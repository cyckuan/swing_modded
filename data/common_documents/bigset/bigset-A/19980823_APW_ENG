Last Hong Kong governor urges world to get tough with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The territory's last colonial governor is
urging the world to take a much tougher approach toward China,
which he says in his controversial book is becoming a threat to
world peace, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   In an exclusive review of Chris Patten's soon-to-be released
book, Sunday Morning Post said Patten criticizes world leaders,
with the exception of a few U.S. policymakers, as too soft on
Beijing.
	   Patten describes China as being able to ``bully its way around
the region as long as it is allowed to do so,'' and the world too
obsessed with a vast Chinese market that ``does not matter very
much to many of us,'' is turning a blind eye to China's human
rights records, the Post said.
	   ``The Chinese government may still be able to terrify its own
people when necessary. But I see no reason why the rest of us
should wake up in Sino-sweat in the middle of the night,'' Patten
writes in ``East and West,'' which goes on sale Sept. 7, the Post
reported.
	   Patten's book had been dropped by publisher HarperCollins, run
by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, allegedly for fear of upsetting
Beijing. He later made a deal for his book with publishing house
Macmillan.
	   The former governor had a strained relationship with the Chinese
communist leadership for much of his five years as governor.
Beijing often criticized him.
	   To protest the democratic reforms he engineered without China's
consent, Beijing dismantled the elected pre-handover legislature
and replaced it with a mostly handpicked interim body when it
regained Hong Kong. A new legislature was elected in May.
	   Although some Hong Kong people blamed Patten for staking the
territory's future for his reforms, recent polls showed most
respondents said he was a far-better leader than the
Beijing-appointed post-handover chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
	   In his new book, Patten also criticizes U.S. President Bill
Clinton for his warming relations with China, the Post said. In
July, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit China since
the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators near
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   ``What is 'coddling dictators' one year becomes the
sophisticated attempt to make sense of 'a multifaceted
relationship' the next,'' he writes.
	   Patten advocates a moratorium on high-level trade missions, few
visits to Beijing with foreign ministers and less red carpet
treatment for mainland Chinese leaders traveling overseas, the
report said.

Negotiations at strike-bound Hyundai Motor hit stalemate
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Government-mediated negotiations to
try to end a monthlong strike at Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's
largest automaker, have hit a stalemate, officials said Sunday.
	   A delegation from President Kim Dae-jung's ruling party pulled
out of the negotiations at Hyundai's main plants in Ulsan, 280
kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, saying, ``There is
nothing more we can do.''
	   ``We failed to reach an agreement because management refused to
compromise,'' Noh Moo-hyun, head of a mediating team from the
governing party, the National Congress for New Politics, told
reporters.
	   But Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho, who worked with the governing
party's mediators, said he will make another try at settling the
dispute over layoffs.
	   Hyundai's 26,000-strong union walked off their jobs July 20 in
protest of the company's plan to lay off 1,538 workers. Hyundai has
shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, is
the first major business to shed redundant workers. The outcome
will set an example for other businesses and affect the nation's
efforts to woo back foreign investors.
	   Government mediators were sent to Hyundai last week to put a
peaceful end to the dispute, which they say is causing huge damage
to the ailing South Korean economy.
	   The labor union wants to save the workers through sharing jobs
and cutting work hours. Management has rejected the suggestion,
calling it a makeshift proposal.
	   Negotiations made some progress on Friday when both sides agreed
to reduce the layoffs to about 300. In return, the union accepted
an unpaid leave for the other workers.
	   Negotiations stalled overnight Saturday as both sides failed to
narrow differences on specific terms for the layoffs and unpaid
leaves.
	   The company wants to pay a two-month extra wage for those
getting laid off and give 1 1/2 years of unpaid leave for the
others. The union wants a 12-month extra wage and a one-year unpaid
leave.
	   Another sticking point is a series of lawsuits that Hyundai has
filed against 64 union leaders for organizing a series of illegal
strikes and causing violence.
	   The union demanded that the company drop the lawsuits and the
government officials backed the demand. But the company rejected
it, saying it would set a dangerous precedent and give unionists an
excuse to stage violent strikes in the future.
	   ``We can't accept the mediated proposal, because it is too much
pro-union,'' said Kim Han-gon, managing director of Hyundai Motor
Co.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, have accused the government of siding with the union
because of the political risks involved in using police force to
break up strikes.
	   Resorting to force is likely to prove an embarrassment to
President Kim Dae-jung, a former opposition leader who routinely
criticized past governments of unfairly using police brutality to
break up strikes.
	   Hyundai maintains it needs to reduce its work force because of
sharply falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been
operating at 40 percent of its annual capacity of 1.25 million
units.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers have
resisted layoffs with a spate of strikes this year.

Cambodian opposition stage rally to protest election results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of people joined in a
protest against alleged election fraud Sunday, cheering and
clapping as opposition leaders called for Cambodian strongman Hun
Sen to step down.
	   Leaders from 10 opposition parties headed the rally at the
Olympic Stadium against the July 26 balloting in which Hun Sen's
ruling party won a slight majority.
	   A march through the capital's traffic-clogged streets, defying
government warnings that the demonstration was ``illegal'' and
could spark social unrest.
	   ``We will carry on our struggle until the world clearly sees the
will of the people,'' said opposition politician Sam Rainsy, adding
that Sunday's rally could be the first of many. ``No one can block
the will of the people. It is going to be a bursting dike.''
	   The protest follows a grenade attack Thursday night in front of
the Interior Ministry where Sam Rainsy was staging a largely
symbolic sleep-in to prevent tampering with ballots in the unlikely
event that a recount is ever organized.
	   Sam Rainsy, the apparent target of the blast, was unharmed, but
the Cambodian driver of Kyodo News agency of Japan was killed.
There have been no arrests.
	   Though the attack served to heighten security concerns Sunday,
Rainsy and other opposition leaders said they were prepared ``to
defy bullets and grenades'' to fight for freedom.
	   ```We will not accept the results of an election that was
fixed,'' the Sam Rainsy Party and its opposition ally Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party said in a statement. ``And we
will not be ruled by a regime that wins through a fixed election.''
	   More than 10,000 people attended the rally, carrying
blue-and-white banners that said: ``Our votes were stolen,'' ``Stop
the election cover up,'' and ``Respect the people's will.''
	   They also handed out leaflets calling for Hun Sen's ouster.
	   ``If today we hold a demonstration and there is no solution,
tomorrow we will do it again,'' said Khem Sokha, of the Buddhist
Liberal Democratic Party. ``We will continue to step up
demonstrations until the dictator steps down.''
	   Last month's parliamentary elections were held one year after
Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup.
Hundreds of the prince's supporters were killed in the months that
followed.
	   Hun Sen organized new polls to win back legitimacy as well as
the international aid lost after his takeover.
	   But the opposition has accused him of rigging the process by
stacking the electoral machinery with his own supporters to ensure
victory.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority with 64
of the 122 parliamentary seats, short of the two-thirds needed to
form a new government.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and Ranariddh's party _ which together won
58 seats _ have threatened to boycott the new parliament and block
the formation of a government unless their claims that Hun Sen won
by massive fraud are investigated.
	   They have demanded recounts for hundreds of areas, but the Hun
Sen-controlled National Election Committee has dismissed their
complaints as ``baseless.''
	   Protesters ended the rally Sunday by marching though the city's
streets, past thousands of curious bystanders who had gathered on
the roadside.
	   A rowdy group of demonstrators surrounded one man they thought
was Vietnamese and threatened to beat and punch him. Police,
concerned for the man's safety, intervened, taking him away in a
pickup truck.
	   During the pre-election campaign many of Hun Sen's political
opponents tapped into historic anti-Vietnamese sentiments in
Cambodia to try to win votes.
	   Hun Sen was installed by Vietnam as Cambodia's leader following
an invasion in 1979 and is still viewed as sympathetic to Vietnam.
	   Rainsy called on the international community which has urged a
political compromise to stop pressuring the opposition to form a
coalition with the CPP, Hun Sen's party _ unless Hun Sen is removed
as candidate for the premiership.
	   ``We will cooperate with the CPP but not with Hun Sen,'' said
Sam Rainsy. ``I appeal to CPP to remove him so a coalition
government can be formed. As long as there is Hun Sen, the
government is in deadlock.''

Thais may forcibly move protesters at Myanmar embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will forcibly move more than a
hundred student protesters away from the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok
if they don't heed requests to leave, the Foreign Ministry said
Sunday.
	   ``We are not going to round them up or arrest them but we are
seeking their peaceful cooperation to move across the street away
from the embassy wall,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak
Chutikul.
	   The protesters, mostly student exiles from Myanmar, have been
camped outside the walls of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok for more
than a week in a show of support for opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi. They are demanding the military government convene the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   About 30 of the protesters began a hunger strike on Saturday,
saying they will fast until parliament is convened, which the
military has repeatedly refused to do.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962. In 1990 it
held a nationwide election in which Suu Kyi's part won 82 percent
of the seats in parliament. The military refused to honor the
result.
	   The Thai government has said they support the protesters as long
as they keep their demonstration peaceful.
	   The Myanmar embassy, however, has been complaining to the Thai
authorities that the protesters are disrupting their business and
they want the demonstration moved further away.
	   The Thais have asked the students to move across the street.
	   ``This is a normal international practice in any country,''
Kobsak said. ``Even in Thailand, protesters have to stay across the
street when they protest at the parliament.''
	   He said that Thailand was obligated under the 1961 Vienna
Convention to prevent any damage, intrusion or disruption of peace
and dignity at embassies.
	   ``The Foreign Ministry is concerned that some elements among the
demonstrators may take advantage of the situation by employing a
violent confrontation with the authorities in order to obtain
publicity,'' Kobsak said.

	   In Arlington, Texas, Scott Brosius hit a three-run homer off
former-Yankee John Wetteland in the eighth, and 22-year-old
right-hander Ryan Bradley won by pitching 1 1-3 hitless innings in
his major league debut.
	   New York (94-32), which overcame five RBIs from Juan Gonzalez,
wasted leads of 2-0, 4-3 and 8-6, while Texas blew 3-2 and 9-8
advantages. The Yankees have won 14 of their last 17 games,
including five of six over Texas.
	   Xavier Hernandez (5-3) was the loser. Mariano Rivera got four
outs for his 33rd save.
 &UR; Mariners 5, White Sox 4, 11 innings
	   In Seattle, Edgar Martinez singled home the winning run in the
11th inning off Jaime Navarro (8-15), the 15th hit for Seattle.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. went 2-for-4 with two walks, remaining stuck at
42 homers. He hasn't homered in 31 at-bats and has just one in his
last 85 at-bats over 21 games.
	   Mike Timlin (2-3) retired all six batters he faced.
 &UR; Angels 5, Blue Jays 1
	   In Anaheim, California, Steve Sparks (8-2) scattered seven hits
in seven innings to outduel Kelvim Escobar (2-2), who struck out a
career-high 11 in seven innings.
	   Tim Salmon hit a two-run homer as Anaheim opened a 2{-game lead
over Texas in the AL West. Randy Velarde had two RBI singles.

United 2, MetroStars 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jaime Moreno and Marco Etcheverry scored
second-half goals and D.C. United won its eighth straight, a 2-1
victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars Saturday night.
	   United (21-5) improved to 13-1 in RFK Stadium.
	   The MetroStars (14-12) led at the half after Diego Sonora scored
in the 41st minute. Moreno tied the game in the 59th minute and
Etcheverry got the game-winner in the 78th minute.
	   The loss prevented the MetroStars from clinching a MLS playoff
spot. The MetroStars need to win one of six remaining games to
clinch an Eastern Conference berth.
	   Etcheverry's ninth goal of the season came on a bouncing shot
from 32 yards that beat MetroStars keeper Tony Meola to the right
corner of the net.
	   MetroStars forward Marcelo Vega made Sonora's goal possible.
Vega got United defender Jeff Agoos to bite on a fake near the end
line, then sent a cross that United keeper Scott Garlick kicked
away.
	   The ball went to Sonora, who beat Garlick from five yards out.
 &UR; Crew 3, Mutiny 1
	   In Columbus, Ohio, Stern John scored the tying and go-ahead
goals and assisted on the third goal as the Columbus Crew beat the
Tampa Bay Mutiny 3-1 Saturday night in Major League Soccer.
	   John has 17 goals, tying Raul Diaz Acre of the New England
Revolution for the league lead.
	   Tampa Bay (7-19) went ahead in the 40th minute on a goal by
Dominic Kinnear.
	   John scored in the 59th and put the Crew (12-12) ahead in the
76th. Andy Williams scored his first MLS goal in the 84th minute.
	   Williams, who got an assist on John's second goal, tied an MLS
record by wetting assists in five consecutive games, his first five
with the Crew since joining the team after the World Cup, where he
played for Jamaica.
	   Brian McBride assisted on two goals for the Crew.
 &UR; Clash 2, Burn 1, shootout
	   In San Jose, California, Victor Mella and Shawn Medved scored
shootout goals and David Kramer stopped three Dallas attempts to
give the San Jose Clash a 2-1 victory Saturday night in Major
League Soccer.
	   San Jose (10-15) opened the scoring in the 32nd minute on Ronald
Cerritos' 10th goal. Dallas (12-14) tied it in the 78th minute on
Brian Haynes' third goal.
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Cobi Jones scored three times and
Carlos Hermosillo added two goals as Los Angeles defeated New
England 5-1 Saturday.
	   The victory was the fourth straight for Los Angeles (20-6),
runaway leader in the Western Conference.
	   Trailing just 1-0 at the half, New England (8-18), winner of
only four of its last 19 games, fell apart in the final 45 minutes
in front of a crowd of 24,143 at Foxboro Stadium.
	   Jones opened the scoring in the 11th minute with a header from
18 yards off Danny Pena's pass.
	   ``Against Los Angeles, you can't play catch up,'' New England
coach Thomas Rongen said. ``You look at the end score of 5-1, but
it was really lost in the first half on that one goal.''
	   Jones scored again in the 79th and 85th minutes, completing his
hat trick by tapping the ball into an empty net after he and two
teammates broke past goaltender Ian Feuer.
	   Jones has 16 goals and three hat tricks.

Myanmar military bars doctors from visiting opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has barred
doctors from visiting opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is
suffering from kidney problems, her political party said Sunday.
	   Suu Kyi has entered the 12th day of her nonviolent protest on a
rural road against the military restricting her from traveling
outside Yangon. She and three colleagues are camped inside a van 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital.
	   The authorities are refusing to let her proceed to the city of
Bassein, where she intended to meet members of her political party.
	   ``The personal physicians of Aung San Suu Kyi were not allowed
to see her Saturday,'' said Tin Oo, the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy.
	   ``They waited for a response from the authorities, but they did
not get any. The authorities did not give any reason. We are trying
to get permission today,'' Tin Oo, a former general, defense
minister and Buddhist monk, said.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors were permitted to visit her twice earlier in
the week. They said after examining her the first time that she was
suffering from low blood pressure and some kidney problems. On
Friday, they said her blood pressure had improved.
	   Suu Kyi has offered to end her protest if the government
releases from prison members of her party elected to parliament and
all those arrested after May this year.
	   ``No detained NLD members have been freed yet,'' Tin Oo said
Sunday.
	   The NLD set Aug. 21 as a deadline for the military to convene
the parliament elected in 1990. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats
in the assembly, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since 1962, ignored the result.
	   After the deadline passed, the NLD announced it would call a
parliament session on its own, setting up a serious confrontation
with the government.
	   The military responded with mass arrests of NLD members on
previous occasions the party attempted to hold meetings.
	   An editorial in Sunday's state-run New Light of Myanmar said the
government ``has achieved unprecedented success.''
	   ``However the threat of neocolonialists and their lap dogs are
working for a recurrence of the 1988 nightmare, the trauma of which
still haunts those who have gone through it,'' it said.
	   The military brutally crushed a nationwide democracy uprising in
1988 by gunning down more than 3,000 protesters. The military has
said only a few dozen died.
	   It frequently accuses Suu Kyi and her colleagues of being
controlled by Western countries intent on subjecting Myanmar to
neocolonialist control.
	   Suu Kyi is the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her
nonviolent campaign to bring democracy to Myanmar.
	   Myanmar was a colony of Great Britain from 1824 to 1948. Under
Gen. Ne Win, Myanmar closed itself off to the outside world from
1962-88.

Three-day-old cloned calf dies in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A cloned calf died Sunday, just three days after it
was born in a research center in southwestern Japan.
	   The male black calf, cloned in an effort to produce high-quality
Japanese beef, was weak and had problems breathing when it was
delivered a week prematurely by Caesarean section last Thursday,
said Yotaro Sasae, a researcher at the Oita Prefecture Animal
Institute.
	   The cause of death was unclear, although an autopsy has found no
abnormalities, he said. The clone was the first at the institute,
which has three other cows pregnant with clones, expected to be
born in September and November, Sasae said.
	   The calf that died Sunday was produced in the same way as Dolly,
the sheep that made history by becoming the world's first
adult-animal clone.
	   Kyodo News service said the calf was the 10th cloned in Japan.
Four of the nine calves, born in two other institutes, also died
shortly after birth, Kyodo said.
	   Local Japanese livestock centers, some with the help of
university researchers, are conducting an ambitious cloning program
to try to reproduce milk cows and quality beef cattle.

Mild earthquake hits Manila, main island of Luzon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A mild earthquake shook wide areas of
the main island of Luzon, including the metropolitan Manila area,
Sunday but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage,
officials said.
	   Government seismologists said they were still determining the
cause and epicenter of the temblor, which struck the capital and
provinces as far away as 100 kilometers (62 miles) at 1:36
p.m.(0536 GMT).
	   They said some areas in the capital reported power outages but
it was not clear if it was caused by heavy rains or the earthquake,
which lasted for several seconds.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

elections

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - One of Indonesia's most prominent
opposition figures set up a new political party Sunday, positioning
himself ahead of next year's general elections.
	   Amien Rais, a vocal critic of former President Suharto in the
months before the autocrat quit, said the new government was a
mirror of the old leadership.
	   Since taking over a turbulent Indonesia in May, President B.J.
Habibie has freed some political prisoners, allowed political
parties to form and scheduled elections for May 1999.
	   Critics, however, say that Suharto's onetime associate is not
moving fast enough.
	   ``The Habibie government is merely the continuation of the
Suharto regime,'' Rais told 10,000 people who filled a badminton
stadium in downtown Jakarta, the capital.
	   Hundreds of police in riot gear were on hand, but the rally was
festive and peaceful. Supporters cradled babies and Muslim high
school students chattered.
	   Rais raised his fist and held up a flag of his National Mandate
Party, an image of the sun on a blue backdrop.
	   Rais pledged to push for political and economic reform in the
nation of 202 million people, which is suffering its worst economic
turmoil since the 1960s. Millions have lost their jobs and prices
are climbing steadily.
	   ``As long as the party is not in a position to govern this
country, this party will function as the opposition,'' Rais said.
	   Dozens of parties have sprouted since Suharto quit, many of
which are likely to be winnowed out by electoral laws that will be
implemented ahead of the May vote.
	   Rais said he was willing to form a coalition with other
reform-minded parties.
	   The ruling Golkar party, weakened by its role as a loyal
instrument of Suharto, is also exploring the possibility of forming
a coalition with other parties, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   ``We are looking out for other parties that appear to have
similar platforms as our own,'' Antara quoted Golkar leader Akbar
Tanjung as saying on Saturday.
	   Although tainted by its past, Golkar has vowed to make itself
more democratic.
	   Before forming a party, Rais quit as head of the 28
million-member Muhammadiyah organization, one of the largest Muslim
groups in predominately Muslim Indonesia.
	   He has argued against mixing religion with politics, although a
larger Muslim group, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama
organization, set up its own party last month.
	   Rais, a lecturer who earned a political science doctorate at
Chicago University, enjoys popularity among students whose
pro-democracy protests helped oust Suharto.

Soldiers scramble to save cracking dikes as China's Yangtze crests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Yangtze River crested on Sunday in the city
of Jiujiang, pounding soggy dikes where 300,000 soldiers and armed
police scrambled to patch cracks.
	   Flood waters dropped only slightly at swollen Dongting Lake on
the Yangtze and rose at Jiujiang and other areas downstream from
the major industrial center of Wuhan, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, the river was rising upstream as well as a result of
heavy rains, meaning more flood problems soon downstream. Officials
warned that dikes protecting cities were softening and cracking
after weeks of water pressure.
	   The heavily populated Yangtze River basin has been hardest hit
in China's worst flood season in 44 years. At least 2,000 people
have died nationwide, but the toll is expected to rise.
	   The government, reluctant to divulge bad news, has not updated
the tallies in more than two weeks. Since then, floods in the
northeast have washed out villages and threatened major industrial
centers and the country's main oil field.
	   Flooding along the Yangtze has affected 240 million people,
about one-fifth of China's population, and caused losses of at
least 200 billion yuan (dlrs 24 billion), according to government
estimates.
	   In Heilongjiang province, China's northeastern corner, 1.5
million people have been flooded out, Xinhua reported.
	   Floods on the lower reaches of the Songhua River threatened a
natural gas plant at Yilan in Heilongjiang that supplies the
provincial capital, Harbin, the People's Daily reported Sunday.
	   About 200 workers built a wall to protect the plant, the
Guangming Daily reported. It said 47,000 people were evacuated from
the town of Yilan.
	   The army sent reinforcements to Harbin over the weekend to
strengthen the 15-mile levee protecting the center of the city from
the Songhua.
	   But the government allowed villages on the opposite shore to be
engulfed by a brown sea in order to divert the river's water from
Harbin. Throughout flooded regions, farms have been allowed to be
inundated to protect cities.
	   At Daqing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Harbin,
soldiers repaired a breach in the third and last line of levees
protecting the Daqing oil field and city from the Nen River.
	   Wide areas of farmland were flooded and a highway was washed out
when the dike burst on Thursday, according to state media reports.
	   Flooded regions were short of medicines, and stomach illnesses,
dysentery, hepatitis and diseases carried by waterborne parasites
were on the rise, Health Minister Zhang Wenkang warned.
	   He said the problem could get worse in the next three months, a
period that usually is the peak for the spread of epidemics in
China.

Broncos top table ahead of finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane Broncos limped to a 16-10
victory over South Sydney on Sunday to finish the regular season in
top place ahead of the Australian rugby league finals.
	   The Broncos' muted end to the home and away rounds was in
contrast to a stirring effort from Newcastle, which came back from
20-4 just before half-time to beat Adelaide 34-20. The Knights'
victory put them on 37 points but in second place behind the
Broncos on points for and against.
	   The top two earned a one-week break while the next eight teams
qualified for the start of finals play next weekend.
	   Melbourne secured a home final in its first season with a 16-12
defeat of Canberra. Melbourne plays Sydney City and Parramatta
plays North Sydney in semifinals where the losers get a second
chance. In next week's knockout finals Canberra plays Manly and St.
George plays Canterbury.
	   Sydney City finished sixth after an inconsistent season but
looked close to its best as Kangaroo star Brad Fittler led a 40-4
victory over Balmain. Veteran test forward Paul Sironen retired
after the Tigers' loss.
	   Sironen broke down in tears after the game, as did coach and
former teammate Wayne Pearce.
	   ``There's not many players who'll be remembered as being as good
a bloke as they are a player, that is Sirro,'' Pearce said.
	   Manly, last season's ARL runner-up behind Newcastle, scraped
into the top 10 with a 38-12 win at Auckland.
	   Cronulla scored a 20-18 win at the Gold Coast but missed the
finals as tenth-palced Manly and ninth-placed Canterbury edged
above them with wins on the final day.
	   Canterbury claimed a 25-24 win over Illawarra, ending the
Steelers' season.
	   Parramatta finished fourth with a 15-15 tie against St. George,
which finished eighth, while North Sydney was fifth, tuning up for
the finals with a 62-0 win over early front-runner North
Queensland.
	   Penrith beat Western Suburbs 36-20 in a match where neither side
had a chance of making the finals.

Government to spend 2.5 billion to help small firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an effort to help businesses survive the
protracted financial turmoil, the government will launch Monday a
2.5-billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlr 320 million) loan scheme for
small and medium companies, it announced Sunday.
	   The government said in a statement it will provide guarantees
for private loans to small and medium enterprises _ the backbone of
the territory's economy _ approved and provided by one of the 26
banks and financial companies which have joined the scheme.
	   The risk of default will be shared among the lending
institutions and the government, it said.
	   The scheme is part of a stimulus package the government
announced in June to kick-start the ailing economy.
	   While profits are generally down, smaller firms also have
trouble getting new loans as banks tighten their purse strings
because interbank interest rates remain high.
	   High interest rates are the government's key tool to fend off
speculators to keep Hong Kong's currency link with the U.S. dollar
intact.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted 2.8 percent in the first quarter,
and officials have said it will shrink further in the second
quarter. A recession is generally defined as two quarters of
negative growth.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent, and is
expected to rise further in the coming months. To fend of
speculators, the government last week bought blue chip stocks to
lift the stock market.
	   The main stock index had lost 60 percent of its value since last
August before last week's government intervention.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of people joined in a
protest against alleged election fraud Sunday, cheering and
clapping as opposition leaders called for Cambodian strongman Hun
Sen to step down.
	   Leaders from 10 opposition parties headed the rally at the
Olympic Stadium against the July 26 balloting in which Hun Sen's
ruling party won a slight majority.
	   However, 28 truck loads of protesters heading to the rally from
the provinces were stopped by police before reaching the capital,
opposition leaders and human rights workers said.
	   In Takhmau province, southwest of Phnom Penh, police used water
cannon to drive back protesters attempting to reach Phnom Penh,
they said. There were no reported injuries.
	   A march through the capital's traffic-clogged streets, defied
government warnings that the demonstration was ``illegal'' and
could spark social unrest.
	   ``We will carry on our struggle until the world clearly sees the
will of the people,'' said opposition politician Sam Rainsy, adding
that Sunday's rally could be the first of many. ``No one can block
the will of the people. It is going to be a bursting dike.''
	   The protest follows a grenade attack Thursday night in front of
the Interior Ministry where Sam Rainsy was staging a largely
symbolic sleep-in to prevent tampering with ballots in the unlikely
event that a recount is ever organized.
	   Sam Rainsy, the apparent target of the blast, was unharmed, but
the Cambodian driver of Kyodo News agency of Japan was killed.
There have been no arrests.
	   Though the attack served to heighten security concerns Sunday,
Rainsy and other opposition leaders said they were prepared ``to
defy bullets and grenades'' to fight for freedom.
	   ```We will not accept the results of an election that was
fixed,'' the Sam Rainsy Party and its opposition ally Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party said in a statement. ``And we
will not be ruled by a regime that wins through a fixed election.''
	   More than 10,000 people attended the rally, carrying
blue-and-white banners that said: ``Our votes were stolen,'' ``Stop
the election cover up,'' and ``Respect the people's will.''
	   They also handed out leaflets calling for Hun Sen's ouster.
	   ``If today we hold a demonstration and there is no solution,
tomorrow we will do it again,'' said Khem Sokha, of the Buddhist
Liberal Democratic Party. ``We will continue to step up
demonstrations until the dictator steps down.''
	   Last month's parliamentary elections were held one year after
Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup.
Hundreds of the prince's supporters were killed in the months that
followed.
	   Hun Sen organized new polls to win back legitimacy as well as
the international aid lost after his takeover.
	   But the opposition has accused him of rigging the process by
stacking the electoral machinery with his own supporters to ensure
victory.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority with 64
of the 122 parliamentary seats, short of the two-thirds needed to
form a new government.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and Ranariddh's party _ which together won
58 seats _ have threatened to boycott the new parliament and block
the formation of a government unless their claims that Hun Sen won
by massive fraud are investigated.
	   They have demanded recounts for hundreds of areas, but the Hun
Sen-controlled National Election Committee has dismissed their
complaints as ``baseless.''
	   Protesters ended the rally Sunday by marching though the city's
streets, past thousands of curious bystanders who had gathered on
the roadside.
	   Rainsy called on the international community which has urged a
political compromise to stop pressuring the opposition to form a
coalition with the CPP, Hun Sen's party _ unless Hun Sen is removed
as candidate for the premiership.
	   ``We will cooperate with the CPP but not with Hun Sen,'' said
Sam Rainsy. ``I appeal to CPP to remove him so a coalition
government can be formed. As long as there is Hun Sen, the
government is in deadlock.''

Boat of illegal Indonesian immigrants sinks, one man dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ One man drowned after a boat
filled with at least 20 Indonesian illegal immigrants sank in the
Straits of Malacca, news reports said Sunday.
	   Asst. Police Commissioner Karn Kam Peng was quoted in the Star
newspaper as saying a rescue squad plucked 11 survivors before dawn
Friday from the rough waters near Port Klang, off the Western coast
of Malaysia.
	   Karn said the illegal immigrants were returning to Indonesia in
a barter trade boat when its engine failed and strong winds pushed
it under. He said eight others were believed missing and the search
for survivors continued.
	   Marine and police officials were not immediately available for
further comment.
	   Karn said the survivors, who included one woman, were being
detained at Klang's immigration department.
	   According to sources quoted in the New Straits Times, the number
of passengers on board the boat, which stopped off at several
points along Malaysia's coast, could have been higher than the
police estimate of 20.
	   Officials at the Maritime Rescue and Coordination Center were
quoted as saying they had not been informed of the incident but
that traffic of illegal immigrants from points near Port Klang was
rife lately.
	   Malaysia has clamped down on foreign workers, most of whom come
from Indonesia, to free up jobs for locals. The government had said
it would not renew some 216,000 work permits effective Aug. 15, the
annual deadline for work permit renewals.
	   Afraid of deportation and fines, about 22,000 foreign workers
fled from their employers before the deadline. Another 102,000 have
registered to leave the country by early September.

	   LHOK SUKON, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights team wrapped up a
grave-digging mission Sunday after unearthing skeletons of people
allegedly killed by the military.
	   Government investigators uncovered remains of at least two dozen
people after three days of digging in the northernmost province of
Aceh. Activists say hundreds more are buried in other mass graves.
	   Soldiers have been accused of arbitrary killings and torture
while crushing a separatist movement in the Sumatra island province
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
	   The inquiry by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission is
the latest sign of a new openness since former President Suharto
resigned in May after nationwide riots and student protests.
	   Some of the skulls that investigators found had holes believed
to be bullet wounds. Ropes that may have been used to tie the
victims' hands were discovered as well.
	   Forensic scientists planned to examine the remains to determine
whether they belonged to execution victims.
	   Baharuddin Lopa, chief investigator, declined to say whether he
thought the military was responsible. But he urged the government
to release all political prisoners from Aceh and to give financial
aid to widows of Acehnese who had been reported missing.
	   He also suggested that local people dig up mass graves by
themselves, with the assistance of the police.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh and ordered the
withdrawal of about 1,000 troops. However, thousands remain
deployed in the province, which lies 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   Another fact-finding mission is expected to visit Lampung
province in southern Sumatra island this week to investigate
reports of military atrocities in the late 1980s. Soldiers also put
down down a separatist movement there.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised greater human
rights for Indonesia's 202 million people. But he opposes activists
in some regions who want to break away from Indonesian authority.

North and Bulldogs to battle for lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ North Melbourne and Western Bulldogs
have scored strong victories to set up a final round clash to
decide the top team in the Australian Football League competition.
	   The two sides made sure they would finish 1-2 in regular season
play to claim home finals and their clash on Friday will determine
which tops the table going into the play-offs.
	   The Bulldogs took a significant step in their bid to end a
44-year title drought with a 14.17 (101) to 13.12 (90) victory over
Essendon.
	   Veteran rover Tony Liberatore successfully came through his
first senior match after a knee reconstruction while ruckman Scott
Wynd was outstanding.
	   ``He is the most influential player at our club bar none,''
coach Terry Wallace said.
	   North Melbourne captain Wayne Carey continued his run of
matchwinning performances when he kicked five goals against
defending champion Adelaide at Football Park.
	   Carey was outstanding in the tense final term _ kicking two
goals from strong marks and setting up another to guide his side to
its eighth straight win.
	   Sydney and St. Kilda are in equal third but Sydney has a game in
hand _ against Melbourne on Monday.
	   The Saints arrested a tailspin with a 9.9 (63) to 7.13 (55)
victory over West Coast Eagles. It was their second win in seven
matches in slump which has carried them from top place to seventh
before this weekend.

Explosion rips through building in Dagestan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ An explosion ripped through a
residential building in the capital of the Caucasus republic of
Dagestan early Sunday.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said that four people were
hospitalized with injuries, while the Interfax news agency said
there were no casualties.
	   Investigators first reported that the blast in the one-story
building in Makhachkala had been caused by a gas leak. They later
announced that a bomb had caused it.
	   Bombings, kidnappings and other violent crimes have kept
Dagestan on edge for months. Various ethnic and religious groups
have been vying for power in the republic, which borders on
secessionist Chechnya.
	   On Friday, Dagestan's highest-ranking Muslim spiritual leader
was killed in a car-bombing, along with his brother and driver.
Authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a fundamentalist Islamic
sect, could have been involved in the attack on Mufti Said-Mohammad
Abubakarov.

Myanmar military bars doctors from visiting opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS government accusations against KNU, KNU response in grafs
7-12, TRIMS.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has barred
doctors from visiting opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is
suffering from kidney problems, her political party said Sunday.
	   Suu Kyi has entered the 12th day of her nonviolent protest on a
rural road against the military restricting her from traveling
outside Yangon. She and three colleagues are camped inside a van 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital.
	   The authorities are refusing to let her proceed to the city of
Bassein, where she intended to meet members of her political party.
	   ``The personal physicians of Aung San Suu Kyi were not allowed
to see her Saturday,'' said Tin Oo, the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy.
	   ``They waited for a response from the authorities, but they did
not get any. The authorities did not give any reason. We are trying
to get permission today,'' Tin Oo, a former general, defense
minister and Buddhist monk, said.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors were permitted to visit her twice earlier in
the week. They said after examining her the first time that she was
suffering from low blood pressure and some kidney problems. On
Friday, they said her blood pressure had improved.
	   On Sunday, the government justified preventing Suu Kyi from
traveling to Bassein, saying it was protecting her from a possible
assassination attempt by the Karen National Union. The KNU is an
insurgent army fighting for autonomy for the Karen ethnic group for
the past 50 years.
	   ``The KNU, an armed separatist force, has threatened in recent
weeks to use guerilla violence to achieve its aims,'' a government
spokesman said.
	   ``Government analysts believe those threats may include attacks
on Aung San Suu Kyi,'' he added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   But the KNU denied the government claims.
	   ``No way. We're not terrorists. We would never do that,'' Ner
Dah, a spokesman for the KNU, told The Associated Press in Bangkok.
``We're working with her to achieve peace and democracy.''
	   Suu Kyi's late mother was a Karen Christian. There have been no
reports of KNU activity in the Bassein area in years.
	   Bassein is in an area where many Karen live. The authorities
there are regarded as among the most oppressive in the country, and
human rights groups have reported continuing atrocities against
Karen villagers in the area.
	   The KNU has voiced support for Suu Kyi and her objectives
repeatedly over the years.
	   Suu Kyi has offered to end her protest if the government
releases from prison members of her party elected to parliament and
all those arrested after May this year.
	   ``No detained NLD members have been freed yet,'' Tin Oo said
Sunday.
	   The NLD set Aug. 21 as a deadline for the military to convene
the parliament elected in 1990. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats
in the assembly, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since 1962, ignored the result.
	   After the deadline passed, the NLD announced it would call a
parliament session on its own, setting up a serious confrontation
with the government.
	   The military responded with mass arrests of NLD members on
previous occasions the party attempted to hold meetings.
	   An editorial in Sunday's state-run New Light of Myanmar said the
government ``has achieved unprecedented success,'' and accused Suu
Kyi of being a ``lad dog'' of Western countries attempting to
colonize Myanmar and spark social unrest.

Bradman to miss birthday party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Indian star Sachin Tendulkar will
join a birthday party of 1,300 here Thursday but the target of the
attention will be missing.
	   Sir Donald Bradman, the world's most famous cricketer, turns 90
on Thursday with his home state of South Australia planning a week
of celebrations.
	   But Bradman, a recluse for the past 20 years, will celebrate his
birthday in private. Tendulkar, the one player who has reminded
Bradman of himself, is expected to receive a private audience with
the man known as The Don, who dominated cricket in his 52-test
career with a peerless average of 99.94.
	   The State Library of SA, which houses the Bradman Collection of
memorabilia, is hosting the celebrations. A spokesman said Bradman
had taken a keen interest in the plans despite his decision to stay
away.
	   Tributes include the unveiling of a new gift from Bradman to the
Bradman Collection, the Warwick Vase album, a handmade album
presented to Sir Donald to celebrate his last visit to England in
the famous 1948 Invincibles tour.
	   Former Australian captain and now South Australian State manager
of cricket Greg Chappell, who will be involved in the celebrations,
said Bradman was the game's greatest player.
	   ``As soon as I got to understand about cricket, I think I was
aware of the name,'' Chappell said. ``It's around the world and not
just in the major cricket playing countries, anywhere where
cricket's been mentioned the name of Bradman has come up.''

Singapore stock exchange passes millennium bug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Singapore passed a
critical test on Sunday to prepare its trading system for the start
of the new millennium, when the dreaded Year 2000 bug is expected
to strike.
	   A mock session lasting several hours Sunday morning involved
setting the dates in all trading computers to January 3, 2000,
which will be the exchange's first day of operation in the next
millennium.
	   The trial, which used closing data from the last day of trading
on Friday, was ``successfully completed,'' according to a statement
from the exchange. Trades were keyed in as if the market were
actually in session.
	   The simulation involved 33 member firms of the stock exchange,
authorized trading centers, approved foreign brokers, participants
of the bond quotation system, and other subscribers of the
exchange's broadcast services.
	   Experts fear that the new millenium will wreak havoc in computer
systems worldwide, because they have been programmed to interpret
years by their last two digits and are likely mistake 2000 for
1900.
	   Governments fear the glitch could paralyze essential operations
such as the smooth running financial institutions, air traffic
control and emergency services.
	   Computer experts in Singapore are so wary of the potential
disruptions that they have been counseling some banks to remain
closed for the first few business days of the new millennium, The
Straits Times reported last week.
	   ``The Year 2000 issue is a crisis which is going to hit us for
sure and nothing can prevent it from happening,'' Andrew Lee, a
computer consultant working for a major Singapore bank, was quoted
as saying.
	   As with the stock exchange, banks in Singapore are scheduled to
open for business on Monday, January 3, 2000. Because it is closer
to the international date line than much of the world, Singapore
will be among the first to witness the calendar transition in
computer systems.
	   Some experts have indicated that many Singapore businesses _
including banks _ are not adequately prepared for the calendar
change, though the government has said that most large institutions
are on track.

Report: China to close 22,000 small coal mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China plans to shut down 22,000 small illegal
coal mines by 2000 in order to reduce an oversupply of coal, the
Business Weekly reported Sunday.
	   The mines that will be closed produce low-quality coal that
creates the most pollution when burned, it said.
	   Closing the small mines is expected to reduce annual coal output
by 200 million tons and balance domestic supply and demand, the
report quoted Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the State Coal
Industry Bureau, as saying.
	   China produced 540 million tons of coal in the first half of
this year, down 7.8 percent from the same period last year, the
state-run Xinhua reported Sunday. Coal supplies three-fourths of
China's energy.
	   The national coal industry has reported losses of 1.75 billion
yuan (dlrs 211 million) in the first half of the year due to
oversupply. Last year was the first time it had net profits after a
period of serious losses from 1984 to 1996.
	   Meanwhile, the government plans to transfer supervision for the
country's 94 key state coal mines from the former Ministry of Coal
Industry to provincial governments.
	   China also has 2,500 local state coal mines and 75,000 township
and village mines.

Yeltsin to return to work on Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will return to work in his
Kremlin office on Monday after a five-week vacation that has given
him little rest, Russian news agencies reported Sunday.
	   Gloomy weather marred the first days of the president's holiday,
and the country's roiling financial crisis deepened by the day.
Yeltsin interrupted his break last weekend to discuss the
government's efforts to cope with the crisis with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, international financial envoy Anatoly Chubais and
other economic policy makers.

Water-scarce Singapore building giant storage tanks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore is building five giant storage tanks
costing U.S. dlrs 38 million as part of efforts to ensure its
domestic water supply and reduce its dependence on water from
abroad, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The huge concrete tanks, capable of holding about a quarter of
Singapore's daily water needs, will occupy 11 hectares (27 acres)
of land near two reservoirs when completed in 2001 at a cost of 66
million Singapore dollars, according to The Sunday Times.
	   The water-scarce city-state imports about half of the 1.2
million cubic meters (42 million cubic feet) consumed here daily
from Malaysia, under one treaty that expires in 2011 and another in
2061. The rest is supplied from domestic sources.
	   The two countries have been unable to negotiate new pacts, and
tensions between the neighbors have soured lately over a number of
disputes. Water quality and the breakdown in negotiations over new
agreements have been one such irritant.
	   Already under construction and referred to as the central
service reservoir, the tanks will hold 318,000 cubic meters (11
million cubic feet) of water and are the latest in a series of
moves by the government to safeguard its water supplies, according
to the newspaper.
	   Singapore will invite bids next year to build its first of three
expensive desalination plants, which could supplant all the water
currently imported from Malaysia once they are completed by 2011.
	   Water tariffs were raised yet again this year, and the
government announced that rates will rise annually from this year
through 2000.
	   In addition, last month's annual Save Water Campaign received
extra attention in the media this year, and featured a surprise
interruption of water supplies into thousands of residences and
businesses island wide.

Strong earthquake hits Manila, main island of Luzon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with seismologists saying earthquake was strongly felt
in some provinces near Manila, preliminary magnitude, other details
throughout

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook many areas
of the main Luzon island, including metropolitan Manila, Sunday but
there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties,
seismologists said.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.1, struck
simultaneously with thunder and hail storms, which knocked off
power in some metropolitan Manila areas, officials said.
	   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the
earthquake was centered beneath the seabed about 30 kilometers
(18.6 miles) west of Subic town in Zambales province.
	   The earthquake occurred at 1:36 p.m. (0536 GMT) and was felt in
several Luzon provinces. In Subic, west of Manila, residents
reported objects falling off shelves and tables, said Director
Reynaldo Punongbayan of the institute.
	   Punongbayan said the earthquake was widely felt because it
occurred close to the seafloor but was not strong enough to
generate destructive undersea tsunami waves.
	   The affected provinces were the same ones hit by an earthquake
that caused widespread destruction and deaths in 1990.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

Thai military to give reshuffle list to prime minister this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's military will submit its
annual reshuffle list to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai this week,
setting up a possible confrontation over a tainted general, the
Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
	   Military brass have been saying in recent weeks that they
support Gen. Chainarong Noonpakdi as its new commander in chief.
But aides to Chuan, who is also defense minister, have said he is
almost certain to amend the list if the army nominates Chainarong.
	   Chainarong commanded troops that opened fire on unarmed
democracy demonstrators in the streets of Bangkok in May 1992,
killing at least 40 and wounding more than a hundred.
	   The Post cited Supreme Commander Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit as
saying the list will go to Chuan this week. Mongkol has said in the
past he hopes the prime minister will not alter it.
	   But Chuan has said he has the right as both prime minister and
defense minister to change the list. Pro-democracy activists have
warned Chainarong's appointment could spark street protests.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Hurricane Bonnie continued to strengthen
Sunday, becoming a 300-mile-long (480-kilometer-long) storm and
skirting sparsely populated Bahamian islands on a route that could
threaten the eastern United States.
	   Another hurricane gained power in the Pacific Ocean but was
expected to diminish over open seas Sunday.
	   At 0900 GMT Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said Bonnie's
center was located about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of San
Salvador in the Bahamas.
	   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have increased to near
105 mph (168 kph) and the hurricane was expected to grow stronger
Sunday, meteorologists said.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center said in a
statement. It said the likelihood of the hurricane hitting
southeast Florida has decreased. But it urged residents of the
coast and keys to be ready to ``take quick action'' if the
situation changed.
	   Jerry Jarrell, director of the center, said Bonnie could
eventually strengthen to a Category 3 storm with winds more than
111 mph (178 kph) capable of causing extensive damage.
	   Though the hurricane stalled for hours Saturday, it resumed its
northwest path after dark. Bonnie is expected to continue on that
course for about 24 hours before a gradual turn to the northwest
that could steer it from the U.S. mainland, the hurricane center
said. Bonnie was moving at about 6 mph (10 kph).

Human rights commission completes mission to search for mass

<TEXT>
	   LHOK SUKON, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights team wrapped up a
grave-digging mission Sunday after unearthing skeletons of people
allegedly killed by the military.
	   Government investigators uncovered remains of at least two dozen
people after three days of digging in the northernmost province of
Aceh. Activists say hundreds more are buried in other mass graves.
	   Soldiers have been accused of arbitrary killings and torture
while crushing a separatist movement in the Sumatra island province
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
	   The inquiry by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission is
the latest sign of a new openness since former President Suharto
resigned in May after nationwide riots and student protests.
	   Some of the skulls that investigators found had holes believed
to be bullet wounds. Ropes that may have been used to tie the
victims' hands were discovered as well.
	   Forensic scientists planned to examine the remains to determine
whether they belonged to execution victims.
	   Baharuddin Lopa, chief investigator, declined to say whether he
thought the military was responsible. But he urged the government
to release all political prisoners from Aceh and to give financial
aid to widows of Acehnese who had been reported missing.
	   He also suggested that local people dig up mass graves by
themselves, with the assistance of the police.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh and ordered the
withdrawal of about 1,000 troops. However, thousands remain
deployed in the province, which lies 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   Another fact-finding mission is expected to visit Lampung
province in southern Sumatra island this week to investigate
reports of military atrocities in the late 1980s. Soldiers also put
down down a separatist movement there.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised greater human
rights for Indonesia's 202 million people. But he opposes activists
in some regions who want to break away from Indonesian authority.

Malaysian prisons lodge complaint against U.S. movie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Prisons Department has
lodged a police report against an American movie charging it
depicts the Southeast Asian nation's prisons in a false light, a
news report said.
	   Polygram Films, ``Return to Paradise'' tells the fictional story
of an American man imprisoned on drug charges in Malaysia after a
reckless vacation with two friends in the northern state of Penang.
	   Some scenes in the film, recently released in the United States,
falsely depict wardens torturing prisoners who are locked in cells
infested with rats and cockroaches and refused medical treatment,
said Omar Mohamad Dan, director-general of Malaysia's prisons
department.
	   Omar said the movie's producers were using the film to criticize
Malaysia's prison and justice system, particularly its law that
imposes the death penalty on drug traffickers.
	   He said a police report was filed Saturday against the movie,
which stars Anne Heche and Joaquin Phoenix, and the matter was
brought to the attention of Malaysia's Home Ministry.
	   ``We will leave it to the authorities to decide on the sort of
action which can be taken,'' Omar was quoted as saying in the New
Straits Times.
	   Omar said evidence of the film's falsehoods could be found on
its Internet site, which shows wardens in the Penang prison
compound armed with pistols, red batons and wearing blue tags.
	   ``Our staff and wardens are issued green tags,'' Omar said,
adding that prison guards were not armed with guns in real life.
``The batons... are black and not as long as the ones depicted in
the movie.''
	   Omar added that Malaysian prisons complied with the United
Nations Standard Minimum Rules and prisoners were regularly checked
on by International Red Cross workers.

Myanmar military bars doctors from visiting opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS more details on Suu Kyi's condition in grafs 6,7

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has barred
doctors from visiting opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is
suffering from kidney problems, her political party said Sunday.
	   Suu Kyi has entered the 12th day of her nonviolent protest on a
rural road against the military restricting her from traveling
outside Yangon. She and three colleagues are camped inside a van 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital.
	   The authorities are refusing to let her proceed to the city of
Bassein, where she intended to meet members of her political party.
	   ``The personal physicians of Aung San Suu Kyi were not allowed
to see her Saturday,'' said Tin Oo, the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy.
	   ``They waited for a response from the authorities, but they did
not get any. The authorities did not give any reason. We are trying
to get permission today,'' Tin Oo, a former general, defense
minister and Buddhist monk, said.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors were permitted to visit her twice earlier in
the week. They said after examining her the first time that she was
suffering from low blood pressure and some kidney problems. On
Friday, they said her blood pressure had improved, but kidney
problems persisted, along with bowel problems and dizziness.
	   The NLD said Sunday it would hold the government, which it had
informed of Suu Kyi's condition, responsible for her health because
it had denied her the right to receive medical treatment.
	   On Sunday, the government justified preventing Suu Kyi from
traveling to Bassein, saying it was protecting her from a possible
assassination attempt by the Karen National Union. The KNU is an
insurgent army fighting for autonomy for the Karen ethnic group for
the past 50 years.
	   ``The KNU, an armed separatist force, has threatened in recent
weeks to use guerilla violence to achieve its aims,'' a government
spokesman said.
	   ``Government analysts believe those threats may include attacks
on Aung San Suu Kyi,'' he added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   But the KNU denied the government claims.
	   ``No way. We're not terrorists. We would never do that,'' Ner
Dah, a spokesman for the KNU, told The Associated Press in Bangkok.
``We're working with her to achieve peace and democracy.''
	   Suu Kyi's late mother was a Karen Christian. There have been no
reports of KNU activity in the Bassein area in years.
	   Bassein is in an area where many Karen live. The authorities
there are regarded as among the most oppressive in the country, and
human rights groups have reported continuing atrocities against
Karen villagers in the area.
	   The KNU has voiced support for Suu Kyi and her objectives
repeatedly over the years.
	   Suu Kyi has offered to end her protest if the government
releases from prison members of her party elected to parliament and
all those arrested after May this year.
	   ``No detained NLD members have been freed yet,'' Tin Oo said
Sunday.
	   The NLD set Aug. 21 as a deadline for the military to convene
the parliament elected in 1990. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats
in the assembly, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since 1962, ignored the result.
	   After the deadline passed, the NLD announced it would call a
parliament session on its own, setting up a serious confrontation
with the government.
	   The military responded with mass arrests of NLD members on
previous occasions the party attempted to hold meetings.
	   An editorial in Sunday's state-run New Light of Myanmar said the
government ``has achieved unprecedented success,'' and accused Suu
Kyi of being a ``lad dog'' of Western countries attempting to
colonize Myanmar and spark social unrest.

Ono wins New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies

<TEXT>
	   HAKONE, Japan (AP) _ Kyoko Ono shot a 1-under-par 72 Sunday and
won the New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies by two strokes, her first
victory in three years as a pro.
	   Ono, starting three strokes off the pace, overcame tough pin
placements and sank two birdies against a bogey en route to a
3-under 216 total.
	   Overnight leader Fuki Kido struggled to a 77 and fell to a tie
for second at 218 with Yuri Fudo, who fired a 72.
	   The victory was worth 10.8 million yen (dlrs 75,500) from a
purse of 60 million yen (420,000).
	   ``I feel like I'm still dreaming,'' said the 27-year-old Ono.
``Now that I finally did it, I'll just keep trying harder and
harder to win at least several more tournaments in months to
come.''
	   South Korean Ku Ok-hee shot a 71 and shared fourth at 219 with
Hiromi Takamura, Harumi Sakaue and first-round leader Chikayo
Yamazaki.
	   Kaori Harada, this season's leading money winner so far with two
victories, shot her third straight 75 for a share of 26th at 225.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the Japan tour's top player in the last two
years, skipped the tournament to take part in the U.S. LPGA Tour's
qualifying tournament.

 &UR; Chadian president arrives by air in Libya, violating sanctions

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi met with
Chadian President Idriss Deby, who flew into the Libyan capital in
violation of U.N. sanctions, state-run television said.
	   Deby told the TV Saturday that he came to Libya to check on
Gadhafi's health after the Libyan leader underwent a hip operation
in July.
	   The television report was monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
	   Libyan television and radio said Deby arrived by air at Tripoli
airport direct from the Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on Saturday,
violating U.N. sanctions on Libya. The sanctions prohibit air
travel to and from the country except for humanitarian reasons.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Libya to hand over two
suspects said to have carried out the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The bombing killed 270 people.
	   African leaders have denounced the sanctions, and the
Organization of African Unity has said it would no longer abide by
them.
	   Deby met with Gadhafi shortly after his arrival, and gave him a
``warm embrace which expressed the depth of African cohesion... and
the deep relations between'' Libya and Chad, the television
broadcast said.
	   Diplomatic ties between Libya and Chad were restored in May.
	   Relations were severed for more than a decade when the last of
the Libyan occupation troops were pushed out of Chad in 1987. Deby
was one of the officers who forced the Libyans out of Chad.

Manuela Machado wins marathon setting championship record

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new
European Championships record and clocked her best time ever in
winning the marathon Sunday in 2 hours 27 minutes 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion eclipsed and old
championship record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took silver in 2:28:01 followed
closely by Italian Marua Viceconte.
	   On a cool but sunny morning, Machado steadily pulled away in the
last 15 kilometers to add another gold to her collection. She was
the 1995 world champion and twice world silver medalist and is
another in a long line of strong Portuguese distance runners.
	   Biktagirova, 33, if a former Los Angeles marathon winner and
finished fourth in the '92 Olympics but was disqualified and given
a three-month ban for testing positive for stimulants.
	   On Saturday, Heike Drechsler, 33, became only the third to win
four consecutive titles in the same event, taking the long jump in
7.16 meters. Fourth in last year's worlds, Drechsler edged out '96
Olympic silver medalist Fiona May (7.11) of Italy and world
champion Luydmila Galkina (7.06) of Russia.
	   The jump was also No. 4 on the world list behind three by
American Marion Jones, who has a best of 7:31.
	   ``This was maybe for me the hardest win,'' said the 33-year-old
German, who is coming back after surgery almost a year ago on both
Achilles tendons.
	   ``I had three really hard years,'' she added. ``I wanted to come
back. It was a really hard thing for me. I had to work very hard
for this gold.''
	   Britain's Colin Jackson, 31, also won his third consecutive
European gold, clocking 13.02 in both the finals and semifinals of
the 110 hurdles.
	   It was the No. 3 time in the world this season behind Americans
Allen Johnson (12.98) and Mark Crear (13.00) for the world
record-holder (12.91) and former world champion.
	   ``It's strange that I had to come here and re-establish
myself,'' he said. ``This one has got to be high on my list of
achievements.''
	   After five days, Britain leads with six gold medals and 11
overall. Russia has five gold and 17 overall and Germany has won
four gold and a total of 16.
	   Britain picked up two more gold medals to go with Jackson's as
Denise Lewis, world silver medalist, won the heptathlon with 6,559
points. Britain's 4X100 men also got gold in 38.52 as 100-meter
champion Darren Campbell and 200 champion Doug Walker picked up
their second golds.
	   European 100 champion Christine Arron of France also got gold in
the 4X100 as she anchored and blew by Russian anchor Irina
Privalova _ the 200 gold-medalist _ to victory. France clocked
42.59.
	   In the pole vault, Russian Maksim Tarasov took advantage of
Sergei Bubka's absence and added a European gold to '92 his Olympic
gold with a jump of 5.81.
	   Spain, which got gold Thursday in the 1,500 with Reyes Estevez,
was 1-2 in the 5,000 and Isaac Viciosa clocked 13:37.46 and Manuel
Pancorbo finished in 13:38.03.
	   The men's marathon was 1-2-3 for Italy with Stefano Baldini
clocking 2:12:01 followed by Danilo Goffi (2:12:11) and Vincenzo
Modica (2:12:53). Spaniards took the next three places.
	   In the first European women's hammer, the world's top two
throwers all season dominated with gold for Mihaela Melinte of
Romania (71.57) and silver for Olga Kuzenkova of Russia (69.28).

Computer loses, American wins gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SEBASTIEN BOUWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Artificial intelligence lost out to humans
in the first international bridge showdown between 34 of the
world's top players and a computer program named GIB.
	   American Michael Rosenberg, 44, won the gold medal in the par
contest that finished Saturday, while GIB finished in 12th place.
	   The face-off highlighted Friday's opening of the two-week World
Bridge Championships in this northern French city.
	   GIB, or ``Goren In a Box,'' was named in honor of Charles Goren,
who helped popularize the card game in the 1940s. Loaded in a
simple personal computer, it was favored to win the animated match.
	   Despite having racked up 1,400 points on Friday, GIB's prowess
evaporated on Saturday. In the end, it scored 1,600 points out of a
possible 6,000.
	   Matthew Ginsberg, a University of Oregon mathematician and
artificial-intelligence expert, blamed it on a software problem in
the bidding process despite his continuous efforts to improve the
program.
	   After all, he noted, GIB did beat 23 of the world's best
players.
	   Other winners in the par contest Saturday were Americans Bart
Bramley in second place with the silver medal and Eric Rodwell in
third with the bronze.
	   Poland's Cezary Balicki finished fourth and Britain's Tony
Forrester fifth. Bob Hamman of the United States finished sixth,
Geir Helgemo of Norway seventh, and Andy Robson of Great Britain
eighth.
	   Five thousand players from 80 countries were competing in the
championships that end Sept. 4. Mixed pairs finals were scheduled
Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congo acknowledged Sunday that Angola had
sent troops to help President Laurent Kabila's embattled government
fight off advancing rebels, escalating a conflict already
threatening to engulf other African states.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumegi, speaking to The
Associated Press in Kinshasa, confirmed the deployment of Angolan
troops, saying Angola was exercising its ``will to support the
Congolese people.''
	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Rebel spokesman Sylvain Mbuki said Sunday his forces were
battling Angolan tanks advancing from the Angolan enclave of
Cabinda toward the Atlantic airbase at Kitona. The rebels have been
using Kitona to airlift troops closing in on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Asked about rebel claims of an Angolan drive toward Kitana,
Mumegi called it a defensive action.
	   An Angolan government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said on Saturday that troops would defend Kinshasa,
Congo's capital, although he gave no official word on his
government's position on the fighting. Neither did state-controlled
media.
	   Mbuki said the rebels will aim to take Kinshasa's Ndjili airport
in case Kitona falls to the Angolans.
	   Angolan troops landed in the west of this vast central African
country in support of Kabila's loyalist forces, a rebel leader said
on Saturday.
	   ``Angolan troops have invaded Congo,'' Bizima Karaha said from
the rebel's stronghold of Goma in eastern Congo.
	   Karaha warned that the Angolan involvement will complicate the
crisis and the rebels will retaliate. Zimbabwe had earlier deployed
troops to help Kabila ward off rebel advances on the capital,
Kinshasa.
	   Earlier, Mumengi had denied that Angola had deployed troops to
Congo, but hinted that they would be sent before long.

Explosion rips through building in Dagestan

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ An explosion ripped through a
residential building in the capital of the Caucasus republic of
Dagestan early Sunday.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said that four people were
hospitalized with injuries, while the Interfax news agency said
there were no casualties.
	   Investigators first reported that the blast in the one-story
building in Makhachkala had been caused by a gas leak. They later
said a mine had caused it, Interfax reported.
	   Bombings, kidnappings and other violent crimes have kept
Dagestan on edge for months. Various ethnic and religious groups
have been vying for power in the republic, which borders on
secessionist Chechnya.
	   On Friday, Dagestan's highest-ranking Muslim spiritual leader
was killed in a car-bombing, along with his brother and driver.
Authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a fundamentalist Islamic
sect, could have been involved in the attack on Mufti Said-Mohammad
Abubakarov.
	   Turpal Atgeriev, Chechnya's first vice premier, said Sunday that
Chechen law enforcement agencies had been ordered to help
investigate Abubakarov's killing. Appearing on Chechen television,
Atgeriev called on Chechens to pass any information they had on the
killing to police, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He said that ``nothing goes unnoticed in the Caucasus, and the
criminals will be established in any case and punished severely,''
the news agency said.

Kuwait restores postal services with Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has restored postal services with Sudan, a
sign that relations between the two countries are improving, albeit
slowly, officials said Sunday.
	   The Communications Ministry ordered the resumption of the postal
services last Wednesday, said ministry officials, speaking under
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Ties between Khartoum and Kuwait soured during the Gulf crisis
that was caused by Iraq's invasion of this oil-rich Gulf state in
August 1990. Kuwait believes Sudan, as well as some other Arab
countries, tilted toward Iraq during that conflict.
	   In May, Kuwait allowed a Sudanese diplomat to work in the
Sudanese Embassy that had been shut since the Gulf War that drove
Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991.
	   Kuwait's embassy in Khartoum, however, remained open, operated
by a charge d'affaires.
	   Some 500 Sudanese nationals live in Kuwait, down from 10,000
before the Iraqi invasion.

Malaysia supports special UN session on missile strikes: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has joined other
predominantly Muslim nations in calling for a special United
Nations Security Council session to discuss the recent United
States bombing of an alleged chemical weapons plant in Sudan.
	   Malaysia's Foreign Minister expressed support for the
extraordinary UN meeting and criticized the U.S. for violating the
sovereignty of other nations, Malaysian national news agency
Bernama reported Sunday.
	   ``This issue involves a principle which is most crucial and
which should not be ignored,'' Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi was quoted as saying by Bernama.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered surprise missile strikes on
suspected terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan last
Thursday.
	   On Friday, Sudan asked the Security Council to convene an urgent
meeting to authorize a fact-finding investigation into the U.S. air
strikes. Several Islamic states met Friday at the United Nations to
express support for Sudan's effort.
	   The Malaysian Foreign Minister also said his country was
concerned the U.S. action could trigger retaliatory action from
terrorist groups, the report said.

Philippine leader temporarily closes aid office after fatal
</HEADLINE>
stampede

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines President Joseph
Estrada ordered the temporary closure of a government aid center on
Sunday after two women were trampled to death as hundreds of people
stampeded to get forms for jobs, food and medicine.
	   Estrada also promised to reduce the huge throng of impoverished
people gathered at the center, located near Manila's presidential
palace.
	   On Saturday morning, hundreds of aid-seekers abandoned long
lines and surged toward a gate where application forms were being
handed out. In addition to the two deaths, dozens of other people
were injured in the melee.
	   Estrada had opened the Presidential Action Center shortly after
he took office on June 30 to highlight his administration's concern
over the welfare of millions of poor Filipinos.
	   The center was an attempt to follow up on a campaign pledge to
combat widespread poverty in the Philippines.
	   The president, who first came to prominence as a movie star,
visited the suburban home of one of the dead women on Sunday and
promised jobs and scholarships to her surviving family members.

Former chief prosecutor assassinated in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former Iranian chief prosecutor was shot
to death Sunday by unidentified assailants, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, who was also a former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization _ was killed by two gunmen at his drapery shop
in Tehran's grand bazaar, the agency said.
	   One of the gunmen opened fire from an Uzi machine gun as
Lajevardi, 63, was speaking to them.
	   Police arrested one of the gunmen. The fate of the other gunman
was not immediately known.
	   An elderly man who tried to intervene was also shot dead, the
agency said.
	   State-run Iranian television described Lajevardi as a ``tireless
struggler for the Islamic revolution'' and ``a selfless soldier''
of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and a
``companion'' of the current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Lajevardi, a hardliner who supported parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He was also involved in the bombing of the Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s, before the Islamic
revolution. He was jailed for two years for complicity in
assassination attempt on former prime minister Hassan Ali Mansoor
in 1965.

Lee rallies Nationalists, but feud with governor lingers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui rallied his feuding
Nationalists at a party assembly Sunday, but a festering quarrel
with powerful governor James Soong cast a shadow over proceedings
and seems destined to dog the party in December polls.
	   The year-end elections ``not only affect the power of the
Nationalist Party's ruling posture, but also are crucial to
national security and the future direction of the country,'' said
Lee as delegates cheered and waved party flags in the massive
auditorium of Taipei's downtown convention center. Lee is also
party chairman.
	   But the veneer of unity quickly wore thin in following debates,
as Soong's allies harangued officials over plans to dismember his
provincial government while the governor applauded from his seat in
the audience.
	   A vestige of pre-1949 days when Taiwan was governed as a
province of greater China, the provincial government is widely
considered an unnecessary extra level of bureaucracy whose
functions widely overlap those of the central government.
	   But elected by popular vote four years ago, Soong remains one of
Taiwan's most powerful politicians despite the planned dismantling
of his power base over the coming months. Nationalist politicians
associated with Soong are expected to be a considerable force in
year-end elections for legislators and the mayors of Kaohsiung and
Taipei cities.
	   The Nationalists go into the polls still smarting from a
humiliating defeat in local elections last December, but buoyed by
Taiwan's relatively smooth weathering of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Critics say the party will be hard pressed to define its mission
to voters beyond the election slogan of ``fair, just new society;
prosperity, stability and good living.''
	   Among 1,067 respondents to a survey by a pair of private
research institutes announced Sunday, 64 percent said they approved
of the job Premier Vincent Siew is doing, but fully half could not
say in what area he was doing well. The survey, conducted August
22-24, did not provide a margin of error.
	   The Nationalists now hold just under half the 164 seats in the
legislature. A Nationalist incumbent faces good odds for reelection
in southern Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, but the party
faces a tough fight in Taipei against popular Democratic
Progressive Party mayor Chen Shui-bian.
	   The election campaign could be much harder to wage if the party
continues to be hobbled by feuding between Lee and Soong
supporters. Their conflict dates from a decision in late 1996 to
abolish the provincial government in all but name, considered by
Soong a personal attack on him by rivals within the party.
	   Also at the conference, the Nationalists elected new members to
the Central Standing Committee, the party's highest decision making
body. All are close Lee allies, and the move seems intended to
ensure a smooth transition of power after Lee retires as president
in 2000, as he is widely expected to do.

Road linking Bangladesh capital, southern city submerged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Flood waters submerged several points
along a key highway linking the capital with a busy southern port
city, officials in Bangladesh said Sunday.
	   Road and rail network is in disarray in Bangladesh after several
weeks of torrential rains and floods. The main road linking Dhaka
with Chittagong was flooded, government officials said.
	   Several towns, including Narayanganj , Manikganj and Rajbari are
under knee- to waist-deep water, the Flood Forecasting and Warning
Center in Dhaka said.
	   The floods have left 530 people dead and more than 2 million
people homeless across the nation of 120 million people.
	   More than 100,000 people have been affected by waterborne
diseases such as diarrhea.
	   Meanwhile, the government has appealed to donor countries and
agencies for help following massive damage to the rice crop and to
basic infrastructure.

Pope urges negotiations to end Congo conflict, saying peace deal is

still possible &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL CANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II appealed to all
sides in Congo's escalating war Sunday to spare the lives of
civilians and to enter negotiations to end the conflict without
further bloodshed.
	   ``I direct a sorrowful appeal to the warring sides not to
deprive the people of the necessary means of life and to avoid
atrocities and massacres, plunder and depredation,'' the pontiff
said in his weekly Sunday address.
	   ``I ask besides that all the forces implicated in the destiny of
that nation agree to negotiations,'' the pope said, saying talks
were still possible even at this stage.
	   Such talks could avoid ``new tears and fighting, leading to a
peaceful and lasting solution and blocking the conflict from
spreading beyond the frontiers of the country,'' he said.
	   The pontiff delivered his remarks to the faithful gathered below
the window of his vacation retreat at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome.
	   Rebels in Congo are fighting to topple President Laurent Kabila.
The rebels accuse Angola of entering the war, which already
includes forces from Zimbabwe.

Report: Four Pakistani citizens to be deported from Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four Pakistani citizens suspected of spreading
extremist Islamic teachings have been detained in Tajikistan, the
Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
	   Citing the Tajik Security Ministry, Interfax said that the four
would be fined and deported on Tuesday.
	   The four men from the province of Punjab were detained in a
mosque in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, on Thursday. They
had no visas or residence permits, and they allegedly proselytized
among Tajik citizens in violation of Tajik law governing the status
of foreigners, Interfax said.
	   A source in the ministry told Interfax that the Pakistanis were
encouraging Tajiks to adopt Shariah law, and thus endangering
Tajikistan's secular state. The source said that security services
were intensifying their search for spies in expectation of attempts
by the Taliban and their radical Islamic brethren to infiltrate
Tajikistan disguised as Afghan refugees.
	   On Saturday, the defense and foreign ministers from Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan held talks behind closed doors
about the fighting in Afghanistan. The governments of the former
Soviet republics of Central Asia are concerned about the Taliban's
potential influence on radical Islamic movements they say are
growing in their own countries.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan forces battling in support of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila captured a key airbase at the
western town of Kitona, a ministry-level official said Sunday.
	   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity but
is in constant contact with Kabila, said Angolan tanks took part in
the swift maneuver.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' the official said.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed.
	   The fall of Kitona, just a few kilometers inland from the
Atlantic coast, would cut off rebel forces from their main supply
bases in the west.

Malaysia accepts Australian explanation on Commonwealth Games flap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chief organizer of the
Commonwealth Games has accepted the explanation of an Australian
official who allegedly questioned Malaysia's ability to host the
Games, a news report said Sunday.
	   Australian Commonwealth Games Association General Manager Perry
Crosswhite created an uproar last week by reportedly warning
Australian athletes that Malaysia may not be up to the task of
organizing the Games because many of the organizers were
ex-military officers.
	   Crosswhite denied he belittled Malaysia's organizing abilities
and said he had been misrepresented in the media.
	   The chairman of the Malaysian organizing committee General
Hashim Mohd Ali was quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency
that he was satisfied with Crosswhite's reply and that it was up to
Australian athletes and officials judge for themselves how well the
Games were organized.
	   ``Crosswhite has given an explanation which says that he was
misunderstood by the press while giving advice to athletes from his
country,'' Hashim told the national Bernama News Agency. ``I agree
with the explanation and accept it with an open heart.''
	   Hashim said there was nothing more to say about the issue
because all efforts should go into making the Games, which begin in
September, a success.
	   Last Wednesday, Crosswhite was quoted by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation as saying that Malaysia may have
difficulty handling certain sports issues because some of the
event's officials were ex-army officers.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will return to work in his
Kremlin office on Monday after a five-week vacation that has given
him little rest.
	   Among the first items on his schedule will be a meeting with
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, the Interfax news agency reported
Sunday. The two leaders are expected to discuss the parliamentary
debate, scheduled for Tuesday, of the government's economic
stabilization bills.
	   Gloomy weather marred the first days of the president's holiday,
and the country's roiling financial crisis deepened by the day.
Yeltsin interrupted his break last weekend to discuss the
government's efforts to cope with the crisis with Kiriyenko,
international financial envoy Anatoly Chubais and other economic
policy makers.

Jewish settlers and Palestinians clash, protests over U.S. strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered by the killing of
a rabbi, threw eggs, potatoes, and apples Sunday at Palestinians
and battled with Israeli soldiers. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas
and rubber bullets to fend off Palestinians who hurled stones.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as
they attempted to cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the
city. The army fired tear gas and rubber bullets towards about 30
protesters who were hurling stones from the Palestinian zone.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the Palestinian stone
throwers, pushing them back out of range of the Israelis.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   During a Cabinet meeting which focused on mounting tensions in
Hebron, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Yasser Arafat,
president of the Palestinian Authority, to reject Thursday's fatal
stabbing of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   The statement said that it was the policy of Netanyahu's
government to strengthen and develop the Jewish area in Hebron,
including Tel Romeida, where the stabbing took place Thursday
night. It said permits would be issued for permament housing to
replace mobile homes at the site.
	   Most of Hebron's population live in the zone that Israel turned
over to Palestinian control last year. The other 20 percent, where
500 Jewish settlers live among 30,000 Palestinians, is controlled
by Israel. The city is often a flash-point for violence between
Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet that gaps had been narrowed in peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, but the two sides still had not
reached agreement on the extent of a further withdrawal in the West
Bank. He said further talks were needed.
	   According to Israeli media reports, army intelligence has warned
that Islamic militant groups such as Hamas were planning to carry
out attacks against Israeli settlers.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip city of Rafah, about 200 members of
Shabiba, the youth movement of Arafat's Fatah faction, burned
American and Israeli flags in protest of U.S. missile strikes in
Sudan and Afghanistan last week.
	   Waving Palestinian and Sudanese flags, the protesters chanted,
``Death to America, Death to Israel.'' Two waved pistols in the
air, and others brandished plastic guns.
	   Over the loudspeakers of mosques, a statement was broadcast
attacking what was termed ``American aggression'' against the
Muslims of Afghanistan and the Sudan.
	   ``We are not going to allow the Americans to humiliate us
anymore. We send our support to the Muslim people of Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' the Shabiba statement said.
	   In Hebron, the parents of a three-month old baby, Qusai Sultan,
claimed their infant died Saturday night at an Israeli military
check post after soldiers refused to let the family seek treatment
at a nearby hospital. The city has been under curfew since
Thursday's attack.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said it had no knowledge of
the death of a baby but stressed that soldiers at road blocks are
under strict instructions to tend to medical emergencies without
delay.
	   Dr. Ziad Ashab of Aliya Hospital examined the body of the baby
Saturday night and said the boy died of respiratory and lung
infections. He said if the infant had arrived at the hospital
sooner his life may have been saved.

Parliament speaker says U.S. strike united Sudanese people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The U.S. strike on a factory in Khartoum
has strengthened popular support for the Islamic government,
Sudan's powerful parliament speaker said.
	   Speaker Hassan Turabi, who is widely regarded as the real power
behind the military-backed government, said the attack will not
deter the government from following through with its policies.
	   Sudan ``will not abandon its agenda of implementing Islamic
laws,'' the pro-government Alwan daily quoted Speaker Hassan
Al-Turabi as telling an anti-American rally in the central Sudanese
town of Medani on Saturday.
	   ``We knew beforehand that we would not be able to build a strong
state without such challenges and tests,'' Turabi was quoted as
saying. ,
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered attacks on suspected
terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan last Thursday.
	   Washington says the bombed Khartoum factory produced chemical
weapons precursors, but Sudan insists it only produced
pharmaceuticals.
	   The U.S. officials who announced the military strikes refused to
say publicly what weapons were used. Later, sources in Washington
said to be familiar with the operation, said that cruise missiles
were used.
	   However, Sudan's army spokesman, Gen. Abdel-Rahman Sirul-Khatim,
said Sunday that U.S. planes were used in the Khartoum attack.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada ordered the
temporary closure of a government aid center on Sunday after two
women were trampled to death as hundreds of people stampeded to get
forms for jobs, food and medicine.
	   Estrada also promised to reduce the huge throng of impoverished
people gathered at the center, located near Manila's presidential
palace.
	   On Saturday morning, hundreds of aid-seekers abandoned long
lines and surged toward a gate where application forms were being
handed out. In addition to the two deaths, dozens of other people
were injured in the melee.
	   Estrada had opened the Presidential Action Center shortly after
he took office on June 30 to highlight his administration's concern
over the welfare of millions of poor Filipinos.
	   The center was an attempt to follow up on a campaign pledge to
combat widespread poverty in the Philippines.
	   The president, who first came to prominence as a movie star,
visited the suburban home of one of the dead women on Sunday and
promised jobs and scholarships to her surviving family members.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Wearing jeans and black rubber shoes,
President Joseph Estrada shoveled garbage out of a dead creek
Sunday in a media event he hoped would encourage Filipinos to clean
up the environment and prevent drains from clogging.
	   At one point, Estrada nearly tripped over into the black, foul
waters but was pulled back by a bodyguard on the bank of the creek
in the fishing town of Malabon, off Manila Bay.
	   The declogging is part of an anti-flood program by the
government in metropolitan Manila ahead of this year's rainy
season. Flooding during the seasonal rains in the capital is often
aggravated by poor drainage and clogged waterways.
	   ``Many tragedies brought about by calamities such as flooding
could have been prevented if only our people have shown even a
little concern,'' Estrada said in Filipino.
	   Estrada dug plastic refuse, decaying wood and mud, which he
dumped into a bright yellow wheelbarrow held by Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado along the creek, lined by shanties.
	   The former movie star, approved a budget of 52 million pesos
(dlrs 1.2 million) for the program during brief ceremonies attended
by mayors and aides.

Russian border guards, customs officers stop alcohol smugglers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mineral water bottles atop the more lucrative
stuff. Fruit camouflaging crates of pure alcohol. False-bottomed
tanker trucks.
	   Russian border guards and customs officers manning the Georgian
border have seen 20 ways of smuggling alcohol, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Sunday.
	   This year, they've stopped more than 1,500 trucks trying to
smuggle alcohol into Russia, said Yuri Kiporov, the commander of
the border guards' detachment patrolling the border. Those included
several heavy-duty tank-trucks that tried to use a ``cloud-high''
mountain pass but were waylaid by border guards, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Many alcohol smugglers cross into Russia's Caucasus region from
Georgia. Russia claims most trucks coming from Georgia don't carry
proper documentation, and most of the alcohol goes to bootleggers,
avoiding taxes and state quality control.

`We'll strike in every corner,' says Kosovo rebel representative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A rebel representative has acknowledged
that the Kosovo Liberation Army has changed tactics and will now
rely on guerrilla warfare to win the Serbian province's
independence.
	   In an interview with the Vienna news magazine Profil, to be
published Monday but available to media on Sunday, Adem Demaci, the
new political spokesman for the KLA said, ``We will strike in every
corner of Kosovo.''
	   The ethnic Albanian rebel army has suffered a series of stinging
defeats in recent weeks at the hands of Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army and lost much of the territory it controlled.
	   Demaci explained the new strategy of his fighters.
	   ``The KLA is regrouping and will continue with a new tactic, the
tactic of the classic guerrilla warfare,'' he said.
	   He said the rebels had made the ``fatal mistake'' to date to
``defend a territory they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to
launch surprise strikes.
	   ``In a guerrilla war, the occupiers do not know if the enemy
stands in front of them or behind them. That will be much worse for
the Serbian police,'' Profil quoted Demaci as saying.
	   He claimed that the KLA was ``completely intact, we have only
lost a few soldiers.''
	   However, hundreds are believed to have been killed in recent
offensives launched by government forces in the central Drenica
region and along the border with Albania.
	   ``We must combine the armed struggle with politics in order to
win freedom,'' Demaci was quoted as saying.
	   ``I am in preparedness, any time, when certain conditions are
fulfilled, to start negotiations with the Serbian regime.''
	   However, the Serbian goverment keeps saying it would never
negotiate with the Kosovo ``terrorists.''
	   Demaci said the most important prerequisite for the start of
negotiations is the termination of the Serbian advance.
	   He said: ``The Serbian regime must cease all terrorist actions
against us Albanians, withdraw all army and police forces.'' Then
one can negotiate ``with international mediation.''

Malaysian prisons lodge complaint against U.S. movie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Prisons Department has
lodged a police report against an American movie charging it
depicts the Southeast Asian nation's prisons in a false light, a
news report said.
	   Polygram Films, ``Return to Paradise'' tells the fictional story
of an American man imprisoned on drug charges in Malaysia after a
reckless vacation with two friends in the northern state of Penang.
	   Some scenes in the film, recently released in the United States,
falsely depict wardens torturing prisoners who are locked in cells
infested with rats and cockroaches and refused medical treatment,
said Omar Mohamad Dan, director-general of Malaysia's prisons
department.
	   Omar said the movie's producers were using the film to criticize
Malaysia's prison and justice system, particularly its law that
imposes the death penalty on drug traffickers.
	   He said a police report was filed Saturday against the movie,
which stars Anne Heche and Joaquin Phoenix, and the matter was
brought to the attention of Malaysia's Home Ministry.
	   ``We will leave it to the authorities to decide on the sort of
action which can be taken,'' Omar was quoted as saying in the New
Straits Times.
	   Omar said evidence of the film's falsehoods could be found on
its Internet site, which shows wardens in the Penang prison
compound armed with pistols, red batons and wearing blue tags.
	   ``Our staff and wardens are issued green tags,'' Omar said,
adding that prison guards were not armed with guns in real life.
``The batons... are black and not as long as the ones depicted in
the movie.''
	   Omar added that Malaysian prisons complied with the United
Nations Standard Minimum Rules and prisoners were regularly checked
on by International Red Cross workers.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With tanks and air support, Angolan
forces Sunday drove into the western town of Kitona and captured a
key rebel base there, a ministry-level official said Sunday.
	   Rebels acknowledged losing the town, but said they were
continuing their advance on Kinshasa and had also captured the
important eastern city of Kisangani.
	   The Congolese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity but
is in regular contact with Kabila, said Angola staged the attacks
to cut rebels off from their supply routes down a narrow corridor
from the Atlantic coast to the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' the official said, adding that Angola
had also sent a number of warplanes to Kinshasa's international
airport.
	   Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, acknowledged the fall of Kitona.
	   ``We've made a tactical withdrawal,'' Karaha said, adding:
``Kitona is Congo. It will remain Congo. Angola cannot colonize
Congo.''
	   The fall of Kitona, just a few kilometers inland from the
Atlantic coast, traps rebel forces between their main supply bases
in the west and the capital, which is still controlled by the
government. The rebels have been using Kitona to receive troops who
have been airlifted across the country from the main rebel bases in
eastern Congo.
	   But Karaha said rebel troops were continuing their march toward
Kinshasa and on Sunday had also captured Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city.
	   The capture of Kisangani could not be independently confirmed.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumengi, speaking to The
Associated Press in Kinshasa, confirmed the deployment of Angolan
troops.
	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Asked earlier Sunday about rebel claims of an Angolan drive
toward Kitona, Mumengi called it a defensive action.
	   But Karaha warned that Angolan involvement would complicate the
crisis and said the rebels would retaliate. Zimbabwe deployed
troops Friday to help Kabila ward off rebel advances on Kinshasa.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement of this vast central African nation, have pushed
to within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of Kinshasa.
	   In announcing that Angolan troops had crossed into Congo, Karaha
urged the Luanda government to ``come to its senses'' and withdraw
its forces.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa tried
to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria. Two key
leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe, who is supporting the Kinshasa government with troops and
military equipment.
	   With the intervention of Angolan forces, chances of a negotiated
settlement are ``almost impossible,'' Karaha said.
	   On Saturday, Karaha said rebels had shot down two warplanes
allied with Kabila's forces.
	   Karaha said the Zimbabwean planes were shot down over rebel
territory in southwestern Congo. The report could not be
independently confirmed.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, Mugabe's spokesman rejected
the rebel claims.
	   There was no immediate comment from Kinshasa on the allegations.
	   Karaha said the attacks Saturday demonstrated the rebels'
resolve to continue fighting as long as outside forces were
involved.
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression,'' he said of the reported arrival of
more than 600 troop reinforcements from Zimbabwe and a contingent
from Angola in support of Kabila.
	   The rebels themselves are said to have the backing of
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.

Helicopters ferry more bodies from Himalayan village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Taking advantage of a brief clearing in
the weather Sunday, air force helicopters flew to the site of a
massive landslide in the Himalayas to transport the bodies of nine
victims who had been buried under a mountain of mud and boulders,
local news agencies reported.
	   Paramilitary soldiers pulled out 10 more bodies of victims from
the slush in the mountain village of Malpa, where 202 people were
already feared killed.
	   On Saturday, a series of landslides sent rocks and mud cascading
down the mountain, which has been lashed by heavy monsoon rains for
three weeks. The total number of known dead was 239.
	   On Sunday, air force helicopters made five trips to the Malpa
region, Press Trust of India news agency quoted local army
commander Maj. Gen. J.R. Mukherjee as saying.
	   So far, security forces have transported 17 of 45 bodies of
victims to nearby towns. Also, air force helicopters have rescued
18 survivors from Malpa, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of New
Delhi, PTI said.
	   The survivors, most of them injured by falling rocks and mud,
are being treated by doctors attached to paramilitary forces in the
village.
	   Among those feared killed were 60 Hindu pilgrims headed to a
sacred lake across the Chinese border in Tibet. Protima Gauri Bedi,
a famous classical Indian dancer was among the pilgrims. Her body
was found in the area and was to be handed over to her relatives
Sunday, United News of India news agency reported.
	   More than 30,000 people have been evacuated to higher ground
from 30 towns and villages facing a flood threat after a block in
the Mandakini River in nearby Garhwal region.
	   Army and civil engineers have decided not to dynamite the rocks
and boulders that have fallen into the river, causing a huge lake
to form in the area. Engineers fear that removing the blockage will
release huge quantities of water downstream and push up the water
level by as much as 26 feet (8 meters) downstream. That could
engulf 30 town and villages, about 100 kilometers (66 miles)
downstream.

Parliament speaker says U.S. strike united Sudanese people

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The U.S. strike on a factory in Khartoum
has strengthened popular support for the Islamic government,
Sudan's powerful parliament speaker said.
	   Speaker Hassan al-Turabi, who is widely regarded as the real
power behind the military-backed government, said the attack will
not deter the government from following through with its policies.
	   Sudan ``will not abandon its agenda of implementing Islamic
laws,'' the pro-government Alwan daily on Sunday quoted Speaker
Hassan al-Turabi as telling an anti-American rally in the central
Sudanese town of Medani on Saturday.
	   ``We knew beforehand that we would not be able to build a strong
state without such challenges and tests,'' al-Turabi was quoted as
saying.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered attacks on suspected
terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan last Thursday.
	   Washington says the bombed Khartoum factory produced chemical
weapons precursors, but Sudan insists it only produced
pharmaceuticals.
	   The U.S. officials who announced the military strikes refused to
say publicly what weapons were used. Later, sources in Washington
said to be familiar with the operation, said that cruise missiles
were used.
	   However, Sudan's army spokesman, Gen. Abdel-Rahman Sirul-Khatim,
said Sunday that U.S. planes were used in the Khartoum attack.

Austrian chancellor says EU will press for end to Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said
Sunday the European Union will press Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end the violence in the Serb province of Kosovo,
adding that a solution to the refugee problem must be found before
winter.
	   ``It is clear that the European Union as well as Austria will
call on Milosevic to stop the violence. We should also look at the
humanitarian issue and take care of the refugees and find a
solution before winter,'' Klima told reporters in this northern
Greek port city.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been
displaced since fighting escalated in the Albanian-dominated
province six months ago.
	   Klima, whose country's holds the rotating EU presidency, said he
agreed during a meeting with Greek Premier Costas Simitis that more
international observers were needed in Kosovo.
	   The crisis in nearby Kosovo was just one of the issues Klima
discussed with Greek officials during a three-day visit here. The
Austrian chancellor was to head home Sunday.
	   Simitis brought up Greece's tense relations with Turkey and the
war-divided island of Cyprus, which is a thorny issue in Europe's
relations with member-state Greece and aspirant Turkey.
	   The EU opened membership talks in March with Cyprus that could
see the island joining the 15-nation Union by the middle of the
next decade. Turkey was excluded from a list of potential EU
members. Turkish Cypriots refused an invitation to send a
delegation to the talks, saying that Cyprus should not become an EU
member before Turkey.
	   ''We are very sorry that they declined to participate,'' Klima
said of the Turkish Cypriots, adding that ``Austria is always
available and willing to support initiatives which are believed to
be able to lead to the resolution of pending issues.''
	   Conflict could break out between Greece and Turkey if Greek
Cypriots go ahead with plans to deploy Russian anti-aircraft
missiles on Cyprus in November. Turkey, which keeps an estimated
35,000 troops in the occupied northern third of Cyprus, has
threatened to take military action to stop their deployment.
	   On Saturday, Klima paid a visit to one of the only all-male
monastic communities in the world on the Mount Athos peninsula east
of the city.

Serbs accused of new artillery assault in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces were accused by ethnic
Albanians of launching a ``strong and massive'' artillery attack
Sunday on several rebel-controlled villages in southwestern Kosovo.
	   The reported assault came a day after the Serbs accused Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas of firing on Serbian police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region, along the road leading south
from the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Civilians in the area _ which includes the villages of Pecane,
Recane, Studencane, and Samodraza _ fled the attack, the Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   The pro-Albanian center, which is close to the pro-independence
Kosovo leadership, said the assault began after police ordered
residents early Sunday to evacuate from a suburb of the town of
Suva Reka, 45 kilometers (about 30 miles) southwest of Pristina,
and took positions there to open fire on KLA positions.
	   The reported attacks could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav Federation, where Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly
9-1. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between rebels and
government forces since the Serbs launched a major offensive Feb.
28.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, already have
been displaced since fighting escalated.
	   After a string of defeats in recent weeks, the KLA has announced
it would switch to guerrilla tactics rather than face the powerful
Serbian police and Yugoslav army in an open confrontation.
	   The latest Serb actions, if confirmed, may have represented a
retaliatory move.
	   Further to the east Sunday, Albanians said the sound of
detonations could be heard at the KLA stronghold Urosevac, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina.
	   The Albanians claimed the Serbs have embarked on a new offensive
to purge the rebels and secure important roads. As further
evidence, they cited yet another alleged attack on a cluster of
villages several kilometers (miles) to the north, closer to
Pristina.
	   Fighting was also reported west of Pristina, where the
government forces launched a grenade attack from a major east-west
road against nearby villages, causing a new flood of refugees, the
Albanian sources said.

	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Asked earlier Sunday about rebel claims of an Angolan drive
toward Kitona, Mumengi called it a defensive action.
	   But Karaha warned that Angolan involvement would complicate the
crisis and said the rebels would retaliate. Zimbabwe deployed
troops Friday to help Kabila ward off rebel advances on Kinshasa.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement of this vast central African nation, have pushed
to within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of Kinshasa.
	   In announcing that Angolan troops had crossed into Congo, Karaha
urged the Luanda government to ``come to its senses'' and withdraw
its forces.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa tried
to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria. Two key
leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe, who is supporting the Kinshasa government with troops and
military equipment.
	   With the intervention of Angolan forces, chances of a negotiated
settlement are ``almost impossible,'' Karaha said.
	   Karaha refused to speculate on Angolan motives for intervention,
but denied reports that his forces had links to Angola's UNITA
rebels.
	   ``We're not in contact with UNITA. We don't want to be in
contact with UNITA. We're not making alliances just for the sake of
alliance,'' he said. ``Angola wants to divide Congo. We're ready to
fight Angola.''
	   Some reports have speculated that Angola is supporting Kabila
out of fears of a possible alliance between the Congolese rebels
and UNITA.

French foreign minister says Iran wants a place in the world
</HEADLINE>
community &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran is looking to reclaim a central role in
the community of nations, and its new leaders strongly condemn
terrorism, France's foreign minister said Sunday.
	   With his high-profile mission, Hubert Vedrine was clearly
seeking to give a boost to Iran's moderates in their bitter
struggle against the hard-liners.
	   Though he did not say that publicly, he made a point on Sunday
to salute ``the impressive will of the Iranian electorate'' that
voted the moderate President Mohammad Khatami into power a year
ago.
	   ``Iran is looking to recover her role, her strategic role,''
Vedrine said, a role he said was natural, given the country's
``size, potential and position.''
	   After a second day of talks, in which he met Khatami and again
spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, Vedrine
wouldn't give specifics on the most difficult issues he came to
discuss: human rights and terrorism.
	   He did, however, emphasize that all the officials he met
condemned acts of terror _ including the recent U.S. Embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   ``All my interlocutors said in a solemn tone that they
absolutely condemn acts of terrorism,'' Vedrine told a news
conference.
	   On human rights, he would say only that the dialogue is
continuing.
	   ``On certain points we have values in common, and on certain
points we have different interpretations,'' he said. He didn't
mention what, if any, reaction the Iranians had when he raised the
subject of the death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie.
	   On Middle East peace, Vedrine was blunter, saying the Iranians
had insisted that they never acted against the peace process, but
were always skeptical of it. Now, he said, they felt it was dead
because of the intransigence of the rightist Israeli government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Without disagreeing with the assessment of Netanyahu's
government, Vedrine said he'd told the Iranians that France feels
any peace process is better than none at all.
	   The two-day trip by Vedrine, which ends Sunday evening, is the
highest-level French visit in seven years. Relations chilled only a
few months after the last trip by a French foreign minister, in
1991, when a former Iranian prime minister turned opposition leader
was assassinated in Paris.
	   Shapour Bakhtiar was one of eight dissidents in France believed
killed by Iranian hit squads.
	   Lately, however, both Europe and the United States have noted
positively the changing signals from Iran.
	   Of course, the gap remains wider with the United States, which
broke off ties with Tehran following the 1979 Islamic revolution
that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.
	   Vedrine said that U.S.-Iranian relations came up only indirectly
in his talks with Khatami, when the Iranian leader spoke of a
desire to open up to the West in general.
	   Aside from the politics, France's interest in Iran is economic.
Although Vedrine brought no business people on this trip, he spent
much time discussing trade, and the two countries agreed to
cooperate in a number of areas: agriculture, the fight against
drugs, civil aviation, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
	   Vedrine also said he'd discussed a host of regional conflicts
with the Iranians, including Afghanistan and Kosovo.
	   Shaking hands with the broadly smiling Khatami before their
meeting, Vedrine handed him a written message from President
Jacques Chirac, who he later said had invited the Iranian president
to visit Paris.

Yangtze rising upstream, more flooding feared in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of highest water levels this summer
upstream on Yangtze River near Chongqing, government announcement
to stop some tree cutting; other details.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Water levels upstream on the Yangtze River rose
Sunday to their highest of the year, threatening more flooding
downstream where soggy dikes have begun to crack.
	   The government, meanwhile, announced a ban on logging in western
Sichuan province along the upper reaches of the river to curb
severe soil erosion.
	   Excessive logging of hillsides is partly to blame for the worst
floods on the Yangtze in 44 years. Heavy rains this summer have
washed off the denuded hills instead of soaking in, causing rivers
to choke up with silt and rise.
	   River levels dropped slowly on the lower and middle reaches of
the Yangtze on Sunday after another crest passed. But the river was
expected to crest again in flood danger zones by Tuesday, state
radio reported.
	   It said the Yangtze on Sunday was at its highest level yet
upstream at Chongqing, a main industrial hub in southwestern China.
	   Downriver in the city of Jiujiang, in south China's Jiangxi
province, 300,000 soldiers and armed police patched up embankments.
Officials warned dikes protecting Jiujiang and other cities were
softening and cracking after weeks of pressure from high water
levels.
	   The heavily populated Yangtze River basin has been hardest hit
by the summer's floods. At least 2,000 people have died nationwide,
but the toll is expected to rise. Millions have fled their homes.
	   The state-run Xinhua News Agency on Sunday reported
``thousands'' have died in the floods, but gave no updated figure.
The agency reported at least 19 people died in Sichuan recently in
flooding caused by torrential rains.
	   The government, reluctant to report bad news, has not updated
the death toll in more than two weeks. Since then, floods in the
northeast have washed out villages and threatened major industrial
centers and the country's main oil field.
	   Flooding along the Yangtze has affected 240 million people,
about one-fifth of China's population, according to government
estimates.
	   The ban on logging in Sichuan, effective Sept. 1, was ordered
for the Chuanxi Forest Area, 4.63 million hectares (11 million
acres) spanning 54 counties, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Because of heavy logging, the area in western Sichuan where soil
erosion is a problem has nearly doubled from 60,000 square
kilometers (24,000 square miles) in the 1950s to 110,000 square
kilometers (44,000 square miles), the report said.
	   The Songhua River at Harbin, in northeast China's Heilongjiang
province, remained at record levels on Sunday, state media said.
	   The army sent reinforcements to Harbin over the weekend to
strengthen the 24-kilometer (15-mile) levee protecting the center
of the city from the Songhua.
	   But the government allowed villages on the opposite shore to be
engulfed by a brown sea of river water to divert the flow away
fromm Harbin. Throughout flooded regions, farms have been allowed
to be inundated to protect cities.
	   At Daqing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Harbin,
soldiers repaired a breach in the third and last line of levees
protecting the Daqing oil field and city from the Nen River.
	   Flooded regions were short of medicines, and stomach illnesses,
dysentery, hepatitis and diseases carried by waterborne parasites
were on the rise, Health Minister Zhang Wenkang warned.
	   He said the problem could get worse in the next three months, a
period that usually is the peak for the spread of epidemics in
China.

Spanish archbishop says Gaudi is saint material
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ The Vatican should consider beatifying
the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, the archbishop of Barcelona
said Sunday.
	   The brains behind this city's still-incomplete Sagrada Familia
Cathedral and other eye-catching modernist buildings worked through
``deep and constant contemplation of the mysteries of faith,''
Archbishop Ricard Maria Carles said in a letter to parishioners,
Europa Press reported.
	   ``Antoni Gaudi, architect, universal Catalan and lay mystic,
deserves to be studied as a candidate for sainthood,'' Carles said.
	   Gaudi died in 1926 after being struck by a trolley.

 &UR; Mandela continues juggling regional rivalries on day two of talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Rivals in the Congo crisis sat in
separate rooms Sunday as South African officials shuttled between
them in an effort to broker peace, South African radio reported.
	   President Nelson Mandela, president of the 14-member Southern
African Development community, has been trying since Wednesday to
contain the six-week old Congo conflict.
	   But several key players failed to show up at the Pretoria
summit, including Congolese President Laurent Kabila; Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe, who sent troops to back Kabila last week;
and a representative from Angola, whose troops joined Kabila's side
on Saturday.
	   ``We'd like them to be here and efforts to get them here have
not stopped,'' Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankhalana told reporters
Sunday.
	   Kabila, who sent his justice minister Mwenze Kongolo to
Pretoria, charges that Uganda and Rwanda have sent troops into the
former Zaire to back rebels trying to unseat him.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, who have denied the charges, continued meetings begun
Saturday with Mandela.
	   The Congolese delegation was relaying the discussion to Kabila
in Congo, the South African Press Association reported.
	   There were no face to face meetings between the two sides, SABC
radio reported Sunday.
	   South Africa has offered a proposal that would call for
recognition of Kabila's government as the legitimate government of
Congo, the radio report said.
	   The proposal also would allow foreign troops to remain in Congo
during an immediate cease-fire, and would mandate a national
conference to name a transitional government and plan for
democratic elections.
	   Kabila has ruled with an iron fist since he ousted former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from Congo last year, and has alienated
ethnic groups that helped him in the ouster.
	   Mankhalana would not confirm the contents of the proposal.
	   Presidents of the 12 remaining SADC countries began a meeting at
1 p.m. (1100 gmt) to bolster crisis negotiations, Mankhalana said.

Taiwan protests Swedish refusal on visa for vice president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Foreign Minister Jason Hu on Sunday
protested a Swedish announcement that it would refuse a visa for
Taiwan's vice president, calling the statement ``impolite,'' and
saying no visa request had been issued.
	   The Swedish Foreign Ministry's announcement Saturday may have
been prompted by inquiries from Stockholm University, which
recently invited Lien Chan to speak there, Hu was quoted saying in
local media.
	   Lien has a busy schedule and has not yet decided whether to
accept the University's invitation, the reports quoted him saying.
	   ``The announcement was really classless and impolite ... I don't
know who they're showing off for,'' Hu was quoted saying.
	   In Stockholm, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Annika Soeder claimed
that Sweden was following European Union practice barring high
level Taiwanese officials from visiting.
	   ``If we would let members of the Taiwanese national leadership
come here, the Taiwanese government could take advantage of that,''
she added.
	   Like most countries, Sweden recognizes Beijing and maintains
only unofficial relations with Taiwan.
	   China considers the Nationalist Party-ruled island a breakaway
province, and aggressively seeks to block Taipei's attempts to
raise its profile abroad.
	   Lien's previous visits to European nations, all impromptu and
unofficial, have fired angry protests from Beijing.
	   The Foreign Ministry's announcement was assailed by opposition
politicians and pro-Taiwanese groups in Sweden.
	   ``It's deplorable. Humiliating. To support democracy in Taiwan
must be allowed to cost us a few canceled deals with China,'' said
Per Ahlmark, former Liberal party leader and chairman of The
Swedish-Taiwanese Friendship Society.
	   Professor Torbjoern Loden, who heads the Stockholm University
department responsible for the conference, protested the
announcement in a letter to Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen.
	   ``The government's decision is a violation of the free exchange
of views across borders, which is an indispensable part of the
academic freedom.'' Loden wrote. Loden is a professor of Chinese
language and culture at Stockholm University.

Egypt's foreign minister arrives unexpectedly in Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moussa meeting with Assad, al-Sharaa.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
arrived here Sunday in a surprise visit for talks with President
Hafez Assad and other senior officials.
	   Moussa, whose visit was not announced in advance, was received
at the airport by his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa, and
other Syrian diplomats.
	   Moussa met with Assad and delivered a message from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   Details of the message were not immediately known, but Arab
diplomats in Cairo said Moussa is preparing for a visit by Mubarak
to Syria which is to take place soon.
	   Mubarak is expected to press for an international conference on
the Middle East, said the diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Syrian media have been critical of holding such a conference,
saying it could give Israel a pretext to back off from the terms of
the peace process set up by the 1991 Madrid Conference.
	   Moussa and al-Sharaa met separately and discussed bilateral and
regional issues, the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks and the
recent U.S. strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians are currently stalled
over Israel's refusal to endorse a U.S. proposal calling for an
Israeli withdrawal of 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Syria is also irked by an Israeli decision to build 4,800 new
homes in four settlement in the occupied Golan Heights.
	   The construction of the settlements ``is tangible evidence that
Israel does not want peace,'' al-Sharaa told reporters. ``The
Israeli government is looking for all possible obstacles in order
not to resume negotiations from the point where they last
reached.''
	   Syria says it will resume negotiations with Israel only after a
full Israeli withdrawal from the heights, which were captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981. Negotiations
between the two broke off more than two years ago.
	   Assad and Mubarak hold regular discussions on topics of interest
to their countries.

Report: Abacha's son arrested after airport gun incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A teen-age son of the late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha was arrested at an airport in northern Nigeria after
pointing a pistol at security personnel, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   Sadiq Abacha was arrested Tuesday at the international airport
in the city of Kano, the respected Lagos Guardian reported, after
pulling out the gun during a routine security check.
	   He was quickly freed after identifying himself as Abacha's son,
the newspaper said.
	   The report said he had two loaded pistols and an unknown amount
of foreign currency in the car's trunk.
	   It was not clear what he was doing at the airport, though
airport officials said he was not believed to be traveling anywhere
that day. His exact age was not given.
	   Kano was Abacha's hometown and his widow, Maryam, and some of
their 9 children still live there.
	   Abacha, whose five-year dictatorship came to a sudden end with
his death in early June, amassed an enormous fortune during his
corrupt rule.
	   His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has vowed to return the
oil-rich but poverty-wracked country to civilian rule next year and
to end the official corruption that has all but destroyed the
country's economy and infrastructure.
	   Maryam Abacha was reportedly stopped by authorities at the Kano
airport a few weeks ago, loaded down with suitcases stuffed with
cash. Authorities now reportedly keep her under surveillance and
have refused to let her leave the country.

Netanyahu denies Israel assisted in U.S. missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
denied that Israel's Mossad intelligence service helped the United
States prepare for strikes on suspected terrorist strongholds in
Afganistan and the Sudan.
	   ``It's simply a baseless fabrication,'' Netanyahu said of media
reports that the Mossad or other Israeli officials had a role in
preparing for Thursday's cruise missile strikes.
	   In a statement, Netanyahu said he briefed the Israeli Cabinet on
a telephone conversation he had with U.S. President Bill Clinton
after the missile strikes Thursday. Netanyahu called Clinton on
Friday.
	   ``Israel stands behind the United States in its struggle against
international terrorism,'' the statement said.
	   The strikes were launched against targets of Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi Arabian businessman tlinked to the Aug. 7 bomg attacks on
U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed
245 Africans and 12 Americans.
	   The daily Haaretz reported Friday that Israel gave the United
States considerable information about bin Laden's connections to
Islamic militant groups.

On battle anniversary, official says strong military vital for
</HEADLINE>
peace &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Marking the anniversary of a bloody battle
with China, Taiwanese Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said
Sunday that maintaining a strong military is the best way to avoid
future conflicts with Beijing.
	   Speaking on the 40th anniversary of a furious Chinese artillery
attack on the Taiwanese-held island of Kinmen, Chiang said
Beijing's continued threat of force against Taiwan requires a
credible defense to deter Chinese military adventurism.
	   ``The purpose of our military preparedness is exactly the goal
of avoiding future conflict,'' Chiang was quoted saying in an
interview with the China Times Express.
	   Chiang and other leaders have used the occasion of the
anniversary to urge continued vigilance against China, even as
their military conflict fades into the past. Public perception of a
China threat is vital for maintaining support for compulsory
military service and the large defense budgets that have enabled
Taiwan to overhaul its forces with high tech weaponry from the
United States and France.
	   Chiang led weekend battle commemorations on Kinmen, joining
veterans in visits to military memorials and graves of some of the
approximately 600 soldiers and civilians who died in the conflict,
which was followed by two decades of symbolic every-other-day
artillery exchanges.
	   President Lee Teng-hui praised the ``glorious sacrifice'' of the
conflict's victims in remarks Sunday before a ruling Nationalist
Party conference in Taipei.
	   ``It was the victory in the August 23 artillery battle that
settled the foundation for (Taiwan's) ensuing 40 years of
prosperity,'' Lee told party delegates.
	   One of the Cold War's major flash points, the 1958 battle has
become a major tourist draw for Kinmen, aided by the opening up of
defunct military installations and clearing of minefields for
development.
	   Island residents today hawk kitchen cleavers made from the
nearly half a million shells fired at the island during the battle.

Ahern predicts more bombings as Blair plans stronger anti-terror
</HEADLINE>
laws
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern predicted that fringe opponents of Northern Ireland's peace
accord will mount more attacks despite a security crackdown and
worldwide revulsion over the Omagh bombing.
	   ``I'd love to say to you that I believe this is the last
event,'' Ahern said in a BBC interview broadcast Sunday. It was
recorded Saturday after the premier joined more than 20,000 people
in Omagh for an emotional memorial to the 28 killed by an IRA
dissidents' car bomb Aug. 15.
	   ``But I think there is a small element _ and they are small _
who do not share that feeling,'' Ahern said. ``They believe that
they have some kind of a mandate, from some period in history, that
gives them some right to do this.''
	   The Irish Republican Army formally stopped its bombing and
shooting in July 1997, but three dissenting gangs continued
violence in pursuit of the IRA's traditional goal of abolishing
Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked with
Britain.
	   The group that admitted responsibility for the Omagh bomb, a
band of IRA defectors nicknamed the Real IRA, said Wednesday it had
``suspended'' its violence, a step short of a formal cease-fire.
	   The IRA's longtime rival in Northern Ireland's militant Catholic
neighborhoods, the Irish National Liberation Army, announced a
``complete cease-fire'' Saturday.
	   But the Continuity IRA, another group that emerged following an
abortive IRA cease-fire in 1994, has remained silent. It has bombed
several Northern Ireland towns since 1995, causing much destruction
but no deaths.
	   Like the Real IRA faction, the Continuity IRA is rooted in the
Irish Republic counties that border Northern Ireland and its few
dozen members claim to represent the ``true'' IRA.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to announce plans
to toughen the United Kingdom's anti-terrorism laws when he visits
Omagh for the first time Tuesday.
	   Among ideas being considered are allowing testimony from a
senior police officer to be used as sufficient evidence to convict
suspects of belonging to a paramilitary group.
	   Ahern on Wednesday announced that this power will become law
within weeks in the Irish Republic.
	   Until now, convicting people of simple membership of the IRA or
other outlawed groups has been extremely difficult, since the
groups keep no written records of membership, senior members do not
involve themselves directly in committing attacks, and potential
civilian witnesses run the risk of being killed as informers.
	   In an article published Sunday in the Observer newspaper, Blair
rejected hard-line appeals for his government to authorize outright
assassination bids on those reputed to command the Real IRA.
	   ``Yes, the group behind this bombing is small in number and the
names of many are known to us,'' Blair wrote. ``In a world
dominated by terror, yes, we could, to use the parlance, `take them
out.'''
	   But Blair said to kill those on the British list of Real IRA
commanders would undermine Britain's democratic credentials.
	   ``And we must win the battle on the security front through
democratic means,'' he wrote, ``which is why there has been such
unprecedented cooperation between London and Dublin, why we are
bringing in the toughest anti-terrorist laws right across the
island of Ireland, and why whatever is required will be done.''

Hanson's rise hurts hopes of reconciliation, says rights official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The rise of the right-wing One Nation
party has destroyed chances of a reconciliation between Aboriginal
and white Australians by the turn of the millennium, Australia's
human rights commissioner Chris Sidoti said Sunday.
	   The divisions in Australian society are greater now than ever
before, Sidoti told reporters while attending a reconciliation
conference in Mackay, in north Queensland state.
	   ``I've had to lower my expectations. All I can see now by the
beginning of 2001, and all I can hope for, is a strong national
commitment to righting the wrongs that have been done to indigenous
people,'' Sidoti said.
	   ``I had hoped eight years ago that we may have done a lot by
then, but there have been major setbacks and we have a long way to
go.''
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has fueled a so-called race
debate in Australia since being elected to federal parliament as an
independent in 1996. Hanson opposes special welfare payments to
Aborigines, who are the nation's most disadvantaged group.
	   She has also vowed to abolish Aborigines' native title land
rights, which the conservative government drastically cut back
earlier this year under pressure from its rural constituency.
	   Hanson also opposes Australia's immigration policies, and warns
the country is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians.''
	   One Nation is less than two years old, but has been attracting
double digit support ratings in national public opinion polls. The
government and Labor opposition have denounced the party.
	   The four day reconciliation conference, Working Together, was an
attempt to bring Aborigines and other together at community level,
organizer Jan Chorley said.

Former chief prosecutor assassinated in Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in grafs 6-10 responsibility claim by Mujahedeen Khalq
opposition group. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former Iranian chief prosecutor was shot
dead Sunday by unidentified assailants, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, who was also a former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization _ was killed by two gunmen at his drapery shop
in Tehran's grand bazaar, the agency said.
	   One of the gunmen opened fire from an Uzi machine gun as
Lajevardi, 63, was speaking to them.
	   Police arrested one of the gunmen. The fate of the other gunman
was not immediately known.
	   An elderly man who tried to intervene was also shot dead, the
agency said.
	   The Baghdad-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group said it was
responsible for Lajevardi's assassination.
	   ``At noon today, Mujahedeen operational units in Tehran carried
out an operation targeting Assadollah Lajevardi, the Butcher of
Evin,'' said a Mujahedeen statement telephoned to the Associated
Press office in Cairo.
	   Lajevardi was at one time the head of the notorious Evin prison
in northern Tehran.
	   The Mujahedeen statement said one of Lajevardi's bodyguards was
killed in the attack and several others were wounded during
``intense'' clashes between Mujahedeen gunmen and the bodyguards.
	   It said the attack was carried out to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of ``the biggest massacre of political prisoners in
Iran in the summer of 1988, in which more than 30,000 political
prisoners were summarily executed ... under Lajevardi's
supervision.''
	   State-run Iranian television described Lajevardi as a ``tireless
struggler for the Islamic revolution'' and ``a selfless soldier''
of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and a
``companion'' of the current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Lajevardi, a hard-liner who supported parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He was also involved in the bombing of the Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s, before the Islamic
revolution. He was jailed for two years for complicity in
assassination attempt on former prime minister Hassan Ali Mansoor
in 1965.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, Interior Ministry officials
said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known. U.S.
authorities confirmed the shooting and said Marines were fortifying
the embassy, but had no further comment.
	   Albanian police said they would issue a statement later.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the American mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
nationals, including some from Arab countries.
	   The Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high on
the embassy's back side at about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police outside
the embassy started shooting in the air to force him out, and after
he refused to do so American security officers shot him in the
chest, the official said.
	   The policeman, who was armed with a pistol, was taken to a
military hospital, where he died soon afterward in surgery.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, from the village of
Ndroq, 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Tirana. The official said
he was a member of a police unit in charge of security at a Tirana
bank.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday.
	   Earlier this summer, five suspects believed to be Egyptian
nationals reportedly were arrested and spirited out of the country
with the help of American agents.
	   Three days later, Albanian and American agents reportedly were
carrying out a nationwide search for suspected members of a
terrorist group that had planned the attack.

Westwood withdraws from European Open in last round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ European tour No. 1 Lee Westwood withdrew
from the European Open golf tournament at the K Club in Ireland
Sunday after aggrevating a hip injury in his last round.
	   The 25-year-old Ryder Cup player said the injury could force him
out of the game for two weeks after quitting the tournament on the
sixth hole Sunday.
	   Westwood, who suffered a recurrence of sciatic nerve problems at
the recent U.S. PGA, where he failed to make the cut, said the pain
around his left hip forced him to retire.
	   He pulled out of the upcoming BMW International in Munich but
said he could be back in time for the European Masters in
Switzerland starting Sept. 3, which is the first qualifying event
for next year's Ryder Cup.
	   ``I think the problem was caused by taking two weeks off after
the Dutch Open, not touching a club, then over-practising before
the U.S. PGA,'' he said Sunday.
	   Westwood just made the cut at the par-72 K Club course, scoring
77 in the first round and 71 in the second round to qualify by one
shot. He fired a 77 on Saturday and had double bogeyed the fourth
and bogeyed the third and fifth holes Sunday to slump to 13-over
before withdrawing from the tournament.
	   At the time Sweden's Mathias Gronberg was a clear leader on
11-under after 55 holes, four strokes in front of American Craig
Hainline.

Lionized, Castro finds satisfaction in scaled-back role as `Mr.
</HEADLINE>
Caribbean' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ For years, many have
predicted the fall of Fidel Castro as an inevitability in a new
world where markets, McDonald's and Madonna hold sway. But the
resilient old revolutionary is still very much around.
	   This weekend marked what seemed like the Cuban dictator's
crowning as the elder statesman of the Caribbean, a region that
longs for a role, and possibly a leader, in a post-Cold War era
where it feels adrift.
	   Castro, who three weeks ago toured Jamaica, Barbados and
Grenada, was invited to observe a Caribbean Community summit in the
Dominican Republic _ a country that shares a fascination with Cuba
but shunned Castro during his four decades in power.
	   His real role was far greater than that of an observer. Castro,
72, cast a large shadow over the summit, projecting benign
authority as he lectured against U.S. domination. Aides even
distributed pamphlets of his recent speeches.
	   In the streets of Santo Domingo, people delighted in professing
support for Castro even while opposing communism. The thousands of
Cuban exiles here limited their protest to newspaper advertisements
while some streets filled with signs welcoming ``El Comandante.''
	   ``Castro is a very important man, no?'' gushed Maria Torres, a
42-year-old seamstress who lives off dlrs 200 a month. ``Maybe he
can help us improve our lives.''
	   For Castro, whose ambitions of fomenting armed global revolution
were frustrated throughout the world and right here in the
Dominican Republic, the Caribbean is a scaled-back, but satisfying,
arena for a comeback late in life.
	   For the Caribbean, an alliance with the area's largest nation _
even in its impoverished state under Castro _ offers much-needed
diplomatic muscle. It is an unmistakable signal to the United
States, which has outraged Caribbeans by neglecting the region
after the Cold War, reducing aid, and even fighting the trade
advantages enjoyed by their vital banana industry in Europe.
	   Thus there's real sympathy here for Castro the underdog, who has
survived four decades of U.S. enmity and outlasted his Soviet
patrons. Sentiment in favor of ending the 37-year U.S. economic
boycott of Cuba _ perceived as ineffectual arrogance that only
harms the Cuban people _ is authentic and overwhelming.
	   Castro himself has become more ideologically palatable, too.
	   His attacks on capitalism now are more muted. Communist Cuba is
courting investors from Europe and the Caribbean. Now it is mainly
an ``unbridled'' form of capitalism that Castro rails against, and
Caribbean togetherness he preaches.
	   Unless it overcomes differences born of competing French,
Spanish, Dutch and English cultural influences, ``the Caribbean
confronts the serious danger of marginalization,'' he warned
Friday.
	   These are ideas that strike deep chords in the Caribbean, where
people feel their small, divided island nations cannot compete with
global powers without a few ``uncapitalistic'' trade concessions
like the banana benefits.
	   Nowhere has the rapprochement been more striking than in Santo
Domingo, which stokes the Caribbean imagination as the oldest
European-style city in the Western hemisphere and shares
centuries-old historical ties with Cuba.
	   Onetime Marxist _ and former president _ Juan Bosch was once
exiled to Cuba and led a failed 1947 expedition to oust Dominican
dictator Rafael Trujillo in which Castro took part. Their boat was
stopped and the dissidents disbanded before they left Cuban waters.
	   Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican Republic
after his ouster by Castro in 1959. Castro then sponsored a small
invasion against Trujillo, whose military annihilated the invading
force. Trujillo responded by backing Cuban exiles in a frustrated
attempt to overthrow Castro.
	   When Castro landed here on Thursday, he seemed close to tears,
saying he ``couldn't believe'' he was finally here. Many Dominicans
felt the same.

India supports U.S. military strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A victim of terrorism itself, India
expressed guarded support for U.S. missile strikes against
Afghanistan and Sudan, Sunday's newspapers reported.
	   ``The recent incidents (embassy bombings) justify the need for
action against terrorism,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was
quoted as saying at a Saturday party meeting. ``I'm not supporting
America, but we are for international initiative against
terrorism,'' he said.
	   ``I hope the U.S. will now realize that terrorism has to be
contained wherever it takes place.''
	   For years India has said Pakistan is training and arming Muslim
guerrillas to fight its proxy war against India in the northern
territory of Kashmir. Pakistan says it only gives the rebels moral
support.
	   In recent months, India has alleged that many Afghan mercenaries
have joined Pakistani and Indian guerrillas to fight for
independence in Kashmir, where more than 16,000 people have died
since the violence erupted in 1989.
	   Successive governments have felt frustrated that Western nations
have not acted against Pakistan decisively.
	   '' I hope on the question of terrorism, double standards will
not be followed,'' Vajpayee said.
	   Soon after the bombing, India's Foreign Office criticized the
missile attacks as unilateral and called for a ``uniform policy ...
from Belfast to the Himalayan region.''
	   Vajpayee's stand contrasted with Defense Minister George
Fernandes' criticism of the American action.
	   ``If the U.S. wanted to deal with the terrorist threat outside
its borders, it should have moved the United Nations or other such
concerned world forum instead of directly resorting to a
pre-emptive attack,'' Fernandes said.

Thrown rocks during Indian festival leaves 800 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An old custom of hurling rocks at each
other during a local festival in northern India left some 800
people injured Sunday, a local news agency reported.
	   Twenty-five people were hospitalized in critical condition after
residents of two rival villages hurled rocks at each other during
the Gotmar festival in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh,
United News of India news agency reported.
	   The origin of the custom is not clear, but residents of the two
villages near the town of Chhindwara, 750 kilometers (465 miles)
south of New Delhi, consider it a sign of luck if they can capture
a tree at a local shrine in the face of the volley of stones.
	   Every August, residents of the two villages line up across a
river and hurl rocks and abuses at each other during the ceremony.
Getting injured is considered a good omen. Once the ceremony is
over, residents of both villages eat and rejoice together.

`We'll strike in every corner,' says Kosovo rebel representative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A rebel representative has acknowledged
that the Kosovo Liberation Army has changed tactics and will now
rely on guerrilla warfare to win the province's independence from
Serbia.
	   In an interview with the Vienna news magazine Profil, to be
published Monday but available to media on Sunday, Adem Demaci, the
new political spokesman for the KLA said, ``We will strike in every
corner of Kosovo.''
	   The ethnic Albanian rebel army has suffered a series of stinging
defeats in recent weeks at the hands of Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army and lost much of the territory it controlled.
	   Demaci explained the new strategy of his fighters in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   ``The KLA is regrouping and will continue with a new tactic, the
tactic of the classic guerrilla warfare,'' he said.
	   He said the rebels had made the ``fatal mistake'' to date to
``defend a territory they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to
launch surprise strikes.
	   ``In a guerrilla war, the occupiers do not know if the enemy
stands in front of them or behind them. That will be much worse for
the Serbian police,'' Profil quoted Demaci as saying.
	   He claimed that the KLA was ``completely intact, we have only
lost a few soldiers.''
	   However, hundreds are believed to have been killed in recent
offensives launched by government forces in the central Drenica
region and along the border with Albania.
	   ``We must combine the armed struggle with politics in order to
win freedom,'' Demaci was quoted as saying.
	   ``I am in preparedness, any time, when certain conditions are
fulfilled, to start negotiations with the Serbian regime.''
	   However, the Serbian government says it will never negotiate
with the Kosovo ``terrorists.''
	   Demaci said the most important prerequisite for the start of
negotiations is the end of the Serbian advance.

Only a few turn out in rain for Diana memorial walk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rain and poor organization spoiled a charity walk
Sunday along Princess Diana's funeral route and there were fears
that it will raise very little for the princess's favorite causes.
	   The organizers had hoped to attract more than 15,000
participants, but only a few hundred turned up to walk the London
streets Diana's coffin traveled on Sept. 6 before it was taken
north of the capital to her ancestral home for burial.
	   Walkers paid 5 pounds (dlrs 8) each to take part and got friends
and relatives to sponsor them.
	   But it was not immediately clear if the walk would raise any
money for Diana's memorial fund, which authorized the event, and
other charities.
	   Organizers the North London Walking Club first had to cover
their 30,000-pound (dlrs 48,000) costs, which included printing
4,000 copies of a glossy, 16-page program, and certificates for
those who completed the six-mile (10-kilometer) event, which began
and ended in Hyde Park.
	   While the club blamed the rain for the poor turn-out, some
walkers blamed poor promotion.
	   ''There was not the publicity there should have been and this is
the result,'' said Michael Bailey, a rail worker from Tunbridge
Wells, south of London, who completed the walk with his wife,
Michelle.
	   He added that the map provided by organizers was difficult to
follow and walk marshalls hard to find. ''I do not think it was
properly organized,'' he said.
	   London housewife Joan Ambrose, 53, said the fancy program was
unnecessary. ''It is silly, they could have given the money
straight to charity,'' she said.
	   North London Walking Club official Sam Woods said it was
unfortunate that the event had not been able to find a major
sponsor, which would have guaranteed better publicity.
	   ''More publicity could have been of more benefit but it is a
balance between what you spend on publicity and what goes to the
charity,'' Woods said.
	   Those who showed up wanted to remember the princess, who died in
a Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   ''I think many people are thinking about Diana at this time of
year and want to do something for her,'' said Edna Chegwidden, 57,
a Londoner.
	   Like Diana's funeral cortege, walkers wound their way through
Green Park, along the Mall and past Buckingham Palace.
	   The program carried a goodwill message from Diana's former
butler, Paul Burrell, a memorial fund official. Ironically, he
anticipated the event would be ''wonderful and fitting tribute to a
truly inspirational and unique human being.''

Netanyahu denies Israel assisted in U.S. missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
denied that Israel helped the United States prepare for strikes on
suspected terrorist strongholds in Afghanistan and the Sudan.
	   ``It's simply a baseless fabrication,'' Netanyahu said of media
reports that the Mossad intelligence service or other Israeli
officials had a role in preparing for Thursday's cruise missile
strikes.
	   In a statement, Netanyahu said he briefed the Israeli Cabinet on
a telephone conversation he had with U.S. President Bill Clinton
after the missile strikes Thursday. Netanyahu called Clinton on
Friday.
	   ``Israel stands behind the United States in its struggle against
international terrorism,'' the statement said.
	   The strikes were launched against the suspected militant sites
of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian businessman linked to the
Aug. 7 bombing attacks on U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 245 Africans and 12 Americans.
	   The daily Haaretz reported Friday that Israel gave the United
States considerable information about bin Laden's connections to
Islamic militant groups.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, Interior Ministry officials
said.
	   The motive for the break-in was not immediately known. U.S.
authorities confirmed the shooting and said Marines were fortifying
the embassy, but had no further comment.
	   Albanian police said they would issue a statement later.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the American mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
nationals, including some from Arab countries.
	   The Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high
wall at the embassy's rear at about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police
outside the embassy started shooting in the air to force him out.
After he refused to leave, American security officers shot him in
the chest, the official said.
	   The policeman, who was armed with a pistol, was taken to a
military hospital, where he died.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, from the village of
Ndroq, 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Tirana. The official said
he was a member of a police unit in charge of security at a Tirana
bank.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday.
	   Earlier this summer, five suspects believed to be Egyptian
nationals reportedly were arrested and spirited out of the country
with the help of American agents.
	   Three days later, Albanian and American agents reportedly were
carrying out a nationwide search for suspected members of a
terrorist group that had planned the attack.

Philippine president submits proposed 1999 budget to congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has
submitted for approval in Congress a 579.5 billion peso (dlrs 13.8
billion) budget for next year, which allocates a large amount to
social services and small business credit, officials said Sunday.
	   Estrada said House Speaker Manuel Villar pledged to prioritize
discussions on the proposed budget, which aims to abolish special
funds for lawmakers' pet infrastructure projects. Those funds have
been widely suspected of being a main source of graft.
	   Estrada told lawmakers Saturday night that the budget reflects
the need to rein in expenses due to a huge budget deficit this
year.
	   ``No amount of persuasion will bring confidence on a government
that cannot curb unnecessary spending and is unable to keep its
books in the black,'' said Estrada.
	   Estrada warned Congress against rejecting or delaying the
proposed budget, saying it could derail government programs or lead
to a bigger deficit.
	   The budget, which is 7.3 percent higher than that of the current
year, allocates 159.4 billion pesos (dlrs 3.8 billion), or 27.5
percent, to social services including education, health, social
welfare and agrarian reform, a goverment statement said.
	   It said 16.3 percent, or about 94.6 billion pesos (dlrs 2.2
billion) will go to the economic services sector, including
agriculture, power, transport and comunications, and local
governments.
	   The Philippines government is projecting a budget deficit of 40
billion (dlrs 952 million) this year but says this could drop to
17.9 billion pesos (dlrs 426 million) next year considering an
austerity program and an aggressive revenue collection drive, the
statement said.
	   The Manila government plans to raise money for the budget partly
from new taxes from road use and land conversions and sales of
government assets.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said cost-cutting steps, tax
reforms and the sale of government properties could help the Manila
government attain a balanced budget or even attain a surplus by the
year 2000.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former Iranian chief prosecutor was shot
to death Sunday by unidentified assailants, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, who was also a former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization _ was killed by two gunmen at his drapery shop
in Tehran's grand bazaar, the agency said.
	   One of the gunmen opened fire with an Uzi machine gun as
Lajevardi, 63, was speaking to them.
	   Police arrested one of the gunmen. The fate of the other gunman
was not immediately known.
	   An elderly man who tried to intervene was also shot dead, the
agency said.
	   Lajevardi was at one time the head of the notorious Evin prison
in northern Tehran.
	   The Baghdad-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group claimed
responsibility for Lajevardi's assassination.
	   ``At noon today, Mujahedeen operational units in Tehran carried
out an operation targeting Assadollah Lajevardi, the Butcher of
Evin,'' said a Mujahedeen statement telephoned to the Associated
Press office in Cairo.
	   The Mujahedeen statement said one of Lajevardi's bodyguards was
killed in the attack and several others were wounded during
``intense'' clashes between Mujahedeen gunmen and the bodyguards.
	   It said the attack was carried out to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of ``the biggest massacre of political prisoners in
Iran in the summer of 1988, in which more than 30,000 political
prisoners were summarily executed ... under Lajevardi's
supervision.''

forces Sunday drove into the western town of Kitona and captured a

continuing their advance on Kinshasa and had also captured the
important eastern city of Kisangani.

staged the attacks to cut rebels off from their supply routes down

More aid workers leave Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ More aid workers fled Afghanistan on
Sunday following the U.S. attack that has made all foreigners a
target in the increasingly isolated country.
	   Red Cross workers arriving in neighboring Pakistan on Sunday
from the southern Afghan city of Kandahar refused to speak to
reporters as they bundled enough luggage for a long stay into
trucks.
	   Oliver Durr, head of the international Red Cross delegation,
said the reduction of his staff in Kandahar and the Afghan capital
of Kabul was temporary ``pending a change in the situation.''
	   Durr said 18 workers were evacuated Sunday, nine each from
Kandahar and Kabul. It was not immediately clear how many stayed
behind to run Red Cross hospitals in Afghanistan.
	   A day earlier, the body of a U.N. military observer killed in
Kabul was flown to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. The Italian
observer was shot the morning after U.S. missiles struck a target
in eastern Afghanistan said to be a training camp for militants
linked the man Washington blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Kabul was reported quiet Sunday after anti-Western
demonstrations Saturday. Also Saturday, demonstrators shouting
anti-foreigner slogans destroyed the offices of a medical aid group
in the far western city of Herat. No injuries were reported.
	   The United Nations pulled non-Afghan staff out of several
Afghani cities.
	   The foreign aid workers are leaving behind a country reduced by
years of civil war to one of the poorest and most heavily mined in
the world.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Sarah Russell said her organization's food,
medical and demining programs were continuing under Afghan staff.
But she acknowledged problems could arise as food and medicine ran
out.
	   ``At the moment, people have got enough supplies to keep going.
It's so unpredictable. It's extremely hard to plan,'' Russell said.

	   State-run Iranian television described Lajevardi as a ``tireless
struggler for the Islamic revolution'' and ``a selfless soldier''
of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and a
``companion'' of the current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Lajevardi, a hard-liner who supported parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He was also involved in the bombing of the Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s, before the Islamic
revolution. He was jailed for two years for complicity in
assassination attempt on former prime minister Hassan Ali Mansoor
in 1965.

Ukraine celebrates independence with mixed feelings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine enters another year of independence
Monday with mixed feelings _ proud of its post-Soviet achievements
yet deeply worried about its future.
	   When military vehicles and troops parade through downtown Kiev,
many will see them as one of the most tangible symbols of the
independence proclaimed on Aug. 24, 1991.
	   But many will also think of economic and social hardships and
look back nostalgically to the Soviet Union, to a time when Ukraine
was the Soviet breadbasket and its defense complex produced
one-third of all Soviet weapons.
	   Today, Ukraine's economy ``is in a profound state of crisis,
which puts the nation's economic independence into question,'' said
former parliament Speaker Oleksandr Moroz, a socialist.
	   A strategically located country of more than 50 million people,
Ukraine has not experienced the violence that accompanied the
downfall of communism in neighboring Russia.
	   Its path has been typical of former Soviet republics _
continuing economic decline, hyperinflation, growing unemployment,
millions impoverished as the government struggles to enact market
reforms.
	   ``Three to 5 percent of the populace grew rich, acting like
thieves _ and the others live like paupers,'' Communist chief Petro
Symonenko snapped recently.
	   Paupers and homeless children do wander the tree-lined streets
of Kiev, Ukraine's European-looking capital, while rich ``new
Ukrainians'' drive Mercedes and flash their omnipresent mobile
telephones.
	   After 7 years of independence, Ukraine is a work in progress.
	   Foreign businesses have been scared away by bureaucracy,
widespread bribe-taking and market instability, bringing in only
about dlrs 2 billion in direct investment since 1991.
	   Seven prime ministers have changed since independence and
reforms have been stifled by President Leonid Kuchma's fights with
parliament. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
suspended cooperation with Ukraine in 1997.
	   Ukraine did manage to establish democratic institutions, improve
its ties with Western nations and NATO and put an end to a long
feud with Russia over the division of the former Soviet Black Sea
fleet.
	   But there always seems to be a ``but.''
	   Kiev and Moscow signed a friendship treaty in 1997, but the
accord, along with the fleet deal, remain to be ratified by their
parliaments.
	   Ukraine has surrendered its nuclear arsenal _ the world's third
largest _ but has yet to dismantle the weaponry's infrastructure or
come to terms with the Soviet atomic legacy, including the
disastrous consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
	   It has moved a long way along the path of economic reform,
introduced a relatively stable currency and reined in inflation,
but major agricultural and tax reforms still lie ahead and
privatization has been moving slowly.
	   Kuchma has moved to introduce a series of reforms and his
premier, Pavlo Lazarenko, has launched a serious crackdown on tax
debtors. Gross domestic product rose in the first half of this
year, the first increase in years, and an IMF mission last month
recommended the release of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   But massive foreign borrowing, the withdrawal of foreign
investors and giant tax debts have brought Ukraine to the brink of
financial crisis, complicated by economic woes in Russia, Ukraine's
main trading partner.
	   ``The closure of plants, non-payment of wages and pensions hits
people every day. Under these blows, they can't even attempt a just
and objective assessment of the road we have passed,'' acknowledged
Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine.
	   ``My principle is that there is no alternative to freedom,'' he
added. ``Those who try to blame independence for our hardships are
simply lying to themselves, to their conscience and to history.''

Growing indications of blame battle between Al Fayed and bodyguards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on crash
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Finger-pointing over who was responsible for
Princess Diana's death appears to have intensified between two
ex-bodyguards and Mohamed Al Fayed, the billionaire father of
Diana's boyfriend who also died in the car crash.
	   Recent news reports and legal moves indicate Al Fayed has fallen
out with his ex-bodyguards Trevor Rees-Jones and Alexander
Wingfield over who was to blame for alleged security lapses before
the crash nearly one year ago.
	   After earlier contending a conspiracy was behind the midnight
crash that killed Diana and Dodi Fayed, the elder Fayed said in
Monday's issue of Time magazine that Rees-Jones and Wingfield
caused the accident ``through their incompetence and unprofessional
practices.
	   ``They had rules and they moved away from the rules. They let me
down,'' said Al Fayed, owner of London's Harrod's department store
and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
	   It was from the Ritz that Diana and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed
left in a chauffeur-driven black Mercedes the night of Aug. 31,
1998, shortly before the car crashed into a pillar in the Pont de
l'Alma tunnel along the Seine River.
	   Al Fayed's lawyers say the bodyguards should have insisted on a
backup car, should not have allowed driver Henri Paul to take the
route he did, and that Rees-Jones should have insisted that Diana
and Fayed buckle up as he did, Time said.
	   Investigators have been focusing on several factors, including
evidence that Paul, who worked for the Ritz, was very drunk,
driving the Mercedes at a high rate of speed and trying to evade
press photographers. Paul also died in the crash.
	   Meanwhile, London's Sunday Telegraph reported Wingfield is to
take Al Fayed to court next week, claiming he was forced to quit
after he refused to back up Al Fayed's conspiracy theory.
	   In addition, there are indications that Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the crash, could change his story at the cost of Al
Fayed.
	   Rees-Jones is soon expected to meet again in Paris with
investigative Judge Herve Stephan, after his French lawyer,
Christian Curtil, formally asked Stephan in June to question top
Ritz managers about possible security lapses and about how much
they knew of Paul's condition.
	   Six months ago, Rees-Jones said Paul appeared fine the night of
the crash and didn't appear to be drunk. But Rees-Jones has since
resigned from his job with Al Fayed.

Play washes out play in the third womens Ashes test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WORCESTER, England (AP) _ Torrential rain prevented any play on
day three of the third and final womens Ashes cricket test between
England and Australia at Worcester on Sunday.
	   The rain started at 11am local time and play was finally
abandoned at 2.30pm.
	   Australia was in a strong position after play Saturday, reaching
279 for one in reply to England's 243 all out but now the likely
outcome of the match is another draw.
	   The first two tests ended in a draws and with just one day of

Biaggi captures his second Grand Prix title in 500cc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRNO, Czech Republic (AP) _ Italy's Max Biaggi captured his
second 500cc Grand Prix title on a Honda on Sunday, capturing the
119-kilometer (73-mile) Czech Republic GP in 45 minutes, 12.043
seconds.
	   Alex Criville of Spain came home second, also on a Honda,
overtaking Brasil's Alex Barros in the last lap.
	   Biaggi had the best start and it looked like he would fight for
the victory with four-time world champion Michael Doohan of
Australia, who started from the pole position. But Doohan fell on
the first lap and had to pull out several laps later.
	   Biaggi, former world champion in the 250cc, didn't make a single
mistake throughout the race and led from start to finish.
	   ``This is a very emotional track for me because I've always won
here in the last four years,'' said Biaggi after the race. ``To win
here in front of all those people is something special for me.''
	   Biaggi's biggest rival in the championship hunt is now Criville,
who had a brief crisis in the middle of the race but fought back
and almost managed to catch up with the Italian.
	   ``I finished second but the important thing is that the
championship is still open, and that's fantastic,'' Criville said.
	   In the 250cc race, Japan's Tetsuya Harada on an Aprilia
comfortably beat his biggest rival Loris Capirossi of Italy, also
on an Aprilia, in what was virtully a two-horse race from start to
finish.
	   Harada covered the 108 kilometers (68 miles) in 41 minutes,
52.318 seconds, beating Capirossi by 5.207 seconds. Italy's
Marcellino Lucchi on an Aprilia finished third, almost half a
minute behind.
	   Child prodigy Marco Melandri on a Honda won the 125cc race,
edging Japan's Kazuto Sakata on an Aprilia. Italy's Lucio
Cecchinello on a Honda finished in a close third.
	   The 16-year-old Melandri clocked a time of 42 minutes, 05.161
seconds in the 103-kilometer (64-mile) race, leaving Sakata a mere
0.038 behind.

Egypt's foreign minister arrives unexpectedly in Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moussa meeting with Assad, al-Sharaa. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
arrived here Sunday in a surprise visit for talks with President
Hafez Assad and other senior officials.
	   Moussa was received at the airport by his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk al-Sharaa, and other Syrian diplomats.
	   Moussa met with Assad and delivered a message from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   Details of the message were not immediately known, but Arab
diplomats in Cairo said Moussa is preparing for an upcoming visit
by Mubarak to Syria.
	   Mubarak is expected to press for an international conference on
the Middle East, said the diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Syrian media have been critical of holding such a conference,
saying it could give Israel a pretext to back off from the terms of
the peace process set up by the 1991 Madrid Conference.
	   Moussa and al-Sharaa met separately and discussed bilateral and
regional issues, the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks and the
recent U.S. strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians are currently stalled
over Israel's refusal to endorse a U.S. proposal calling for an
Israeli withdrawal of 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Syria is also irked by an Israeli decision to build 4,800 new
homes in four settlement in the occupied Golan Heights.
	   The construction of the settlements ``is tangible evidence that
Israel does not want peace,'' al-Sharaa told reporters. ``The
Israeli government is looking for all possible obstacles in order
not to resume negotiations from the point where they last
reached.''
	   Syria says it will resume negotiations with Israel only after a
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981. Negotiations
between the two broke off more than two years ago.
	   Assad and Mubarak hold regular discussions on topics of interest
to their countries.

Albania and Macedonia talk peace as Kosovo fighting rages on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Albanian Premier Fatos Nano and his
Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski pledged Sunday to
preserve peace in their countries, both concerned with violence in
Serbia's neighboring Kosovo province.
	   ``The crisis in Kosovo has caused concern and Macedonia and
Albanian have most reasons to worry,'' Crvenkovski said.
	   ``We are here to defend stability of the Republic of Macedonia
and the Republic of Albania and we are not alone in that, we have
support from Europe and the United States,'' said Nano, wrapping up
his two-day visit to Macedonia.
	   Nearly two million ethnic Albanians live in Kosovo, in southern
Serbia, and thousands have fought to win independence and possibly
unite with neighboring Albania, the country where they got key
support for their struggle.
	   Macedonia, neighbor to both Serbia and Albania, has its own
large and increasingly restive ethnic Albanian minority which could
be inclined to also start their own struggle for independence. Nano
was invited to Macedonia by Crvenkovski, whose government is
anxious to avoid more tensions or an escalation.
	   Both Macedonia and Albania aspire to join NATO, and the U.S.
ambassador to Skopje, Christopher Hill, joined the premiers' talks
on Saturday at the Ohrid lake resort in southwestern Macedonia.
	   Hill is a top mediator in Serbia between the authorities and
ethnic Albanian rebels there. A U.S. embassy official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Hill ``used the opportunity to inform
the Albanian prime minister about the situation in Kosovo.''

French foreign minister says Iran wants a place in the world

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran is looking to reclaim a central role in
the community of nations, and its new leaders strongly condemn
terrorism, France's foreign minister said Sunday.
	   With his high-profile mission, Hubert Vedrine was clearly
seeking to give a boost to Iran's moderates in their bitter
struggle against the hard-liners.
	   Though he did not say that publicly, he made a point on Sunday
to salute ``the impressive will of the Iranian electorate'' that
voted the moderate President Mohammad Khatami into power a year
ago.
	   ``Iran is looking to recover her role, her strategic role,''
Vedrine said, a role he said was natural, given the country's
``size, potential and position.''
	   After a second day of talks, in which he met Khatami and again
spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, Vedrine
wouldn't give specifics on the most difficult issues he came to
discuss: human rights and terrorism.
	   He did, however, emphasize that all the officials he met
condemned acts of terror _ including the recent bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   ``All my interlocutors said in a solemn tone that they
absolutely condemn acts of terrorism,'' Vedrine told a news
conference.
	   On human rights, he would say only that the dialogue is
continuing.
	   ``On certain points we have values in common, and on certain
points we have different interpretations,'' he said. He didn't
mention what, if any, reaction the Iranians had when he raised the
subject of the death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie.
	   On Middle East peace, Vedrine was blunter, saying the Iranians
had insisted that they never acted against the peace process, but
were always skeptical of it. Now, he said, they felt it was dead
because of the intransigence of the rightist Israeli government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The two-day trip by Vedrine, which ends Sunday evening, is the
highest-level French visit in seven years. Relations chilled only a
few months after the last trip by a French foreign minister, in
1991, when a former Iranian prime minister turned opposition leader
was assassinated in Paris.
	   Shapour Bakhtiar was one of eight dissidents in France believed
killed by Iranian hit squads.
	   Lately, however, both Europe and the United States have noted
positively the changing signals from Iran.

	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets of
Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinians,
some children, went on for several hours Sunday even as an Israeli
army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired towards Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as they attempted to
cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the city. At the
checkpoint, a group of 30 Palestinian children, some as young as
five years-old, threw stones towards the Israeli troops, who
responded by firing rubber bullets and a stun grenade.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the stone throwers,
pushing them back out of range of the Israelis. No injuries were
reported.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Yasser Arafat, president
of the Palestinian Authority, to condemn Thursday's fatal stabbing
of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   The statement said that it was the policy of Netanyahu's
government to strengthen and develop the Jewish area in Hebron,
including Tel Romeida, where the stabbing took place Thursday
night. It said permits would be issued for permanent housing to
replace mobile homes at the site.
	   Most of Hebron's population live in the zone that Israel turned
over to Palestinian control last year. The other 20 percent, where
500 Jewish settlers live among 30,000 Palestinians, is controlled
by Israel. The city is often a flash-point for violence between
Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Following the murder, Israeli troops placed a curfew on the
Palestinian residents, preventing them from leaving their homes or
opening up market stalls, turning the usually bustling center into
a virtual ghost-town.
	   During a condolence call to Raanan's widow, Israeli President
Ezer Weizman was heckled and cursed by settlers. Israeli police
said they would investigate settler militant Baruch Marzel for
slander and incitement for calling the moderate Weizman, a traitor
who should be jailed.
	   Also, the parents of a three-month old baby, Qusai Sultan,
claimed their infant died Saturday night at an Israeli military
checkpost after soldiers refused to let the Palestinian family seek
treatment at a nearby hospital.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said it had no knowledge of
the death of a baby but stressed that soldiers at road blocks are
under strict instructions to tend to medical emergencies without
delay.
	   Dr. Ziad Ashab of Aliya Hospital examined the body of the baby
Saturday night and said the boy died of respiratory and lung
infections. He said if the infant had arrived at the hospital
sooner his life may have been saved.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet that gaps had been narrowed in peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, but the two sides still had not
reached agreement on the extent of a further withdrawal in the West
Bank. He said further talks were needed.
	   According to Israeli media reports, army intelligence has warned
that Islamic militant groups such as Hamas were planning to carry
out attacks against Israeli settlers.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip city of Rafah, about 200 members of
Shabiba, the youth movement of Arafat's Fatah faction, burned
American and Israeli flags in protest of U.S. missile strikes in
Sudan and Afghanistan last week.
	   Waving Palestinian and Sudanese flags, the protesters chanted,
``Death to America, Death to Israel.'' Two waved pistols in the
air, and others brandished plastic guns.
	   Over the loudspeakers of mosques, a statement was broadcast
attacking what was termed ``American aggression'' against the
Muslims of Afghanistan and the Sudan.
	   ``We are not going to allow the Americans to humiliate us
anymore. We send our support to the Muslim people of Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' the Shabiba statement said.

Serbs accused of new artillery assault in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians accused Serb forces
of launching a ``strong and massive'' artillery attack Sunday on
several rebel-controlled villages in southwestern Kosovo.
	   The reported assault came a day after the Serbs accused Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas of firing on Serbian police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region, along the road leading south
from the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Civilians in the area fled the attack, the Kosovo Information
Center said.
	   The center, which is close to the pro-independence Kosovo
leadership, said the assault began after police ordered residents
early Sunday to evacuate a suburb of the town of Suva Reka, 45
kilometers (about 30 miles) southwest of Pristina, and took
positions there to open fire on KLA positions.
	   The reported attacks could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav Federation, where Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly
9-1. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between rebels and
government forces since the Serbs launched a major offensive Feb.
28.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, already have
been displaced since fighting escalated.
	   After a string of defeats in recent weeks, the KLA has announced
it would switch to guerrilla tactics rather than face the powerful
Serbian police and Yugoslav army in an open confrontation.
	   The latest Serb actions, if confirmed, may have represented a
retaliatory move.
	   Further to the east Sunday, Albanians said the sound of
detonations could be heard at the KLA stronghold Urosevac, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina.

Yangtze rising upstream, more flooding feared in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with call for crackdown on crimes in flood areas,
other details; Trims. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Water levels upstream on the Yangtze River rose
Sunday to their highest of the year, threatening more flooding
downstream where soggy dikes have begun to crack.
	   The government, meanwhile, announced a ban on logging in western
Sichuan province along the upper reaches of the river to curb
severe soil erosion.
	   Excessive logging of hillsides is partly to blame for the worst
floods on the Yangtze in 44 years. Heavy rains this summer have
washed off the denuded hills instead of soaking in, causing rivers
to choke up with silt and rise.
	   River levels dropped slowly on the lower and middle reaches of
the Yangtze on Sunday after another crest passed. But another flood
peak was headed downriver toward the flood zones, state radio
reported.
	   It said the Yangtze on Sunday was at its highest level yet
upstream at Chongqing, a main industrial hub in southwestern China.
	   Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of the river last week,
and flooding occurred on five major rivers of the Yangtze River
system in Sichuan province. The five rivers flow into the Yangtze
at Chongqing.
	   Downriver in the city of Jiujiang, in south China's Jiangxi
province, 300,000 soldiers and armed police patched up embankments.
Officials warned dikes protecting Jiujiang and other cities were
softening and cracking after weeks of pressure from high water
levels.
	   The heavily populated Yangtze River basin has been hardest hit
by the summer's floods. At least 2,000 people have died nationwide,
but the toll is expected to rise. Millions have fled their homes.
	   The state-run Xinhua News Agency on Sunday reported
``thousands'' have died in the floods, but gave no updated figure.
The agency reported at least 19 people died and three were missing
in Sichuan in floods started by rainstorms Wednesday through
Friday.
	   The government more than two weeks ago said more than 2,000 had
died nationwide. Since then officials have not disclosed an updated
toll.
	   Flooding along the Yangtze has affected 240 million people,
about one-fifth of China's population, according to government
estimates.
	   In a bid to turn the tide against Yangtze floods in the decades
ahead, the Sichuan provincial government banned logging effective
Sept. 1 in the Chuanxi Forest Area, 4.63 million hectares (11
million acres) spanning 54 counties, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Because of heavy logging, the area in western Sichuan where soil
erosion is a problem has nearly doubled from 60,000 square
kilometers (24,000 square miles) in the 1950s to 110,000 square
kilometers (44,000 square miles), the report said.
	   Grazing and fuel gathering were also banned on some slopes so
that they could be reforested.
	   The Public Security Ministry on Sunday ordered its bureaus in
flooded areas to punish theft of relief supplies, break-ins at
homes of people out fighting the floods and other crimes, Xinhua
reported.
	   The Songhua River at Harbin, in northeast China's Heilongjiang
province, remained at record levels on Sunday, state media said.
	   The army sent reinforcements to Harbin over the weekend to
strengthen the 24-kilometer (15-mile) levee protecting the center
of the city from the Songhua.
	   But the government allowed villages on the opposite shore to be
engulfed by a brown sea of river water to divert the flow away from
Harbin. Throughout flooded regions, farms have been allowed to be
inundated to protect cities.

Posh might be. And Scary, too. Two Spice Girls reported pregnant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ And then there were six?
	   Days after newspapers reported Posh Spice Victoria Adams is
pregnant, the News of the World on Sunday announced that a second
member of the hit band The Spice Girls is expecting.
	   ''I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no,'' the tabloid quoted
Scary Spice Melanie Brown as saying. Breathlessly, it recorded her
father's response when its reporters asked him for comment: ''How
did you find out? You're the first.''
	   The News of the World said 23-year-old Ms. Brown ''and her
delighted fiance,'' dancer Jimmy Gulzar, plan to marry as soon as
the group finishes its U.S. tour, which ends this week.
	   ``The pair have already phoned Mel's family in Leeds to tell
them about the baby. Excited Mel has also bought a house and is
having builders install a nursery,'' the newspaper enthused.
	   No one answered calls at the office of The Spice Girls'
spokesman, Alan Edwards.
	   Ms. Adams, 24, and her fiance, Manchester United soccer star
David Beckham, have not commented on reports she is pregnant. They
plan to marry next year.
	   Ms. Adams will take time off from the Spice Girls' hectic
schedule but she will not be leaving the band, reports said.
	   The fifth Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell, also known as Ginger
Spice, quit the band in June.

Trade group alleges Congo troops kidnapping ethnic Tutsis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A group promoting trade
between South Africa and Rwanda charged Sunday that Congo's
government troops have kidnapped at least 20 ethnic Tutsis in
Kinshasa.
	   The 20 people who disappeared were relatives and friends of
members of the Rwandan Southern African Alliance, formed last year
to foster international exchange with southern African countries,
said coordinator Atilla Alpman.
	   The most recent victims were Jacky Gatariki, 34, and two family
members, who were abducted on Saturday by government troops,
according to several RSAA members in telephone contact with
Kinshasa, Alpman said.
	   Gatariki is a Congolese citizen of Banyamulenge ethnic identity,
a group closely associated with Rwanda's Tutsis.
	   Rwanda, located to the east of Congo, backed rebel leader
Laurent Kabila's ouster last year of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   But the Banyamulenge charge that Kabila has treated them
shabbily and they launched an uprising last month to unseat the new
president.
	   Earlier this month, Amnesty International accused both sides in
the conflict of provoking and covering up civilian massacres and
ethnic killings in the troubled central African country, formerly
known as Zaire.
	   Amnesty said the government had repeatedly condoned attacks
against ethnic Tutsis with broadcasts on state radio urging
civilians to ``massacre'' people with ``long noses, who are tall
and slim and want to dominate us.''
	   RSAA said that many people of Tutsi descent had their cellular
phones disconnected by Kabila's government, and estimated that
about 500 others have disappeared.
	   The organization did not have the other 500 names.
	   In 1994 in Rwanda, at least half a million people, most of them
minority Tutsis, were slaughtered before a Tutsi-led rebellion
ousted the ethnic Hutu government.
	   Kabila claims that Rwanda and another neighbor, Uganda, are
backing the rebel troops. Both countries have denied the
allegation.

No threat to Oder river after refined oil spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Firefighters on Sunday contained about 500
kilograms (1,100 pounds) of refined oil that spilled into the Oder
river from a factory, a spokesman said.
	   Three teams that deal with toxic substances put up barriers to
contain the oil, part of 20 tons that leaked at the Rockwool-Polska
factory in Cigacice, 430 kilometers (260 miles) west of Warsaw,
according to firefighter spokesman Andrzej Kostrzewa.
	   Most of the spill remained in the factory's reservoirs, and the
oil that got outside, less than four barrels (168 gallons), never
reached the main river stream, said Sylwester Michalak, another
firefighting official.
	   ``There is no direct threat'' to the river, Kostrzewa said.
	   The factory makes insulation material for houses.

Growing indications of blame battle between Al Fayed and bodyguards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment, background on bodyguards
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Finger-pointing over who was responsible for
Princess Diana's death appears to have intensified between two
ex-bodyguards and Mohamed Al Fayed, the billionaire father of
Diana's boyfriend who also died in the car crash.
	   Recent news reports and legal moves indicate Al Fayed has fallen
out with his ex-bodyguards Trevor Rees-Jones and Alexander
Wingfield over who was to blame for alleged security lapses before
the crash nearly one year ago.
	   After earlier contending a conspiracy was behind the midnight
crash that killed Diana and Dodi Fayed, the elder Fayed said in
Monday's issue of Time magazine that Rees-Jones and Wingfield
caused the accident ``through their incompetence and unprofessional
practices.
	   ``They had rules and they moved away from the rules. They let me
down,'' said Al Fayed, owner of London's Harrod's department store
and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
	   It was from the Ritz that Diana and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed
left in a chauffeur-driven black Mercedes the night of Aug. 31,
1998, shortly before the car crashed into a pillar in the Pont de
l'Alma tunnel along the Seine River.
	   Al Fayed's lawyers say the bodyguards should have insisted on a
backup car, should not have allowed driver Henri Paul to take the
route he did, and that Rees-Jones should have insisted that Diana
and Fayed buckle up as he did, Time said.
	   Investigators have been focusing on several factors, including
evidence that Paul, who worked for the Ritz, was very drunk,
driving the Mercedes at a high rate of speed and trying to evade
press photographers. Paul also died in the crash.
	   Wingfield's lawyer, Bill Waddington, called Fayed's latest
allegations ``outrageous and groundless,'' London's Sunday
Telegraph reported.
	   ``Mr. Wingfield is saddened that he should choose the buildup to
the first anniversary of the crash to make such absurd comments,''
Waddington added.
	   According to the Telegraph, both Rees-Jones and Wingfield have
insisted they objected to the drive they say Dodi Fayed planned, in
part because it lacked a backup car.
	   Meanwhile, the Telegraph reported that Wingfield, who left the
Ritz that night in a decoy car, is to take Al Fayed to court next
week, claiming he was forced to quit after he refused to back up Al
Fayed's conspiracy theory.
	   In addition, there are indications that Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the crash, could change his story at the cost of Al
Fayed.
	   Rees-Jones is soon expected to meet again in Paris with
investigative Judge Herve Stephan, after his French lawyer,
Christian Curtil, formally asked Stephan in June to question top
Ritz managers about possible security lapses and about how much
they knew of Paul's condition.
	   Six months ago, Rees-Jones said Paul appeared fine the night of
the crash and didn't appear to be drunk. But Rees-Jones has since
resigned from his job with Al Fayed.

Muslim fundamentalists stage protest against U.S. missile attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ About 2,000 Muslim fundamentalists on
Sunday burned effigies of U.S. President Bill Clinton and staged a
noisy protest against U.S. missile attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan.
	   ``Clinton must accept responsibility for missile attacks and
resign immediately,'' activists of the Islamic Oikko Jote or
Islamic United Front chanted as they marched through the city.
	   ``Clinton manage your sex scandal not the Muslims,'' they said.
	   The protest was in contrast to the government stand, which
condemned terrorism and stopping short of criticizing Washington.
	   Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad called for ``coordinated
efforts of the United Nations and other world bodies to combat the
growing threats of terrorism.''
	   ``Bangladesh had always opposed terrorism in all its forms. ...
We deplore the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in the
strongest terms,'' he told reporters.
	   Commenting on the retaliatory attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan,
Azad said that ``such acts raise pertinent questions on the
sanctity of territorial integrity of sovereign states.''

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known. But an
American diplomat who declined to be named described it as a small
incident that had nothing to do with fears of a possible terrorist
attack.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
nationals, including some from Arab countries.
	   The Interior Ministry, in an official statement, said the
policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high on the embassy's back
side at about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police outside the embassy
started shooting in the air to force him out, and after he fired
back with a pistol security officers shot him.
	   A ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity
identified the guards who did the shooting as American, not
Albanian.
	   The policeman had at least two bullet wounds, one near the
heart, and died soon afterward in surgery at a nearby military
hospital, doctors were quoted by Albanian TV as saying.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, from the village of
Ndroq, 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Tirana _ a member of a
police unit in charge of security at a Tirana bank.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads, and U.S. Marines
fortified the compound.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday, but the Americans said it was planned and had
nothing to do with the shooting.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Saudi Arabian riyal continued to come
under pressure Sunday because of speculation stoked by the U.S.
attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan, dealers said.
	   The dollar was trading at riyals 3.7520-30, up from 3.7506-08
before the U.S. strikes Thursday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the U.S. strikes on Afghanistan
and Sudan aimed to destroy terrorist infrastructure, particularly
that of Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden, whom the United States
blames for the Aug. 7 bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. The U.S. missiles hit bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan.
	   Dealers said the riyal came under pressure Friday from dealers
in London and New York who betting against the currency in forward
dealings.
	   As a result, one-year riyal swap rates jumped to 420-460 basis
points over the spot exchange rate Sunday, up from 370-390 points
Thursday. The higher points reflect the pressure on the currency.
	   Some dealers said the pressure would not last long as the Saudi
government has staunchly defended the riyal in recent years.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian companies have won seven
contracts to supply goods worth dlrs 7 million to Iraq under the
oil-for-food program, the official Petra News Agency said Sunday.
	   The contracts were approved by the U.N. sanctions committee in
New York.
	   They allow Jordan to sell veterinary drugs, eggs, fodder
concentrates, medicines and milk powder.
	   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to buy humanitarian goods
with the proceeds of limited oil sales that are sanctioned by the
United Nations.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The government has allocated 100 million Iraqi
dinars (dlrs 83,000) to maintain Iraq's 73 floating bridges, a
Cabinet minister said in remarks published Saturday.
	   Housing and Reconstruction Minister Ma'an Abdellah Sersem said
that maintenance work and improvements would soon begin on the
bridges, which are nearly 20 years old, the weekly newspaper
Al-Musawir al-Arabi reported.
	   The bridges cross Iraq's two main rivers, the Tigris and
Euphrates, and some tributaries.

	   ROME, Italy (AP) _ The United Nations will find out who was
responsible for the killing of an Italian U.N. worker in
Afghanistan, Secretary-General Kofi Annan promised Italy.
	   Military observer Lt. Col. Carmine Calo died Saturday, a day
after being shot as he drove a marked U.N. vehicle in Kabul. A
French civilian U.N. worker in the vehicle with Calo was injured.
	   An Italian newspaper, l'Unita, on Sunday called Calo the first
victim of retaliation for the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan. The acting head of the U.N. Afghan mission, James Ngobi,
said Saturday that the attack specifically targeted the United
Nations.
	   Annan telephoned Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Saturday
night to express his condolences and to promise an accounting for
the ``odious attack,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Ngobi said he was told that Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had
arrested the perpetrators and arraigned them before a military
court. But in Afghanistan, a Taliban official said only that 13
people were being held for questioning in Friday's shooting.

	   Military observer Lt. Col. Carmine Calo died Saturday, a day
after being shot as he drove a marked U.N. vehicle in Kabul. A
French civilian U.N. worker in the vehicle with Calo was injured.
	   An Italian newspaper, l'Unita, on Sunday called Calo the first
victim of retaliation for the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan. The acting head of the U.N. Afghan mission, James Ngobi,
said Saturday that the attack specifically targeted the United
Nations.
	   Annan telephoned Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Saturday
night to express his condolences and to promise an accounting for
the ``odious attack,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Ngobi said he was told that Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had
arrested the perpetrators and arraigned them before a military
court. But in Afghanistan, a Taliban official said only that 13
people were being held for questioning in Friday's shooting.

Fans demonstrate as Spurs slump continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pressure is piling on Tottenham Hotspur manager
Christian Gross after 350 angry fans demonstrated outside White
Hart Lane after the team conceded its sixth goal in two Premier
League games.
	   Mounted police, dog handlers and 100 stewards took two hours to
disperse the fans blockading the gates of the Spurs' homeground
after its 3-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.
	   The London-based team was beaten 3-1 by Wimbledon in the first
round of the Premier League.
	   The fans chanted ``sack the board'' and ``we want our Tottenham
back''. And with the season only two rounds old, the demonstrations
look likely to continue unless Spurs' form reverses against Everton
at Liverpool on Saturday.
	   A Tottenham Action Group spokesman said the fans had had enough
(of the losses) and it is quite clear they wanted both the manager
(Gross) and the chairman to resign.
	   Fans were critical when Tottenham failed to make a major signing
in the off-season after fighting relegation from the top-flight
competition last season.
	   Gross, Spurs' Swiss manager, is hoping to sign Norwegian
international Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for 5.5 million pounds (dlrs 8.9
million) from Manchester United this week in a bid to bolster his
strikepower.
	   At West Ham Saturday, about 500 people gathered to hurl abuse
and missiles at Manchester United and England midfielder David
Beckham.
	   Beckham became the target of a hate campaign when fans blamed
him for England's exit from the World Cup in France after he was
sent off in the team's second-round loss to Argentina.
	   The News of the World newspaper reported a mob threw bottles,
cans and stones at the Manchester United bus as it approached West
Ham's ground before the match.
	   The report said Beckham sat ``grim-faced amid the most vicious
protest against him'' since the World Cup tournament.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Back from the brink, President Laurent
Kabila's quest for regional military support paid off Sunday when
his Angolan allies captured a key rebel stronghold in western
Congo.
	   The rebels acknowledged losing the town, but said they were
continuing their advance on Kinshasa, the capital, and had also
captured the important eastern city of Kisangani.
	   The strategic Angolan victory was a much needed boost for an
embattled Kabila, but it also threatens to transform Congo into a
proxy battlefield for a region-wide war of shifting alliances and
uncertain prospects.
	   With air support and rumbling tanks, Angolan forces drove into
the town of Kitona, near the Atlantic coastline, effectively
cutting off the advancing rebel army from its rear supply base.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' a ministry-level official said on
condition of anonymity. He added that Angola had landed a number of
warplanes at Kinshasa's international airport.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed the
deployment of Angolan troops.
	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Asked earlier Sunday about the Angolan drive toward Kitona,
Mumengi called it a defensive action.
	   Rebel leaders on the other side of the country in the eastern
city of Goma acknowledged the loss of Kitona, but vowed to avenge
the defeat and continue their march toward Kinshasa.
	   Zimbabwean soldiers deployed last week, however, are now helping
to shore up Kinshasa's southern defenses.
	   In the space of several days, the landscape of this, Congo's
second civil war in two years, has dramatically shifted and is fast
expanding into a regional conflict.
	   Rwanda and Uganda _ in support of the rebels _ have repeatedly
warned Zimbabwe and Angola not to get involved.
	   Both countries say they will respond with direct retaliatory
intervention if the Angolans and Zimbabweans don't withdraw.
	   Rwanda last year backed Kabila, as did Uganda, in his bid to
oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. This time around
they are believed to arming and supporting the rebels that seek to
oust Kabila.
	   Zimbabwe, having extended more than dlrs 200 million in military
credits to Congo, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
Angola's involvement may be partially driven by a concern that
Congo's rebels could link up with Angola's UNITA insurgent
movement.
	   Whatever the motivation, Congo's frontlines are becoming
confusingly crowded with regional troops.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, remains away from the capital and holed up at
his residence in the southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's
former rebel stronghold, Information Minister Mumengi said.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who fled to the
rebel side, acknowledged the fall of Kitona _ the first major
setback in a stunning three-week rebel advance on Kinshasa.
	   ``We've made a tactical withdrawal,'' said Karaha, a member of
the rebel political wing, the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
``Kitona is Congo, it will remain Congo. Angola cannot colonize
Congo.''
	   Ironically, Karaha's comments mirror similar statements by
Kabila in recent weeks. He has accused Rwandan Tutsis of using the
rebel movement _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disaffected members of the Kabila's army _ to create a
regional Tutsi empire.
	   Kitona was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   But Karaha said the news was not all bad for the rebels,
claiming rebel fighters had captured Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city. That claim could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa tried
to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria. Two key
leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and his ally, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu were at the meetings.
	   Kabila was represented by his justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo.
	   In Pretoria, rivals from the Congolese crisis sat in separate
rooms as South African officials shuttled between them in an effort
to broker peace, South African radio reported.
	   With the intervention of Angolan forces, however, chances of a
negotiated settlement are ``almost impossible,'' Karaha said.
	   On Saturday, Karaha said his rebels had shot down two warplanes
allied with Kabila's forces.
	   Karaha said the Zimbabwean planes were shot down over rebel
territory in southwestern Congo.
	   Zimbabwe rejected the rebel claims and there has been no
immediate comment from Kinshasa.
	   Karaha said the anti-aircraft attacks Saturday demonstrated the
rebels' resolve to continue fighting as long as outside forces were
involved.

Ukrainian president expects IMF loan, vows to overcome crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine expects the approval of a dlrs 2.2
billion IMF loan next week that would help the country overcome a
financial crisis, President Leonid Kuchma said Sunday.
	   ``That would be a significant moral, political and economic
support,'' Kuchma said of the loan, recommended by a visiting
International Monetary Fund mission last month.
	   Kuchma quoted IMF managing director Michel Camdessus as telling
him in a weekend telephone conversation that ``the IMF shall not
leave Ukraine alone with its problems at this difficult time.''
	   Ukraine is experiencing a deep financial crisis caused by its
massive foreign borrowing, the lack of foreign investors and
inability to collect billions of dollars in tax debts.
	   The crisis has been aggravated by the ruble devaluation in
Russia, which in turn pushed the Ukrainian hryvna down against the
U.S. dollar and raised fears of further investor exodus and damage
to trade with Moscow, Ukraine's principal trade partner.
	   Kuchma, speaking on the eve of Ukraine's Independence Day, vowed
that the former Soviet republic would overcome the crisis, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``There are no grounds to be concerned today, but the ways of
God are not known,'' he said.
	   Kuchma noted that emergency economic decrees issued earlier in
the summer have helped some major investors stay in Ukraine. He
voiced hope for more cooperation with thewmakers, Kuchma said its
leadership ``stands for a constructive cooperation'' with the
government.
	   Parliament speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko said Sunday that any
further talk of a government-parliament confrontation would be
``immoral.''
	   ``The fate of the people should be above political ambitions,''
he said at a festive Independence Day gathering.
	   Tkachenko also spoke vaguely about a national revival program
that would be worked out by Kuchma's government and parliament,
saying his announcement has been coordinated with Kuchma.
	   He did not disclose details of the program, saying only it would
correct the course of reforms so as to stimulate domestic producers
and create new jobs.

More aid workers leave Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with restrictions on bin Laden. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said
Sunday they are restricting the movements of the target of a U.S.
missile attack three days ago, but described it as a security
measure to protect the man.
	   Taliban spokesman Mullah Abdullah, reached on satellite
telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Afghanistan said
for Osama bin Laden would be allowed to travel only ``in
Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and he will be provided security by
Taliban fighters.''
	   ``We are treating him as a guest,'' Abdullah said. ``The
security of Osama is important.''
	   The United States launched missiles Thursday at a target in
eastern Afghanistan said to be a training camp for militants linked
to bin Laden, whom Washington blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   More aid workers fled Afghanistan on Sunday in the wake of the
U.S. attack.
	   Red Cross workers arriving in neighboring Pakistan from the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar refused to speak to reporters as
they bundled enough luggage for a long stay into trucks.
	   Oliver Durr, head of the international Red Cross delegation,
said the reduction of his staff in Kandahar and the Afghan capital
of Kabul was temporary ``pending a change in the situation.''
	   Durr said 18 workers were evacuated Sunday, nine each from
Kandahar and Kabul. It was not immediately clear how many stayed
behind to run Red Cross hospitals in Afghanistan.
	   A day earlier, the body of a U.N. military observer killed
Friday in Kabul was flown to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.
	   Kabul was reported quiet Sunday after anti-Western
demonstrations Saturday. Also Saturday, demonstrators shouting
anti-foreigner slogans destroyed the offices of a medical aid group
in the far western city of Herat. No injuries were reported.
	   The United Nations pulled non-Afghan staff out of several
Afghani cities.
	   The foreign aid workers are leaving behind a country reduced by
years of civil war to one of the poorest and most heavily mined in
the world.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Sarah Russell said her organization's food,
medical and demining programs were continuing under Afghan staff.
But she acknowledged problems could arise as food and medicine ran
out.
	   ``At the moment, people have got enough supplies to keep going.
It's so unpredictable. It's extremely hard to plan,'' Russell said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known, but an
American diplomat who declined to be named described it as a small
incident that had nothing to do with fears of a possible terrorist
attack.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
citizens.
	   The Interior Ministry, in an official statement, said the
policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high wall at the embassy's
rear about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police outside the embassy started
shooting in the air to force him to stop, and after he fired back
with a pistol security officers shot him.
	   A ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity
identified the guards who did the shooting as American, not
Albanian.
	   The policeman had at least two bullet wounds, one near the
heart, and died soon afterward in surgery at a nearby military
hospital, doctors were quoted by Albanian TV as saying.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, a member of a police
unit in charge of security at a Tirana bank.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads, and U.S. Marines
fortified the compound.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday, but the Americans said it was planned and had
nothing to do with the shooting.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An oil spill Sunday at a factory near the
Oder river caused a slick five kilometers (three miles) long,
firefighters said.
	   Three teams of firefighters trained to deal with toxic
substances put up barriers to contain an estimated 20 tons of oil
that leaked at the Rockwool-Polska factory in Cigacice, 430
kilometers (260 miles) west of Warsaw, according to firefighter
spokesman Andrzej Kostrzewa.
	   Firefighters first said they prevented the oil from reaching the
main stream of the river, then later reported some of the oil
escaped and caused the slick.
	   Sylwester Michalak, a firefighting official, said the amount of
oil that escaped into the river was unknown. He said another
barrier was being built downstream from the slick to try to halt
the oil.
	   Most of the spill remained in the factory's reservoirs,
according to Michalak.
	   The factory makes insulation material for houses.

Japanese voters deliver mixed verdict to Obuchi Cabinet in
</HEADLINE>
by-elections

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese voters sent a mixed message Sunday in the
first by-elections since Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office,
as the ruling and main opposition party split a pair of contested
seats, local media reported.
	   Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the rival
Democratic Party of Japan each held onto their respective seats up
for grabs in two rural, typically conservative districts, national
broadcaster NHK reported.
	   The by-elections, held in neighboring prefectures on the Japan
Sea coast, were called after two incumbent lawmakers in the
powerful lower house of Parliament died last month.
	   Some observers had expected the polls to serve as a referendum
on Obuchi's rocky first month in office, which has been dominated
by debate over a controversial plan to bolster the banking system
with taxpayer funds.
	   The ruling party, which has a majority in the lower house,
tapped Obuchi for the prime ministership after it suffered a major
loss in July upper house elections. Two surveys published earlier
this month showed the new Cabinet's public approval rating no
higher than about 25 percent.
	   But that did not prevent the Liberal Democrats from holding onto
their seat in Toyama prefecture.
	   The LDP's Mitsuhiro Miyakoshi, a 47-year old former prefectural
assembly member, beat both the main opposition party-backed
candidate, Masaei Nishio, and the elder brother of the deceased
incumbent, who ran as an independent.
	   The other race, held in Ishikawa prefecture, was won by the
Democratic Party of Japan's Ken Okuda, 39, son of the deceased DPJ
incumbent. Okuda bested Masao Okabe, a 65-year old former

 &UR; Palestinian family blames infant's death on Israeli-imposed curfew &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian parents of a three-month old
baby charged Sunday that their child died because Israeli troops
maintaining a curfew refused to let them seek medical treatment for
their son.
	   Some 30,000 Palestinian residents living in Hebron under Israeli
rule have been under curfew since Thursday, after a Jewish settler
was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant. Residents are not
allowed to leave their homes.
	   Dr. Ziad Ashab at the Aliya Hospital in Hebron, where baby Qusai
Sultan arrived dead late Saturday night, examined the body and said
the boy died of respiratory and lung infections. If the infant had
arrived at the hospital sooner, ``he may have survived,'' Ashab
said.
	   The baby's mother, Shireen, said her son, one of a set of
triplets, was suffering from influenza when she decided to take him
to the hospital.
	   She said she pleaded with soldiers but they refused to let her
travel through the city, halting her at a checkpoint outside her
home. Her son died at the checkpoint, she said.
	   ``It's inhumane and a terrible thing to prevent a baby from
going to the hospital, it breaks my heart,'' she told reporters,
weeping.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman's office said it had
no knowledge of the death of a baby but stressed that ``soldiers at
road blocks are under strict instructions to tend to medical
emergencies without delay.''
	   The baby boy was laid to rest later Sunday in a vineyard owned
by the family, and the grave was covered with fresh flowers.
	   Israel still controls 20 percent of this tense West Bank city,
where 30,000 Palestinians live in a climate of constant friction
with 500 Jewish settlers. The Palestinian Authority controls the
other 80 percent of the city.

Kabila opponent offers to broker talks with rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's key political
adversary, Etienne Tshisekedi, offered Sunday to broker peace talks
between the government and rebel forces.
	   Speaking for the first time since the rebel war against Kabila
began, Tshisekedi told reporters in Kinshasa he was willing to
mediate discussions between Kabila and the rebel's political wing,
the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   ``We ask President Kabila and the other parties to give their
troops an order to immediately cease this fighting,'' he said.
	   He offered to meet with Kabila in the southern city of
Lubumbashi, where the president has been holed up at his residence
for the past week. He has not yet spoken with Kabila, but said he
may try to go to Lubumbashi on Sunday evening.
	   ``I'm ready to meet President Kabila as soon as possible, after
that I will do the same for our other brothers that are in Goma,''
where the rebels are based, he said.
	   The government did not immediately respond to the offer.
	   A coalition ethnic Tutsi fighters and disenchanted members of
Kabila's military revolted earlier this month and have vowed to
drive Kabila from power.
	   The rebels have marched to within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of
the capital, Kinshasa, but are facing growing resistance now that
Kabila has deployed allied forces from Angola and Zimbabwe.
	   ``We believe from the start that this is strictly an internal
political problem,'' he said of the rebel war. ``We don't have the
right to send our Congolese sons to their deaths.''
	   It was a surprise move by Tshisekedi, who has accused Kabila of
being no better for Congo than longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   Asked why he was willing to help Kabila and the rebels find
common ground, he said his motivation was to save lives.
	   ``If the departure of Kabila comes at the cost of Congolese
lives, we oppose it,'' he said.
	   Mobutu, who ruled the former Zaire for 32 years, crippled this
vast central African country with rampant corruption, mismanagement
and nepotism.
	   After Mobutu's ouster by Kabila, Tshisekedi urged the new leader
to implement political and democratic reforms.
	   Kabila responded by arresting Tshisekedi and sending him into
internal exile for five months. Several members of Tshisekedi's
political party, the Union for Democratic and Social Progress, have
also been imprisoned.
	   After coming to power last year, Kabila banned all opposition
political activity for two years.

	   Chernomyrdin, a Soviet-style bureaucrat who once headed the
national gas monopoly, Gazprom, has busied himself since being
fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin _ a relatively bland
and conservative figure strongly associated with an unpopular
administration _ could win, although he could probably count on
support from at least part of the business and banking
establishment.
	   The announcement came by surprise on a day when Kiriyenko had
been busy holding meetings to work out measures to save Russia's
banking system from default.
	   Yeltsin delivered the news in a tersely worded announcement from
his press service. He did not give any reasons, although he has
been under increasing pressure from parliament to replace the
government.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of

officials indicated it appeared to have nothing to do with fears of
a possible terrorist attack.

of a particular person, although we are concerned about threats at

U.S. Arab allies indirectly criticize U.S. air strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Some of Washington's main Arab allies on
Sunday indirectly criticized last week's U.S. military strikes on
two Muslim states, stressing the fight against world terrorism
should be carried out through the United Nations.
	   Both Kuwait's Cabinet and Egypt's foreign minister made the
point, but did not directly mention the attacks that the United
States conducted on its own last Thursday against alleged terrorist
targets.
	   Also Sunday, Middle East opponents of Washington _ including
Iraq, Libya and Iran _ renewed their harangue against the American
strikes on a Sudanese factory and the bases of millionaire Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   In announcing the attacks, President Clinton blamed bin Laden
for the Aug. 7 attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
which killed 257 people, and said there was evidence of more
threatened attacks on U.S. interests. He said the Sudanese factory
made chemical weapons agents; Sudan said it makes only medicines.
	   In Kuwait, the statement from the Cabinet urged the world
community to battle terrorism ``within the framework of the United
Nations ... and to intensive all cooperative efforts.''
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, asked on a trip to Syria
about the U.S. military action, also said the United Nations should
have the responsibility to lead the battle against terrorism.
	   ``It is well known we should deal with terrorism by ... letting
the Security Council exercise its role in the context of
international legitimacy,'' Moussa was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
	   Kuwait and Egypt, which rarely criticize the United States
directly, issued their statements only after many Arabs had spoken
out against the attacks. Two other Arab allies of Washington _
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain _ have yet to issue official statements on
the raids.
	   Egypt's upper house of parliament said Sunday that Arab public
opinion should be considered in the battle against terrorism.
	   ``The world powers should follow well balanced policies ... so
that the methods of dealing with terrorism will not trigger
inappropriate reactions in public opinion,'' said the statement by
the Shura Council.
	   Meanwhile, newspapers in Iraq and officials in Libya and Iran
kept up criticism of the United States.
	   Iran's President Mohammad Khatami _ who recently has tried to
ease bitter U.S.-Iranian relations _ was quoted by Iran's news
agency as saying Washington should be condemned for using the
embassy bombings as ``a pretext'' for Thursday's strikes.
	   The agency said he made the statement in a telephone call
Saturday with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the whole world saw the U.S.
strikes as ``a bid to cover up Clinton's Monica-gate scandal'' _ a
reference to the U.S. leader's relationship with former White House
aide Monica Lewinsky.
	   Gadhafi also said the United States has itself to blame for bin
Laden's actions since it gave financial and military support to him
and other Muslim warriors in the 1980s war to drive Soviets forces
out of Afghanistan.
	   ``It was the United States which created bin Laden and gave him
the training camps in ... Afghanistan,'' Gadhafi told Libyan
reporters, according to the Egyptian news agency MENA.
	   Gadhafi added Washington's ``plot backfired on it'' when the
so-called Arab Afghans returned to their own countries and began to
fight U.S. policies.

Odessa elections cap months of political turmoil in Ukrainian port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ODESSA, Ukraine (AP) - Residents of this major Ukrainian Black
Sea city voted Sunday in municipal elections capping months of
violence and political turmoil.
	   Nearly 50 candidates planned to run, but the final number stood
at 33 as many have voluntarily withdrawn from the race and others
were invalidated by the electoral commission.
	   Turnout was a low 8 percent as of mid-day and observers noted
that fine weather drew many residents out of the city, a former
Soviet resort gem that has been hit by Ukraine's economic decline
and sea pollution.
	   The election was preceded by an attempt to elect a mayor last
March, when incumbent Eduard Hurvits beat regional administration
chief Ruslan Bodelan, his long-time rival and an ally of President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   The often turbulent campaign included several outbreaks of
violence such as kidnappings and shootings, and the two rivals
accused each other of having links to organized crime.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court then invalidated the election results,
and Kuchma then dismissed Hurvits and Bodelan. The president has
sent a senior Cabinet official to head the Odessa city government
until Sunday's election.
	   Full control over Odessa, one of Ukraine's major business
centers and the site of a key oil export terminal, is vital for the
central government, which wants to use the port to transport
Caspian Sea oil to Europe.
	   In the current race, the city election commission has refused to
register Hurvits, now a lawmaker in the new Ukrainian parliament,
but did register his rival Bodelan, who is considered among the top
candidates to win. Government auditors, meanwhile, have accused
Hurvits' former administration of financial wrongdoings.
	   At an electoral rally in Odessa earlier this week, Hurvits
called on city residents to vote for Oleksiy Kostusev, a lawmaker
who came in second in the 1994 municipal elections and is presently
considered Bodelan's most serious rival, Ukrainian newspapers
reported.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and the rest of his government on Sunday and said
he was reappointing former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   The surprise announcement came as the inexperienced Kiriyenko
and his government were struggling to overcome one of Russia's

	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Habib ur Rehman went to
neighboring Afghanistan to live under what he calls an ``exemplary
Islamic government.'' Sunday he was back in his homeland being
treated for wounds received in the U.S. attack on Afghanistan, and
appeared even more committed to an extremist brand of Islam.
	   Hard-line Islamic groups in Pakistan are a tiny minority in the
otherwise moderate Muslim country. But they are gaining strength
from the like-minded Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan.
	   Rehman denied he had been receiving military training in the
camp hit by U.S. missiles Thursday night, though others there
acknowledged it was a school for armed Islamic militants. The U.S.
said its attack was aimed at installations of Osama bin Laden, an
anti-American Saudi dissident accused of sponsoring terrorist
attacks around the world. Bin Laden, treated as an honored guest by
the Taliban, has been reported unharmed.
	   ``Thank God bin Laden is safe,'' Rehman said. ``The Taliban
government is an exemplary Islamic government. That's why I went
there, to live under them and see how they organize things.''
	   The Pakistani border city of Peshawar is a meeting point for
Afghans and Pakistanis. It has seen the largest and most violent
anti-American protests in the wake of the U.S. missile attacks.
	   Muslim schools in and around Peshawar run by conservative
Pakistani groups were the breeding ground for the Taliban militia
that has swept across Afghanistan since 1994. The Afghan refugee
camps in the area are another source of fundamentalist thought.
	   Many Pakistanis, even those not allied with any of the
fundamentalist groups, have been angered at the U.S. attack on a
Muslim neighbor. The attacks have prompted daily anti-American
protests throughout Pakistan.
	   In Islamabad on Sunday, about 400 protesters converged on the
commercial district of Abpara to chant anti-American slogans and
denounce the attack.
	   The Taliban ``have brought peace to Afghanistan. They are
determined to enforce sharia (Islamic) law on Afghanistan,'' said
Mohammed Ibrahim, head of the Peshawar office of Jamaat-i-Islami, a
small but growing political party in Pakistan.
	   In Pakistan, years of economic mismanagement and corruption has
shaken faith in politics, making the Islamic parties' promises of
order attractive. Ibrahim said he was inspired by the Taliban's
success in Afghanistan.
	   ``Our goal is the establishment of an Islamic state in
Pakistan,'' said Ibrahim. He praised the Taliban for instituting
measures like cutting off the hands of thieves, but said they
should allow girls to be educated.
	   ``During the last three-four years, I've seen a number of
religious schools popping up in Peshawar,'' said Mohammed Tahir,
one of the city's shopkeepers. ``The entire culture of Peshawar is
changing. Our women are now frightened to go out without a burqa
(head-to-toe veil). Our society is a conservative society, but it
hadn't been like this before.''
	   Afrasyab Khattak, a human rights activist in Peshawar, said
Pakistanis on his side of the border and Afghans on the other have
a common linguistic, ethnic and religious heritage. He says that
culture did not politicize Islam before the Afghan war against
Soviet invaders and Soviet-backed communist governments in Kabul.
Then, oil-rich, rightist Arabs joined with the United States to
back anti-Soviet Afghans.
	   ``Communism came with the ruble. This political Islam came with
dollars and petro-dollars,'' Khattak said.

Court sentenced 11 dissidents to prison terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Eleven dissidents received prison terms
from 5 to 10 years on Sunday after a court convicted them of
subversion, the official news agency reported.
	   The court found the leading accused, former army captain
Khojmali el-Mubarak Khojali, guilty of belonging to an illegal
organization, waging war against the government and disloyalty to
the state, the Sudan News Agency said.
	   The judge sentenced Khojali and one other accomplice to 10 years
in prison. The other nine defendants received sentences of five
years.
	   All 11 were found to be members of the umbrella organization of
Sudanese opposition parties, the National Democratic Alliance which
is based in Asmara, Eritrea. The alliance seeks to topple the
military-backed, Islamic fundamentalist government of President
Omar el-Bashir.
	   The court acquitted four accused and discharged a fifth on
grounds of his advanced age, the agency said.
	   The state prosecutor told the agency the sentences were lenient
``in view of the crimes they committed.'' But he did not say if he
would appeal the sentence. Both sides have one month in which to
file an appeal.
	   In June, the government accused exile leaders of planting bombs
at several sites in Khartoum, set to explode during celebrations of
the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military coup that overthrew the
democratically-elected government.
	   The main guerrilla force in the alliance, the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the southern provinces, whose inhabitants are predominantly
Christian and animist, from the Islamic north.

Jewish settlers and Palestinians clash, protests over U.S. strikes

	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets of
Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinians,
some children, went on for several hours Sunday even as an Israeli
army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired towards Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as they attempted to
cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the city. At the
checkpoint, a group of 30 Palestinian children, some as young as
five years-old, threw stones towards the Israeli troops, who
responded by firing rubber bullets and a stun grenade.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the stone throwers,
pushing them back out of range of the Israelis. No injuries were
reported.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Yasser Arafat, president
of the Palestinian Authority, to condemn Thursday's fatal stabbing
of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   The statement said that it was the policy of Netanyahu's
government to strengthen and develop the Jewish area in Hebron,
including Tel Romeida, where the stabbing took place Thursday
night. It said permits would be issued for permanent housing to
replace mobile homes at the site.
	   Arafat's aide said the decision would only hurt the peace
process.
	   ``We think that this decision may increase the tension in the
Hebron area. The Israeli government should begin the political
separation of Israel from the West Bank as a step forward to rescue
the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeneh told the AP.

Cuba wins most medals in Central American and Caribbean Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ Cuba easily won the most medals in
the 18th Central American and Caribbean Games, which ended this
weekend in the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo.
	   Cuba earned 190 gold medals, 74 silver medals and 69 bronze
medals for a total of 323.
	   Still, Cuba's showing did not match its even more impressive
performance five years ago in the Puerto Rican city of Ponce, when
it won 227 gold medals.
	   Mexico ended up in second place with 61 gold medals and
Venezuela in third with 56 golds.
	   Colombia, with 19 gold medals, took fourth place, and Puerto
Rico, with 11, was in fifth place when the games ended Saturday.
	   The next Central American and Caribbean Games will be held in
San Salvador in 2002.

Buffaloes best Fighters 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Kintetsu Buffaloes defeated the Nippon Ham
Fighters 3-2 Sunday at the Tokyo Dome, helped by a game-tying solo
home run from former Boston Red Sox slugger Phil Clark in the sixth
inning.
	   Clark's effort was followed by Takayuki Murakamai's game-winning
homer in the ninth inning, giving Kintestu pitcher Masaki Maki the
win and trimming Nippon Ham's lead over the Buffaloes to just half
a game.
	   As recently as a month ago, the Fighters were ahead of Kintetsu
by 10 games in the Pacific League standings.
	   Elsewhere in the Pacific League, an RBI single in the fourth
inning by Troy Neel, formerly of the Oakland Athletics, propelled
the Orix BlueWave to a 4-0 win at home in Kobe over the Seibu
Lions.
	   The Daiei Hawks defeated the last placed Lotte Marines 3-1 in a
Chiba game which saw Hawks outfielder Akihito Muramatsu drive in
two runs on a single and sacrifice.
	   In the Central League, South Korean pitcher Sun Dong-yol
snatched the last four outs for his 21st save as the Chunichi
Dragons savored a 4-1 victory over the Yokohama BayStars. The
Dragons starting hurler Shiheki Noguchi took the win after allowing
only one run in eight innings.
	   Meanwhile, the Hanshin Tigers topped the Yakult Swallows 2-1 at
the Osaka Dome, thanks in part to a sixth inning homer hit by
former Chicago Cub Dave Hansen.
	   In other Central League action, the Yomiuri Giants stomped the
Hiroshima Carp 11-8 as Shinichi Murata drilled home a grand slam to
cap an eight-run fifth inning for the Giants. Relieving pitcher
Kazutaka Nishiyama took the win in the game, which was played in
Hiroshima.

Dozens more crosses erected near Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) _ Despite calls by church officials to
stop, conservative Catholics erected dozens more crosses Sunday
next to the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz.
	   The new crosses, some of them hand-carved, were certain to anger
Jewish leaders who want all crosses removed from the site,
including an eight-meter (26-foot) papal cross that has stood there
for almost a decade.
	   Most of the more than 50 crosses put up Sunday were four meters
(about 13 feet) tall and increased the total number of crosses in
the field bordering Auschwitz to well over 100.
	   Among those erecting the crosses was a group that identified
itself as a nationalist skinhead group from Wroclaw, about 200
kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Auschwitz in southern Poland.
	   Conservative Catholics inspired by religious activist Kazimierz
Switon began putting up the additional crosses late last month in a
campaign to prevent the larger papal cross from being moved because
of protests by Jewish groups.
	   The tall cross, which is from a Mass celebrated by Polish-born
Pope John Paul II in 1979 at the nearby Birkenau death camp, can be
seen from inside Auschwitz. Jewish groups complain it disturbs the
memory of the more than 1 million Jews who died at Auschwitz and
Birkenau.
	   But Poles, particularly conservative Catholics, say the tall
cross is a memorial to 152 Poles shot to death on the property in
1941.
	   Earlier this year, Jewish groups refused to sign a dlrs 93.5
million development plan for Auschwitz-Birkenau because of the
papal cross. Fearing the cross would be moved, Switon held a hunger
strike in June at the property, a former Carmelite monastery now
leased to a conservative war victims' group.
	   When the smaller crosses started appearing at the site in late
July, Jewish groups in Israel and United States protested. Catholic
church officials initially rejected the protests, then reversed
themselves and called those putting up more crosses irresponsible.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government has terminated the lease
of the war victims' group, setting up a court challenge over legal
control of the property.
	   The government has said only the church can decide what to do
about religious symbols, showing its reluctance to challenge the
church in Poland, where more than 90 percent of the population is
Catholic.
	   Church leaders were scheduled to meet this week to discuss the
issue.

Siemens, Motorola said to seek mobile phone venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German electronics company Siemens wants to
join forces in mobile telephone production with U.S. rival
Motorola, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, Sony Corp. is considering giving up its cooperation
with Siemens in mobile phone development, another report said.
	   Siemens couldn't be reached for comment. The company announced
major plans to improve profitability in April.
	   The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said Siemens is losing money in
mobile phone production and that bringing its two factories into a
joint venture with Motorola's six would cut development costs and
raise sales.
	   Currently, Siemens provides design and technology for Sony
mobile phones for the European market, Der Spiegel magazine said.
	   Now, with its own research and development center nearing
completion in Germany and a factory in France, Sony thinks it can
stand on its own feet, the magazine said.

Tommi Makinen wins Rally Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JYVASKYLA, Finland (AP) _ Tommi Makinen kept his slim hopes
alive of retaining the world rally championship by beating overall
leader Carlos Sainz by 35.6 seconds to win the Rally Finland for
the fifth straight time Sunday.
	   Makinen, a two-time defending champion from Finland, completed
the three-day, 24-stage event in 3 hours, 16 minutes, 56.1 seconds.
The Mitsubishi driver now trails Sainz by nine points with three
rallies left in the series at San Remo (Italy), Australia and the
RAC in Britain.
	   It was the second time this year Makinen beat Sainz in a
Scandinavian world championship event, having defeated the Spanish
Toyota driver by 52 seconds in the Swedish winter rally six months
ago.
	   ``It was easier than I expected,'' Makinen said. ``Sure, five
straight wins here is a record and very special, but most important
for me is the overall title.''
	   Sainz, a former two-time world champion, became the winningest
driver last month when he captured the Rally of New Zealand for his
22nd world championship victory.
	   ``This result is very important for the overall,'' he said.
``With Colin McRae withdrawing on day one I managed to get a
nine-point lead in the standings. But three rallies remain and a
lot of things can still happen.''
	   McRae, a Scotsman, had to abandon the rally during Friday's
first stage with a broken rear strut and now shares second overall
with Makinen at 38 points.
	   Juha Kankkunen, a former world champion driving on familiar
gravel roads in central Finland, placed third in a Ford, 45.2
seconds back. Didier Auriol of France was fourth in a Toyota,
2:29.2 behind the winner. Kankkunen is third overall (31 points)
and Auriol fifth (30).

Ayala suffers first career defeat to Tatsuyoshi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ In a fight stopped by the commission
doctor midway through, Japan's Joichiro Tatsuyoshi defended his WBC
bantamweight title against hitherto unbeaten Paulie Ayala.
	   The doctor stopped the fight after a head butt by the Texan _
ruled as intentional _ cut the champ's right eyelid in the sixth
round.
	   Two judges saw the fight 59-55, while the third also favored
Tatsuyoshi by a 58-56 margin.
	   ``I want a rematch,'' Ayala asked Tatsuyoshi while shaking hands
and hugging. ``Yes, of course,'' the champion promised before
leaving the ring.
	   It was Tatsuyoshi's second defense of the title he won from
Thailand's Sirimongkol Nakornthorn-Parkview last November. The
Japanese boxer once held the crown three years earlier before his
career was threatened by a retina injury he suffered while
fighting.
	   Tatsuyoshi now has 17 wins, including 12 knockouts, four defeats
and a draw. It was the first loss for Ayala, who has won 25 fights,
11 by knockouts.
	   In another title bout, Mexican Cesar Bazan defeated challenger
Hiroyuki Sakamoto of Japan and retained his WBC lightweight title
in a unanimous decision.
	   There were no knockdowns throughout the 12-rounder.
	   Sakamoto never backpedaled, hurting the champion in the sixth
and the 10th rounds. But the taller and faster Bazan was in control
otherwise, often landing solid punches on his opponent while
side-stepping and dancing away.
	   It was Bazan's first defense of the title he won in June from
Stevie Johnston of Denver, Colorado.
	   Bazan has won 33 fights, 23 by knockouts, against two defeats
and a draw. Sakamoto suffered his third defeat to go with 30
victories, including 22 knockouts.
	   In the day's third fight, second-ranked contender Wandee Chareon
of Thailand won a decision over Japan-based Lin ming-jia of Taiwan
to win the WBC strawweight interim championship.
	   Wandee, 18, was in control throughout, troubling the 31-year-old
top-ranked contender with straights, hooks and body blows.
	   The interim championship allows top-ranked contenders to take a
crack at a world crown when a champion fails to defend his title
for an extended period of time.
	   The strawweight title was held by Ricardo Lopez of Mexico.
	   Lin said after the match he will retire from competition as he
has reached his physical limits.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known, but an
American diplomat who declined to be named described it as a small
incident that had nothing to do with fears of a possible terrorist
attack.
	   ``We have reason to believe that this was an isolated incident
of a particular person, although we are concerned about threats at
all our embassies and Tirana is clearly one of them,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told ABC-TV.

Manuela Machado wins marathon setting championship record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with German Riedel winning the discus &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new
European Championships record and clocked her best time ever in
winning the marathon Sunday in 2 hours 27 minutes 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world champion who
still holds the world record of 74.08 set in 1986, gained silver at
66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.
	   On a cool but sunny morning, Machado steadily pulled away in the
last 15 kilometers to add another gold to her collection. She was
the 1995 world champion and twice world silver medalist and is
another in a long line of strong Portuguese distance runners.
	   Biktagirova, 33, is a former Los Angeles marathon winner and
finished fourth in the '92 Olympics but was disqualified and given
a three-month ban after testing positive for stimulants.
	   Viceconte has had more success at half marathons and this is her
first medal in a major event.
	   On Saturday, Heike Drechsler, 33, became only the third to win
four consecutive titles in the same event, taking the long jump in
7.16 meters. Fourth in last year's worlds, Drechsler edged out '96
Olympic silver medalist Fiona May (7.11) of Italy and world
champion Luydmila Galkina (7.06) of Russia.
	   The jump was also No. 4 on the world list behind three by
American Marion Jones, who has a best of 7:31.
	   ``This was maybe for me the hardest win,'' said the 33-year-old
German, who is coming back after surgery almost a year ago on both
Achilles tendons.
	   ``I had three really hard years,'' she added. ``I wanted to come
back. It was a really hard thing for me. I had to work very hard
for this gold.''
	   Britain's Colin Jackson, 31, also won his third consecutive
European gold, clocking 13.02 in both the finals and semifinals of
the 110 hurdles.
	   It was the No. 3 time in the world this season behind Americans
Allen Johnson (12.98) and Mark Crear (13.00) for the world
record-holder (12.91) and former world champion.
	   ``It's strange that I had to come here and re-establish
myself,'' he said. ``This one has got to be high on my list of
achievements.''
	   After five days, Britain leads with six gold medals and 11
overall. Russia has five gold and 17 overall and Germany has won
four gold and a total of 16.
	   Britain picked up two more gold medals to go with Jackson's as
Denise Lewis, world silver medalist, won the heptathlon with 6,559
points. Britain's 4X100 men also got gold in 38.52 as 100-meter
champion Darren Campbell and 200 champion Doug Walker picked up
their second golds.
	   European 100 champion Christine Arron of France also got gold in
the 4X100 as she anchored and blew by Russian anchor Irina
Privalova _ the 200 gold-medalist _ to victory. France clocked
42.59.
	   In the pole vault, Russian Maksim Tarasov took advantage of
Sergei Bubka's absence and added a European gold to '92 his Olympic
gold with a jump of 5.81.
	   Spain, which got gold Thursday in the 1,500 with Reyes Estevez,
was 1-2 in the 5,000 and Isaac Viciosa clocked 13:37.46 and Manuel
Pancorbo finished in 13:38.03.
	   The men's marathon was 1-2-3 for Italy with Stefano Baldini
clocking 2:12:01 followed by Danilo Goffi (2:12:11) and Vincenzo
Modica (2:12:53). Spaniards took the next three places.
	   In the first European women's hammer, the world's top two
throwers all season dominated with gold for Mihaela Melinte of
Romania (71.57) and silver for Olga Kuzenkova of Russia (69.28).

	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Habib ur Rehman went to
neighboring Afghanistan to live under what he calls an ``exemplary
Islamic government.'' Sunday he was back in his homeland being
treated for wounds received in the U.S. attack on Afghanistan, and
appeared even more committed to an extremist brand of Islam.
	   Hard-line Islamic groups in Pakistan are a tiny minority in the
otherwise moderate Muslim country. But they are gaining strength
from the like-minded Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan.
	   Rehman denied he had been receiving military training in the
camp hit by U.S. missiles Thursday night, though others there
acknowledged it was a school for armed Islamic militants. The U.S.
said its attack was aimed at installations of Osama bin Laden, an
anti-American Saudi dissident accused of sponsoring terrorist
attacks around the world. Bin Laden, treated as an honored guest by
the Taliban, has been reported unharmed.
	   ``Thank God bin Laden is safe,'' Rehman said. ``The Taliban
government is an exemplary Islamic government. That's why I went
there, to live under them and see how they organize things.''
	   The Pakistani border city of Peshawar is a meeting point for
Afghans and Pakistanis. It has seen the largest and most violent
anti-American protests in the wake of the U.S. missile attacks.
	   Muslim schools in and around Peshawar run by conservative
Pakistani groups were the breeding ground for the Taliban militia
that has swept across Afghanistan since 1994. The Afghan refugee
camps in the area are another source of fundamentalist thought.
	   Many Pakistanis, even those not allied with any of the
fundamentalist groups, have been angered at the U.S. attack on a
Muslim neighbor. The attacks have prompted daily anti-American
protests throughout Pakistan.
	   In Islamabad, about 400 protesters converged on the commercial
district of Abpara to chant anti-American slogans and denounce the
attack. Near the border with Afghanistan 5,000 protesters, led by a
Taliban official, condemned the attack and vowed retaliation
against the United States.
	   The attack has injected new anti-American fervor into the more
extremists Islamic groups in Pakistan. In the northern city of
Saidu Sharif, several hard-line groups met to call for a ``jihad,''
or holy war, against the United States.

Yeltsin fires Kiriyenko, reappoints Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Duma reaction, background on devaluation,
Yeltsin due back from vacation &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and the rest of his government on Sunday and named
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting head of the
government.
	   The surprise announcement came as the 35-year-old Kiriyenko and
his government were struggling to overcome one of Russia's worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   Yeltsin had fired Chernomyrdin and appointed Kiriyenko in March,
saying Russia needed new ideas and fresh leadership. Kiriyenko had
barely been ratified when Russia's economy went into a tailspin, a
victim of plunging world oil prices and the Asian economic crisis.
	   Since then, the young prime minister had been waging a losing
battle to shore up the economy. He worked tirelessly to defend the
national currency, the ruble, negotiate loans with Western lenders
and push reform measures through a hostile parliament dominated by
communists and their allies.
	   Last week, the government conceded defeat in the fight to save
the ruble, announcing Monday that it was effectively devaluing the
currency by allowing its value to slip by up to 34 percent against
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Friday, all factions of the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, including those usually supportive of the government,
had demanded Kiriyenko's resignation. The Duma also passed a
resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Chernomyrdin, a Soviet-style bureaucrat who once headed the
national gas monopoly, Gazprom, has busied himself since being
fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin _ a relatively bland
and conservative figure strongly associated with an unpopular
administration _ could win, although he could probably count on
support from at least part of the business and banking
establishment.
	   The announcement of the change in governments came unexpectedly
on a day when Kiriyenko had been busy holding meetings to work out
measures to save Russia's banking system from default.
	   Yeltsin, who is scheduled to end a much criticized five-week
vacation on Monday, delivered the news in a tersely worded
announcement from his press service. He did not give any reasons,
although he has been under increasing pressure from parliament to
replace the government.

Jewish settlers and Palestinians clash, protests over U.S. strikes

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets of
Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinians,
some children, went on for several hours Sunday even as an Israeli
army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired toward Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as they attempted to
cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the city. At the
checkpoint, a group of 30 Palestinian children, some as young as
five years old, threw stones toward the Israeli troops, who
responded by firing rubber bullets and a stun grenade.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the stone throwers,
pushing them out of range of the Israelis. No injuries were
reported.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to denounce Thursday's fatal stabbing of Rabbi Shlomo
Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   The statement said the government would strengthen the Jewish
area in Hebron. It said permits would be issued for permanent
housing to replace mobile homes at the site of the Thursday night
stabbing.
	   Arafat's aide said the decision would only hurt the peace
process.
	   ``We think that this decision may increase the tension in the
Hebron area. The Israeli government should begin the political
separation of Israel from the West Bank as a step forward to rescue
the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated Press.

French poll: Diana leads lineup of women of the century
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French poll says half the country thinks Princess
Diana was the woman who most deeply marked the 20th century,
followed by Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Grace
of Monaco.
	   Nearly a year after her death in a car crash in Paris, Diana was
picked by 49 percent of those polled by the IPSOS agency. The late
First Lady Jaqueline Kennedy and screen siren Miss Monroe both
received 13 percent, followed by 11 percent for Princess Grace.
	   Among 44 percent of those polled, Diana is best-known for her
humanitarian activities, 27 percent remembered her best as a modern
woman in search of freedom and 14 percent as a princess unlucky in
love, the survey said.
	   Fifty percent said they would think of Diana on Aug. 31, the
anniversary of her death. Among women, the figure was 60 percent
and among men it was 40 percent, said the poll for the society
magazine Gala.
	   But only 21 percent said they would visit the so-called
``Dianaland,'' the nickname for the princess' gravesite and museum
in England, if they had the chance.
	   The poll Aug. 13 and 14 questioned a nationally representative
sampling of 1,002 French adults. No margin of error was given, but
French polls of that size usually have an error margin of plus or
minus 2-3 percent.

 &UR; Palestinian family blames infant's death on Israeli-imposed curfew
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian parents of a three-month old
baby charged Sunday that their child died because Israeli troops
maintaining a curfew refused to let them seek medical treatment for
their son.
	   Some 30,000 Palestinian residents living in Hebron under Israeli
rule have been under curfew since Thursday, after a Jewish settler
was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant. Residents are not
allowed to leave their homes.
	   Dr. Ziad Ashab at the Aliya Hospital in Hebron, where baby Qusai
Sultan arrived dead late Saturday night, examined the body and said
the boy died of respiratory and lung infections. If the infant had
arrived at the hospital sooner, ``he may have survived,'' Ashab
said.
	   The baby's mother, Shireen, said her son, one of a set of
triplets, was suffering from influenza when she decided to take him
to the hospital.
	   She said she pleaded with soldiers but they refused to let her
travel through the city, halting her at a checkpoint outside her
home. Her son died at the checkpoint, she said.
	   ``It's inhumane and a terrible thing to prevent a baby from
going to the hospital, it breaks my heart,'' she told reporters,
weeping.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman's office said it had
no knowledge of the death of a baby but stressed that ``soldiers at
road blocks are under strict instructions to tend to medical
emergencies without delay.''
	   The baby boy was laid to rest later Sunday in a vineyard owned
by the family, and the grave was covered with fresh flowers.
	   Israel still controls 20 percent of this tense West Bank city,
where 30,000 Palestinians live in a climate of constant friction
with 500 Jewish settlers. The Palestinian Authority controls the
other 80 percent of the city.

In annual speech, prime minister outlines difficulties for
</HEADLINE>
Singapore
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In a sobering state-of-the-nation address,
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong warned Sunday that Singapore is
sliding into a recession and defended his government from
allegations that it is hurting the interests of its Southeast Asian
neighbors.
	   ``We are in for some very tough times'' said Goh, to open the
English portion of his speech. ``Matters are likely to get worse
before they get better.''
	   As Singapore struggles to keep its economy afloat, ties with
neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have become more strained than
ever, adding to the mood of uncertainty in the prosperous island
republic.
	   ``Steering through this storm to safety is Singapore's biggest
challenge since I became prime minister eight years ago,'' said Goh
in the live telecast on national TV.
	   Goh devoted part of his speech to parrying accusations that it
was rejoicing in neighboring Malaysia's economic woes and doing its
best to aggravate its problems.
	   ``Recently, Malaysian newspapers have carried absurd allegations
that Singapore is happy that Malaysia is experiencing economic
difficulties, and that we are sabotaging them or even stealing
their cargoes,'' said Goh. ``They are totally wrong.''
	   Goh pointed out that the countries' economies are closely
intertwined and stressed that when Malaysia has serious problems,
Singapore is also damaged.
	   Malaysia's ``apparent lack of understanding of how the markets
work has also complicated our relations,'' said Goh. Malaysia has
accused Singapore banks of luring away Malaysian dollars by
offering higher interest rates.
	   Goh said the city-state has tried to help Malaysia where it
could. He said his government has held onto several billion
Malaysian dollars of its foreign reserves ``even though we could
see (their currency) steadily depreciating.''
	   He urged the two countries, which have diverse ethnic make ups
and which separated in 1965 after race riots and political
differences, to ``deal with the difficulties rationally and
soberly.''
	   Goh expressed similar concerns over relations with its other
large neighbor, Indonesia.
	   Widespread unrest which targeted the Chinese minority and
eventually overthrew the government are a major concern for tiny
Singapore, which is predominantly Chinese. Goh noted that ``there
were Singaporean victims of the May riot.''
	   Tensions with Indonesia also worsened after former
Vice-President B.J. Habibie assumed leadership. Habibie has accused
more prosperous Singapore of not doing enough to help his huge
country, which is in the grips of its worst economic crisis in
modern history.
	   ``Singapore will help Indonesia within the limits of our
ability,'' countered Goh. But he cautioned that ``we are only three
million people... Where is the capacity to help 211 million
people'' in Indonesia?
	   But Goh praised Habibie's acknowledgement of the crimes against
ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, along with his ``new policy of
openness... (which has) increased the credibility of Indonesia's
reforms.''
	   Goh said Singapore will continue to offer humanitarian aid in
addition to its contributions to the bailout package orchestrated
by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Outlining policies to boost the economy, Goh stressed the need
for more competitive business costs in Singapore through lower
government charges, taxes, wages and land costs.
	   Improved business operating efficiency was also important for
Singapore, which profits from sizable foreign investment because of
its world-class sea port, airport and other infrastructure, said
Goh.
	   But Goh said recovery will be a long and painful process over
the next two years.
	   ``We cannot wish away these external problems'' even though
Singapore will likely recover before its neighbors, he said.

Six former top officials arrested in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The former defense minister and five
other former high-ranking officials were arrested Sunday and
charged with crimes against humanity during the chaos that followed
the collapse of pyramid schemes last year, the prosecutor's office
said.
	   Among those arrested were former Defense Minister Safet Zhulali,
former deputy chief of the secret service Bujar Rama and former
Interior Minister Halit Shamata.
	   The other three were the State Control Minister Blerim Cela;
Sokol Mulosmanaj, the police chief of Vlora, the town where the
anti-government actions started last year, and an army commander,
Kreshnik Lusha.
	   The statement said that in cooperation with each other, they
committed crimes against humanity that resulted in the destruction
of the Albanian state and the deaths of thousands of people.
	   Public discontent following the collapse of the pyramid schemes,
in which most Albanians lost their life savings, led to insurgency
during which more than 2,000 people lost their lives.
	   A million guns were looted from army depots, and the army and
police deserted.
	   All those arrested were members of the Democratic Party of
former President Sali Berisha. Three were members of parliament.
	   Berisha told reporters Sunday that the arrests were politically
motivated and aimed at intimidating the opposition.
	   He called on all his party supporters to joint in a protest
Monday at downtown Skenderbeg square.
	   The six could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

Lugar meets Ukrainian officials, discusses nuclear disarmament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - U.S. Senator Richard Lugar discussed
nuclear disarmament and Ukrainian-American economic ties Sunday
with top Ukrainian officials.
	   At a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, Lugar (R-Ind.)
pledged continued economic aid for Ukraine and praised Kiev for its
support of the recent U.S. bombings in Sudan and Afghanistan,
Kuchma's aides said.
	   Lugar, however, said at a separate meeting with parliament
leaders that Washington was concerned about Ukraine's financial
difficulties caused by the ruble crisis in Russia and a decline in
its agricultural production.
	   Much of the talks, including Lugar's meeting with national
security chief Volodymyr Horbulin, focused on Ukrainian measures to
dismantle the launching shafts and other infrastructure of its
former Soviet nuclear arsenal.
	   Ukraine has surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia since
becoming independent in 1991, and destroyed dozens of missile silos
in 1996-97.
	   Kuchma and Horbulin noted that U.S. funds meant to assist
Ukraine with destroying the silos were coming in time, but that the
money allocated for recultivating the land around the former silos
had been arriving late.
	   Lugar and Senator Sam Nunn initiated the 1991 Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program which provides American
technical assistance to the former Soviet Union to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction and account for and control weapons
material.
	   On Sunday, Lugar said he was pleased with Ukraine's progress in
destroying the nuclear weapons' infrastructure. According to
Horbulin, he also supported the idea of using Ukrainian missiles
for peaceful purposes and producing new boosters at Ukrainian
plants.

Kohl launches home stretch of uphill re-election campaign

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl rallied 18,000 party
faithful Sunday to energize his push for re-election, portraying
himself as a trusted statesman in uncertain times and his opponent
as a showman hiding behind vague promises.
	   With just five weeks left in his toughest campaign as incumbent,
Kohl called on backers at a Dortmund civic center to help him fight
for every vote ahead of the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections.
	   The conservative Christian Democrats lag in the polls, but with
some putting nearly half of voters' undecided, Kohl pledged, ``We
can win. We want to win. We will win.''
	   Much of the hour-long speech launching the campaign's so-called
``hot phase'' focused on Kohl's achievements in the last 16 years
as chancellor, with emphasis on German unification, but with few
specifics about what he would do in the next four if elected.
	   Kohl suggested the opposition Social Democrats were trying to
diminish the differences between the rivals, and confuse undecided
voters, by suggesting that Germany's two major parties might govern
together in a ``grand coalition.''
	   He ruled out the possibility as ``silly talk.''
	   Germany faces a political choice between ``two fundamentally
opposing directions'' as it heads toward the new millennium, Kohl
said.
	   ``We stand for security and reliability,'' said Kohl.
	   With the slogan ``World class for Germany'' as backdrop, he
cited opinion polls indicating his party is closing the gap on the
opposition Social Democrats and that many voters are undecided.
	   ``We're going to make it,'' he proclaimed.
	   Despite the display of confidence, Kohl's measured tone and
well-worn rhetoric contrasted with Schroeder's impassioned speeches
in three cities when the Social Democrats' candidate kicked off his
final campaign Sunday.
	   Kohl charged his foes were running ``a campaign of the forked
tongue'' that lacked clear ideas for the nation's future and
obscured sacrifices Germans would have to make to compete in the
world economy.
	   ``The aim is to deceive voters,'' he declared.
	   But in a move some saw as a sign of the conservative leader's
desperation, the 68-year-old leader also gave the floor to two
critics in an effort to to demonstrate openness to new ideas.
	   Lothar Spaeth, who runs a high-tech company in eastern Germany,
and Saxony state governor Kurt Biedenkopf, an economist, have long
accused Kohl of moving too slowly on reforming Germany's welfare
state.
	   Both have been enlisted this year to try to rally votes in the
east, where Kohl's support has crumbled since unification because
of the region's economic collapse.
	   Kohl dwelled at length on his achievements as statesman _
unification in 1990 and the drive for European unity _ and painted
Schroeder as the spearhead of a shift to the political left that
would trigger economic decline.
	   He warned Germans against electing an untested government,
emphasizing the importance of a stable Germany in the heart of
Europe as financial crises in Russia and Asia and rising tensions
in the Balkans and Africa spread uncertainty.
	   He took up record unemployment _ the core campaign issue _ only
briefly, predicting that the number of jobless would fall below 4
million this year.
	   ``That is why it's important for us to stay on course,'' he
said.

Manuela Machado wins marathon, O'Sullivan clinches second gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sonia O'Sullivan winning women's 5,000 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the
5,000-meter gold medal to her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the
last 100 meters at the European Championship on Sunday.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   She overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of Romania
coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a slow 15
minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult. It was Riedel's first European title.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world titlist and
former European champion who still holds the world record of 74.08
set in 1986, gained silver at 66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.
	   On a cool but sunny morning, Machado steadily pulled away in the
last 15 kilometers to add another gold to her collection. She was
the 1995 world champion and twice world silver medalist and is
another in a long line of strong Portuguese distance runners.
	   Biktagirova, 33, is a former Los Angeles marathon winner and
finished fourth in the '92 Olympics but was disqualified and given
a three-month ban after testing positive for stimulants.
	   Viceconte has had more success at half marathons and this is her
first medal in a major event.
	   On Saturday, Heike Drechsler, 33, became only the third to win
four consecutive titles in the same event, taking the long jump in
7.16 meters. Fourth in last year's worlds, Drechsler edged out '96
Olympic silver medalist Fiona May (7.11) of Italy and world
champion Luydmila Galkina (7.06) of Russia.
	   The jump was also No. 4 on the world list behind three by
American Marion Jones, who has a best of 7:31.
	   ``This was maybe for me the hardest win,'' said the 33-year-old
German, who is coming back after surgery almost a year ago on both
Achilles tendons.
	   ``I had three really hard years,'' she added. ``I wanted to come
back. It was a really hard thing for me. I had to work very hard
for this gold.''
	   Britain's Colin Jackson, 31, also won his third consecutive
European gold, clocking 13.02 in both the finals and semifinals of
the 110 hurdles.
	   It was the No. 3 time in the world this season behind Americans
Allen Johnson (12.98) and Mark Crear (13.00) for the world
record-holder (12.91) and former world champion.
	   ``It's strange that I had to come here and re-establish
myself,'' he said. ``This one has got to be high on my list of
achievements.''
	   After five days, Britain leads with six gold medals and 11
overall. Russia has five gold and 17 overall and Germany has won
four gold and a total of 16.
	   Britain picked up two more gold medals to go with Jackson's as
Denise Lewis, world silver medalist, won the heptathlon with 6,559
points. Britain's 4X100 men also got gold in 38.52 as 100-meter
champion Darren Campbell and 200 champion Doug Walker picked up
their second golds.
	   European 100 champion Christine Arron of France also got gold in
the 4X100 as she anchored and blew by Russian anchor Irina
Privalova _ the 200 gold-medalist _ to victory. France clocked
42.59.
	   In the pole vault, Russian Maksim Tarasov took advantage of
Sergei Bubka's absence and added a European gold to '92 his Olympic
gold with a jump of 5.81.
	   Spain, which got gold Thursday in the 1,500 with Reyes Estevez,
was 1-2 in the 5,000 and Isaac Viciosa clocked 13:37.46 and Manuel
Pancorbo finished in 13:38.03.

Tommi Makinen wins Rally Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JYVASKYLA, Finland (AP) _ Tommi Makinen kept his hopes alive of
retaining the world rally championship by beating overall leader
Carlos Sainz by 35.6 seconds to win the Rally Finland for the fifth
straight time Sunday.
	   Makinen, a two-time defending champion from Finland, completed
the three-day, 24-stage event in 3 hours, 16 minutes, 56.1 seconds.
The Mitsubishi driver now trails Sainz by nine points with three
rallies left in the series: San Remo, Italy, Australia and the RAC
in Britain.
	   It was the second time this year that Makinen beat Sainz in a
Scandinavian world championship event, having defeated the Spanish
Toyota driver by 52 seconds in the Swedish winter rally six months
ago.
	   ``It was easier than I expected,'' Makinen said. ``Sure, five
straight wins here is a record and very special, but most important
for me is the overall title.''
	   Sainz, a former two-time world champion, became the winningest
driver last month when he captured the Rally of New Zealand for his
22nd world championship victory.
	   ``This result is very important for the overall,'' Sainz said.
``With Colin McRae withdrawing on day one, I managed to get a
nine-point lead in the standings. But three rallies remain and a
lot of things can still happen.''
	   McRae, a Scotsman, had to abandon the rally during Friday's
first stage with a broken rear strut and now shares second overall
with Makinen at 38 points.
	   Juha Kankkunen, a former world champion driving on familiar
gravel roads in central Finland, placed third in a Ford, 45.2
seconds back. Didier Auriol of France was fourth in a Toyota,
2:29.2 behind the winner. Kankkunen is third overall with 31 points
and Auriol is fifth with 30 points.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the
5,000-meter gold medal to her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the

	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that

	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27

Lambruschini, Olympic bronze medalist, clocked 8:16.70, while the
bronze went to Jim Svenoy of Norway in 8:18.97.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Packing 115-mph (184-kph) winds and
threatening to grow stronger, Hurricane Bonnie stalled off the
Bahamas on Sunday but is expected to continue on a tack that could
hit landfall in the eastern United States.
	   The increasing winds made Bonnie a Category 3 hurricane, which
have winds of more than 111 mph (178 kph) and are capable of
extensive damage. The storm hovered about 185 miles (300
kilometers) east of San Salvador in the central Bahamas.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said in a statement Sunday. The storm's winds were expected to
increase.
	   In the Pacific Ocean, the winds of Hurricane Howard held steady
at around 144 mph (230 kph) Sunday morning, but forecasters
predicted the hurricane would peter out harmlessly.
	   The Atlantic season's first hurricane, Bonnie, at more than 300
miles (480 kilometers) long, dwarfed sparsely populated Bahamian
islands, drenching them with rain and gusty winds.
	   But its worst thunderstorms battered the open seas to its north,
said National Hurricane Center forecaster John Guiney.
	   ``The lucky thing is ... the Bahamas will not be feeling the
full brunt of the storm,'' he said. But he noted that Bonnie has
been ``very erratic ... meandering around,'' making forecasts less
reliable.
	   At 11 a.m. Sunday (1500 GMT), the hurricane center said Bonnie
was expected to resume a northwesterly motion that would take it
northeast of the central Bahamas.
	   ``The seas are a little rough and we had some very strong winds
at about 2 a.m. this morning, but nothing severe,'' San Salvador
administrator Charles King said by telephone.
	   King said islanders had prepared because ``they learned their
lesson with Hurricane Lili'' in 1996. Then, people tried to put up
shutters as the storm smashed into the island, which has a
population of 550. There was flooding but no severe damage.
	   Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the
hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet (1.8-2.7 meters) above
normal, and Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause flooding.

Six former top officials arrested in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's former defense minister and
five other former high-ranking officials were arrested Sunday and
charged with crimes against humanity for their actions during the
chaos that followed the collapse of pyramid schemes last year, the
prosecutor's office said.
	   Among those arrested were former Defense Minister Safet Zhulali,
former deputy chief of the secret service Bujar Rama and former
Interior Minister Halit Shamata.
	   The statement said that in cooperation with each other, they
committed crimes against humanity that resulted in the destruction
of the Albanian state and the deaths of thousands of people.
	   Public discontent following the collapse of the pyramid schemes,
in which most Albanians lost their life savings, led to insurgency
during which more than 2,000 people lost their lives.
	   All those arrested Sunday were members of the Democratic Party
of former President Sali Berisha.
	   Berisha told reporters Sunday that the arrests were politically
motivated and aimed at intimidating the opposition. He called on

Machado wins marathon, O'Sullivan clinches second gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian Masterkova winning 1,500 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the
5,000-meter gold medal to her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the
last 100 meters at the European Championship on Sunday.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   She overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of Romania
coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a slow 15
minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult. It was Riedel's first European title.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world titlist and
former European champion who still holds the world record of 74.08
set in 1986, gained silver at 66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia pulled away from
world champion Carla Sacramento of Portugal in the final bend and
went on win the women's 1,500 in 4:11.91. Sacramento clocked
4:12.62, while Anita Weyerman of Switzerland took bronze at
4:13.06.
	   Damian Kallabis of Germany upset defending champion Alessandro
Lambruschini of Italy to win the 3,000 steeplechase in 8:13.10.
Lambruschini, Olympic bronze medalist, clocked 8:16.70, while the
bronze went to Jim Svenoy of Norway in 8:18.97.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.
	   On a cool but sunny morning, Machado steadily pulled away in the
last 15 kilometers to add another gold to her collection. She was
the 1995 world champion and twice world silver medalist and is
another in a long line of strong Portuguese distance runners.
	   Biktagirova, 33, is a former Los Angeles marathon winner and
finished fourth in the '92 Olympics but was disqualified and given
a three-month ban after testing positive for stimulants.
	   Viceconte has had more success at half marathons and this is her
first medal in a major event.
	   On Saturday, Heike Drechsler, 33, became only the third to win
four consecutive titles in the same event, taking the long jump in
7.16 meters. Fourth in last year's worlds, Drechsler edged out '96
Olympic silver medalist Fiona May (7.11) of Italy and world
champion Luydmila Galkina (7.06) of Russia.
	   The jump was also No. 4 on the world list behind three by
American Marion Jones, who has a best of 7:31.
	   ``This was maybe for me the hardest win,'' said the 33-year-old
German, who is coming back after surgery almost a year ago on both
Achilles tendons.
	   ``I had three really hard years,'' she added. ``I wanted to come
back. It was a really hard thing for me. I had to work very hard
for this gold.''
	   Britain's Colin Jackson, 31, also won his third consecutive
European gold, clocking 13.02 in both the finals and semifinals of
the 110 hurdles.
	   It was the No. 3 time in the world this season behind Americans
Allen Johnson (12.98) and Mark Crear (13.00) for the world
record-holder (12.91) and former world champion.
	   ``It's strange that I had to come here and re-establish
myself,'' he said. ``This one has got to be high on my list of
achievements.''

Kiriyenko _ in the wrong place at the wrong time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sergei Kiriyenko's age and inexperience were both
his greatest assets and liabilities.
	   But in the end, the 36-year-old Russian prime minister may have
lost his job not because of who he was, but because he was in the
wrong place at the wrong time.
	   Kiriyenko was fired unceremoniously Sunday after spending five
difficult months trying to keep Russia's economy from collapsing.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had fought hard to push Kiriyenko's
appointment through parliament this spring, arguing strenuously
that Russia needed new, vigorous leadership. Not long after
Kiriyenko took office, the Russian stock market went into a
nosedive, beginning an unremitting series of economic crises.
	   Kiriyenko represented a new generation of young leaders who are
quickly entering the top ranks of politics, business and other
fields.
	   The son of a prominent academic, he was born July 26, 1962, in
the Black Sea town of Sukhumi. He graduated from the Gorky
Institute of Water Transport Engineering and took a two-year course
at the Moscow Academy of Economics, majoring in finance and
banking.
	   After serving in the military, Kiriyenko became a foreman at the
Krasnoye Sormovo shipyard in the Soviet city of Gorky, now known as
Nizhny Novgorod.
	   He also served as the first secretary of Gorky's regional
committee of the Young Communist League, the Komsomol and was a
deputy in the local legislature.
	   Kiriyenko was just 28 and beginning his career as a private
businessman when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The transition
to a market economy provided new opportunities to young Russians,
and Kiriyenko made the most of them.
	   In 1994, he became a founder of a commercial bank in Nizhny
Novgorod, Garantia, and served as the bank's chairman of the board.
	   Two years later, Kiriyenko became president of the NORSI oil
company and held that job until he entered government as first
deputy minister for fuel and energy in May, 1997.
	   In November, 1997, he was appointed minister for fuel and
energy, a post he held until Yeltsin fired his Cabinet and named
Kiriyenko acting prime minister on March 23.

Maloney holds off challenge of defending champion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ A consistent performance in all four events
paid off for 17-year-old Kristen Maloney as she won U.S. Gymnastics
women's championship.
	   Maloney, fourth in the national championship all-around
competition last year, finished with 76.749 points Saturday night
to hold off the challenge of defending champion Vanessa Atler.
	   After the competition, Maloney was recognized as the U.S.
gymnast of the year and sportswoman of the year for the second
consecutive year by USA Gymnastics.
	   Atler, who last year became the first junior national champion
to win the senior women's title the following year, was second with
75.762. Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu placed third with
75.161 and Jennie Thompson, 17, placed fourth at 74.837.
	   Atler, 16, said she began the night disappointed with her
Thursday performance.
	   ``I thought that isn't the way I've trained,'' she said. ``I
wanted to come back and hit my routines.''
	   Maloney entered the all-around finals Saturday leading Moceanu
by .715 points. Atler was in sixth after having problems on the
uneven bars, in which she received a 8.225 from the judges.
	   ``It made me a little bit nervous,'' Maloney said of going into
the competition.
	   Maloney, who competed with a stress fracture in her tibia,
finished first in a field that included three former national
champions _ Atler, Moceanu and Kim Zmeskal.
	   ``I didn't really think I was beating anyone,'' Maloney said.
``I just wanted to hit all my routines.''
	   The champion's score was the second highest of the finals at
38.578. Atler had the highest score of 38.787, followed by Moceanu
at 37.725.
	   Maloney, who began in gymnastics in 1987 when she wanted to
accompany her older brother and sister to school, began the night
with a 9.725 on the uneven bars. She followed with a 9.75 on the
beam _ the highest mark in that event on Saturday. She was first
after each of her rotations, scoring a 9.625 in floor exercise and
claimed the championship despite getting her low score of the night
on her final event with a 9.487 in the vault.
	   The champion was determined by the combined scores from the
preliminary round on Thursday and finals on Saturday.
	   Moceanu, 16, who claimed national championships in the vault and
balance beam on Thursday, lost ground to the champion on the uneven
bars where she received her low mark each day of the competition.
On Saturday, she scored a 8.975 on the event.
	   Atler managed to outscore Maloney in three of the four events,
but was unable to make up her deficit from the opening night. Her
high mark Saturday was a 9.8 on the uneven bars.
	   Moceanu entered the competition after missing two weeks of
training because of a strained left knee. She wore a brace on the
knee during the competition.
	   The highest score of the night went to Elise Ray with a 9.850 on
the uneven bars. The performance helped her finish fifth with
74.662 points.
	   Zmeskal, the 1991 world champion who returned to competition
this year for the first time since competing in the 1992 Olympics,
finished 11th overall with 71.899 points.
	   ``It's a different sport out there,'' she said, adding that she
now plans to train with the 2000 Olympics as a goal. ``I feel so
much deeper toward the sport and have a new respect for high-level
gymnastics. ... I know where I fit in. ... I loved being out
there.''
	   The top 20 finishers in the competition earned berths on the
U.S. National team.

Sorenstam wins after equaling course record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam shot a 5-under-par 67 to
tie the course record set by Kelly Robbins earlier in the week and
won the Compaq Open by a whopping 10 strokes on Sunday.
	   ``It was one of my best-ever rounds,'' said the Swede, who's
ranked No. in the world. ``It was very windy and I was very
patient. But even when I was well ahead I had to keep
concentrating. You never know what can happen.''
	   Sorenstam, who won the tournament on another Swedish course
outside her hometown of Stockholm last year, finished with a
9-under-par total of 279. The former two-time U.S. Open champion
earned dlrs 75,000.
	   Robbins, who leads the U.S. Solheim Cup rankings, had a 75 and
shared ninth, 15 shots behind.
	   Helen Alfredsson, another Swedish star on the (U.S.) LPGA Tour,
trailed Sorenstam by two shots going into the final round. But she
struggled to a 75 on the tough Barseback course and shared second
with countrywoman Catrin Nilsmark and Johanna Head of Britain.
Nilsmark, who also plays on the LPGA Tour, had a 72. Head shot a 74
and recorded her best finish ever on the European Tour after
failing to make a cut all season.
	   Three other former U.S. Open champions played in the tournament
with Laura Davies of Britain sharing fifth (290), Liselotte Neumann
of Sweden 14th (296) and Alison Nicholas of Britain 18th (297).
Karrie Webb of Australia, another LPGA star, tied for 11th at 295.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl rallied 18,000 party
faithful Sunday to energize his push for re-election, portraying
himself as a trusted statesman in uncertain times and his opponent
as a showman hiding behind vague promises.
	   With just five weeks left in his toughest campaign as incumbent,
Kohl called on backers at a Dortmund civic center to help him fight
for every vote ahead of the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections.
	   The conservative Christian Democrats lag in the polls, but with
some putting nearly half of voters' undecided, Kohl pledged, ``We
can win. We want to win. We will win.''
	   Much of the hour-long speech launching the campaign's so-called
``hot phase'' focused on Kohl's achievements in the last 16 years
as chancellor, with emphasis on German unification, but with few
specifics about what he would do in the next four if elected.
	   Kohl suggested the opposition Social Democrats were trying to
diminish the differences between the rivals, and confuse undecided
voters, by suggesting that Germany's two major parties might govern
together in a ``grand coalition.''
	   He ruled out the possibility as ``silly talk.''
	   Germany faces a political choice between ``two fundamentally
opposing directions'' as it heads toward the new millennium, Kohl
said.
	   ``We stand for security and reliability,'' said Kohl.
	   With the slogan ``World class for Germany'' as backdrop, he
cited opinion polls indicating his party is closing the gap on the
opposition Social Democrats and that many voters are undecided.
	   ``We're going to make it,'' he proclaimed.
	   Despite the display of confidence, Kohl's measured tone and
well-worn rhetoric contrasted with Schroeder's impassioned speeches
in three cities when the Social Democrats' candidate kicked off his
final campaign Sunday.

 &UR; Serbs launch new assaults in Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with main assault confirmed, refugees fleeing

 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUDENCANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The sound of tank fire boomed and
smoke drifted over the sear hills. The women and children scrambled
to flee the latest Serb assault Sunday, but the grizzled peasant
stood his ground.
	   ``I leave my life in God's hands,'' Raif Makica declared as the
tractor pulled out of his barnyard and headed for the mountains,
dragging a trailer overflowing with his 20-member family, a few
mattresses, and food for the day. ``I cannot leave my land. I
cannot leave my animals.''
	   Sunday brought fresh assaults by Serb police and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, in their months'-long attempt to
eradicate an insurrection by militant ethnic Albanians fighting to
wrest Kosovo province away from Serbia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav Federation, where Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly
9-1. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between rebels and
government forces since the Serbs launched a major offensive Feb.
28.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, already have
been displaced since fighting escalated.
	   After a string of defeats in recent weeks, the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army has announced it would switch to guerrilla tactics
rather than face the powerful Serbian police and Yugoslav army in
an open confrontation.
	   KLA commanders in Studencane said Sunday that villages were
being targeted across a 15-kilometer (nearly 10-mile) front
southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   The attacks were thought to be in retaliation for a reported KLA
attack on Serbian police and a Yugoslav army unit in the same
region, along the road leading south from the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   Civilians in the area _ which includes the villages of Pecane,
Recane, Studencane, and Samodraza _ fled the attack. Dozens of
tractors moved along the dirt road toward nearby Pirane pulling
trailers overloaded with women and children, blankets and whatever
else could hastily be grabbed from targeted homes.
	   ``They have been shooting since this morning,'' said Hanife
Jahay, cradling one of her two children. She and other women were
crying, or red-eyed. For Jahay, it was the second flight in less
then a month _ she had escaped to Studencane from a nearby village
in early August after a Serb assault.
	   On a nearby hill, guerrilla fighter Bekhrim Hajdari peered
through a rifle sight toward the hazy smoke rising above the
targeted area, several kilometers (miles) away. He said the
villages were being hit by tank and large-caliber mortar fire. Then
he drove away with another fighter to search for casualties.
	   The assault began after police ordered residents early Sunday to
evacuate from a suburb of the town of Suva Reka, 45 kilometers
(about 30 miles) southwest of Pristina, and took positions there to
open fire on KLA positions. In Pristina early Sunday, some
residents stood by roadsides with ears cupped to listen to the
distant sound of artillery fire.
	   A report from the Serb-run Media Center said bodies of a mother
and a daughter, aged 44 and 19, were found near a road south of
Suva Reka, blindfolded, hands tied and shot dead. The report said
they were likely killed by ``Albanian extremists'' because they
were loyal to the Serbian authorities.
	   Further to the east Sunday, Albanians said the sound of
detonations could be heard at the KLA stronghold of Urosevac, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina. Fighting also was reported
along two stretches of the Pristina-Pec road.
	   The Albanians claimed the Serbs have embarked on a new offensive
to purge the rebels and secure important roads. As further
evidence, they cited yet another alleged attack on a cluster of
villages several kilometers (miles) to the north, closer to
Pristina.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States is seeking contact with
Sudan, but Khartoum wants a public apology from Washington for its
missile strike first, the Sudanese Information Minister said
Sunday.
	   Sudan would welcome a U.N. inspection of the factory that U.S.
missiles destroyed Thursday, but would not allow an inspection of
any other alleged chemical weapons site, Ghazi Salah el-Din told a
press conference here.
	   The minister confirmed that his government is recalling its
entire diplomatic staff from the embassy in Washington, but said
Sudan is not ``severing ties with the United States.''
	   Reports of such recall were denied Friday by Sudanese diplomats
in Washington, who said they had received no such orders.
	   ``This is in retaliation for the U.S. action,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   Sudan would also take steps against European countries that
``openly and unconditionally supported the United States'
aggression on Sudan.
	   ``We're not suggesting to withdraw our mission from those
countries, but there will be a policy of reasonable action against
these countries,'' he said.
	   Britain and several other European states have backed the U.S.
strike against a pharmaceutical factory in north Khartoum.
President Bill Clinton ordered the attack, and a simultaneous
strike against extremist camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   The United States says the Khartoum factory produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan says it produced only
medical drugs and vaccines.
	   ``We have been receiving signals and suggestions by third
parties that the U.S. wishes to take a milder position towards
Sudan, presumably because of the mistake it has committed,'' Salah
el-Din said.
	   ``Our response is that we do not entertain any behind-the-scenes
contact,'' he said. ``If they want to speak to us, they have to
come up with a public apology.''
	   U.S. officials also said the Khartoum factory belonged to a
corporation in which the Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden had a
stake. Washington accuses bin Laden of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   ``Bin Laden never came near the factory and there is no way that
this factory could have produced chemical weapons,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   The minister recalled the United States' successfully persuading
Khartoum to expel bin Laden from Sudan in 1996.
	   At that time, he said, ``we gave them a piece of advice that
they never followed. We told them: `Don't send him out of Sudan
because you will lose control over him.'
	   ``Now, the United States has ended up with war with an invisible
enemy,'' he said.
	   Turning to Sudan's request to the U.N. Security Council for an
inspection of the Khartoum factory, the minister said: ``Our demand
is very specific, we want the Untied Nations to investigate U.S.
allegations that this factory contains chemical weapons, but we
will not accept other inspections because that would distract world
attention from the issue of U.S. aggression.''

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the
5,000-meter gold medal to her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the
last 100 meters at the European Championship on Sunday.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   She overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of Romania
coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a slow 15
minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult. It was Riedel's first European title.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world titlist and
former European champion who still holds the world record of 74.08
set in 1986, gained silver at 66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia pulled away from
world champion Carla Sacramento of Portugal in the final bend and
went on win the women's 1,500 in 4:11.91. Sacramento clocked
4:12.62, while Anita Weyerman of Switzerland took bronze at
4:13.06.
	   In the women's high jump, Monica Dinescu of Romania cleared 1.97
meters to win the gold medal. Donata Jancewicz of Poland edged
Alina Astafei of Germany for the silver with both clearing 1.95.
	   Damian Kallabis of Germany upset defending champion Alessandro
Lambruschini of Italy to win the 3,000 steeplechase in 8:13.10.
Lambruschini, Olympic bronze medalist, clocked 8:16.70, while the
bronze went to Jim Svenoy of Norway in 8:18.97.
	   Svetla Dimitrova of Bulgaria defended her 100-meter hurdles
title by holding off Olympic silver medalist Brigita Bukovec of
Slovenia. Dimitrova won in 12.56, Bukovec was second in 12.65 and
Irina Korotya of Russia third in 12.85.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.
	   On a cool but sunny morning, Machado steadily pulled away in the
last 15 kilometers to add another gold to her collection. She was
the 1995 world champion and twice world silver medalist and is
another in a long line of strong Portuguese distance runners.
	   Biktagirova, 33, is a former Los Angeles marathon winner and
finished fourth in the '92 Olympics but was disqualified and given
a three-month ban after testing positive for stimulants.
	   Viceconte has had more success at half marathons and this is her
first medal in a major event.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl rallied 18,000 party
faithful Sunday to energize his push for re-election, portraying
himself as a trusted statesman in uncertain times and his opponent
as a showman hiding behind vague promises.
	   With just five weeks left in his toughest campaign as incumbent,
Kohl called on backers at a Dortmund civic center to help him fight
for every vote ahead of the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections.
	   The conservative Christian Democrats lag in the polls, but with
some putting nearly half of voters' undecided, Kohl pledged, ``We
can win. We want to win. We will win.''
	   Much of the hour-long speech launching the campaign's so-called
``hot phase'' focused on Kohl's achievements in the last 16 years
as chancellor, with emphasis on German unification, but with few
specifics about what he would do in the next four if elected.
	   Kohl suggested the opposition Social Democrats were trying to
diminish the differences between the rivals, and confuse undecided
voters, by suggesting that Germany's two major parties might govern
together in a ``grand coalition.''
	   He ruled out the possibility as ``silly talk.''
	   Germany faces a political choice between ``two fundamentally
opposing directions'' as it heads toward the new millennium, Kohl
said.
	   ``We stand for security and reliability,'' said Kohl.
	   With the slogan ``World class for Germany'' as backdrop, he
cited opinion polls indicating his party is closing the gap on the
opposition Social Democrats and that many voters are undecided.
	   ``We're going to make it,'' he proclaimed.
	   Despite the display of confidence, Kohl's measured tone and
well-worn rhetoric contrasted with Gerhard Schroeder's impassioned
speeches in three cities when the Social Democrats' candidate
kicked off his final campaign Sunday.

Yeltsin fires Kiriyenko, reappoints Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Seleznyov, Chernomyrdin meeting with
Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and the rest of his government on Sunday and named
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting head of the
government.
	   The surprise announcement came as the 35-year-old Kiriyenko and
his government were struggling to overcome one of Russia's worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   Yeltsin had fired Chernomyrdin and appointed Kiriyenko in March,
saying Russia needed new ideas and fresh leadership. Kiriyenko had
barely been ratified when Russia's economy went into a tailspin, a
victim of plunging world oil prices and the Asian economic crisis.
	   Since then, the young prime minister had been waging a losing
battle to shore up the economy. He worked tirelessly to defend the
national currency, the ruble, negotiate loans with Western lenders
and push reform measures through a hostile parliament dominated by
communists and their allies.
	   Last week, the government conceded defeat in the fight to save
the ruble, announcing Monday that it was effectively devaluing the
currency by allowing its value to slip by up to 34 percent against
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Friday, all factions of the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, including those usually supportive of the government,
had demanded Kiriyenko's resignation. The Duma also passed a
resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, whose government was ``not capable of
working efficiently,'' the Interfax news agency reported. However,
he criticized the reappointment of Chernomyrdin.
	   ``This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former cabinet was doing,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Chernomyrdin, a Soviet-style bureaucrat who once headed the
national gas monopoly, Gazprom, has busied himself since being
fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin _ a relatively bland
and conservative figure strongly associated with an unpopular
administration _ could win, although he could probably count on
support from at least part of the business and banking
establishment.
	   The announcement of the change in governments came unexpectedly
on a day when Kiriyenko had been busy holding meetings to work out
measures to save Russia's banking system from default.
	   Yeltsin, who is scheduled to end a much criticized five-week
vacation on Monday, delivered the news in a tersely worded
announcement from his press service. He did not give any reasons,
although he has been under increasing pressure from parliament to
replace the government.
	   Interfax reported that Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin had met Sunday,
sometime before the announcement.

Lutheran clergyman takes first spade of dirt from Spanish Flu
</HEADLINE>
grave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Lutheran clergyman dug the first shovelful
of dirt from a frozen mass grave this weekend in a gesture of local
support for an international project seeking the secrets of the
Spanish Flu in an Arctic cemetery.
	   A four-nation team is exhuming the bodies of six young coal
miners who died of the Spanish Flu in 1918 and were buried in the
permafrost of Longyearbyen, a Norwegian mining outpost in the
Svalbard islands.
	   The experts believe the frozen bodies may contain enough traces
of the virus to build a genetic profile of the illness that killed
20 to 40 million people in a global epidemic.
	   After four days of preparations, including setting up a six
meter (20 foot) long tent over the grave site and removing a row of
white crosses, the team began digging into the grave Saturday
evening. Jan Hoifodt, the state Lutheran church's clergyman for
Svalbard, started the digging.
	   ``The church council for Svalbard and I as a minister have
supported this project right from the beginning because it can have
such significance for world health,'' Hoifodt said as he took the
first shovelful of dirt.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what it now Ft. Riley,
Kansas in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread quickly with America
troops being deployed to Europe in World War I, and became a global
epidemic.
	   Kirsty Duncan, a medical geographer who leads the four-nation
team, read about the epidemic and that scientists still did not
much about the virus that killed more people than all the fighting
in W.W.I.
	   The 31-year-old professor at the Universities of Windsor and
Toronto began a search that led her to the frozen graves on
Svalbard, north of the Norwegian mainland and just 950 kilometers
(600 miles) from the North Pole.
	   Even though experts say there is virtually no chance that the
deadly virus being alive, the team is taking no chances.
	   The tent erected over the graves has airlocks and a chemical
decontamination shower. The team will wear isolation suits, breathe
air pumped in from the outside and take an experimental anti-viral
medication.
	   The team expects to reach the frozen bodies after about one week
of digging. They will take four sets of samples from each body, and
ship the sets to four medical laboratories in Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States. Analysis of the samples is expected
to take up to 18 months.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Police arrested three Greenpeace activists
on Sunday, four days after the group boarded a Norwegian offshore
drilling rig to protest exploration for new oil and natural gas
fields.
	   Another three activists were arrested Saturday aboard The
Deepsea Bergen, a rig working for the Norwegian state oil company
Statoil. The rig had just plugged a well about 220 kilometers (140
miles) off the town of Kristiansund, which is 400 kilometers (250
miles) northwest of Oslo.
	   Greenpeace claims that the world already has four times more
fossil fuel than can be burned without damaging the climate. It
says money used for looking for more oil would be better spent
developing alternative energy supplies, such as solar power.
	   A Greenpeace news release said the action ended Sunday with the
arrest of the last three activists aboard the rig. The six
protesters were brought to land and ordered to pay fines of 20,000
kroner (dlrs 2,600) each. Greenpeace refused to pay the fines, so
the case will go to court.
	   The activists from Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway
boarded the oil rig from rubber boats launched from their vessel,
the MV Greenpeace. The demonstrators had been staying in survival
capsule they hoisted onto the rig.

Spain says Algeria close to producing weapons-grade nuclear
</HEADLINE>
material

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Algeria's military-backed government has
developed a nuclear program that is just two years away from
producing weapons-grade plutonium, a Spanish newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   Although it has renounced acquiring nuclear weapons and accepted
an international inspections regime, the Algiers government is
building facilities that will put it in a position to acquire
weapons-grade plutonium by the turn of the century, El Pais said.
	   The left-leaning daily quoted a confidential report from the
Spanish military intelligence agency known as CESID which was
submitted to the Madrid government last month.
	   In the early 1980s Algeria signed secret accords with China and
Argentina for these countries to help it develop weapons-grade
plutonium, the report says.
	   U.S. reconnaissance satellites detected a nuclear reactor built
near the town of Birine, 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of
Algiers. Under pressure from the United States, Algeria in 1992
joined the inspections regime of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, and in 1995 it signed the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Still, although the Algerian authorities say they do not seek
nuclear weapons, their highly-trained scientists and the facilities
under construction will allow the government to resume a
military-oriented program ``if the corresponding political decision
is taken,'' according to the CESID report.
	   It added that political instability in Algeria could prompt
future governments there to re-embrace the goal of acquiring the
bomb. Since 1992 the regime has been fighting Islamic
fundamentalist rebels in a war that has claimed an estimated 75,000
lives.
	   At the Algerian embassy in Madrid, officials were unavailable
for comment on the CESID report.

 &UR; Bartoli wins Swiss Grand Prix, solidifies World Cup bid &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Michele Bartoli of
Italy edged Belgium's Frank Vandenbroucke by a hairsbreadth on
Sunday, to win the 85th Swiss Grand Prix cycling race and
strengthen his bid for a second consecutive World Cup title.
	   ``It's a great feeling to be on the way to a second World Cup
title,'' said Bartoli, who has four career World Cup victories.
``It means a lot to win, and even more to win a second one.''
	   Leading a group of nine in the final stretch at the Oerlikon
velodrome, Bartoli appeared on his way to certain victory before
Vandenbroucke surged from behind, crossing so close to the Italian
he forced a photo-finish.
	   Italy's Salvatore Commesso finished third, followed by
compatriot Andrea Tafi. American Bobby Julich crossed fifth.
	   Vandenbroucke, who remained with the pack throughout the entire
race, only joined the leading breakaway group with two kilometers
(1.25 miles) left, before sprinting to the front in the velodrome
to threaten Bartoli. The Belgian, whose wheel crossed an
infinitesimal two millimeters behind Bartoli's, even stabbed his
first in the air as he sailed across the finishline, convinced he'd
won.
	   ``I was very surprised Vandenbroucke came back so close,'' said
Bartoli, sixth at the event last year. ``I didn't have time to be
afraid. When I saw his bike crossing beside me, I hesitated briefly
but didn't stop pedalling.''
	   In a stunning breakaway effort which was to last almost 200
kilometers (125 miles), Italy's Fabrizio Bontempi, Switzerland's
Lukas Zumsteg and France's Pascal Derame escaped in the opening
loop around Basel, remaining up front for the majority of the race,
at one point picking up a seven-minute lead over the pack.
	   Then, with about 45 kilometers remaining (28 miles), Mapei rider
Tafi broke away from the pack, caught up to the leader group then
passed it to forge ahead solo.
	   Urging the rest of the pack along, Bartoli managed to re-absorb
the gritty little duo with just 27 kilometers (27 miles) to go, and
Tafi still up ahead alone.
	   Waiting for the last short, steep climbs of the Regensberg, the
28-year-old Bartoli escaped with teammate Salvatore Commesso and
Julich to catch up to Tafi.
	   The group grew to seven when Italians Davide Rebellin,
Massimiliano Gentili and Paolo Bettini joined the leaders.
	   After a couple of fruitless attacks by Julich and just two
kilometers left (1.25 miles), Mapei's Vandenbroucke and Italian
Dario Frigo attacked to catch up with the leaders.
	   The course, slightly lengthened to 242.7 kilometers (151 miles)
this year, ran from Basel to Zurich, finishing with a lap on the
oval. The layout was modified to increase the level of difficulty
after last year's race saw the entire pack reaching the velodrome
together, the crammed conditions causing several crashes.
	   Bartoli, who doesn't want to specialize in one-day events but
also wants win stage races, said while the victory was sweet, the
world championships in October in Valkenburg, Netherlands remained
his ultimate goal.
	   ``My real goal is the world championships where I'd like to
captain the Italian road team,'' said Bartoli, who did not compete
at the Tour de France. ``Our team proved we're all worthy of
selection for the Italian world championship team. We proved we're
one of the strongest teams on the road the way we controlled and
dominated the race.''
	   The Asics rider sits atop the World Cup rankings with 376 points
after eight-of-10 stages, followed by Dutchman Leon Van Bon, the
winner in Hamburg last week, second with 181. With only the
Paris-Tours and Tour de Lombardie stages left, Van Bon is the only
contender still able to prevent Bartoli from claiming the title.

	   STUDENCANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and the Serb-dominated
Yugoslav army mount fresh assaults Sunday on rebellious ethnic
Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
	   Separatist Kosovo Liberation Army commanders in Studencane said
Sunday that villages were being targeted across a 15-kilometer
(nearly 10-mile) front southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   The attacks were thought to be in retaliation for a reported KLA
attack on Serbian police and a Yugoslav army unit in the same
region, along the road leading south from the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav Federation, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by
roughly 9-1. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between rebels
and government forces since the Serbs launched a major offensive
Feb. 28.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, already have
been displaced since fighting escalated.
	   After a string of defeats in recent weeks, the KLA has announced
it would switch to guerrilla tactics rather than face the powerful
Serbian police and Yugoslav army in an open confrontation.
	   Civilians in the area under attack Sunday fled. Dozens of
tractors moved along the dirt road toward nearby Pirane pulling
trailers overloaded with women and children, blankets and whatever
else could hastily be grabbed from targeted homes.
	   ``They have been shooting since this morning,'' said Hanife
Jahay, cradling one of her two children. She and other women were
crying, or red-eyed. It was Jahay's second flight in less then a
month _ she had escaped to Studencane from a nearby village in
early August after a Serb assault.
	   On a nearby hill, guerrilla fighter Bekhrim Hajdari peered
through a rifle sight toward the hazy smoke rising above the
targeted area, several kilometers (miles) away. He said the
villages were being hit by tank and large-caliber mortar fire. Then
he drove away with another fighter to search for casualties.
	   The assault began after police ordered residents early Sunday to
evacuate a suburb of the town of Suva Reka, 45 kilometers (about 30
miles) southwest of Pristina, and took positions there to open fire
on KLA positions. In Pristina early Sunday, some residents stood by
roadsides with ears cupped to listen to the distant sound of
artillery fire.
	   A report from the Serb-run Media Center said bodies of a mother
and a daughter, aged 44 and 19, were found near a road south of
Suva Reka, blindfolded, hands tied and shot dead. The report said
they were likely killed by ``Albanian extremists'' because they
were loyal to the Serbian authorities.
	   Further to the east Sunday, Albanians said the sound of
detonations could be heard at the KLA stronghold of Urosevac, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina. Fighting also was reported
along two stretches of the Pristina-Pec road.
	   The Albanians said the Serbs have embarked on a new offensive to
purge the rebels and to secure important roads.

No Yorke but Villa beats Middlesbrough 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ The fans chanted ``no Yorke, no
Yorke'' but Aston Villa proved it could do without the star striker
as it scored a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough at Villa Park Sunday.
	   Villa, playing its first match since Dwight Yorke's 12.6 million
pound (dlrs 20 million) transfer to Manchester United, moved into
third spot on the competition table with a win and a draw.
	   Julian Joachim started Villa's charge in the sixth minute and
the team never looked back.
	   When Allan Thompson scored his first home goal for Villa in the
78th minute and restored a two goal margin, Villa's 10th win in 13
games under John Gregory was secured.
	   Thompson, who missed with a straight-forward penalty kick in the
first half, made no mistake with his second attempt. He lined up
confidently and blasted into goal near the right post via a
deflection off Middlesbrough's defensive wall.
	   The departure of Yorke left Gregory with an attacking dilema
which was seemingly exacerbated through the absence of former
England international Stan Collymore, who was still out with a
thigh injury.
	   But Gregory had no shortage of goalscorers on Sunday.
	   With just over five minutes gone, Alan Wright's forward ball
from the left was taken skillfully by Lee Hendrie, who stalled the
defense and then flicked it on to Joachim. Joachim netted to give
the home team an early advantage.
	   Joachim, named man-of-the-match, said the departure of Yorke was
disappointing but gave other players, including Collymore, a chance
to secure the No.1 striker spot.
	   ``There is an opportunity there for me to get a striker's spot
and I'll be happy to take it,'' he said after the match.
	   Villa had a 1-0 lead at halftime and extended the advantage in
the 52nd minute when Gary Charles fired in the second goal after a
length-of-the-field buildup.
	   The claret and blues made repeated attacking raids until
Middlesbrough hit back in the 62nd minute to reduce the margin when
Mikkel Beck finished-off an attacking raid by heading the ball into
goal.
	   Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson made two tactical
substitutions in the 60th minute, replacing former England
international Paul Gascoigne with the fresh Beck, which sparked the
Boro forwards into action.
	   Villa's Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich suddenly had plenty
of work cut out for him but was equal to the task, making two
brilliant saves as a rejuvenated Middlesbrough launched dangerous
shots at goal.
	   In the only division one match Sunday, Bradford grabbed a 2-2
tie with Bolton by scoring a goal two minutes from full-time at
Valley Parade.
	   On Saturday, Charlton charged to the top of the Premier League
after a crushing 5-0 win over Southampton as Clive Mendonca scored
three times in the last 25 minutes.
	   Charlton, back in the top-flight competition for the first time
since 1990, scored two goals in the first half before Mendonca
overwhelmed Southampton at The Valley.
	   Charlton stormed to the top on a day when the big teams were
held in tied games. Defending titlist Arsenal and Liverpool drew
0-0 at Anfield, Manchester United managed only a goal-less tie at
West Ham despite the debut of 12.6 million pound (dlrs 20 million)
Dwight Yorke, while Chelsea and Newcastle tied 1-1.
	   Yorke had few openings against the Hammers as the Reds looked
far short of the form that brought four league titles in five
seasons.
	   Liverpool striker Michael Owen signed a new contract Saturday to
keep him at Anfield for five years but the 18-year-old England
international had few chances against a well-organized Arsenal
defense.
	   At Stamford Bridge, Nigerian international Celestine Babayaro
fired Chelsea ahead but Swedish striker Andreas Andersson leveled
for Newcastle. Both teams are still looking for their first win in
the the campaign.
	   Wimbledon, surprise first-round leaders after a 3-0 win over
Tottenham, was held 0-0 by Derby.
	   Leicester, which gained a 2-2 tie at Manchester United last
weekend, moved into second place after downing Everton 2-0 with
goals by veteran striker Tony Cottee and Muzzy Izzet.
	   Tottenham lost 3-0 at home to Sheffield Wednesday and the
pressure is already on Swiss coach Christian Gross after two losses
and six goals conceded. Peter Atherton, Paolo Di Canio and Andy
Hinchcliffe netted Wednesday's goals at White Hart Lane.
	   Steve Stone netted Nottingham Forest's winner in a 1-0 victory
over neighbor Coventry at the City Ground.
	   Leeds plays Blackburn to complete the round two on Monday.
	   After two games, Arsenal places fifth, Liverpool sixth, while
Manchester United is 11th and Chelsea is five from last after a
loss and a tie.

Lutheran clergyman takes first spade of dirt from Spanish Flu
</HEADLINE>
grave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Lutheran clergyman dug the first shovelful
of dirt from a frozen mass grave this weekend in a gesture of local
support for an international project seeking the secrets of the
Spanish Flu in an Arctic cemetery.
	   A four-nation team is exhuming the bodies of six young coal
miners who died of the Spanish Flu in 1918 and were buried in the
permafrost of Longyearbyen, a Norwegian mining outpost in the
Svalbard islands.
	   The experts believe the frozen bodies may contain enough traces
of the virus to build a genetic profile of the illness that killed
20 to 40 million people in a global epidemic.
	   After four days of preparations, including setting up a six
meter (20 foot) long tent over the grave site and removing a row of
white crosses, the team began digging into the grave Saturday
evening. Jan Hoifodt, the state Lutheran church's clergyman for
Svalbard, started the digging.
	   ``The church council for Svalbard and I as a minister have
supported this project right from the beginning because it can have
such significance for world health,'' Hoifodt said as he took the
first shovelful of dirt.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what it now Ft. Riley,
Kansas in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread quickly with America
troops being deployed to Europe in World War I, and became a global
epidemic.
	   The team expects to reach the frozen bodies after about one week
of digging. They will take four sets of samples from each body, and
ship the sets to four medical laboratories in Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States. Analysis of the samples is expected
to take up to 18 months.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States is seeking contact with
Sudan, but Khartoum wants a public apology from Washington for its
missile strike first, the Sudanese Information Minister said
Sunday.
	   Sudan would welcome a U.N. inspection of the factory that U.S.
missiles destroyed Thursday, but would not allow an inspection of
any other alleged chemical weapons site, Ghazi Salah el-Din told a
press conference here.
	   The minister confirmed that his government is recalling its
entire diplomatic staff from the embassy in Washington, but said
Sudan is not ``severing ties with the United States.''
	   Reports of such recall were denied Friday by Sudanese diplomats
in Washington, who said they had received no such orders.
	   ``This is in retaliation for the U.S. action,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   Sudan would also take steps against European countries that
``openly and unconditionally supported the United States'
aggression on Sudan.
	   ``We're not suggesting to withdraw our mission from those
countries, but there will be a policy of reasonable action against
these countries,'' he said.
	   Britain and several other European states have backed the U.S.
strike against a pharmaceutical factory in north Khartoum.
President Bill Clinton ordered the attack, and a simultaneous
strike against extremist camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   The United States says the Khartoum factory produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan says it produced only
medical drugs and vaccines.
	   ``We have been receiving signals and suggestions by third
parties that the U.S. wishes to take a milder position towards
Sudan, presumably because of the mistake it has committed,'' Salah
el-Din said.
	   ``Our response is that we do not entertain any behind-the-scenes
contact,'' he said. ``If they want to speak to us, they have to
come up with a public apology.''
	   U.S. officials also said the Khartoum factory belonged to a
corporation in which the Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden had a
stake. Washington accuses bin Laden of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   ``Bin Laden never came near the factory and there is no way that
this factory could have produced chemical weapons,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   The minister recalled the United States' successfully persuading
Khartoum to expel bin Laden from Sudan in 1996.
	   At that time, he said, ``we gave them a piece of advice that
they never followed. We told them: `Don't send him out of Sudan
because you will lose control over him.'
	   ``Now, the United States has ended up with war with an invisible
enemy,'' he said.
	   Turning to Sudan's request to the U.N. Security Council for an
inspection of the Khartoum factory, the minister said: ``Our demand
is very specific, we want the Untied Nations to investigate U.S.
allegations that this factory contains chemical weapons, but we
will not accept other inspections because that would distract world
attention from the issue of U.S. aggression.''
	   In Baghdad on Sunday, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail said Sudan is ready to receive former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter and members of the U.S. Congress to determine whether the
factory produced weapons ingredients.
	   ``We will keep the place (factory) as it is,'' Ismail told
reporters at the end of his visit to Iraq. ``We will insist that an
investigation team come because this is step one. It is very, very
important that the international community, the American, European
and Sudanese people know whether the American claims are right or
wrong.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Algeria's military-backed government has
developed a nuclear program that is just two years away from
producing weapons-grade plutonium, a Spanish newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   Although it has renounced acquiring nuclear weapons and accepted
an international inspections regime, the Algiers government is
building facilities that will put it in a position to acquire
weapons-grade plutonium by the turn of the century, El Pais said.
	   The left-leaning daily quoted a confidential report from the
Spanish military intelligence agency known as CESID that was
submitted to the Madrid government last month.
	   In the early 1980s Algeria signed secret accords with China and
Argentina for those countries to help it develop weapons-grade
plutonium, the report says.
	   U.S. reconnaissance satellites detected a nuclear reactor built
near the town of Birine, 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of
Algiers. Under pressure from the United States, Algeria in 1992
joined the inspections regime of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, and in 1995 it signed the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Still, although the Algerian authorities say they do not seek
nuclear weapons, their highly-trained scientists and the facilities
under construction will allow the government to resume a
military-oriented program ``if the corresponding political decision
is taken,'' according to the CESID report.
	   It added that political instability in Algeria could prompt
future governments there to re-embrace the goal of acquiring the
bomb. Since 1992 the regime has been fighting Islamic
fundamentalist rebels in a war that has claimed an estimated 75,000
lives.

Nicaragua jolted by 6.5-magnitude earthquake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Residents of western Nicaragua felt
the strong shudder of a 6.5-magnitude earthquake early Sunday, but
authorities reported no damages or injuries from the temblor.
	   The quake occurred at 7:57 local time (1357 GMT) and was
centered in the Pacific Ocean just off Puerto Sandino, about 140
miles (230 kms) west of Managua.
	   Nicaragua's National Seismological Institute said the
near-surface quake was caused by movement between the Cocos and
Caribbean tectonic plates.
	   Firefighters and the Red Cross said they had no reports of any
damages from the temblor.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known. But U.S.
officials indicated it appeared to have nothing to do with fears of
a possible terrorist attack.
	   ``We have reason to believe that this was an isolated incident
of a particular person, although we are concerned about threats at
all our embassies and Tirana is clearly one of them,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told ABC-TV when asked about
the incident.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
nationals, including some from Arab countries.
	   The Interior Ministry, in an official statement, said the
policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high on the embassy's back
side at about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police outside the embassy
started shooting in the air to force him out, and after he fired
back with a pistol security officers shot him.
	   A ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity
identified the guards who did the shooting as American, not
Albanian.
	   The policeman had at least two bullet wounds, one near the
heart, and died soon afterward in surgery at a nearby military
hospital, doctors were quoted by Albanian TV as saying.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, from the village of
Ndroq, 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Tirana _ a member of a
police unit in charge of security at a Tirana bank.
	   Relatives in Ndroq told Associated Press Television that Shehu,
divorced and with two children, had an extremely poor family and
was depressed. On Saturday night, they said, he told his mother he
would not live to see age 40. No anti-American feelings were
evident among relatives or family members.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads, and U.S. Marines
fortified the compound.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday, but the Americans said it was planned and had
nothing to do with the shooting.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan wants a public apology from the
United States for launching missiles at a suspected chemical
weapons plant, the Sudanese Information Minister said Sunday.
	   Sudan would welcome a U.N. inspection of the factory that U.S.
missiles destroyed Thursday, but would not allow an inspection of
any other alleged chemical weapons site, Ghazi Salah el-Din told a
news conference here.
	   The minister confirmed that his government is recalling its
entire diplomatic staff from the embassy in Washington, but said
Sudan is not ``severing ties with the United States.''
	   Reports of a recall were denied Friday by Sudanese diplomats in
Washington, who said they had received no such orders.
	   ``This is in retaliation for the U.S. action,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   He said Sudan would also take steps against European countries
that ``openly and unconditionally supported the United States'
aggression on Sudan.
	   ``We're not suggesting to withdraw our mission from those
countries, but there will be a policy of reasonable action against
these countries,'' he said.
	   Britain and several other European states have backed the U.S.
strike against a pharmaceutical factory in north Khartoum. U.S.
President Bill Clinton ordered the attack Thursday, and a
simultaneous strike against extremist camps in Afghanistan, in
retaliation for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   The United States says the Khartoum factory produced ingredients
for chemical weapons. Sudan says it produced only medicine and
vaccines.
	   ``We have been receiving signals and suggestions by third
parties that the U.S. wishes to take a milder position toward
Sudan, presumably because of the mistake it has committed,'' Salah
el-Din said.
	   ``Our response is that we do not entertain any behind-the-scenes
contact,'' he said. ``If they want to speak to us, they have to
come up with a public apology.''
	   U.S. officials say the factory was linked to Saudi extremist
Osama bin Laden, whom Washington accuses of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   ``Bin Laden never came near the factory and there is no way that
this factory could have produced chemical weapons,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   The minister recalled that the United States successfully
persuaded Sudan to expel bin Laden in 1996.
	   At that time, he said, ``we gave them a piece of advice that
they never followed. We told them: `Don't send him out of Sudan
because you will lose control over him.'
	   ``Now, the United States has ended up with war with an invisible
enemy,'' he said.
	   In Baghdad on Sunday, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail said Sudan is ready to receive former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter and members of the U.S. Congress to determine whether the
factory produced weapons ingredients.
	   ``We will keep the place (factory) as it is,'' Ismail told
reporters at the end of his visit to Iraq. ``We will insist that an
investigation team come because this is step one. It is very, very
important that the international community, the American, European
and Sudanese people know whether the American claims are right or
wrong.''

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Michele Bartoli of
Italy edged Belgium's Frank Vandenbroucke Sunday to win the 85th
Swiss Grand Prix cycling race and strengthen his bid for a second
consecutive World Cup title.
	   ``It's a great feeling to be on the way to a second World Cup
title,'' said Bartoli, who has four career World Cup victories.
``It means a lot to win, and even more to win a second one.''
	   Leading a group of nine in the final stretch at the Oerlikon
velodrome, Bartoli appeared sure of victory before Vandenbroucke
surged from behind, crossing so close to the Italian that he forced
a photo-finish.
	   Italy's Salvatore Commesso finished third, followed by
compatriot Andrea Tafi. American Bobby Julich crossed fifth.
	   Vandenbroucke, who remained with the pack throughout the race,
only joined the leading breakaway group with two kilometers (1.25
miles) left, before sprinting to the front in the velodrome to
threaten Bartoli. The Belgian, whose wheel crossed two millimeters
(0.08 inches) behind Bartoli's, even stabbed his fist in the air as
he sailed across the finish line, convinced he had won.
	   ``I was very surprised Vandenbroucke came back so close,'' said
Bartoli, sixth at the event last year. ``I didn't have time to be
afraid. When I saw his bike crossing beside me, I hesitated briefly
but didn't stop pedaling.''
	   In a stunning breakaway effort which was to last almost 200
kilometers (125 miles), Italy's Fabrizio Bontempi, Switzerland's
Lukas Zumsteg and France's Pascal Derame escaped in the opening
loop around Basel, remaining up front for the majority of the race,
at one point picking up a seven-minute lead over the pack.
	   Then, with about 45 kilometers (28 miles) remaining, Mapei rider
Tafi broke away from the pack, caught up to the leader group then
passed it to forge ahead on his own.
	   Urging the rest of the pack along, Bartoli managed to re-absorb
the leader group with just 27 kilometers (16.8 miles) to go, and
Tafi still up ahead alone.
	   Waiting for the last short, steep climbs of the Regensberg,
28-year-old Bartoli escaped with teammate Salvatore Commesso and
Julich to catch up to Tafi.
	   The group grew to seven when Italians Davide Rebellin,
Massimiliano Gentili and Paolo Bettini joined the leaders.
	   After a couple of fruitless attacks by Julich and just two
kilometers (1.25 miles) left, Mapei's Vandenbroucke and Italian
Dario Frigo attacked to catch up with the leaders.
	   The course, slightly lengthened to 242.7 kilometers (151 miles)
this year, ran from Basel to Zurich, finishing with a lap on the
oval. The layout was modified to increase the level of difficulty
after last year's race saw the entire pack reaching the velodrome
together, the crammed conditions causing several crashes.
	   Bartoli said while the victory was sweet, the world
championships in October in Valkenburg, Netherlands remain his
ultimate goal.
	   ``My real goal is the world championships where I'd like to
captain the Italian road team,'' said Bartoli, who did not compete
at the Tour de France. ``Our team proved we're all worthy of
selection for the Italian world championship team. We proved we're
one of the strongest teams on the road the way we controlled and
dominated the race.''
	   The Asics rider sits atop the World Cup rankings with 376 points
after eight of 10 stages, followed by Dutchman Leon Van Bon, the
winner in Hamburg last week, second with 181. With only the
Paris-Tours and Tour de Lombardie stages left, Van Bon is the only
contender still able to prevent Bartoli from claiming the title.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian parents of a three-month old
baby charged Sunday that their child died because Israeli troops
maintaining a curfew refused to let them seek medical treatment for
their son.
	   The Israeli army said it investigated the charge and staunchly
denied such an incident took place.
	   Some 30,000 Palestinian residents living in Hebron under Israeli
rule have been under curfew since Thursday, after a Jewish settler
was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant. Residents are not
allowed to leave their homes.
	   Dr. Ziad Ashab at the Aliya Hospital in Hebron, where baby Qusai
Sultan arrived dead late Saturday night, examined the body and said
the boy died of respiratory and lung infections. If the infant had
arrived at the hospital sooner, ``he may have survived,'' Ashab
said.
	   The baby's mother, Shireen, said her son, one of a set of
triplets, was suffering from influenza when she decided to take him
to the hospital.
	   She said she pleaded with soldiers but they refused to let her
travel through the city, halting her at a checkpoint outside her
home. Her son died at the checkpoint, she said.
	   ``It's inhumane and a terrible thing to prevent a baby from
going to the hospital, it breaks my heart,'' she told reporters,
weeping.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman's office ``There is
no truth in the reports about a mother being delayed with her sick
child.'' The army stressed that ``soldiers at road blocks are under
strict instructions to tend to medical emergencies without delay.''
	   The baby boy was laid to rest later Sunday in a vineyard owned
by the family, and the grave was covered with fresh flowers.
	   Israel still controls 20 percent of this tense West Bank city,
where 30,000 Palestinians live in a climate of constant friction
with 500 Jewish settlers. The Palestinian Authority controls the
other 80 percent of the city.

Egypt's Foreign Minister pays surprise visit to Syria

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held
talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad on ways to revive
the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Moussa, who arrived earlier on a surprise one-day visit, told
reporters he and the president had discussed Egypt's proposal to
convene an international conference on the process.
	   Syria's government-run media have been criticized the idea of
such a conference, saying it could give Israel a pretext to back
off from the peace terms laid down at the 1991 Madrid Conference.
	   Moussa also said he delivered a message from Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and received a reply from Assad. He did not disclose
the contents of either message.
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said Sunday that Moussa was preparing
the ground for a Mubarak visit to Syria.
	   Moussa also met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and
discussed bilateral and regional issues, the stalled Arab-Israeli
peace talks and the recent U.S. strikes against Afghanistan and
Sudan.
	   The Egyptian minister left Damascus late Sunday.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians are currently stalled
over Israel's refusal to endorse a U.S. proposal calling for an
Israeli withdrawal of 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Syria, which has not held peace talks with Israel since early
1996, is irked by Israel's recent decision to build 4,800 new homes
on the occupied Golan Heights.
	   The construction of the homes ``is tangible evidence that Israel
does not want peace,'' al-Sharaa told reporters. ``The Israeli
government is looking for all possible obstacles in order not to
resume negotiations from the point where they last reached.''
	   Syria says it will resume negotiations with Israel only after it
pledges to make a complete withdrawal from the heights, which it
captured in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ African leaders on Sunday called
for an immediate cease-fire in the Congo crisis, after a two-day
meeting that lacked many of the key players.
	   President Nelson Mandela told reporters the agreement was
adopted unanimously by 12 members of the Southern African
Development Community, who recognized Congo President Laurent
Kabila's continuing right to govern in the face of a rebel
incursion.
	   Kabila did not attend the meeting, but sent a representative.
	   The leaders also called for a troop stand still and urged Congo
to hold elections ``within a reasonable amount of time, taking into
account the realities'' of the country, the statement said.
	   Kabila has ruled with an iron fist since he ousted dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko from the former Zaire last year, and has alienated
ethnic groups that helped him.
	   He claims that neighboring Uganda and Rwanda, whose presidents
attended the meeting, are backing the disgruntled rebels in their
attempt to unseat him.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu deny Kabila's charges they have been backing rebel
troops.
	   It was not clear if Kabila accepted the cease-fire.
	   In a separate development, two South African military planes
flew to Kinshasa in Congo to rescue 800 Tanzanian troops stranded
between Congo government and rebel troop lines, a South African
official told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
	   The Tanzanian troops supported Kabila when he ousted Mobutu last
year.
	   The 3-week-old Congolese conflict has drawn neighboring
countries into the fight. Zimbabwe, whose President Robert Mugabe
boycotted the summit, sent troops to assist Kabila last week. And
Angola, whose president also did not attend, sent soldiers to back
Kabila on Saturday.
	   Namibia has sent weapons and food to Kabila. Zambia also favors
military intervention to support Kabila.
	   The conflict in the former Zaire endangers a fragile political
cooperation emerging since South Africa's apartheid regime ended in
1994, when it appeared the region would open to democratic and
economic development after decades of strife.
	   Mandela has sought to use his international stature to give
South Africa a leadership role in the region, using SADC as the
structure.
	   But his efforts in the Congo crisis _ the most serious challenge
to regional stability since 1994 _ appear to some critics to have
come too late.
	   ``South Africa ... appears to be paying the price of defensive
diplomacy (and) vacillation,'' an editorial in Johannesburg's
Sunday Independent said.
	   Mandela's main rival within SADC, Mugabe, was way ahead of South
Africa with a presidential summit two weeks ago in Victoria Falls
that included Kabila but not South Africa.
	   Last week, Mugabe called another meeting, of SADC defense
ministers in Harare, where he claims five additional countries
supported military intervention.
	   Some of the governments that sent representatives, including
Mozambique and Malawi, disputed the claim. South Africa says the
Harare meeting was not an official SADC gathering.
	   Mugabe's motivation for military intervention is not clear.
Zimbabwe's state press agency, ZIANA, reported Sunday that Kabila
owed Zimbabwean companies more than 2.5 billion Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 125 million) lent after his takeover.

Sorenstam wins after matching course record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ Two-time U.S. Women's Open champion Annika
Sorenstam shot a 5-under-par 67 to tie the course record and win
the Compaq Open by a staggering 10 strokes Sunday.
	   ``It was one of my best-ever rounds,'' said the Swede, the
world's top-ranked female player. ``It was very windy, and I was
very patient.
	   ``But even when I was well ahead I had to keep concentrating.
You never know what can happen.''
	   Sorenstam, who won the tournament last year on another Swedish
course outside her hometown of Stockholm, carded a 9-under-par 279
on the demanding Barseback course. She earned dlrs 75,000.
	   Kelly Robbins, who had the other 67 earlier in the tournament,
had a closing 75. Robbins, who leads the U.S. Solheim Cup rankings,
wound up 15 shots behind Sorenstam, sharing ninth place.
	   Helen Alfredsson, another Swedish star on the LPGA Tour, trailed
Sorenstam by two shots going into the final round. But she
struggled to a 75 and shared second with compatriot Catrin Nilsmark
and Johanna Head of Britain.
	   Nilsmark, who also plays on the LPGA Tour, had a 72. Head shot a
closing 74 en route to her best finish on the European Tour, where
she made the cut for the first time this year.
	   Three other former U.S. Open champions played in the tournament.
Laura Davies of Britain shared fifth at 290, Liselotte Neumann of
Sweden was 14th at 296 and Alison Nicholas of Britain was 18th at
297. Karrie Webb of Australia, another LPGA star, tied for 11th at
295.

Kipketer stunned in 800, O'Sullivan clinches second gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's javelin, more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, still unfit
after a bout of malaria earlier this year, suffered a stunning
defeat at the European Championship and finished last in the men's
800-meter Sunday.
	   Kipketer, the Kenyan-born world champion and world
record-holder, was at the front of the pack coming out of the last
bend.
	   But Nils Schumann of Germany then made his move, elbowing his
way past Andrea Longo of Italy and Kipketer. Schumann tangled
briefly with Kipketer, who glanced at the German in anger.
	   Kipketer, running his first European championship after becoming
a Danish citizen, appeared to lose his stride and seemed to be
tiring as he was passed by all seven finalists.
	   Kipketer had a bout with malaria in February and did not start
training until late May.
	   Schumann, the 20-year-old European junior champion, held off
Andre Bucher of Switzerland to win the gold in 1:44.89. Bucher
clocked 1:45.04, while Lukas Vydra of the Czech Republic took
bronze at 1:45.23.
	   ``I thought he may not be so quick in the finish,'' Schumann
said. ``I tried to stay with him as long as I could and then try to
win in the finish, which is my strength.''
	   ``To beat a world champion and world record holder is
incredible,'' he said.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the 5,000-meter gold medal to
her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the last 100 meters.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   ``I just can't believe it, a double gold!'' O'Sullivan said.
``All the way down the home straight I was just desperate to cross
the finish line, my legs were shaking.''
	   Grit Breuer also earned her second gold medal when she led
Germany to victory in the women's 4x400 relay by running a superb
anchor leg and blowing past Russia's Olga Kotlyarova in the last 20
meters.
	   O'Sullivan overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of
Romania coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a
slow 15 minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Breuer, who came back from a doping ban in 1995, won the
individual 400 on Friday. She also ran a similar anchor leg to give
Germany the world title last year. Germany clocked 3:23.03.
	   ``It was close but I was relaxed and I just waited because I
knew the Russian would slow down,'' Breuer said.
	   Russia ended up second in 3:25.56 and Britain was third in
3:25.56.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult. It was Riedel's first European title.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world titlist and
former European champion who still holds the world record of 74.08
set in 1986, gained silver at 66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Steve Backley, Olympic and world silver medalist, won his third
straight javelin European title with a throw of 89.72 meters and
led a 1-2 British finish. Mick Hill took silver at 86.92 and
Raymond Hecht of Germany bronze at 86.63.
	   Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia pulled away from
world champion Carla Sacramento of Portugal in the final bend and
went on win the women's 1,500 in 4:11.91. Sacramento clocked
4:12.62, while Anita Weyerman of Switzerland took bronze at
4:13.06.
	   In the women's high jump, Monica Dinescu of Romania cleared 1.97
meters to win the gold medal. Donata Jancewicz of Poland edged
Alina Astafei of Germany for the silver with both clearing 1.95.
	   Damian Kallabis of Germany upset defending champion Alessandro
Lambruschini of Italy to win the 3,000 steeplechase in 8:13.10.
Lambruschini, Olympic bronze medalist, clocked 8:16.70, while the
bronze went to Jim Svenoy of Norway in 8:18.97.
	   ``What a big surprise, Kallabis has come out of nowhere, he was
not even among the European top 10 this season,'' said
Lambruschini, who missed three weeks of training recently because
of a calf injury.
	   ``My coach has been telling me for eight months now that I will
win,'' Kallabis said. ``Last week I started believing him and so it
happened.''
	   Svetla Dimitrova of Bulgaria defended her 100-meter hurdles
title by holding off Olympic silver medalist Brigita Bukovec of
Slovenia. Dimitrova won in 12.56, Bukovec was second in 12.65 and
Irina Korotya of Russia third in 12.85.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Letting bygones be
bygones, Fidel Castro exchanged memories Sunday with Joaquin
Balaguer, the former Dominican strongman who once symbolized
Castro's isolation in the Caribbean.
	   The two aging foot soldiers of the Cold War spent nearly an hour
jammed into a tiny tan sofa at Balaguer's simple Santo Domingo
home. A small army of security agents and machine gun-toting
soldiers stood guard outside.
	   ``Sitting here, I feel like one of your soldiers,'' Balaguer,
91, joked. Castro, 72, urged Balaguer _ a prolific, if
controversial and occasionally racist, author _ to keep writing.
	   On the fourth day of his first visit to the Dominican Republic,
Castro also met with an old friend, former President Juan Bosch,
and Peggy Cabral, widow of the late leftist politician Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez.
	   Castro also was visiting Bani, hometown of Gen. Maximo Gomez,
who fought for Cuba's independence from Spain in the late 19th
century.
	   As president of the Dominican Republic for most of the past
three decades, the conservative Balaguer was one of Latin America's
last ``caudillos,'' or strongmen.
	   Under Balaguer, the Dominican Republic was staunchly
anti-communist and one of the biggest U.S. aid recipients in the
Caribbean. His meeting Sunday with Castro was seen here as a
symbolic closing chapter for two wily politicians who have ruled
through force and pragmatism.
	   Bosch, a onetime Marxist, spent time in exile in Cuba. With
Castro's help, he plotted in the 1940s to overthrow Dominican
dictator Rafael Trujillo.
	   Bosch gained the Dominican presidency in 1962 only to be quickly
overthrown by the army. When leftists tried to restore him to power
in 1965, the United States _ fearing another communist Cuba in the
Caribbean _ invaded with 20,000 Marines.
	   President Leonel Fernandez, a political ally of Bosch, joined
Castro at Bosch's home Sunday.

	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets of
Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinians,
some children, went on for several hours Sunday even as an Israeli
army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired towards Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Settler children then headed towards the Palestinian-run
vegetable market, closed since the curfew began Thursday. Israeli
TV footage showed a handful of children, wearing traditional
knitted skullcaps, overturning market stalls and dumping produce on
the ground.

Serbs launch new assaults in Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 8th graf to reflect Serbs claiming KLA attacks on
police Sunday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STUDENCANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The sound of tank fire boomed and
smoke drifted over the sear hills. The women and children scrambled
to flee the latest Serb assault Sunday, but the grizzled peasant
stood his ground.
	   ``I leave my life in God's hands,'' Raif Makica declared as the
tractor pulled out of his barnyard and headed for the mountains,
dragging a trailer overflowing with his 20-member family, a few
mattresses, and food for the day. ``I cannot leave my land. I
cannot leave my animals.''
	   Sunday brought fresh assaults by Serb police and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, in their monthslong attempt to
eradicate an insurrection by militant ethnic Albanians fighting to
wrest Kosovo province away from Serbia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav Federation, where Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly
9-1. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between rebels and
government forces since the Serbs launched a major offensive Feb.
28.
	   At least 230,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, already have
been displaced since fighting escalated.
	   After a string of defeats in recent weeks, the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army has announced it would switch to guerrilla tactics
rather than face the powerful Serbian police and Yugoslav army in
an open confrontation.
	   KLA commanders in Studencane said Sunday that villages were
being targeted across a 15-kilometer (nearly 10-mile) front
southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   The attacks were thought to be in retaliation for reported KLA
attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serbian police and a Yugoslav
army unit in the same region, along the road leading south from the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Civilians in the area _ which includes the villages of Pecane,
Recane, Studencane, and Samodraza _ fled the attack. Dozens of
tractors moved along the dirt road toward nearby Pirane pulling
trailers overloaded with women and children, blankets and whatever
else could hastily be grabbed from targeted homes.
	   ``They have been shooting since this morning,'' said Hanife
Jahay, cradling one of her two children. She and other women were
crying, or red-eyed. For Jahay, it was the second flight in less
then a month _ she had escaped to Studencane from a nearby village
in early August after a Serb assault.
	   On a nearby hill, guerrilla fighter Bekhrim Hajdari peered
through a rifle sight toward the hazy smoke rising above the
targeted area, several kilometers (miles) away. He said the
villages were being hit by tank and large-caliber mortar fire. Then
he drove away with another fighter to search for casualties.
	   The assault began after police ordered residents early Sunday to
evacuate from a suburb of the town of Suva Reka, 45 kilometers
(about 30 miles) southwest of Pristina, and took positions there to
open fire on KLA positions. In Pristina early Sunday, some
residents stood by roadsides with ears cupped to listen to the
distant sound of artillery fire.
	   A report from the Serb-run Media Center said bodies of a mother
and a daughter, aged 44 and 19, were found near a road south of
Suva Reka, blindfolded, hands tied and shot dead. The report said
they were likely killed by ``Albanian extremists'' because they
were loyal to the Serbian authorities.
	   Further to the east Sunday, Albanians said the sound of
detonations could be heard at the KLA stronghold of Urosevac, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina. Fighting also was reported
along two stretches of the Pristina-Pec road.
	   The Albanians claimed the Serbs have embarked on a new offensive
to purge the rebels and secure important roads. As further
evidence, they cited yet another alleged attack on a cluster of
villages several kilometers (miles) to the north, closer to
Pristina.

Nigeria's Abubakar arrives in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdusalam Abubakar, Sunday arrived for a three-day visit to
South Africa, where he will meet President Nelson Mandela.
	   The visit, his first foreign trip since he took office in June,
is a landmark in relations between the two countries that have been
at odds over Nigeria's military regime in past years.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a
heart attack in June.
	   Abubakar is to brief South African legislators on his plans to
democratize Nigeria, and to meet Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   The Congo crisis also will be discussed, a government statement
said.

U.S. Embassy guards in Tirana shoot, kill Albanian police intruder

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 10th graf with family members saying policeman was
depressed, no sign of anti-American sentiment &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Security guards at the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana shot and killed an Albanian policeman who scaled the wall of
the U.S. diplomatic compound Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The motive of the break-in was not immediately known, but an
American diplomat who declined to be named described it as a small
incident that had nothing to do with fears of a possible terrorist
attack.
	   ``We have reason to believe that this was an isolated incident
of a particular person, although we are concerned about threats at
all our embassies and Tirana is clearly one of them,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told ABC-TV.
	   The shooting came a week after 120 heavily armed Marines
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana
after U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan
to attack the mission.
	   On Friday, police and intelligence agents reportedly raided
several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested 10 foreign
citizens.
	   The Interior Ministry, in an official statement, said the
policeman climbed the 2-meter (7-foot) -high wall at the embassy's
rear about 11:45 a.m. Albanian police outside the embassy started
shooting in the air to force him to stop, and after he fired back
with a pistol security officers shot him.
	   A ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity
identified the guards who did the shooting as American, not
Albanian.
	   The policeman had at least two bullet wounds, one near the
heart, and died soon afterward in surgery at a nearby military
hospital, doctors were quoted by Albanian TV as saying.
	   He was identified as Shkelqim Shehu, 35, a member of a police
unit in charge of security at a Tirana bank.
	   Relatives in Ndroq told Associated Press Television that Shehu,
divorced and with two children, had an extremely poor family and
was depressed. On Saturday night, they said, he told his mother he
would not live to see age 40. No anti-American feelings were
evident among relatives or family members.
	   Albanian police surrounded the embassy immediately after the
shooting and sealed off surrounding roads, and U.S. Marines
fortified the compound.
	   Security at the embassy has been stepped up in recent days
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and
again after retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan. An evacuation of embassy staffers
continued Sunday, but the Americans said it was planned and had
nothing to do with the shooting.

Egypt's Foreign Minister pays surprise visit to Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting's end, Moussa's comments,
CHANGES overline; TRIMS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held
talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad on ways to revive
the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Moussa, who arrived earlier on a surprise one-day visit, told
reporters he and the president had discussed Egypt's proposal to
convene an international conference on the process.
	   Syria's government-run media have criticized the idea of such a
conference, saying it could give Israel a pretext to back off from
the peace terms laid down at the 1991 Madrid Conference.
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said Sunday that Moussa was preparing
the ground for a Mubarak visit to Syria.
	   Moussa also met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and
discussed bilateral and regional issues, the stalled Arab-Israeli
peace talks and the recent U.S. strikes against Afghanistan and
Sudan.
	   The Egyptian minister left Damascus late Sunday.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians are currently stalled
over Israel's refusal to endorse a U.S. proposal calling for an
Israeli withdrawal of 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Syria, which has not held peace talks with Israel since early
1996, is irked by Israel's recent decision to build 4,800 new homes
on the occupied Golan Heights.
	   The construction of the homes ``is tangible evidence that Israel
does not want peace,'' al-Sharaa told reporters. ``The Israeli
government is looking for all possible obstacles in order not to
resume negotiations from the point where they last reached.''
	   Syria says it will resume negotiations with Israel only after it
pledges to make a complete withdrawal from the Golan, which it
captured in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981.

	   HEBRON, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets of
Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinians,
some children, went on for several hours Sunday even as an Israeli
army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired toward Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Settler children then headed to the Palestinian-run vegetable
market, closed since the curfew began Thursday. Israeli TV footage
showed a handful of children, wearing traditional knitted
skullcaps, overturning market stalls and dumping produce on the
ground.

Sweden's Gronberg moves three ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Mathias Gronberg stormed away from the
field to win the 1.25 million (dlrs 2 million) European Open by 10
strokes at the K Club near Dublin on Sunday.
	   The 28-year-old Swede clinched the 208,300 pounds (dlrs 344,000)
winners' purse, the second richest prize on the European tour, with
a last-round 69 to finish 13-under with a total of 275.
	   Gronberg, whose last win on tour was in the 1995 European
masters, started the last round with a three stroke lead over
America's Craig Hainline.
	   He was six strokes ahead of third-placed Darren Clarke, Bernhard
Langer and Jose Rivero.
	   But he eclipsed the big names of European golf in testing
conditions on Sunday. European tour leader Lee Westwood was an
early casualty, withdrawing with a hip injury on the sixth hole of
the final round after slumping to 13-over par.
	   Only five other players finished with sub-par totals on the
par-72 course, with Wales' Phillip Price sinking a 10-foot birdie
putt on the last hole to share second place with Spain's Miguel
Angel Jimenez on three under.
	   Jimenez closed with a 69 for a total of 285 and held outright
second until Price sunk his birdie putt to finish with a 1-under
final round 71.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke finished in fourth place,
missing his chance to overtake Lee Westwood and go into No.1 on the
European tour money list.
	   Clarke fired a closing round 73 to finish with 286. First or
second place at the K Club would have moved him from No. 2 to No. 1
in Europe.
	   Hainline blew out in the last round, closing with a 6-over 78
for a share of sixth place on 287 with Argentina's Angel Cabrera,
who closed with a 67.
	   The American rookie was the leading challenger in the first
three rounds, carding 71-69-69, but encountered trouble on the last
day and dropped six strokes to finish with a 1-under par total.
	   Bernard Langer and Jose Rivero also finished poorly. Langer
fired a 75 to finish with an even total 288, while Rivero hit 76 to
finish one stroke further back.

Women's corpses found on Bahamas resort island

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Police on a Bahamian resort island have
found the corpse of a visiting British tourist and another body
that investigators say may be a missing Virginia schoolteacher.
	   The two bodies were found Saturday afternoon on Paradise Island,
a resort area near Nassau, police said Sunday. They were in an area
of bushes separating the island's golf course from a secluded part
of Cabbage Beach.
	   Police identified one of the women as Joanne Clarke, 24, who
disappeared Friday afternoon. Police said she was from Britain but
were unsure of her home town.
	   The other corpse was badly decomposed, and officials said they
would not be able to identify it until after an autopsy on Monday
or Tuesday. However, police superintendent Arnold Josey said it
might be 32-year-old Lori Fogleman, a second grade teacher from
Richmond, Virginia who disappeared July 20.
	   Fogleman's purse was found in late July about a mile (1-1/2
kilometers) from where the body was discovered. She was last seen
driving a rental car on Paradise Island.
	   Josey would not say how the two women were killed but said
investigators believe the deaths might be linked.
	   Clarke was visiting Nassau on a three-week vacation and had gone
to the beach Friday with a female friend and the 10-year-old son of
another acquaintance. Her companions left the beach about 3 p.m.
	   When her friend returned at 5 p.m., Clarke was missing.
	   Police, friends, members of the Bahamas Air Sea Rescue
Association and local volunteers searched for Clarke on Saturday.
They found her about 3 p.m. lying face down among the bushes.
	   Clarke was dressed in a blouse and jeans, indicating she may
have been leaving the beach when she was attacked, Josey said.

Gronberg wins by 10 strokes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS headline

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Mathias Gronberg stormed away from the
field to win the 1.25 million (dlrs 2 million) European Open by 10
strokes at the K Club near Dublin on Sunday.
	   The 28-year-old Swede clinched the 208,300 pounds (dlrs 344,000)
winners' purse, the second richest prize on the European tour, with
a last-round 69 to finish 13-under with a total of 275.
	   Gronberg, whose last win on tour was in the 1995 European
masters, started the last round with a three stroke lead over
America's Craig Hainline.
	   He was six strokes ahead of third-placed Darren Clarke, Bernhard
Langer and Jose Rivero.
	   But he eclipsed the big names of European golf in testing
conditions on Sunday. European tour leader Lee Westwood was an
early casualty, withdrawing with a hip injury on the sixth hole of
the final round after slumping to 13-over par.
	   Only five other players finished with sub-par totals on the
par-72 course, with Wales' Phillip Price sinking a 10-foot birdie
putt on the last hole to share second place with Spain's Miguel
Angel Jimenez on three under.
	   Jimenez closed with a 69 for a total of 285 and held outright
second until Price sunk his birdie putt to finish with a 1-under
final round 71.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke finished in fourth place,
missing his chance to overtake Lee Westwood and go into No.1 on the
European tour money list.
	   Clarke fired a closing round 73 to finish with 286. First or
second place at the K Club would have moved him from No. 2 to No. 1
in Europe.
	   Hainline blew out in the last round, closing with a 6-over 78
for a share of sixth place on 287 with Argentina's Angel Cabrera,
who closed with a 67.
	   The American rookie was the leading challenger in the first
three rounds, carding 71-69-69, but encountered trouble on the last
day and dropped six strokes to finish with a 1-under par total.
	   Bernard Langer and Jose Rivero also finished poorly. Langer
fired a 75 to finish with an even total 288, while Rivero hit 76 to
finish one stroke further back.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Back from the brink, President Laurent
Kabila's quest for regional military support paid off Sunday when
his Angolan allies captured a key rebel stronghold in western
Congo.
	   The rebels acknowledged losing the town, but said they were
continuing their advance on Kinshasa, the capital, and had also
captured the important eastern city of Kisangani.
	   The strategic Angolan victory was a much needed boost for an
embattled Kabila, but it also threatens to transform Congo into a
proxy battlefield for a region-wide war of shifting alliances and
uncertain prospects.
	   With air support and rumbling tanks, Angolan forces drove into
the town of Kitona, near the Atlantic coastline, effectively
cutting off the advancing rebel army from its rear supply base.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' a ministry-level official said on
condition of anonymity. He added that Angola had landed a number of
warplanes at Kinshasa's international airport.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed the
deployment of Angolan troops.
	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Asked earlier Sunday about the Angolan drive toward Kitona,
Mumengi called it a defensive action.
	   Rebel leaders on the other side of the country in the eastern
city of Goma acknowledged the loss of Kitona, but vowed to avenge
the defeat and continue their march toward Kinshasa.
	   Zimbabwean soldiers deployed last week, however, are now helping
to shore up Kinshasa's southern defenses.
	   In the space of several days, the landscape of this, Congo's
second civil war in two years, has dramatically shifted and is fast
expanding into a regional conflict.
	   Rwanda and Uganda _ in support of the rebels _ have repeatedly
warned Zimbabwe and Angola not to get involved.
	   Both countries say they will respond with direct retaliatory
intervention if the Angolans and Zimbabweans don't withdraw.
	   Rwanda last year backed Kabila, as did Uganda, in his bid to
oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. This time around
they are believed to arming and supporting the rebels that seek to
oust Kabila.
	   Zimbabwe, having extended more than dlrs 200 million in military
credits to Congo, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
Angola's involvement may be partially driven by a concern that
Congo's rebels could link up with Angola's UNITA insurgent
movement.
	   Whatever the motivation, Congo's frontlines are becoming
confusingly crowded with regional troops.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, remains away from the capital and holed up at
his residence in the southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's
former rebel stronghold, Information Minister Mumengi said.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who fled to the
rebel side, acknowledged the fall of Kitona _ the first major
setback in a stunning three-week rebel advance on Kinshasa.
	   ``We've made a tactical withdrawal,'' said Karaha, a member of
the rebel political wing, the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
``Kitona is Congo, it will remain Congo. Angola cannot colonize
Congo.''
	   Ironically, Karaha's comments mirror similar statements by
Kabila in recent weeks. He has accused Rwandan Tutsis of using the
rebel movement _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disaffected members of the Kabila's army _ to create a
regional Tutsi empire.
	   Kitona was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   But Karaha said the news was not all bad for the rebels,
claiming rebel fighters had captured Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city. That claim could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa tried
to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria. Two key
leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and his ally, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu were at the meetings.
	   Kabila was represented by his justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo.
	   President Nelson Mandela told reporters that an agreement was
adopted unanimously Sunday by 12 members of the Southern African
Development Community, calling for an immediate cease-fire and
recognizing Kabila's continuing right to govern in the face of the
rebel incursion.
	   It seemed unlikely, though, that the call to lay down arms would
be heeded.
	   Karaha said earlier in the day that with the intervention of
Angolan forces, chances of a negotiated settlement are ``almost
impossible.''

	   The quake occurred at 7:57 a.m. (1357 GMT) and was centered in
the Pacific Ocean about 100 miles (160 kilometers) off Puerto
Sandino, or about 140 miles (230 kilometers) west of Managua.
	   Nicaragua's National Seismological Institute said the
near-surface quake was caused by movement between the Cocos and
Caribbean tectonic plates.
	   Firefighters and the Red Cross said they had no reports of any
damages.
	   Authorities in El Salvador reported a quake at the same time,
but assigned it a magnitude of 6.2.
	   The quake was felt in southern El Salvador, but no injuries or
damages were reported there.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former Iranian chief prosecutor was shot
dead Sunday by unidentified assailants, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, who was also a former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization _ was killed by two gunmen at his drapery shop
in Tehran's grand bazaar, the agency said.
	   One of the gunmen opened fire from an Uzi submachine gun as
Lajevardi, 63, was speaking to them.
	   Police arrested one of the gunmen. The fate of the other gunman
was not immediately known.
	   An elderly man who tried to intervene was also shot dead, the
agency said.
	   The Baghdad-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group said it was
responsible for Lajevardi's assassination.
	   ``At noon today, Mujahedeen operational units in Tehran carried
out an operation targeting Assadollah Lajevardi, the Butcher of
Evin,'' said a Mujahedeen statement telephoned to the Associated
Press office in Cairo.
	   Lajevardi was at one time the head of the notorious Evin prison
in northern Tehran.
	   The Mujahedeen statement said one of Lajevardi's bodyguards was
killed in the attack and several others were wounded during
``intense'' clashes between Mujahedeen gunmen and the bodyguards.
	   It said the attack was carried out to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of ``the biggest massacre of political prisoners in
Iran in the summer of 1988, in which more than 30,000 political
prisoners were summarily executed ... under Lajevardi's
supervision.''
	   Independent sources say about 250 prisoners were killed.
	   President Mohammad Khatami said in a statement broadcast on
state television he had ordered Iranian intelligence to catch the
assassins and bring them to justice.
	   The television service described Lajevardi as a ``tireless
struggler for the Islamic revolution'' and ``a selfless soldier''
of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and a
``companion'' of the current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Kipketer stunned in 800, O'Sullivan clinches second gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's relay, Edwards wins triple jump &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, still unfit
after a bout of malaria earlier this year, suffered a stunning
defeat at the European Championship and finished last in the men's
800-meter Sunday.
	   Kipketer, the Kenyan-born world champion and world
record-holder, was at the front of the pack coming out of the last
bend.
	   But Nils Schumann of Germany then made his move, elbowing his
way past Andrea Longo of Italy and Kipketer. Schumann tangled
briefly with Kipketer, who glanced at the German in anger.
	   Kipketer, running his first European championship after becoming
a Danish citizen, appeared to lose his stride and seemed to be
tiring as he was passed by all seven finalists.
	   Kipketer had a bout with malaria in February and did not start
training until late May.
	   Schumann, 20, European junior champion, held off Andre Bucher of
Switzerland to win the gold in 1:44.89. Bucher clocked 1:45.04,
while Lukas Vydra of the Czech Republic took bronze at 1:45.23.
	   ``I thought he may not be so quick in the finish,'' Schumann
said. ``I tried to stay with him as long as I could and then try to
win in the finish, which is my strength.''
	   ``To beat a world champion and world record holder is
incredible,'' he said.
	   The final gold medal of the championship went to Jonathan
Edwards of Britain in the men's triple jump. Edwards, world record
holder, soared 17.99 meters, second longest of the year after his
18.01, and a championship record.
	   That gave Britain a championship-high nine gold medals and a
total of 16.
	   Germany, which like Britain had three golds on the final day,
finished with eight golds and 23 medals overall, tops in the event.
Russia ended with 22 medals, including six golds.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the 5,000-meter gold medal to
her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the last 100 meters.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   ``I just can't believe it, a double gold!'' O'Sullivan said.
``All the way down the home straight I was just desperate to cross
the finish line, my legs were shaking.''
	   Grit Breuer also earned her second gold medal when she led
Germany to victory in the women's 4x400 relay by running a superb
anchor leg and blowing past Russia's Olga Kotlyarova in the last 20
meters.
	   O'Sullivan overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of
Romania coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a
slow 15 minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Breuer, who came back from a doping ban in 1995, won the
individual 400 on Friday. She also ran a similar anchor leg to give
Germany the world title last year. Germany clocked 3:23.03.
	   ``It was close but I was relaxed and I just waited because I
knew the Russian would slow down,'' Breuer said.
	   Russia finished second in 3:25.56 and Britain third in 3:25.56.
	   Britain won the men's 4x400, ahead of Poland and France.
	   Portugal's Manuela Machado set a new championship record and
clocked her best time ever in winning the marathon in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 10 seconds.
	   Machado, 35, the defending champion, eclipsed the old
championships record of 2:28:38 set in 1986 for fellow Portuguese
Rosa Mota.
	   Her previous personal best was 2:27:42.
	   Russia's Madina Biktagirova took the marathon silver in 2:28:01
followed closely by Italian Marua Viceconte 2:28:31, all three
under the old championships record.
	   Lars Riedel, four-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
threw 67.07 meters in his first attempt to win the gold medal in
the men's discus, beating veteran 38-year-old German teammate
Juergen Schult. It was Riedel's first European title.
	   Schult, Olympic champion in 1988 and 1987 world titlist and
former European champion who still holds the world record of 74.08
set in 1986, gained silver at 66.69.
	   Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania took bronze at 66.46.
	   Steve Backley, Olympic and world silver medalist, won his third
straight javelin European title with a throw of 89.72 meters and
led a 1-2 British finish. Mick Hill took silver at 86.92 and
Raymond Hecht of Germany bronze at 86.63.
	   Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia pulled away from
world champion Carla Sacramento of Portugal in the final bend and
went on win the women's 1,500 in 4:11.91. Sacramento clocked
4:12.62, while Anita Weyerman of Switzerland took bronze at
4:13.06.
	   In the women's high jump, Monica Dinescu of Romania cleared 1.97
meters to win the gold medal. Donata Jancewicz of Poland edged
Alina Astafei of Germany for the silver with both clearing 1.95.
	   Damian Kallabis of Germany upset defending champion Alessandro
Lambruschini of Italy to win the 3,000 steeplechase in 8:13.10.
Lambruschini, Olympic bronze medalist, clocked 8:16.70, while the
bronze went to Jim Svenoy of Norway in 8:18.97.
	   Svetla Dimitrova of Bulgaria defended her 100-meter hurdles
title by holding off Olympic silver medalist Brigita Bukovec of
Slovenia. Dimitrova won in 12.56, Bukovec was second in 12.65 and
Irina Korotya of Russia third in 12.85.

Yeltsin dismisses government, reappoints Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with reaction, background,
details. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the Russian
government Sunday and replaced his young prime minister with the
Soviet-style leader he'd fired five months ago.
	   The surprise announcement came in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse, and one week after the
Russian government effectively devalued its national currency, the
ruble.
	   Yeltsin gave no reason for firing Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect from
Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem the
collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation of
the economy.
	   The president, on the last day of a five-week vacation, issued a
terse announcement through his press service firing Kiriyenko and
his cabinet and appointing former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of firing top aides when things
aren't going well, always trying to shift the blame and absolve
himself of any responsibility. He has fired dozens of ministers
during his years in the Kremlin.
	   ``It's simply comical,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko bloc in parliament. He said the decision ``reveals
the deep confusion and uncertainty at the center of executive
power,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``It's not going to be good,'' said Charles Blitzer, a London
investment banker who used to head the World Bank office in Moscow.
``It's hard to see where Russia goes from here when they appoint a
prime minister who so demonstrably did little about the fundamental
problems as prime minister before.''
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Yeltsin fought hard to get Kiriyenko ratified in parliament,
angrily rejecting demands that he find another, more experienced
premier. At one point, it appeared he might dissolve parliament
because of the impasse over Kiriyenko's appointment.
	   Kiriyenko had barely been ratified when Russia's economy went
into a tailspin, a victim of plunging world oil prices and the
Asian economic crisis.
	   Since then, the young prime minister had been waging a losing
battle to shore up the economy. He worked tirelessly to defend the
ruble, negotiate loans with Western lenders and push reform
measures through a hostile parliament dominated by communists and
their allies.
	   Last week, the government conceded defeat in the fight to save
the ruble, announcing Monday that it was effectively devaluing the
currency by allowing its value to slip by up to 34 percent against
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Friday, all factions of the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, including those usually supportive of the government,
had demanded Kiriyenko's resignation. The Duma also passed a
resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, whose government was ``not capable of
working efficiently,'' the Interfax news agency reported. However,
he criticized the reappointment of Chernomyrdin.
	   ``This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former cabinet was doing,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is due to hold a summit meeting
with Yeltsin in a little over a week, had expected a shakeup and
was not worried by it, a White House official said in Edgartown,
Mass., where Clinton is vacationing.
	   ``It's policies, not personalities,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity,
	   Chernomyrdin, a stolid figure who had seemed to offer a
counterweight in the past to Yeltsin's bluster, had busied himself
since being fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential
campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin could win the
presidency, although he could probably count on support from at
least part of the business and banking establishment.

Swedish captain picks four Swedish wild cards for September match
</HEADLINE>
against U.S. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ European captain Pia Nilsson on Sunday
picked four Swedes as wild card-entries for next month's Solheim
Cup matches against defending champion United States at Muirfield
Village, Ohio.
	   Nilsson, one of the first Swedes to play on the (U.S.) PLGA
Tour, named former U.S. Open champion Liselotte Neumann, Catrin
Nilsmark, Sophie Gustafson and Charlotta Sorenstam in addition to
Lisa Hackney of Britain after the Compaq Open.
	   Annika Sorenstam earned one of the seven automatic spots by
winning the European Tour event. The two-time former U.S. Open
champion, who's ranked No. 1 in the world, won the tournament by a
record 10 shots. Charlotta Sorenstam, Annika's younger sister, also
plays on the LPGA Tour.
	   ``I started crying when I heard the news,'' Charlotta Sorenstam
said. ``I have dreamt about this. The Solheim Cup is the biggest
tournament for us.''
	   Annika Sorenstam believes European can beat the Americans in the
Sept. 18-20 matches on the Jack Nicklaus-designed course.
	   ``We haven't had such a good team in a long time,'' she said
``There are many Swedes on the team, we know each other and that's
good for the team spirit.''
	   Helen Alfredsson, another Swedish star on the LPGA Tour, former
U.S. Open champions Laura Davies and Alison Nicholas, fellow
Britons Trish Johnson and Catriona Matthew and Marie-Laure de
Lorenzi of France were the other automatic six selections.
	   The United States beat Europe in the 1996 matches in Wales. The
United States also won in 1994 and 1990 while Europe prevailed in
1992.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former Iranian chief prosecutor was shot

	   Lajevardi, a hard-liner who supported parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's presidential elections, was a key
figure in Iranian politics before the revolution.
	   He was a founding member of the Coalition of Islamic Mourning
Group, an influential body whose members hold key government posts.
He was also involved in the bombing of the Israeli El Al airline
offices in Tehran in the early 1970s, before the Islamic
revolution. He was jailed for two years for complicity in
assassination attempt on former prime minister Hassan Ali Mansoor
in 1965.

Italy's Serpellini wins Tour of Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Marco Serpellini of Italy won the
2,177-kilometer (1,350-mile) Tour of Portugal on Sunday.
	   Portugal's Orlando Rodrigues, who won the Tour in 1994 and the
following year, came second in the overall standings, while Italian
Wladimir Belli took third.
	   Britain's Jeremy Hunt won the 137.8-kilometer (85-mile) final
stage between Caldas da Rainha and Lisbon. But Serpellini's lead
was enough to give him overall victory.
	   He had seized the yellow jersey on Saturday from Belli, who had
held it for four consecutive legs.
	   The race began in the southern Spanish city of Seville Aug. 10.
	   After seven Italian racers failed blood tests and were
disqualified in the first three days, the race looked set to be
marred by the kind of doping scandals that plagued last month's
Tour de France.
	   However the remaining 10 days, which took riders through
northern Portugal before turning south to the capital, were
trouble-free.

Yeltsin past master at shifting blame, but few Russians believe
</HEADLINE>
him &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia once again deep in crisis, Boris
Yeltsin reached for his favorite tactic: firing his own deputies to
try and shift the blame.
	   While he may lack ideas on how to tackle Russia's never-ending
problems, Yeltsin is never slow when it comes to claiming it wasn't
his fault. But most Russians long ago stopped believing that the
man at the top is not to blame.
	   The president's sudden dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday is the latest in a long line of government
shakeups.
	   Whenever the government's policies have run into trouble or
popular resistance, Yeltsin has unflinchingly blamed the men he
appointed and dodged any responsibility.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union left him master of the
Kremlin seven years ago, Yeltsin has followed two rules: The blame
for whatever goes wrong must be laid on others, and no one can rise
above him or encroach upon his power or position.
	   At times, the government has ended up looking like a comic
opera.
	   When market reforms first started to run into problems in the
early 1990s, Yeltsin dismissed then-Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar,
bringing in Soviet-era technocrat Viktor Chernomyrdin as a safe
pair of hands.
	   Now Chernomyrdin, who was unexpectedly and ignominiously ousted
in March, is back. Kiriyenko, who was plucked from obscurity and
presented as the man who could save Russia, is out.
	   Much of the latest financial crisis reflects world economic
problems and the drop in Russia's vital oil sales that has forced
the Russian government to back down on promises not to devalue the
currency.
	   Perhaps no government could have done much about such problems,
but Yeltsin sees only one thing _ blaming somebody else.
	   Several of Russia's top liberal economic reformers have become
political yo-yos, filling and then losing ministerial posts from
year to year as they fail to produce results or their policies hit
popular opposition.
	   When the Communists, his main foes, started to do well in the
polls in 1995, Yeltsin brought some of their leaders into the
government, only to drop them when he grew tired of political
cooperation.
	   Yeltsin, like most political leaders, wants to be loved by his
people. He sees himself as an historic figure who is leading Russia
from a tortured Soviet past to a prosperous, democratic future.
	   Most Russians now see him as a buffoon who has presided over the
wholesale decline of the country. His popularity rating in polls
has been hovering around 2 percent.
	   Critics and allies worry about his lack of strong leadership,
health problems that have sidelined him for months at a time and a
drinking problem stretching back years.
	   But the president's latest government shakeup wasn't just
another prank or aberration, rather a classic example of Yeltsin
the politician at work.
	   This is the Yeltsin who insists on taking enormous power and
delighting in dramatic interventions to show he's in charge, while
showing little appetite for making government policies work. This
is the Yeltsin who tries to shift the blame if things don't go
right.
	   As president, Yeltsin sees his role as setting general policy
for the government. He then expects his ministers and subordinates
to achieve his aims, rarely getting involved in the actual details.
	   If a policy is not realized, or if it encounters too much
opposition, Yeltsin will blame his subordinates, scolding them in
public and dismissing them. If popular opposition doesn't abate,
Yeltsin will often change course or co-opt critics into the
government.
	   Yeltsin does appear to believe that democratic reforms are
Russia's only hope. But he has neither the inclination nor the
determination to drive those policies through and the enormous task
of transforming Russia has bogged down in inefficiency and constant
crisis.
	   The Russian czars never took the blame for what went wrong in
their day even though they were autocrats, instead blaming their
own ministers. Which is just one of the reasons many Russians now
refer to Yeltsin as the czar.

Chernomyrdin, the old reliable, returns to top job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For six years, Viktor Chernomyrdin was the
quintessential right-hand man _ colorless, reliable, and seemingly
content to sit in his boss's shadow.
	   While President Boris Yeltsin hired, fired and reshuffled scores
of Cabinet ministers, Chernomyrdin stayed in place, apparently
immune from Yeltsin's volatile style of leadership.
	   That ended without warning last March, when Chernomyrdin was
unceremoniously dumped, replaced with the perky Kiriyenko, who was
25 years younger. Yeltsin said it was time for a new generation.
	   But when the new generation failed to stave off economic
disaster, Yeltsin turned once again to the old, reliable
Chernomyrdin.
	   Chernomyrdin was born outside the industrial southern Urals city
of Orenburg in 1938. He attended a technical school, and his first
job was as a mechanic in an oil refinery.
	   He joined the Communist Party apparat and moved up slowly and
deliberately until he became minister of natural gas in 1985 and
president of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom in 1989 _ Russia's
largest company.
	   Yeltsin appointed him premier in December 1992. To the surprise
of many, he supported market reforms such as tight budgets and
monetary policies to fight inflation, following guidelines set by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   In 1997, after six years of contraction, the economy posted its
first growth. Some praised it as a triumph of Chernomyrdin's
leadership. Others said it was his fault the turnaround took so
long _ he continued to favor his friends in the energy sector and
resisted breaking up state monopolies and closing down money-losing
industries.
	   Analysts said a major reason for Chernomyrdin's ouster was that
Yeltsin became concerned that he was accumulating too much power
and concentrating on building his presidential campaign for 2000.
	   He declared his presidential intentions after he was dismissed,
and in recent months has worked full-time on his campaign. However,
he was seen as a secondary candidate, whose dour demeanor and
technocratic language did little to inspire voters. It was not
clear what effect his reappointment would have on his presidential
ambitions.

Oslo Channel players mark fifth anniversary of troubled Middle East

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
arrived in the Norwegian capital Sunday to help commemorate the
fifth anniversary of the now-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace pact
secretly negotiated in Oslo.
	   His counterpart in those secret talks, Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, was expected in Oslo on Monday to join Peres in
ceremonies that include both of them giving talks at the Norwegian
Nobel Institute, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was skipping
the ceremonies, which he last week dismissed as ``nostalgia.''
Netanyahu had staunchly opposed the Oslo Accords and the peace
process has been stalled since he became prime minister in May
1996.
	   ``We have the wrong government,'' said Peres, speaking briefly
to reporters at Oslo's Fornebu Airport.
	   In the margins of the ceremonies, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross palnned
to meet privately in Oslo with Netanyahu's advisers and Palestinian
negotiators, reported the Norwegian state broadcast network NRK.
	   ``We've had a stalemate for a very long time and it's very
important that we overcome that stalemate,'' he said in an
interview with NRK.
	   Peres was foreign minister in 1993 and led an Israeli team of
negotiators in the secret Oslo talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
	   The talks led to what is now called the Oslo Accords on mutual
recognition and to a framework agreement on Palestinian autonomy.
The agreement was completed in Oslo on Aug. 19-20, 1993 signed
Sept. 13, 1993 in Washington D.C.
	   Peres, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shared
the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end decades of
conflict in the Middle East. Peres became prime minister after
Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist in 1995.
	   Key players in the secret talks, including the Norwegian,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams of 1993, were gathering
for a government dinner on Sunday evening, followed by meetings
with top Norwegian political leaders and the lectures by Peres and
Arafat on Monday.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Packing 115-mph (184-kph) winds and
threatening to grow stronger, Hurricane Bonnie stalled off the
Bahamas on Sunday but is expected to continue on a tack that could
hit landfall in the eastern United States.
	   The increasing winds made Bonnie a Category 3 hurricane, which
have winds of more than 111 mph (178 kph) and are capable of
extensive damage. The storm moved slightly northward about 190
miles (305 kilometers) east-northeast of San Salvador in the
central Bahamas, but the National Hurricane Center in Miami said it
was expected to turn to the northwest later Sunday.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center said in a
statement Sunday. The storm's winds were expected to increase.
	   Rough seas caused by the storm slammed three sailboats onto a
beach in Grand Turk, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the
storm's center. Residents rescued all 14 people on the boats, Turks
and Caicos police reported.
	   In the Pacific Ocean, the winds of Hurricane Howard held steady
at around 144 mph (230 kph) Sunday morning, but forecasters
predicted the hurricane would peter out harmlessly.
	   The Atlantic season's first hurricane, Bonnie, at more than 300
miles (480 kilometers) long, dwarfed sparsely populated Bahamian
islands, drenching them with rain and gusty winds.
	   Turks and Caicos police said a 40-foot (12-meter) Haitian sloop
and a 47-foot (14-meter) ketch from the United States broke from
their anchors Saturday and were driven 500 yards (450 meters) into
a nearby beach.
	   On Sunday morning, seas snapped the anchor rope of a second
40-foot (12-meter) sailboat from Haiti and drove it onto the same
beach.
	   Bonnie's worst thunderstorms battered the open seas to its
north, said National Hurricane Center forecaster John Guiney.
	   ``The lucky thing is ... the Bahamas will not be feeling the
full brunt of the storm,'' he said. But he noted that Bonnie has
been ``very erratic ... meandering around,'' making forecasts less
reliable.
	   At 2 p.m. Sunday (1800 GMT), the hurricane center said Bonnie
was expected to resume a northwesterly motion that would take it
northeast of the central Bahamas.
	   San Salvador administrator Charles King said by telephone that
islanders had prepared for Bonnie because ``they learned their
lesson with Hurricane Lili'' in 1996. Then, people tried to put up
shutters as the storm smashed into the island, which has a
population of 550. There was flooding but no severe damage.
	   Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the
hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet (1.8-2.7 meters) above
normal, and Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause flooding.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, still unfit
after a bout of malaria earlier this year, suffered a stunning
defeat at the European Championship and finished last in the men's
800-meter Sunday.
	   Kipketer, the Kenyan-born world champion and world
record-holder, was at the front of the pack coming out of the last
bend.
	   But Nils Schumann of Germany then made his move, elbowing his
way past Andrea Longo of Italy and Kipketer. Schumann tangled
briefly with Kipketer, who glanced at the German in anger.
	   Kipketer, running his first European championship after becoming
a Danish citizen, appeared to lose his stride and seemed to be
tiring as he was passed by all seven finalists.
	   Kipketer had a bout with malaria in February and did not start
training until late May.
	   Schumann, 20, European junior champion, held off Andre Bucher of
Switzerland to win the gold in 1:44.89. Bucher clocked 1:45.04,
while Lukas Vydra of the Czech Republic took bronze at 1:45.23.
	   ``I thought he may not be so quick in the finish,'' Schumann
said. ``I tried to stay with him as long as I could and then try to
win in the finish, which is my strength.''
	   ``To beat a world champion and world record holder is
incredible,'' he said.
	   The final gold medal of the championship went to Jonathan
Edwards of Britain in the men's triple jump. Edwards, world record
holder, soared 17.99 meters, second longest of the year after his
18.01, and a championship record.
	   That gave Britain a championship-high nine gold medals and a
total of 16.
	   Germany, which like Britain had three golds on the final day,
finished with eight golds and 23 medals overall, tops in the event.
Russia ended with 22 medals, including six golds.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland added the 5,000-meter gold medal to
her 10,000 title by surging ahead in the last 100 meters.
	   O'Sullivan, a former world champion in the distance, picked up
her second gold medal in the same style she won the 10,000 on
Wednesday _ by using her powerful kick in the finish.
	   ``I just can't believe it, a double gold!'' O'Sullivan said.
``All the way down the home straight I was just desperate to cross
the finish line, my legs were shaking.''
	   Grit Breuer also earned her second gold medal when she led
Germany to victory in the women's 4x400 relay by running a superb
anchor leg and blowing past Russia's Olga Kotlyarova in the last 20
meters.
	   O'Sullivan overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of
Romania coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a
slow 15 minutes, 6.50 seconds.
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo clocked 15:08.31 for silver, and Marta Dominguez of Spain
took bronze at 15:10.54.
	   Breuer, who came back from a doping ban in 1995, won the
individual 400 on Friday. She also ran a similar anchor leg to give
Germany the world title last year. Germany clocked 3:23.03.
	   ``It was close but I was relaxed and I just waited because I
knew the Russian would slow down,'' Breuer said.
	   Russia finished second in 3:25.56 and Britain third in 3:25.56.
	   Britain won the men's 4x400, ahead of Poland and Spain. France,
originally third, was disqualified.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In the 1991 Gulf War, American warplanes
bombed a factory west of Baghdad. The United States said the
facility was a biological weapons plant. Iraq said it produced
formula milk for babies, the only one of its kind in the country.
	   Last week, in a deja vu of sorts, the United States attacked
another factory, this time a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts
of Khartoum. Washington said it was making precursors for chemical
weapons. Sudan said no such work occurred.
	   The mystery surrounding the plant remains, perhaps hidden under
the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of antibiotics
piled in rubble of red brick, splintered wood and white plaster.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest many of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for malaria and tuberculosis; it
planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval; it was privately
owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was on a site
of about one square kilometer (less than a square mile) in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum,
next to a plant for generating the capital's electricity.
	   Four main buildings were on the site, three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
	   The factories were destroyed, but the fires inside them still
smoldered on Sunday, emitting a stench of burning plastic. An
industrial lay on top of a collapsed roof, its blades blown by a
light breeze.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered a line
of 87 products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory, who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, said Umbadi and Khartoum
pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxycilin, an
anti-malarial drug, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi said.
	   All those products, packaged in El Shifa's blue and white
cartons, are available at Khartoum pharmacies. So are other El
Shifa antibiotics and drugs to treat ulcers and tuberculosis.
	   The plant produced anywhere from a third to half of Sudan's
domestic market.
	   ``The spectrum of drugs they produce is very wide. No other
factory can produce all of it. There will be a loss,'' said Mona
Hamid, a doctor at Khartoum's Radiation and Isotope Center.
	   Among its products was Shifazole, an antibiotic to treat
parasites in animals. The factory won a contract in January to ship
100,000 one-liter cartons at a cost of dlrs 199,000 to Iraq under a
U.N. exemption to the sanctions imposed in 1990, U.N. documents
show. White cartons of the antibiotic were scattered in the rubble.
	   The shipment was to be sent to Iraq by October, said Alamaddin
Al Shibli, the factory's export manager. The company began
exporting medicine this year to nearby Yemen and was scheduled to
send a shipment of veterinary medicine to Chad by month's end, he
said.
	   The plant was owned by Salah Idris, a Sudanese businessmen who
lives in London, Saudi Arabia and Khartoum, said his lawyer, Ghazi
Suleiman. He denies Idris ever met Osama bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi millionaire the United States blames for the attack on the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, said Suleiman, who
himself is one of Sudan's most prominent opposition figures.
	   ``He didn't believe it at first and he thought the news was
wrong. He was really taken by surprise,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris, who is described as charming and apolitical, purchased
the plant in March 1998 from Bashir Hassan Bashir, a Sudanese
businessman, and Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a prominent Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia-based company, Suleiman said. Baboud has interests
that include cargo transport, food import and building parts for
ships, said a company employee in Jeddah, who asked not to be
identified.
	   Idris also has connections to a wealthy Saudi family, said the
employee and diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There are no signs of secrecy at the plant. Two prominent signs
along the road point to the factory, and foreigners have been
allowed to visit the site at all hours. Plant employees strenuously
deny any components of chemical weapons were made.
	   ``(Take) any chemical (and) you can produce poison out of it,
but you need special utilities and specialized personnel and, (on)
top of all, lots of secrecy,'' Shibli said. ``This factory was open
to everyone.''
	   Doctors differ on the impact of the plant's destruction.
	   Most agreed the products could be purchased from other plants in
Khartoum or abroad, but Honowa Hamad, a Khartoum pharmacist, said
prices of imported medicine could be three times higher or more.
	   Some doctors and pharmacists worried about the impact of higher
prices on Sudan's people, who are some of the poorest in Africa.
	   Most international aid groups working in Sudan already purchase
their medicine from abroad, said Jean-Guy Vataux, the local
representative of Medecins Sans Frontieres. He said its destruction
should not affect relief operations in famine-stricken southern
Sudan.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
arrived in the Norwegian capital Sunday to help commemorate the
fifth anniversary of the now-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace pact
secretly negotiated in Oslo.
	   His counterpart in those secret talks, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, was expected in Oslo on Monday to join Peres in ceremonies
that include speeches by the two at the Norwegian Nobel Institute,
which awards the Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was skipping
the ceremonies, which he last week dismissed as ``nostalgia.''
Netanyahu had staunchly opposed the Oslo Accords and the peace
process stalled soon after he became prime minister in May 1996.
	   ``We have the wrong government,'' said Peres, speaking briefly
to reporters at Oslo's Fornebu Airport.
	   In the margins of the ceremonies, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross planned
to meet privately in Oslo with Netanyahu's advisers and Palestinian
negotiators, reported the Norwegian state broadcast network NRK.
	   ``We've had a stalemate for a very long time and it's very
important that we overcome that stalemate,'' he said in an
interview with NRK.
	   Peres was foreign minister in 1993 and led an Israeli team of
negotiators in the secret Oslo talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
	   The talks led to a framework agreement on Palestinian autonomy.
The agreement was completed in Oslo on Aug. 19-20, 1993 and signed
Sept. 13, 1993 in Washington D.C.
	   Peres, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shared
the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end decades of
conflict in the Middle East. Peres became prime minister after
Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist in 1995.
	   Key players in the secret talks, including the Norwegian,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams of 1993, were gathering
for a government dinner Sunday evening, followed by meetings with
top Norwegian political leaders and the lectures by Peres and
Arafat on Monday.

Hamburg opens with victory in rebuilt stadium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Polish national team player Jacek Dembinski scored
in the 33rd minute Sunday as Hamburger SV celebrated its stadium
renovation with a victory over VfL Bochum.
	   Hamburg had no trouble orienting itself to a pitch turned 90
degrees at Westfalenstadium in their home opener, winning 1-0 in
front of 28,0000.
	   Their players, led by strikers Anthony Yeboah and Sergei
Kiryakov, constantly threatened the Bochum goal.
	   Yeboah, a former Bundesliga scoring champion coming off a poor
season, showed he's regained form. He set up the goal with his head
and three times had close scoring misses within the first 20
minutes.
	   Kiryakov, who played for Karlsruhe last season, started his
first match for his new team. Hamburg jumped to sith in the table,
while Bochum fell into the cellar.

Odessa elections cap months of political turmoil in Ukrainian port

<TEXT>
	   ODESSA, Ukraine (AP) _ Residents of this major Ukrainian Black
Sea city voted Sunday in municipal elections capping months of
violence and political turmoil.
	   Nearly 50 candidates planned to run, but the final number stood
at 33 as many have voluntarily withdrawn from the race and others
were invalidated by the electoral commission.
	   Turnout was a low 8 percent as of mid-day and observers noted
that fine weather drew many residents out of the city, a former
Soviet resort gem that has been hit by Ukraine's economic decline
and sea pollution.
	   The election was preceded by an attempt to elect a mayor last
March, when incumbent Eduard Hurvits beat regional administration
chief Ruslan Bodelan, his long-time rival and an ally of President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   The often turbulent campaign included several outbreaks of
violence such as kidnappings and shootings, and the two rivals
accused each other of having links to organized crime.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court then invalidated the election results,
and Kuchma then dismissed Hurvits and Bodelan. The president has
sent a senior Cabinet official to head the Odessa city government
until Sunday's election.
	   Full control over Odessa, one of Ukraine's major business
centers and the site of a key oil export terminal, is vital for the
central government, which wants to use the port to transport
Caspian Sea oil to Europe.
	   In the current race, the city election commission has refused to
register Hurvits, now a lawmaker in the new Ukrainian parliament,
but did register his rival Bodelan, who is considered among the top
candidates to win. Government auditors, meanwhile, have accused
Hurvits' former administration of financial wrongdoings.
	   At an electoral rally in Odessa earlier this week, Hurvits
called on city residents to vote for Oleksiy Kostusev, a lawmaker
who came in second in the 1994 municipal elections and is presently
considered Bodelan's most serious rival, Ukrainian newspapers
reported.

Seles wins fourth du Maurier title

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles won her fourth consecutive du
Maurier Open women's tennis championship on Sunday with a
convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory over Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain.
	   Seles, 24, of the United States, needed only one hour 16 minutes
to win the dlrs 150,000 top prize for the hardcourt tournament at
Montreal's sold-out, 10,500-seat Jarry Stadium. Sanchez won dlrs
60,000.
	   It was the first tournament victory of the year for Seles, the
former world No. 1 currently ranked No. 6, who showed she is in top
form heading into the U.S. Open in two weeks.
	   Seles broke service for a 2-0 lead in the opening set and served
out for the win. She broke Sanchez to open the second set and again
for a 5-2 lead while closing out the match without losing her
service.
	   Seles faced only one break point in the match and lost only 10
points on her serve during the match.
	   The Yugoslav-born Seles, who upset top-seeded Martina Hingis of
Switzerland in the semifinals, and Sanchez, who had ended Czech
veteran Jana Novotna's 19-match winning run, were each in their
fifth du Maurier final.
	   Sanchez won in 1992 _ beating Seles in the final _ and 1994.
Seles also beat Sanchez in the 1996 final en route to her four
straight titles.
	   While Seles has struggled to regain her form since a fan stabbed
her in the back during a tournament in 1993, she has dominated the
du Maurier and began her comeback with a victory in the 1995 final
over South Africa's Amanda Coetzer in Toronto.
	   Her record in five du Maurier appearances is 24-1.
	   Sanchez, 27, also a former world No. 1 and now ranked fourth,
defeated Seles in the French Open final in June for her third
career title at Roland Garros. But Seles holds a career 16-3 record
against Sanchez.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A very strong tropical wave was located just east of the Lesser
Antilles this morning. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the
system this morning and could not find a closed circulation in this
system.
	   However, this system has the potential of becoming a tropical
depression later tonight or Monday. Nevertheless, even if this
system does not become a tropical depression, all the
meteorological guidance suggest that very heavy rainfall and gusty
winds will probably affect our area from Monday night through
Tuesday.
	   Residents and visitors in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands are advised to keep monitoring the progress and development
of this system as it enters the Caribbean.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Mostly sunny in the morning, becoming hot. Partly
cloudy in the afternoon with a 30 percent chance of showers. Slight
chance of thunderstorms. High 85 to 95. Wind southeast 10 to 15
mph.
	   Tonight... Partly cloudy in the east with a 20 percent chance of
showers. Fair in the west. Low 75 to 80. Wind east at 5 mph.
	   Monday... Mostly sunny in the morning. Increasing clouds and
showers, becoming breezy in the late afternoon. High 85 to 90. Wind
becoming northeast 15 to 20 mph and gusty. Chance of rain 40
percent, mainly in the late afternoon.
	   Eastern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Partly cloudy with a 30 percent chance of showers. High
from 70 to 75 in the mountains, 85 in lower elevations. Wind

Blind gives Ajax assured start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam captain Danny
Blind, still playing at 37 years old, scored a fine goal Sunday in
Ajax Amsterdam's 2-0 win over Willem II Tilburg.
	   Blind slid the ball home from 16 meters (18 yards) via the
inside of the post on 26 minutes, after one of many frantic
scrambles in the Willem II goalmouth.
	   Center back Blind marshalled a solid Ajax defense which
permitted just two chances in the game.
	   His goal doubled the lead gained by Georgian striker Shota
Arveladze after just seven minutes and Ajax looked set for a big
win to start the season.
	   But around 15 chances went begging for the Amsterdammers,
including a Blind drive against the crossbar.
	   The win gives Ajax second spot in the league after the first
round of games, behind FC Utrecht which, inspired by striker
Michael Mols, won 4-2 at NAC Breda.

Britain protests Sudan provided no security in embassy attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sudan-Factory Puzzle
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The British Embassy has protested to
Sudan over its failure to provide security when a crowd stoned the
embassy and tore down the British flag, a spokesman said Sunday.
	   ``Although we were assured that the forces would turn up,
unfortunately they did not arrive in time to prevent extensive
damage to the embassy,'' said Julian Reilly.
	   Some 500 demonstrators arrived at the embassy Saturday to
protest British support for Thursday's U.S. missile attack on a
pharmaceutical plant in north Khartoum. They were part of a massive
crowd who had attended a rally outside the president's office.
	   Protesters threw rocks at the brown-brick embassy, breaking 52
windows.
	   One of the demonstrators who entered the embassy grounds climbed
the flagpole and cut down the Union Jack. The crowd tore it to
pieces.
	   The crowd dispersed after about 40 minutes. No one was hurt, but
Reilly said the damage could run into tens of thousands of dollars.
	   The embassy made several requests for security from Sudan's
embassy police and the Foreign Ministry, but police showed up only
after the crowd dispersed.
	   ``We do think they could have done better,'' Reilly said. ``I
don't know if (the delay) was intentional.''
	   The embassy has not received a response from Sudan, he said.
	   The embassy advised the 250 British citizens in Sudan to
``remain vigilant and cautious.''
	   Reilly said Britain has no plans to recall any of its 10
diplomats in Sudan.
	   Sudanese Information Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din refused to
comment on the lack of security.
	   ``It was a spontaneous, popular reaction, and we have nothing to
say about it,'' Salah el-Din said in an interview.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In the 1991 Gulf War, American warplanes
bombed a factory west of Baghdad. The United States said the
facility was a biological weapons plant. Iraq said it produced
formula milk for babies, the only one of its kind in the country.
	   Last week, in a deja vu of sorts, the United States attacked
another factory, this time a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts
of Khartoum. Washington said it was making precursors for chemical
weapons. Sudan said no such work occurred.
	   The mystery surrounding the plant remains, perhaps hidden under
the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of antibiotics
piled in rubble of red brick, splintered wood and white plaster.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest many of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for malaria and tuberculosis; it
planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval; it was privately
owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was on a site
of about one square kilometer (less than a square mile) in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum,
next to a plant for generating the capital's electricity.
	   Four main buildings were on the site, three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
	   The factories were destroyed, but the fires inside them still
smoldered on Sunday, emitting a stench of burning plastic. An
industrial fan lay on top of a collapsed roof, its blades blown by
a light breeze.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered a line
of 87 products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory, who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, said Umbadi and Khartoum
pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxycilin, an
anti-malarial drug, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi said.
	   All those products, packaged in El Shifa's blue and white
cartons, are available at Khartoum pharmacies. So are other El
Shifa antibiotics and drugs to treat ulcers and tuberculosis.
	   The plant produced anywhere from a third to half of Sudan's
domestic market.
	   ``The spectrum of drugs they produce is very wide. No other
factory can produce all of it. There will be a loss,'' said Mona
Hamid, a doctor at Khartoum's Radiation and Isotope Center.
	   Among its products was Shifazole, an antibiotic to treat
parasites in animals. The factory won a contract in January to ship
100,000 one-liter cartons at a cost of dlrs 199,000 to Iraq under a
U.N. exemption to the sanctions imposed in 1990, U.N. documents
show. White cartons of the antibiotic were scattered in the rubble.
	   The shipment was to be sent to Iraq by October, said Alamaddin
Al Shibli, the factory's export manager. The company began
exporting medicine this year to nearby Yemen and was scheduled to
send a shipment of veterinary medicine to Chad by month's end, he
said.
	   The plant was owned by Salah Idris, a Sudanese businessmen who
lives in London, Saudi Arabia and Khartoum, said his lawyer, Ghazi
Suleiman. He denies Idris ever met Osama bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi millionaire the United States blames for the attack on the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, said Suleiman, who
himself is one of Sudan's most prominent opposition figures.
	   ``He didn't believe it at first and he thought the news was
wrong. He was really taken by surprise,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris, who is described as charming and apolitical, purchased
the plant in March 1998 from Bashir Hassan Bashir, a Sudanese
businessman, and Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a prominent Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia-based company, Suleiman said. Baboud has interests
that include cargo transport, food import and building parts for
ships, said a company employee in Jeddah, who asked not to be
identified.
	   Idris also has connections to a wealthy Saudi family, said the
employee and diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There are no signs of secrecy at the plant. Two prominent signs
along the road point to the factory, and foreigners have been
allowed to visit the site at all hours. Plant employees strenuously
deny any components of chemical weapons were made.
	   ``(Take) any chemical (and) you can produce poison out of it,
but you need special utilities and specialized personnel and, (on)
top of all, lots of secrecy,'' Shibli said. ``This factory was open
to everyone.''
	   Doctors differ on the impact of the plant's destruction.
	   Most agreed the products could be purchased from other plants in
Khartoum or abroad, but Honowa Hamad, a Khartoum pharmacist, said
prices of imported medicine could be three times higher or more.
	   Some doctors and pharmacists worried about the impact of higher
prices on Sudan's people, who are some of the poorest in Africa.
	   Most international aid groups working in Sudan already purchase
their medicine from abroad, said Jean-Guy Vataux, the local
representative of Medecins Sans Frontieres. He said its destruction
should not affect relief operations in famine-stricken southern
Sudan.

Swedish flavor to Europe's Solheim Cup team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Europe's team for the Solheim Cup
has a distinctive Swedish flavor.
	   Annika Sorenstam played her way onto the team Sunday by winning
the Compaq Open, freeing up one of five wild-card selections that
captain Pia Nilsson used on Sorenstam's sister and three other
Swedes.
	   In all, Europe will have six Swedes on the 12-woman roster when
it tries to win back the cup from the United States next month at
Muirfield Village in Columbus, Ohio.
	   The six players are the most from one country for the European
team since the biennial matches began in 1990. England had five
players on the 1996 team.
	   ``The only thing I can count on is my own conscience,'' said
Nilsson, head coach of the Swedish golf team who helped build its
women's program into a world power. ``I wanted the 12 best players
from Europe, whether they were all from Spain or all from
Stockholm.
	   ``I feel this is the strongest team we've ever had in Europe.''
	   The United States will announce its team next week after the
State Farm Rail Classic. Ten players make the team on points and
captain Judy Rankin will select the other two.
	   Europe is granted five captain's choices because so many of its
best players make their living on the LPGA Tour. The only European
team member who does not play the LPGA fulltime is Marie-Laure de
Lorenzi of France.
	   Helen Alfredsson, a two-time winner of the LPGA this year, led
Europe's points list. She was followed by Laura Davies, Trish
Johnson and Alison Nicholas, all of England.
	   Sorenstam, the No. 1 player in the world, was 11th in the
Solheim Cup standings going into the Compaq Open in Sweden, which
she won by 10 strokes. That moved her up to fifth in points.
	   Rounding out the top seven were Lorenzi and Catriona Matthew of
Scotland. Nilsson used her captain's picks on Charlotta Sorenstam,
Sophie Gustafson, Catrin Nilsmark and Liselotte Neumann of Sweden,
along with England's Lisa Hackney.
	   Gustafson, runner-up at the Women's British Open last week, was
ninth in the standings and in position to play her way onto the
team Sunday until shooting a 42 on the back nine, including a
penalty she called on herself.
	   Nilsson chose Gustafson over another Swede, Maria Hjorth, who
finished eighth in points.
	   ``Maria Hjorth is consistently better and has a good game, but
Sophie was an instinct choice,'' Nilsson said. ``She hits the ball
very long, and I feel she is a tremendous player to have in
best-ball combinations. Sophie could surprise even more.''
	   Others passed over for Europe were Lora Fairclough of England
and Carin Koch of Sweden, who is five months' pregnant. Nilsson
said she was concerned that Koch might not have enough strength to
go 36 holes if needed.
	   Five European players _ Davies, Neumann, Alfredsson, Johnson and
Nicholas _ have played in every Solheim Cup. Matthew, Gustafson and
Charlotta Sorenstam will be playing in their first matches.
	   ``Charlotta's game has come a long ways,'' Nilsson said. ``She
was ahead of most of the players when you look at where she has
placed and her scoring average.''
	   Sorenstam is 28th on the LPGA's money list, one spot ahead of
Koch.
	   Scottish rookie Janice Moodie, who took the lead into the final
round of the British Open before finishing fourth, was not eligible
for the Solheim Cup because she has not played five tournaments in
Europe over the past two years.
	   The United States won in 1996 by taking 10 of 12 points in the
Sunday singles matches for a 17-11 victory. The only Europe won the
Solheim Cup was in 1992, when it won seven of 10 singles matches
for a 11 1-2 to 6 1-2 margin.

<TEXT>
	   ROME, Italy (AP) _ Islamic militants have started work on
retaliation against the United States, targeting U.S. and Israeli
strategic sites and airliners, a leading Muslim activist was quoted
as saying Sunday in a warning he said came directly from Osama bin
Laden.
	   Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of a London-based Islamic group
known to have connections to the Saudi dissident linked to the U.S.
embassy bombings in Africa, read a statement he said was signed by
bin Laden to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper:
	   ``The international Islamic Front announces that the war has
begun. Our response to the barbaric bombardment against Muslims of
Afghanistan and Sudan will be ruthless and violent.
	   ``All the Islamic world has mobilized to strike a prominent
American or Israeli strategic objective, to blow up their airplanes
and to seize them.''
	   Mohammed is head of Al-Muhajiroun, or the Emigrants, which says
it represents the interests of Muslims in the Arab world. Bin Laden
has been known to send envoys or videos to its rallies, bearing
messages from him.
	   The United States linked bin Laden's Afghanistan-based militant
network to the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. Thursday, U.S. missile strikes targeted sites in
Afghanistan and Sudan allegedly connected with bin Laden.
	   Bin Laden's whereabouts have been uncertain since the U.S.
attacks, although he is said to have survived them. Mohammed said
the statement came from Pashewar, Pakistan.
	   Calling the missile attacks an ``irreparable error'' by Clinton,
Mohammed said,``Our response could happen in any corner of the
world.''
	   Retaliation for the U.S. attacks will end only when the last
American soldier has left Saudi Arabia and the Gulf and when the
embargo against Iraq is over, Mohammed said.
	   ``We will not give a truce to America,'' he said.

Yeltsin dismisses government, reappoints Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 14th graf, `On Friday ...,' to UPDATE
with description of Kiriyenko reaction. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the Russian
government Sunday and replaced his young prime minister with the
Soviet-style leader he'd fired five months ago.
	   The surprise announcement came in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse, and one week after the
Russian government effectively devalued its national currency, the
ruble.
	   Yeltsin gave no reason for firing Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect from
Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem the
collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation of
the economy.
	   The president, on the last day of a five-week vacation, issued a
terse announcement through his press service firing Kiriyenko and
his cabinet and appointing former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of firing top aides when things
aren't going well, always trying to shift the blame and absolve
himself of any responsibility. He has fired dozens of ministers
during his years in the Kremlin.
	   ``It's simply comical,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko bloc in parliament. He said the decision ``reveals
the deep confusion and uncertainty at the center of executive
power,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``It's not going to be good,'' said Charles Blitzer, a London
investment banker who used to head the World Bank office in Moscow.
``It's hard to see where Russia goes from here when they appoint a
prime minister who so demonstrably did little about the fundamental
problems as prime minister before.''
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Yeltsin fought hard to get Kiriyenko ratified in parliament,
angrily rejecting demands that he find another, more experienced
premier. At one point, it appeared he might dissolve parliament
because of the impasse over Kiriyenko's appointment.
	   Kiriyenko had barely been ratified when Russia's economy went
into a tailspin, a victim of plunging world oil prices and the
Asian economic crisis.
	   Since then, the young prime minister had been waging a losing
battle to shore up the economy. He worked tirelessly to defend the
ruble, negotiate loans with Western lenders and push reform
measures through a hostile parliament dominated by communists and
their allies.
	   Last week, the government conceded defeat in the fight to save
the ruble, announcing Monday that it was effectively devaluing the
currency by allowing its value to slip by up to 34 percent against
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Friday, all factions of the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, including those usually supportive of the government,
had demanded Kiriyenko's resignation. The Duma also passed a
resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.
	   Kiriyenko took the news of his dismissal calmly and continued
working well into the evening, ITAR-Tass reported. At one point, he
left his office to say farewell to striking miners who have been
camped outside the government building all summer, and whom
Kiriyenko had previously ignored.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, whose government was ``not capable of
working efficiently,'' the Interfax news agency reported. However,
he criticized the reappointment of Chernomyrdin.
	   ``This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former cabinet was doing,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is due to hold a summit meeting
with Yeltsin in a little over a week, had expected a shakeup and
was not worried by it, a White House official said in Edgartown,
Mass., where Clinton is vacationing.
	   ``It's policies, not personalities,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity,
	   Chernomyrdin, a stolid figure who had seemed to offer a
counterweight in the past to Yeltsin's bluster, had busied himself
since being fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential
campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin could win the
presidency, although he could probably count on support from at
least part of the business and banking establishment.

Ajax defeats Willem II 2-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam captain Danny
Blind, still playing at 37 years old, scored the final goal Sunday
in Ajax's 2-0 victory over Willem II Tilburg.
	   Blind slid the ball home from 16 meters (18 yards) on the inside
of the post at 26 minutes, after one of many frantic scrambles in
the Willem II goalmouth.
	   Center back Blind marshaled a solid Ajax defense which gave
Willem II just two chances.
	   His goal doubled the lead gained by Georgian striker Shota
Arveladze's goal just seven minutes into the game.
	   The victory gives Ajax second spot in the league after the first
round of games, behind FC Utrecht which, inspired by striker
Michael Mols, won 4-2 at NAC Breda.

Questions remain on factory, but some Sudanese claims prove true

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In the 1991 Gulf War, American warplanes
bombed a factory west of Baghdad. The United States said the
facility was a biological weapons plant. Iraq said it produced
formula milk for babies, the only one of its kind in the country.
	   Last week, in a deja vu of sorts, the United States attacked
another factory, this time a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts
of Khartoum. Washington said it also made precursors for chemical
weapons. Sudan denied this.
	   The mystery surrounding the plant remains, perhaps hidden under
the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of antibiotics
piled in rubble of red brick, splintered wood and white plaster.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest many of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for malaria and tuberculosis; it
planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval; it was privately
owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was on a site
of about one square kilometer (less than a square mile) in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum,
next to a plant for generating the capital's electricity.
	   Four main buildings were on the site, three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
	   The factories were destroyed Thursday, but the fires inside them
still smoldered Sunday, emitting a stench of burning plastic. An
industrial fan lay on top of a collapsed roof, its blades blown by
a light breeze.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered 87
products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory, who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, said Umbadi and Khartoum
pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxycilin, an
anti-malarial drug, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi said.
	   All those products, packaged in El Shifa's blue and white
cartons, are available at Khartoum pharmacies. So are other El
Shifa antibiotics and drugs to treat ulcers and tuberculosis.
	   The plant produced anywhere from a third to half of the medicine
available on Sudan's domestic market.
	   ``The spectrum of drugs they produce is very wide. No other
factory can produce all of it. There will be a loss,'' said Mona
Hamid, a doctor at Khartoum's Radiation and Isotope Center.
	   Among its products was Shifazole, an antibiotic to treat
parasites in animals. The factory won a contract in January to ship
100,000 one-liter (pint) cartons at a cost of dlrs 199,000 to Iraq
under a U.N. exemption to the sanctions imposed in 1990, U.N.
documents show. White cartons of the antibiotic were scattered in
the rubble.
	   The shipment was to be sent to Iraq by October, said Alamaddin
Al Shibli, the factory's export manager. The company began
exporting medicine this year to nearby Yemen and was scheduled to
send a shipment of veterinary medicine to Chad by month's end, he
said.
	   The plant was owned by Salah Idris, a Sudanese businessmen who
lives in London, Saudi Arabia and Khartoum, said his lawyer, Ghazi
Suleiman. He denies Idris ever met Osama bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi millionaire the United States blames for the attack on the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, said Suleiman, who
is one of Sudan's most prominent opposition figures.
	   ``He didn't believe it at first and he thought the news was
wrong. He was really taken by surprise,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris, described as charming and apolitical, purchased the plant
in March from Bashir Hassan Bashir, a Sudanese businessman, and
Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a prominent Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia-based company, Suleiman said. Baboud interests include cargo
transport, food import and building parts for ships, said a company
employee in Jeddah, who asked not to be identified.
	   Idris also has connections to a wealthy Saudi family, said the
employee and diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There are no signs of secrecy at the plant. Two prominent signs
along the road point to the factory, and foreigners have been
allowed to visit the site at all hours. Plant employees strenuously
deny any components of chemical weapons were made.
	   ``(Take) any chemical (and) you can produce poison out of it,
but you need special utilities and specialized personnel and ...
lots of secrecy,'' Shibli said. ``This factory was open to
everyone.''
	   Doctors differ on the impact of the plant's destruction.
	   Most agreed the products could be purchased from other plants in
Khartoum or abroad, but Honowa Hamad, a Khartoum pharmacist, said
prices of imported medicine could be three times higher or more, a
heavy burden for Sudan's people, among the poorest in Africa.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd was

Shifting tides in Congo's escalating war

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Back from the brink, President Laurent
Kabila's quest for regional military support paid off Sunday when
his Angolan allies captured a key rebel stronghold in western
Congo.
	   The rebels acknowledged losing the town, but said they were
continuing their advance on Kinshasa, the capital, and had also
captured the important eastern city of Kisangani.
	   The strategic Angolan victory was a much needed boost for an
embattled Kabila, but it also threatens to transform Congo into a
proxy battlefield for a region-wide war of shifting alliances and
uncertain prospects.
	   With air support and rumbling tanks, Angolan forces drove into
the airbase at Kitona, near the Atlantic coastline, effectively
cutting off the advancing rebel army from its rear supply base.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' a ministry-level official said on
condition of anonymity. He added that Angola had landed a number of
warplanes at Kinshasa's international airport.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed the
deployment of Angolan troops.
	   ``They are deploying beside our Congolese forces to reinforce
and protect our army,'' Mumengi said.
	   Quoting an unidentified Angolan military source, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported Sunday that Kabila's troops, aided by
Angolan soldiers, had moved on from Kitona on Saturday, capturing
the nearby towns of Muanda and Banana and then to Boma, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) to the east. The report said the soldiers
captured Matadi, Congo's only ocean-going port on the Congo River
and an important strategic target, on Sunday. The report could not
be independently confirmed.
	   If true, however, it would mean that most of the major rebel
victories in the area southwest of Kinshasa had been reversed.
	   The military official told Lusa that Angola has a 2,000-strong
force in Congo's Lower Congo province.
	   Government officials declined to make detailed comment, but
Health Minister Jean-Baptiste Sondgi said that: ``There's fighting
in the area, I can't give exact details. There will be an important
announcement tomorrow.''
	   Rebel leaders on the other side of the country in the eastern
city of Goma acknowledged the loss of Kitona, but vowed to press on
to Kinshasa.
	   Zimbabwean soldiers deployed last week, however, are now helping
to shore up Kinshasa's defenses.
	   In the space of several days, the landscape of this, Congo's
second civil war in two years, has dramatically shifted and is fast
expanding into a regional conflict.
	   Rwanda and Uganda _ in support of the rebels _ have repeatedly
warned Zimbabwe and Angola not to get involved, warning of direct
retaliatory intervention if they don't withdraw.
	   Rwanda last year backed Kabila, as did Uganda, in his bid to
oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. This time around
they are believed to supporting the rebels seeking to oust Kabila.
	   Zimbabwe, having extended more than dlrs 200 million in military
credits to Congo, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
Angola's involvement may be partially driven by a concern that
Congo's rebels could link up with Angola's UNITA insurgent
movement.
	   Whatever the motivation, Congo's frontlines are becoming
confusingly crowded with regional troops.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, remains holed up at his residence in the
southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's former rebel
stronghold, Information Minister Mumengi said.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who fled to the
rebel side, acknowledged the fall of Kitona _ the first major
setback in a stunning three-week rebel advance on Kinshasa.
	   ``We've made a tactical withdrawal,'' said Karaha, a member of
the rebel political wing, the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   Ironically, Karaha's comments mirror similar statements by
Kabila in recent weeks. He has accused Rwandan Tutsis of using the
rebel movement _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disaffected members of the Kabila's army _ to create a
regional Tutsi empire.
	   Kitona was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   But Karaha said the news was not all bad for the rebels,
claiming rebel fighters had captured Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city. That claim could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa tried
to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria. Two key
leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and his ally, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu were at the meetings. Kabila was represented by his
justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo.
	   President Nelson Mandela told reporters that an agreement was
adopted unanimously Sunday by 12 members of the Southern African
Development Community, calling for an immediate cease-fire and
recognizing Kabila's right to govern.
	   It seemed unlikely, though, that the call to lay down arms would
be heeded.
	   Karaha said earlier in the day that with the intervention of
Angolan forces, chances of a negotiated settlement are ``almost
impossible.''

Britain protests Sudan provided no security in embassy attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sudan-Factory Puzzle
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The British Embassy has protested to
Sudan over its failure to provide security when a crowd stoned the
embassy and tore down the British flag, a spokesman said Sunday.
	   ``Although we were assured that the forces would turn up,
unfortunately they did not arrive in time to prevent extensive
damage to the embassy,'' said Julian Reilly.
	   Some 500 demonstrators arrived at the embassy Saturday to
protest British support for Thursday's U.S. missile attack on a
pharmaceutical plant in north Khartoum. They were part of a massive
crowd who had attended a rally outside the president's office.
	   Protesters threw rocks at the brown-brick embassy, breaking 52
windows.
	   One of the demonstrators who entered the embassy grounds climbed
the flagpole and cut down the Union Jack. The crowd tore it to
pieces.
	   The crowd dispersed after about 40 minutes. No one was hurt, but
Reilly said the damage could run into tens of thousands of dollars.
	   The embassy made several requests for security from Sudan's
embassy police and the Foreign Ministry, but police showed up only
after the crowd dispersed.
	   ``We do think they could have done better,'' Reilly said. ``I
don't know if (the delay) was intentional.''
	   The embassy has not received a response from Sudan, he said.
	   The embassy advised the 250 British citizens in Sudan to
``remain vigilant and cautious.''
	   Reilly said Britain has no plans to recall any of its 10
diplomats in Sudan.
	   Sudanese Information Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din refused to
comment on the lack of security.
	   ``It was a spontaneous, popular reaction, and we have nothing to
say about it,'' Salah el-Din said in an interview.

Kipketer loses again in 800; Britain, Germany close with 3 golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS throughout; adds Kipketer quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer was unbeaten for two
years. Now he's lost his last two races.
	   The Kenyan-born Dane, narrowly leading Sunday's 800-meter final
coming out of the final turn, got jostled by Germany's Nils
Schumann, who almost simultaneously was elbowed by Italian Andrea
Longo trying to pass on the outside.
	   It threw off the world champion and world record-holder just
enough to allow Schumann to blow by and win in 1:44.89 with
Switzerland's Andre Bucher (1:45.04) taking silver and Lukas Vydra
(1:45.23) of the Czech Republic bronze.
	   Kipketer, running in his first European Championships after
getting Danish citizenship, finished eighth _ dead last _ as he
slowed to a disgusted trot down the stretch.
	   It's been that kind of season for the Dane, who was hospitalized
for malaria in February and didn't start training seriously until
late May.
	   He was unbeaten in 1996 and '97 in 27 races. This loss comes on
the heals of a loss Aug. 12 in Zurich to Kenyan Japheth Kimutai.
	   ``Someone pushed me from behind and I stopped running because
the race was stolen from me,'' said Kipketer, who almost a year to
the day (Aug. 24, 1997) smashed Sebastian Coe's record, lowering it
to 1:41.11.
	   ``I didn't have good preparation but there wouldn't have been a
problem on the way home if somebody didn't touch me,'' he added.
	   Schumann, the European junior champion, agreed.
	   ``It looked worse on TV replays than it really was, he said.
``Longo came form inside and shoved me. At his best, Wilson would
have continued running and he would have probably won.''
	   ``To beat a world champion and world record holder is
incredible,'' he added.
	   Kipketer's loss _ he filed and protest and lost that, too _ was
the biggest upset on the closing day of the six-day championships
that saw Germany and Britain each win three gold medals with
Britain topping the final medal table with nine gold and 16
overall.
	   Germany had eight gold and 23 overall and Russia had six gold
and 22.
	   Britain got gold from world record-holder Jonathan Edwards in
the triple jump (17.99), Steve Backley in the javelin (89.72) to
win this third straight Euro gold in the event, and the 4X400 team
to add to earlier wins in the 100, 200 and 400.
	   Edwards suggested Britain's big haul might make up for a
disappointing World Cup and the image the country has as ``gallant
losers.'' It also comes after Britain was shut out of gold in
Olympic track and the worlds last year in Athens.
	   ``It's given the sport a real shot in the arm,'' he said. ``It's
showed that we're the most successful sport in the country.''
	   Germany's three golds came as four-time world champion and
Olympic gold medalist Lars Riedel won the discus with a throw of
67.07.
	   Grit Breuer got her second gold anchoring the 4X400 to victory
(3:23.03), and Damian Kallabis upset defending champion and Olympic
bronze medalist Alessandro Lambruschini of Italy to win the 3,000
steeplechase (8:13.10).
	   There was also double gold for Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland,
winning the 5,000 _ she's a former world champion at the distance _
to go with the earlier 10,000 gold.
	   ``I just can't believe it, a double gold,'' O'Sullivan said.
	   O'Sullivan overtook reigning world champion Gabriela Szabo of
Romania coming out of the final bend and cruised home to win in a
slow 15:06.50
	   ``This is special because people who have been beating me all
year were in there,'' O'Sullivan said. ``It just reminds Szabo that
I'm not gone, that I'm still there.''
	   Szabo took silver (15:08.31) and Marta Dominguez of Spain took
bronze (15:10.54).
	   The Iberian peninsula continued to be the heart of European
distance running as Portugal's Manuela Machado, 35, set a
championships record _ and a personal best _ winning the marathon
on a cool, windy day in 2:27:10.
	   Machado the defending champion, eclipsed the record of 2:28:38
set in 1986 by fellow Portuguese Rosa Mota.
	   Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia pulled away from
world champion Carla Sacramento of Portugal on the final turn in a
slow race to win the women's 1,500 (4:11.91). Sacramento took
silver (4:12.62) and Anita Weyerman of Switzerland took bronze
(4:13.06).
	   Monica Dinescu of Romania won the high jump (1.97) and Svetla
Dimitrova of Bulgaria took the 100-meter hurdles (12.56) to defend
her European title.

Yeltsin dismisses government, reappoints Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 20th graf, `U.S. President ...,' with 2 grafs to UPDATE
with Clinton official speaking on record. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the Russian
government Sunday and replaced his young prime minister with the
Soviet-style leader he'd fired five months ago.
	   The surprise announcement came in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse, and one week after the
Russian government effectively devalued its national currency, the
ruble.
	   Yeltsin gave no reason for firing Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect from
Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem the
collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation of
the economy.
	   The president, on the last day of a five-week vacation, issued a
terse announcement through his press service firing Kiriyenko and
his cabinet and appointing former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of firing top aides when things
aren't going well, always trying to shift the blame and absolve
himself of any responsibility. He has fired dozens of ministers
during his years in the Kremlin.
	   ``It's simply comical,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko bloc in parliament. He said the decision ``reveals
the deep confusion and uncertainty at the center of executive
power,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``It's not going to be good,'' said Charles Blitzer, a London
investment banker who used to head the World Bank office in Moscow.
``It's hard to see where Russia goes from here when they appoint a
prime minister who so demonstrably did little about the fundamental
problems as prime minister before.''
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Yeltsin fought hard to get Kiriyenko ratified in parliament,
angrily rejecting demands that he find another, more experienced
premier. At one point, it appeared he might dissolve parliament
because of the impasse over Kiriyenko's appointment.
	   Kiriyenko had barely been ratified when Russia's economy went
into a tailspin, a victim of plunging world oil prices and the
Asian economic crisis.
	   Since then, the young prime minister had been waging a losing
battle to shore up the economy. He worked tirelessly to defend the
ruble, negotiate loans with Western lenders and push reform
measures through a hostile parliament dominated by communists and
their allies.
	   Last week, the government conceded defeat in the fight to save
the ruble, announcing Monday that it was effectively devaluing the
currency by allowing its value to slip by up to 34 percent against
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Friday, all factions of the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, including those usually supportive of the government,
had demanded Kiriyenko's resignation. The Duma also passed a
resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.
	   Kiriyenko took the news of his dismissal calmly and continued
working well into the evening, ITAR-Tass reported. At one point, he
left his office to say farewell to striking miners who have been
camped outside the government building all summer, and whom
Kiriyenko had previously ignored.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, whose government was ``not capable of
working efficiently,'' the Interfax news agency reported. However,
he criticized the reappointment of Chernomyrdin.
	   ``This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former cabinet was doing,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''
	   American intelligence had alerted U.S. President Bill Clinton to
expect a Russian government shakeup, a White House official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Clinton intends to go ahead
with a summit meeting with Yeltsin in a little over a week, his
aides said.
	   ``We'll continue to work closely with the Russian government and
watch the situation closely as it evolves,'' said P.J. Crowley,
spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council.
	   Chernomyrdin, a stolid figure who had seemed to offer a
counterweight in the past to Yeltsin's bluster, had busied himself
since being fired by laying the groundwork for a presidential
campaign in 2000.
	   Few political analysts think Chernomyrdin could win the
presidency, although he could probably count on support from at
least part of the business and banking establishment.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd was
hospitalized late Sunday less than two weeks after being
discharged, diplomats said.
	   The king, who is in his mid-70s, had his gallbladder removed by
a team led by a U.S. surgeon on Aug. 12.
	   King Fahd was admitted to King Faisal Specialist Hospital in the
capital Riyadh, diplomats said in phone interviews with The
Associated Press in Dubai.
	   The diplomats, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said they had no details about the king's condition. Hospital
officials were not available for comment.
	   This is the fourth time the Saudi monarch has been hospitalized
this year.
	   Fahd went to the same hospital on Aug. 2 and was admitted for
short periods in March and April.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in 1995 that damaged his short-term memory and
his ability to concentrate. Two months later, he temporarily handed
over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Wilson Kipketer was unbeaten for two
years. Now he's lost his last two races.
	   The Kenyan-born Dane, narrowly leading Sunday's 800-meter final
coming out of the final turn, got jostled by Germany's Nils
Schumann, who almost simultaneously was elbowed by Italian Andrea
Longo trying to pass on the outside.
	   It threw off the world champion and world record-holder just
enough to allow Schumann to blow by and win in 1:44.89 with
Switzerland's Andre Bucher (1:45.04) taking silver and Lukas Vydra
(1:45.23) of the Czech Republic bronze.
	   Kipketer, running in his first European Championships after
getting Danish citizenship, finished eighth _ dead last _ as he
slowed to a disgusted trot down the stretch.
	   It's been that kind of season for the Dane, who was hospitalized
for malaria in February and didn't start training seriously until
late May.
	   He was unbeaten in 1996 and '97 in 27 races. This loss comes on
the heels of a loss Aug. 12 in Zurich to Kenyan Japheth Kimutai.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan wants a public apology from
Washington for its missile strike against a factory in Khartoum,
and has asked the United Nations to investigate U.S. allegations
that the factory produced the ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   Sudan would welcome a U.N. inspection of the factory that U.S.
missiles destroyed Thursday, but would not allow the team to
inspect any other alleged chemical weapons site, Information
Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din told a press conference Sunday.
	   He confirmed that Sudan is recalling its entire diplomatic staff
from Washington, but said Sudan was not severing ties with the
United States.
	   ``This is in retaliation for the U.S. action,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   Sudan will also take steps against European countries that
``openly and unconditionally supported the United States'
aggression against Sudan,'' he added.
	   Britain, Germany and several other European states backed the
U.S. strike against a pharmaceutical factory in north Khartoum.
President Clinton ordered the attack, and a simultaneous strike
against extremist camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for the Aug.
7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The United States says the Khartoum factory produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan says it produced only drugs
and vaccines.
	   Sudan has asked the U.N. Security Council to hold an emergency
meeting on the air strike and to consider sending a fact-finding
mission to the factory.
	   At the news conference, the Sudanese minister said Washington
has indicated it wants a dialogue with Sudan.
	   ``We have been receiving signals and suggestions by third
parties that the U.S. wishes to take a milder position towards
Sudan, presumably because of the mistake it has committed,'' Salah
el-Din said.
	   ``Our response is that we do not entertain any behind-the-scenes
contact,'' he said. ``If they want to speak to us, they have to
come up with a public apology.''
	   U.S. officials say the Khartoum factory belonged to a
corporation in which the Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden had a
stake. Washington accuses bin Laden of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   ``Bin Laden never came near the factory and there is no way that
this factory could have produced chemical weapons,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   The minister recalled the United States' successfully persuading
his government to expel bin Laden from Sudan in 1995.
	   ``We gave (U.S. officials) a piece of advice that they never
followed. We told them: `Don't send him out of Sudan because you
will lose control over him.'
	   ``Now, the United States has ended up with war with an invisible
enemy,'' Salah el-Din said.
	   Turning to Sudan's request for a U.N. inspection of the Khartoum
factory, the minister said: ``We want the United Nations to
investigate U.S. allegations that this factory contains chemical
weapons, but we will not accept other inspections because that
would distract world attention from the issue of U.S. aggression.''
	   In Baghdad, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said
Sudan is ready to receive Jimmy Carter and members of the U.S.
Congress to determine whether the factory produced weapons
ingredients.
	   ``We will keep the place (factory) as it is,'' Ismail told
reporters, speaking at the end of a visit to Iraq. ``It is very,
very important that the international community, the American,
European and Sudanese people know whether the American claims are
right or wrong.''

Cardinal says search meant to make him hear the `clinking of
</HEADLINE>
handcuffs' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ The cardinal of Naples stridently protested
a police search of his church office, warning Sunday of a ``danger
to the sovereignty to the Church.''
	   On Saturday, dozens of police entered the offices of Cardinal
Michele Giordano to inspect documents and computer discs.
	   Giordano's lawyer said authorities were looking for evidence of
loan sharking, extortion and associating with criminals _ the
charges under which the cardinal's brother, Mario Lucio Giordano,
was arrested Thursday.
	   A series of politicians protested the search as excessive even
for Italy, which saw hundreds of leading figures brought down in
the ``Kickback City'' investigations of the 1990s. Some questioned
whether the search violated sovereignty accords between the state
and the Roman Catholic Church.
	   In a news conference Sunday, the cardinal spoke of a ``danger to
the sovereignty of the Church.''
	   ``This was done as a spectacle, to frighten, to intimidate, to
press, to agitate and to make heard ... the clinking of the
handcuffs,'' he said, calling it one of thousands of abuses of
powers by Italy's justice system.
	   Giordano, 67, has led the Naples archdiocese since 1987 and was
named a cardinal in 1988.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that prosecutors asked tax
police in February to start going through banking records involving
the cardinal.

Liability for guaranteed contracts to be arbitrated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Are North American National Basketball League
owners obligated to pay guaranteed contracts during a lockout?
That's the dlrs 800 million question to be argued Monday in the
league's latest labor skirmish.
	   Arbitrator John Feerick will convene a grievance hearing Monday
on the union's contention that owners are liable to pay salaries to
some 220 players with guaranteed contracts for the upcoming season.
	   The hearing is scheduled to last two days, and Feerick's ruling
should come in early September.
	   ``It's not our policy to comment on matters of pending
litigation, but we have said before that the law is very clear that
employees don't get paid during a lockout. That's our view,'' NBA
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said Sunday.
	   There is no precedent for locked out athletes demanding to be
paid, so there will be no professional sports precedent for Feerick
to seize upon.
	   During the summer-long NBA lockout of 1995, players who missed
paychecks did not file a grievance. Nor did North American National
Hockey League hockey players who were locked out for the first
three months of the 1994-95 season.
	   The union is expected to argue that owners should have protected
themselves by inserting lockout language into individual player
contracts as baseball owners routinely do.
	   ``These players are supposed to be paid under those contracts in
virtually all circumstances,'' said a source close to the union,
who asked not to be identified. ``It (the standard player contract)
says you can't test positive for cocaine, you can't be out of
shape. It says all kinds of things that can get the owners out of
their obligation to pay. But it never says anything about a
lockout.''
	   If the players were to win, there's still a chance that
Feerick's verdict would not be the final word. The league has sued
the union over this matter in federal court, so any award could be
put on hold.
	   Still, the winning side should have an increase in leverage when
talks resume on a collective bargaining agreement to replace the
one that expired July 1 _ the day the lockout began.
	   The players filed the grievance with Feerick on June 30, a few
hours before the lockout commenced, claiming the owners committed
an ``anticipatory breach of contract'' by announcing June 29 that
they would not pay players during the lockout.
	   Most players are not due to receive their first paychecks until
Nov. 15, but a handful were supposed to be paid this summer.
Leaguewide, guaranteed contracts for the 1998-99 season add up to
about dlrs 800 million.
	   No new talks are scheduled, and none should be expected until
after Feerick has ruled. The season is scheduled to start Nov. 4,
so a new agreement is likely needed by mid-October in order to
prevent the NBA from losing its perfect record of ever having lost
a game to labor strife.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Russian tourist with light stab wounds to the
shoulder and back told Jerusalem police Sunday that he was attacked
by two Palestinian men in the traditionally Arab section of east
Jerusalem.
	   ``We are checking his story,'' said police spokesman Shmuel
Ben-Ruby. Ben Ruby said the man, who was only identified as a
Russian tourist, was taken to a hospital for treatment after
reporting the incident to a police station.
	   The man told police that he was attacked on the Mount of Olives,
and managed to walk several kilometers (miles) to a police station
in the walled Old City, to report the attack.
	   There have been several stabbing incidents inside the Old City
this year.

Chavez confident for De La Hoya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRECKENRIDGE, Colorado (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez has no doubt he
can beat WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya in a rematch
scheduled for Sept. 18 in Las Vegas.
	   Hanging in his gym in this mountain town is a sign, which
translated from Spanish to English, says: ``Yes you can, we're
going to be able to do it, we're going to win!''
	   With each punch combination he throws, the 35-year-old Chavez is
thinking about De La Hoya. As his trainers wipe sweat off his
muscular shoulders, the Mexican is thinking about De La Hoya.
	   At any training session, onlookers can see the intensity in
Chavez's dark eyes and furrowed brow. He is thinking about de la
Hoya.
	   In 1996, the six-time world boxing champion, who boasts a 99-2-2
record, lost to De La Hoya (28-0) on a technical knockout after a
doctor stopped the fight because Chavez was bleeding profusely.
	   ``This time, there is no excuse,'' Chavez said.
	   Chavez and his trainers said they chose Breckenridge for its
altitude of 9,600 feet (2,900 meters) and its tranquility.
	   The boxer admits the altitude affects him, particularly when he
is lifting weights, but hopes it will give him an edge.
	   ``I will have an advantage from the altitude, but De la Hoya
will be in his own weight class,'' Chavez said.
	   Normally, Chavez fights as a junior welterweight, which has a
weight limit of 140 pounds (63.50 kilos), and De La Hoya fights as
a welterweight with a limit of 147 pounds (66.7 kilos). Chavez will
have to bulk up to fight De La Hoya.
	   In the current boxing standings released by the magazine ``The
Ring,'' Chavez is ranked third in his weight class.
	   Despite the rankings, Chavez insists the bout will be ``the
surprise of the year.''
	   ``It's been a long time since I've worked this hard,'' Chavez
said. ``The pressure is on De La Hoya.''
	   Chavez wants to make the De La Hoya fight a memorable one,
because it's going to be one of his last. He says he will retire by
the end of the year.

Champion Lens lifts the gloom with 4-0 win at Sochaux
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After a disappointing start to the season, French
champion Lens roared back into form Sunday with an emphatic 4-0
triumph at newly-promoted Sochaux.
	   After an even first half, Lens powered to victory, with winger
Tony Vairelles, who won his first international cap for France
Wednesday, in irresistable form.
	   The first goal came in the 53rd minute, when Vairelles slipped
past defender Philippe Raschke and played a smart ball to Pascal
Nouma, whose left wing cross was squeezed into the net by Vladimir
Smicer.
	   Vairelles made it 2-0 four minutes later, when he collected a
long through ball from Stephane Dalmat and hammered the ball into
the net from 20 yards (meters).
	   Nouma scored two late goals to complete the rout.
	   After losing its first game of the season at Toulouse and only
drawing at home against minnow Lorient in its second, Lens badly
needed a win to keep in touch with leaders Marseille and Bordeaux.
	   In Sunday's other match, newly-promoted Nancy recorded its first
win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Nantes.
	   Nancy collected three points thanks to a fortunate injury-time
goal by striker Samuel Wiart.
	   Winger Marc Zanotti chipped a free kick toward the Nantes goal,
goalkeeper Michael Landreau failed to gather and the ball bounced
off Wiart into the empty net.
	   In the first half, Landreau had kept Nantes level with a
stunning close-range save from a 10-meter (yard) Zanotti volley.
	   Nantes' best chance came when Argentine Diego Bustos created an
opening for Frederic Da Rocha with a neat pass, but the striker
sliced the ball wide from 15 yards.
	   In games played Saturday, Marseille scored five goals in a
remarkable second half recovery to beat Montpellier 5-4 and
maintain its winning start to the season.
	   Bordeaux also won, 1-0 at home to Auxerre, to join Marseille on
nine points after three rounds of the championship.

Saudi king returns to hospital less than two weeks after he left

 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on the king

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd returned to
hospital late Sunday less than two weeks after being discharged,
diplomats said.
	   The king, who is in his mid-70s, had his gallbladder removed by
a medical team led by a U.S. surgeon on Aug. 12.
	   King Fahd was admitted to King Faisal Specialist Hospital in the
capital Riyadh, diplomats said in phone interviews with The
Associated Press in Dubai.
	   The diplomats, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said they had no details about the king's condition. Hospital
officials were not available for comment.
	   This is the fourth time the Saudi monarch has been admitted to
hospital this year.
	   Fahd went to the same hospital on Aug. 2. He was also
hospitalized for short periods in March and April.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in 1995 that damaged his short-term memory and
his ability to concentrate. Two months later, he temporarily handed
over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Fahd, whose name means tiger in Arabic, succeeded to the throne
in 1982 on the death of King Khalid.
	   In the Arab world he is seen as a staunch ally of the United
States. The car-bomb attacks on U.S. military personnel in Riyadh
and Dhahran in 1995 and 1996 were reportedly carried out by Muslim
extremists opposed to the large number of U.S. troops in the
kingdom.
	   Fahd has suffered from diabetes and arthritis for years. Since
his stroke he has used a wheelchair.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

Taliban cool toward bin Laden

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The hospitality Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers have extended Osama bin Laden cooled Sunday, days after
American missiles hit an area in the eastern of the country where
he is accused of training an international army of Islamic
militants.
	   Taliban spokesman Mullah Abdullah, reached on satellite
telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Afghanistan said
bin Laden would be allowed to travel only ``in Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan and he will be provided security by Taliban fighters.''
	   Abdullah described it as a security measure, but it amounted to
a restriction on the movements of bin Laden, whom Washington blames
for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The United States launched missiles Thursday at what officials
described as a bin Laden military training camp.
	   Foreigners in Afghanistan have been attacked since then, and
international aid workers are fleeing the country. Eighteen Red
Cross workers left Sunday, a day after the body of a U.N. military
observer killed in Kabul on Friday preceded them to Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital.
	   In an interview with the BBC Sunday, supreme Taliban leader
Mullah Omar expressed displeasure with reported statements from bin
Laden that called for Muslims to strike at the United States.
	   Omar was quoted as saying he was sending an envoy to bin Laden,
in an unknown location in Afghanistan, to make clear the Taliban
would speak for themselves about how to respond to U.S. action in
their country.
	   The statements Sunday clearly indicated unhappiness with bin
Laden. But after the U.S. missile strikes sparked large and violent
anti-American, pro-bin Laden protests across Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, it appeared unlikely Omar would completely disown the
man he has described as an honored guest.
	   Nonetheless, Taliban response to the strikes has been muted,
perhaps because they are undecided of their position on bin Laden.
Omar has said bin Laden would not be handed over, while Taliban
envoys at the United Nations have said they would be willing to
discuss such a solution if the United States could prove terrorism
charges against him.
	   The U.N. envoys are more exposed to international opinion. To
Westerners like U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, bin
Laden is a symbol of the Taliban's unwillingness to fight
terrorism. Albright told reporters recently that the Taliban could
show its desire to be part of the international community by not
harboring ``terrorist elements.''
	   That reputation as a harborer of terrorism is just one of the
issues bedeviling the Taliban's world image. There are reports they
are making money from heroine production, and they have a record of
denying basic rights to women and minorities.
	   The religious militia is on the verge of bringing all of
Afghanistan under its control, but has been denied the U.N. seat
and recognition as a legitimate government it wants.
	   Bin Laden, son of a Saudi construction magnate, was a hero of
the Afghan war against Soviet invaders. He fought himself and used
his wealth to buy arms and recruit other foreign Muslim fighters
for Afghan groups intent on putting Afghanistan under Islamic law.
	   After the fall of Afghanistan's communist government in 1992,
bin Laden was accused of turning the determined hatred with which
he had fought communism against the United States and against Arab
governments like the one in his native Saudi Arabia he accuses of
failing to stand up to Washington.

Player wins again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, New York (AP) _ Gary Player became the second-oldest
winner on the Senior PGA Tour when his 4-under-par 68 Sunday gave
him a one-stroke victory in the dlrs 1 million Northville Long
Island Classic.
	   Only Mike Fetchick, who won the 1985 Hilton Head Seniors
Invitational on his 63rd birthday, was an older champion than
Player, who will turn 63 on Nov. 1.
	   Player, who has won 130 events worldwide including nine major
tournaments, won for the 19th time on Senior PGA Tour and for the
first time since the Bank One Classic in 1995. The South African
did win three senior events last season, but none were in the
United States.
	   Walter Hall, a co-leader of this event entering the final round
for the second straight year, shot a 71 and finished tied for
second with J.C. Snead at 11-under 205.
	   Hall, in just his second year on the senior tour, had a chance
to force a playoff but missed about an 8-foot (2.4-meter) birdie
putt on the par-3 18th.
	   Snead closed with a 67, that included a great par save on the
par-5 17th and a birdie on the closing hole.
	   Lee Trevino and John Schroder had 69s to finish at 10-under.
That was one stroke ahead of Terry Dill, who had a 67, and Tom
Shaw, the other co-leader entering the final round. He had a 73.
	   Player, who had three 68s, took the lead for good with a 10-foot
(3-meter) birdie putt on the par-4 16th, then parred in to win the
first-place prize of dlrs 150,000 and become the seventh player
older than 60 to win a senior tour event.
	   Player won the inaugural senior event played at this venue in
1987 but it isn't recognized as an official tournament.
	   Hall, who closed with a 74 last year and finished 11th, had a
chance at a birdie on No. 17 as well, but his 8-footer (2.4 meter)
hit the cup and rolled out.
	   Player, who started the final round two strokes behind the
leaders, had three birdies on the back nine, gaining ground as Hall
and Shaw combined for just one, Hall's on No. 10.

Jewish settlers and Palestinians clash, protests over U.S. strikes

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets
of Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and
Palestinians, some children, went on for several hours Sunday even
as an Israeli army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers scuffled with Jewish settlers and
fired towards Palestinian children.
	   Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their community,
several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a group of
settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron.
	   Settler children then headed towards the Palestinian-run
vegetable market, closed since the curfew began Thursday. Israeli
TV footage showed a handful of children, wearing traditional
knitted skullcaps, overturning market stalls and dumping produce on
the ground.
	   The violence dissipated for several hours and then scuffles
between settlers and Palestinians broke out again when the army
briefly lifted the curfew for two hours in the evening to allow
Palestinians to stock up on food supplies.
	   About 50 men and women settlers converged on the Arab market
near their homes and began hitting Palestinian merchants and
tossing carts. Palestinians fought back, throwing rocks and bottles
at the settlers. Israeli troops on the scene shot several rounds of
rubber bullets in the air to scatter the crowds. At least two
Palestinians were arrested.
	   Earlier, soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as they
attempted to cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the
city. At the checkpoint, a group of 30 Palestinian children, some
as young as five years-old, threw stones towards the Israeli
troops, who responded by firing rubber bullets and a stun grenade.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the stone throwers,
pushing them back out of range of the Israelis. No injuries were
reported.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Yasser Arafat, president
of the Palestinian Authority, to condemn Thursday's fatal stabbing
of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   Israel's Army Radio said the militant group Hamas had released a
statement vowing more attacks on Jewish settlers, but the validity
of the statement could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Israeli Cabinet said that it was the policy of Netanyahu's
government to strengthen and develop the Jewish area in Hebron,
including Tel Romeida, where the stabbing took place Thursday
night. It said permits would be issued for permanent housing to
replace mobile homes at the site.
	   Arafat's aide said the decision would only hurt the peace
process.

	   The violence dissipated for several hours and then scuffles
between settlers and Palestinians broke out again when the army
briefly lifted the curfew for two hours in the evening to allow
Palestinians to stock up on food supplies.
	   About 50 men and women settlers converged on the Arab market
near their homes and began hitting Palestinian merchants and
tossing carts. Palestinians fought back, throwing rocks and bottles
at the settlers. Israeli troops on the scene shot several rounds of
rubber bullets in the air to scatter the crowds. At least two
Palestinians were arrested.
	   Earlier, soldiers pushed back about 25 settlers as they
attempted to cross into the Palestinian-controlled area of the
city. At the checkpoint, a group of 30 Palestinian children, some
as young as five years-old, threw stones towards the Israeli
troops, who responded by firing rubber bullets and a stun grenade.
	   Palestinian police eventually dispersed the stone throwers,
pushing them back out of range of the Israelis. No injuries were
reported.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Yasser Arafat, president
of the Palestinian Authority, to condemn Thursday's fatal stabbing
of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority condemns the
murder and distances itself from any legitimization of any attacks
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank,'' a Cabinet statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
	   Israel's Army Radio said the militant group Hamas had released a
statement vowing more attacks on Jewish settlers, but the validity
of the statement could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Israeli Cabinet said that it was the policy of Netanyahu's
government to strengthen and develop the Jewish area in Hebron,
including Tel Romeida, where the stabbing took place Thursday
night. It said permits would be issued for permanent housing to
replace mobile homes at the site.
	   Arafat's aide said the decision would only hurt the peace
process.

Corretja rallies to defeat Agassi for RCA Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Alex Corretja survived a knockdown return by
Andre Agassi and then saved four break points in a crucial third
game of the final set for a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory Sunday in the
title match of the RCA Championships.
	   It was the first championship in the United States for Corretja,
No. 11 in the latest ATP rankings and seeded sixth in the
tournament, and was worth dlrs 122,500 to the 24-year-old Spaniard.
	   The victory cooled the hot summer streak of Agassi, the
winningest player on the ATP Tour this year, who is 50-12 with the
loss. He had won 19 of his previous 21 matches since falling to
Germany's Tommy Haas at Wimbledon.
	   Agassi, a four-time champion this year, had defeated Corretja
the previous four times they played. He appeared to be on his way
to another triumph when he knocked Corretja down with a hard smash
in the sixth game of the second set.
	   ``I didn't have much choice,'' said Agassi, who lined a forehand
shot into the shoulder of Corretja that dropped him to the court.
	   Agassi immediately jumped over the net to check on his opponent,
who rose up after a moment and resumed his match.
	   ``It's always a scary moment. He was close to the net and just
happened to be where I hit the ball,'' Agassi said.
	   ``When I got up, I didn't know where I was. I didn't know if I
was in Indianapolis or Barcelona (his hometown) or wherever,'' said
Corretja, who will break into the Top 10 in the next ATP Tour
rankings with the victory.
	   Agassi, who was seeded fifth in the tournament, was about to
even the set at 3-3 when the knockdown took place. He seemed to
lose his concentration and was broken when he double-faulted on two
of the last three points.
	   Corretja then held at love and claimed the set when Agassi
double-faulted once and won only one point on his serve.
	   ``I got a little tentative with my shots and got a little
conservative,'' said Agassi, who breezed though the first set in
only 34 minutes as he broke Corretja in his first two service games
while winning nine of the first 12 points on the Spaniard's serve.
	   The longest game of the match was the third in the third set,
when Corretja saved four break points before holding to go up 2-1
after six deuces.
	   The players held serve through the first six games of the final
set and Corretja took a 4-3 edge when he saved a break point, broke
Agassi while losing only one point and lost just one point in the
final game of the match.

Rematch in works after Robinson outpoints Gatti in rousing bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ A rematch is being planned
after Ivan Robinson outpointed Arturo Gatti by a split decision in
a thrilling 10-round lightweight battle Saturday night.
	   Robinson indicated he would bypass a title bout against WBC
champion Cesar Bazan to oppose Gatti again. Gatti (29-3) was
scheduled for the title bout if he, as the 4-1 favorite, beat
Robinson (26-2).
	   The second fight could be scheduled for November or January,
said Robinson's trainer, Eddie Woods, depending on how quickly
Gatti recovers from cuts around his left eye, which swelled
dramatically during Saturday night's bout.
	   ``He wants to do it again. I want to do it again,'' said
Robinson, 27, who sparred with Gatti, 26, in the past and considers
him a friend. ``Gatti has a huge heart. That's why I want to fight
him. This is what the fans come to see. We gave them a great
show.''
	   The crowd of about 2,000 at the Atlantic City Convention Center
rewarded the Jersey City-based Gatti and Philadelphia native
Robinson with a standing ovation as the fight ended.
	   Robinson landed scores of inside combinations, then sustained
Gatti's dangerous left hooks to the head. Two sent him reeling
along the ropes in the fight's final 30 seconds.
	   Gatti enhanced his warrior mystique Saturday, congratulating
Robinson and not complaining about the decision.
	   ``Ivan fought a great battle,'' Gatti said. ``I thought I could
get him out of there. I almost did. I know I take too many punches,
but that's how I fight.''
	   Robinson won 98-93 on one judge's scorecard and 96-94 on
another. Gatti won one card, 96-93. The Associated Press scored it
96-95 Robinson.

 &UR; By JESSICA ROBERTSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Packing 115-mph (184-kph) winds and
expected to grow stronger, Hurricane Bonnie crept northwestward
across the Atlantic Sunday on a tack that could threaten the
eastern United States.
	   The increasing winds made Bonnie a Category 3 hurricane, which
have winds of more than 111 mph (178 kph) and are capable of
extensive damage.
	   The storm moved slowly northwest about 180 miles (290
kilometers) east-northeast of San Salvador in the central Bahamas.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it might issue a
hurricane watch for the southeast U.S. coast on Monday.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center said in a
statement Sunday. The storm's winds were expected to increase.
	   Rough seas caused by the storm slammed three sailboats onto a
beach in Grand Turk, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) southeast of
the storm's center. Residents rescued all 14 people on the boats,
Turks and Caicos police reported.
	   In the Pacific Ocean, the winds of Hurricane Howard held steady
at around 144 mph (230 kph) Sunday, but forecasters predicted the
hurricane would weaken as it moves into cooler waters.
	   The Atlantic season's first hurricane, Bonnie, at more than 300
miles (480 kilometers) long, dwarfed sparsely populated Bahamian
islands, drenching them with rain and gusty winds.
	   Turks and Caicos police said a 40-foot (12-meter) Haitian sloop
and a 47-foot (14-meter) ketch from the United States broke from
their anchors Saturday and were driven 500 yards (450 meters) into
a nearby beach.
	   On Sunday morning, seas snapped the anchor rope of a second
40-foot (12-meter) sailboat from Haiti and drove it onto the same
beach.
	   Bonnie's worst thunderstorms battered the open seas to its
north, said National Hurricane Center forecaster John Guiney.
	   ``The lucky thing is ... the Bahamas will not be feeling the
full brunt of the storm,'' he said. But he noted that Bonnie has
been ``very erratic ... meandering around,'' making forecasts less
reliable.
	   At 5 p.m. Sunday (2100 GMT), the hurricane center said Bonnie
was moving at 5 mph (7 kph) on a course that would take it
northeast of the central Bahamas.
	   San Salvador administrator Charles King said by telephone that
islanders had prepared for Bonnie because ``they learned their
lesson with Hurricane Lili'' in 1996. Then, people tried to put up
shutters as the storm smashed into the island, which has a
population of 550. There was flooding but no severe damage.
	   Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the
hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet (1.8-2.7 meters) above
normal, and Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause flooding.

Austria's foreign minister calls Kiriyenko the victim of the
</HEADLINE>
lobbies &QL; 
 &UR; With MOSCOW--Russia Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The new Russian government must move
quickly to assure its international partners that it will pursue
economic reforms despite the removal of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, Austria's foreign minister said Sunday.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired the 36-year-old banker and
his entire government one week after Russia effectively devalued
the ruble. The announcement came in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   During a television interview, Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel described Kiriyenko as ``a victim of the
lobbies'' because of his inability to force the country's economic
power blocs to cooperate with reform programs.
	   Kiriyenko was replaced by former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly during
the Soviet era. He served as Yeltsin's prime minister from December
1992 until this March, when Kiriyenko was appointed.
	   The economic crisis in Russia is bad news for the Austrians, who
have extended about 60 billion Schillings (dlrs 4.8 billion) worth
of credits to the Russians, some of which are guaranteed by the
Austrian government.
	   Schuessel said Austria hoped the new government would press on
with reforms in the banking sector and accelerate privatization.
	   But Schuessel said there was little that major European powers
or the United States could do until the Russians themselves resolve
their political differences.
	   ``Russia cannot be cleaned up or reformed from outside,''
Schuessel said. ``The solution must come from within.''

Study shows fetuses metabolize cancer-causing tobacco byproduct
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists have known for years that smoking by
pregnant women causes babies to be born smaller, sicklier, at a
higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and _ in some cases _
even addicted to nicotine.
	   But a new study announced Sunday at the annual meeting of the
American Chemical Society in Boston offers what researchers say is
the first direct evidence that fetuses of women who smoke actually
metabolize cancer-causing agents contained in tobacco.
	   The study, conducted by University of Minnesota professor
Stephen S. Hecht and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute,
examined the first urine produced by 48 German newborns.
	   With the same equipment used to conduct sophisticated drug tests
on athletes, scientists searched for traces of the chemical NNK _
nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone _ one of the strongest
cancer-causing agents found in all types of tobacco products.
	   Previous studies have shown a relationship between NNK and lung
cancer in humans, as well as tumors in mice, rats and hamsters.
Experiments also have shown that NNK is a ``statistically
significant'' cause of tumors in the offspring of pregnant hamsters
and mice given the chemical, Hecht said.
	   While researchers found no traces of NNK in newborns of
non-smokers, they detected the carcinogen in 22 of 31 newborns of
mothers who smoked during pregnancy.
	   The pregnant women in the two-year study smoked between 5 and 25
cigarettes per day, averaging 12 cigarettes per day. Results showed
that NNK crosses the placental barrier between mother and fetus,
where it is then broken down by the fetus and expelled in its
urine, Hecht said.
	   ``Hopefully this will deliver the message one more time about
how dangerous it is for pregnant women to smoke,'' Hecht said
Sunday, a day before he was to formally present the study to the
society, which represents more than 150,000 scientists worldwide.
	   Hecht said more research is needed to determine the likelihood
of the NNK leading to cancer in the newborns later in life. Because
most mothers who smoke during pregnancy will continue to smoke
after they give birth, those children born with NNK are likely to
be exposed to years of tobacco smoke.
	   ``We need long-term studies by epidemiologists to determine the
consequences of exposure to tobacco smoke,'' said Hecht, adding
that while smoking is on the decline, more than 50 percent of women
who smoke continue to do so during pregnancy. ``Right now we are
depending on the memory of people with cancer to remember if their
mother smoked and how much.''

champions from Guadaloupe, Mexico, 6-1.
	   Starting pitcher Tetsuya Furukawa surrendered four hits, struck
out seven and added an RBI double and a triple.
	   Kashima scored two runs in the second inning on a passed ball
and two wild pitches by Guadaloupe pitcher Daniel Lopez. A pair of
throwing errors on an otherwise routine sacrifice bunt in the fifth
made it 3-0, and Furukawa followed with an RBI double.
	   A passed ball and Tomoyuki Okawa's RBI single gave Kashima a 6-0
lead in the fifth.
	   Guadalupe's sole run came on Jose Oregel's sixth inning home
run.
	   The Latin American champions stranded seven runners. They
threatened in the fourth and fifth innings, but Furukawa ended each
inning with strikeouts.
	   Guadalupe returns three players from the 1997 championship team,
and a coach from last year, Jose Valadez, is now the manager. Only
one team has won titles back-to-back: Monterrey, Mexico _ a town
just a few miles (kilometers) from Guadalupe _ in 1957-58.
	   The top two teams in the international pool meet Thursday with a
trip to the finals at stake. The championship is Saturday.
	   Guadaloupe left fielder Jorge Trevino was hit in the helmet by a
fastball, but ran to first after a minute on the ground and stayed
in the game.

Seles wins fourth du Maurier title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles of the United States won her fourth
consecutive du Maurier Open women's tennis championship Sunday with
a convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory over Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain.
	   Seles, 24, needed only 76 minutes to win the dlrs 150,000 top
prize for the hardcourt tournament at a sold-out, 10,500-seat Jarry
Stadium. Sanchez Vicario pocketed dlrs 60,000.
	   ``I just think I have a good time here,'' said Seles about the
hardcourt tournament that alternates between Toronto and Montreal.
``I love both Toronto and Montreal and I've always thought that if
you're relaxed off the court, you're probably more relaxed on the
court, too. It just seems to work for me.''
	   It was the first tournament title of the year for Seles, the
former world No. 1 currently ranked sixth in the world, who showed
she is in top form heading into the U.S. Open in two weeks.
	   Seles broke service for a 2-0 lead in the opening set and served
out for the win. She broke Sanchez Vicario to open the second set
and again for a 5-2 lead, while closing out the match without
losing her service.
	   ``Monica wasn't missing much today,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
``She served really well and didn't give me many chances. I had a
break point in the second set and really, that was my only chance.
I don't think I played badly, she just played much better.''
	   Seles faced only one break point in the match and lost only 10
points on her serve during the match.
	   Seles, who upset top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the
semifinals, and Sanchez Vicario, who had ended Czech veteran Jana
Novotna's 19-match winning run, were each competing in their fifth
du Maurier final.
	   Sanchez Vicario won in 1992 _ beating Seles in the final _ and
1994. Seles also beat Sanchez Vicario in the 1996 final en route to
her four straight titles.
	   While Seles has struggled to regain her form since a fan stabbed
her in the back during a tournament in 1993, she has dominated the
du Maurier, beginning her comeback with a victory in the 1995 final
over South Africa's Amanda Coetzer.
	   Her record in five du Maurier appearances is 24-1.
	   It was a baseline battle from the beginning, but Seles hit the
ball harder and came up with the more inventive shots than the
27-year-old Sanchez Vicario.
	   Sanchez Vicario, also a former world No. 1 and now ranked
fourth, defeated Seles in the French Open final in June for her
third career title at Roland Garros. But Seles holds a career 16-3
record against the Spaniard.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Pedro Martinez pitched six shutout innings
and Darren Bragg matched a career-high with four hits as the Boston
Red Sox beat the Minnesota Twins 5-1 Sunday.
	   Martinez (17-4) allowed four hits, struck out three and walked
one. He did not allow an extra-base hit after Otis Nixon led off
the game with a double.
	   John Valentin had three hits, including his 16th homer and
scored three runs for Boston, which leads Baltimore by eight games
in the AL wild-card race.
	   Mo Vaughn and Mike Stanley also had three hits each for the Red
Sox.
	   The game featured the second matchup in 11 days between
Martinez, the 1997 NL Cy Young winner, and Brad Radke (10-12), a
20-game winner in 1997. It also included a brief discussion between
the teams after Martinez hit Minnesota's Matt Lawton in the sixth.
 &UR; Indians 4, Orioles 1
	   In Baltimore, Dwight Gooden won his third straight decision and
Travis Fryman drove in two runs, leading the Cleveland Indians over
the Baltimore Orioles.
	   Gooden (6-6) is 3-0 in his last five starts and has not lost
since July 26. He allowed four hits and an unearned run in 6 1-3
innings to reach .500 for the first time since he was 3-3 at the
All-Star break.
	   Cleveland won two of three from the Orioles during the weekend.
Baltimore has dropped three of four, but still has baseball's best
record since the break at 31-11.
	   Mike Jackson pitched the ninth inning for his 32nd save.
	   Sidney Ponson (7-7) had not lost in nine starts and was 6-0
since his last setback on June 26.
 &UR; Royals 11, Devil Rays 5
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Sal Fasano had a career-high four
hits and hit consecutive home runs with Jermaine Dye as the Kansas
City Royals beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   The Royals matched a season high with their fourth straight
victory.
	   Fasano went 4-for-4 and drove in three runs. He homered in the
third inning, then added RBI singles in the sixth and seventh.
	   The Royals' last four-game winning streak came May 24-29. The
Devil Rays have dropped six of seven and fell 30 games under .500
(49-79) for the first time.
	   Pat Rapp (10-11), who pitched a shutout at Tropicana Field on
May 13, gave up a three-run homer to Bubba Trammell in the sixth.
	   Dye's homer off Bryan Rekar (1-6) cleared the top of the
left-field pole. Three pitches later, Fasano hit his seventh homer,
an opposite-field drive down the right-field line.

Pitkowski, Maclagan win singles titles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Top-seeded Sarah Pitkowski of France, enjoying
her best year since joining the Corel WTA Tour in 1993, defeated
No. 2 Cara Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 7-5 Sunday to win the women's
singles in the dlrs 75,000 GHI Bronx Tennis Classic.
	   Britain's Miles Maclagan, who has struggled ever since he
injured his right elbow in 1996, was a 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 winner over
Israel's Oren Motevassel in the men's title match.
	   ``I was getting ready for a third set,'' said the 22-year-old
Pitkowski, who, in winning her ninth career title, captured five
straight games in each set.
	   ``In the first set, I was down 2-5 and then rallied to take the
next fix games. That carried over to the second set when I jumped
off to a 2-0 advantage.
	   ``It was probably because I was getting tired that I lost five
in a row and that's when I said to myself, 'Get ready for the third
set.' All of a sudden things started to go my way and I got the
next five games ... and the match.''
	   Pitkowski, whose best career ranking was No. 39 last March, is
currently ranked 46th in the world and anxiously awaiting next
week's U.S. Open. She has reached the second round in that event
each of the last two years.
	   ``I'm ready for the U.S. Open,'' she said. ``This tournament was
a great preparation. My goal is to get past the second round (and)
... hopefully beat a big player and get my ranking under 40.''

 &UR; Kucera beats Ivanisevic for Pilot Pen title &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sunday's match &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Karol Kucera earned his first
title on United States soil Sunday, beating Goran Ivanisevic 6-4,
5-7, 6-2 in the final of the Pilot Pen International.
	   The match was a study in contrasts: the steady, unflappable
Kucera against the emotional and unpredictable Ivanisevic. On a
couple close calls that went against him, the volatile Croat tossed
his racket and ripped his shirt.
	   It also pitted the tour's top server against the top returner.
Coming into the tournament, Ivanisevic had 666 aces in 44 matches.
Kucera had a 36 percent return rate in 50 matches.
	   Kucera broke Ivanisevic four times, including the fifth game of
the second set when an apparent Ivanisevic ace was overruled,
making it 0-40. Ivanisevic won the next two points, but
double-faulted for the game and Kucera took a pivotal 3-2 lead.
	   He served out for the match, winning it when Ivanisevic sent his
return long.
	   ``It's always very tough,'' said Kucera. ``He was serving very,
very well today. I am very happy with the way I played today. I
hope I'm going to play this well in the U.S. Open.''
	   Ivanisevic had 15 aces to Kucera's eight, but not much else in
his arsenal. His usually stinging backhand had little bite or
predictability.
	   The 24-year-old Slovak kept Ivanisevic on the move throughout
the match with his offspeed groundstrokes, and fatigue became a
factor.
	   ``I was tired. I hit a lot of forehands,'' Ivanisevic said. ``My
backhand was like roulette _ I had no clue where the ball was
going.''
	   He also strongly questioned if the chair umpire or linesmen knew
where the ball was going. A serve he thought was an ace, but ruled
wide in the ninth game brought Ivanisevic to the net. After having
a few words with the umpire, he stared down a line judge for
several seconds.
	   ``Instead of 15-All, it's love-30. It happened twice and it is a
big difference. A couple of bad calls cost me the match,''
Ivanisevic said.
	   Ivanisevic, who is 0-5 in U.S. finals, also was hard on himself
when he missed easy chances. With Kucera serving and up 5-4 in the
first set, Ivanisevic battled back from 15-40 to deuce. When he
missed an easy winner, he ripped a large hole in his shirt and had
to play the next two points before he could make a change, losing
the game and the set.
	   At the end of the match, Ivanisevic climbed onto the empty
umpire's chair while Kucera was accepting his award. He said the
view was a comfortable one.
	   ``I saw a lot of nice lines. It is very nice to sit, you know,
that is why he makes so many mistakes,'' he said.

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Sayaka Tsushima made history
Sunday as the first girl to play for a Far East team in the Little
League World Series, playing center field and going 1-for-2 with a
single, walk and two runs as Kashima, Japan, defeated the defending
champions from Guadalupe, Mexico, 6-1.
	   Starting pitcher Tetsuya Furukawa surrendered four hits, struck
out seven and added an RBI double and a triple.

Singh's eagle clinches International
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ Vijay Singh led wire-to-wire Sunday
and punctuated his final round with an eagle on the 17th hole to
capture the Sprint International for his second title in as many
weeks.
	   Singh, 35, the newly crowned PGA champion, began the day with 33
points and a narrow 1-point lead under the modified Stableford
scoring system used in this event. The Fijian never relinquished
it.
	   Singh birdied five holes on his front nine, increasing his point
total to 43 for a 7-point lead over Willie Wood at the turn. His
potential runaway didn't materialize, however, and the victory
wasn't clinched until eight holes later.
	   Nursing a 1-point lead over both Wood and defending champion
Phil Mickelson, Singh played the 492-yard (450-meter), par-5 17th
hole perfectly.
	   He drilled a 3-wood 306 yards (280 meters) uphill to the middle
of the fairway, then hit an 8-iron to the back fringe. His
downhill, curving putt from about 25 feet (7.6 meters) found the
cup for a 5-point eagle, increasing his point total to 47.
	   Wood and Mickelson tied for second at 41, and Tiger Woods, who
fashioned four eagles in the first three rounds but none on Sunday,
finished at 38. Rocco Mediate was next at 37.
	   The International's scoring format awards 5 points for an eagle,
2 for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double bogey or worse. Points accumulated over all four rounds. The
field, cut at the halfway point, was cut again to the top 36
scorers and ties for Sunday's final round.
	   Singh's early birdie barrage gave him a seemingly comfortable
lead. But after Singh's poor drive on No. 10 and subsequent bogey,
Wood ran in birdie putts at the 11th and 12th holes, and the lead
was trimmed to 2 points.
	   Wood three-putted the 14th to fall another point behind, but the
diminutive American sank a 15-foot (4.6-meter) birdie putt at No.
16 to cut the deficit to 1.
	   The 17th hole is a birdie and eagle opportunity for most
players, but Wood's lack of length hurt him there. His drive found
the right rough, and his second shot, a long iron, was short of the
green. He pitched to 20 feet (6.1 meters) but two-putted for a
disappointing par.
	   Mickelson, who birdied three holes on the front nine to get to
34, closed with a flourish. He eagled the 17th and birdied the
18th, a 7-point flurry.
	   Woods started fast, birdieing his first two holes and, after a
bogey at No. 3, carding another birdie at No. 4 to get to 36
points. But, struggling with his swing mechanics, Woods began
spraying the ball and suffered bogeys at Nos. 6, 9 and 12 to drop
to 33.
	   Back-to-back birdies at Nos. 14 and 15 got him back in
contention at 37 points, but he three-putted the 16th hole and his
eagle bid failed at 17 when his putt slid past the hole.
	   Bob Tway, who began the day far off the pace at 20, birdied four
holes on the front side and eagled the 17th. His 16-point round
vaulted him to 36.
	   Brad Faxon, at 23 after three rounds, also made a belated move
with an eagle at 17 to get to 36.
	   Steve Flesch and Brandt Jobe also finished at 36.

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Sayaka Tsushima made history
Sunday as the first girl to play for a Far East team in the Little
League World Series, playing center field and going 1-for-2 with a
single, walk and two runs as Kashima, Japan, defeated the defending
champions from Guadalupe, Mexico, 6-1.
	   Starting pitcher Tetsuya Furukawa surrendered four hits, struck
out seven and added an RBI double and a triple.
	   Kashima scored two runs in the second inning on a passed ball
and two wild pitches by Guadalupe pitcher Daniel Lopez. A pair of
throwing errors on an otherwise routine sacrifice bunt in the fifth
made it 3-0, and Furukawa followed with an RBI double.
	   A passed ball and Tomoyuki Okawa's RBI single gave Kashima a 6-0
lead in the fifth.
	   Guadalupe's sole run came on Jose Oregel's sixth inning home
run.
	   The Latin American champions stranded seven runners. They
threatened in the fourth and fifth innings, but Furukawa ended each
inning with strikeouts.
	   ``Sometimes, when they're down, they can come back, but today
wasn't one of those days,'' Guadalupe manager Jose Valdez said.
	   How did the win make Sayaka feel?
	   ``Very happy,'' she said, through an interpreter, with a big
smile.
	   Sayaka has played baseball for about 2 1-2 years and is one of
the team's best athletes. She also plays golf and soccer.
	   ``She's the No. 1 fighter on the team,'' manager Atsushi Ohkawa
said.
	   Guadalupe returns three players from the 1997 championship team,
and Valdez, a coach from last year, is now the manager. Only one
team has won titles back-to-back: Monterrey, Mexico _ a town just a
few miles (kilometers) from Guadalupe _ in 1957-58.
	   The top two teams in the international pool meet Thursday with a
trip to the finals at stake. The championship is Saturday.
	   Guadalupe left fielder Jorge Trevino was hit in the helmet by a
fastball, but ran to first after a minute on the ground and stayed
in the game.

	   In Anaheim, california, Randy Velarde hit a go-ahead two-run
triple and Chuck Finley won for just the second time in 13 home

seventh helped rally the Angels, who concluded a 5-2 homestand and
stretched their AL West lead to three games over Texas. The Rangers

Fred Meyer could be Palmer's last tournament for a while
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ As usual, Arnold Palmer will be the
crowd favorite at the Fred Meyer Challenge. Only this time fans and
players may be watching his every move with more sympathy than awe.
	   The Fred Meyer, a unique best-ball charity tournament scheduled
for Monday and Tuesday by 12 two-man teams, will be Palmer's last
tournament before he begins seven weeks of radiation therapy as
follow-up treatment for successful prostate cancer surgery last
year.
	   Palmer's physician has described the treatments as precautionary
after recent tests revealed that the golfer might have traces of
the disease. No visible cancer tissue has been found, and the
treatment is not expected to especially grueling for Palmer.
	   But fans at the Fred Meyer, now in its 13th year, are sure to
give Palmer a loving send-off for what will amount to an extended
vacation from competition and personal appearances.
	   ``Naturally, I'm disappointed to have to forego my business
trips and tournament play, but I certainly do what my doctors tell
me now so that I can get back to all my normal activities as soon
as possible,'' Palmer said last week.
	   Peter Jacobsen, the founder of the Fred Meyer and Palmer's
teammate at the previous 13 tournaments, learned of Palmer's
therapy from the newspaper in Denver before Saturday's third round
of the International.
	   ``It came as a surprise and a shock,'' Jacobsen said. ``I will
support Arnold as much as I can Monday and Tuesday and I hope the
people in the Portland area will turn out to show their love and
respect.''
	   Palmer, 68, was scheduled to arrive in Portland late Sunday
night. Jacobsen, contending for a top-10 finish at the
International, was to arrive in the afternoon, missing his own
clinic and the Washington Mutual Pro-Am.
	   Others playing at the Fred Meyer include Masters and British
Open winner Mark O'Meara and U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen. Brad
Faxon, who won the Fred Meyer with Australian Greg Norman the past
three years, will team up with Billy Andrade. Norman will not play.
	   This year the tournament, a non PGA Tour event, is being held at
the Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club, a plush new course in Aloha, a
suburb west of Portland. The Reserve consists of two courses side
by side, making it easier for spectators to watch.
	   Players will compete for dlrs 1 million in prize money, with
dlrs 150,000 going to the winning team. Peter Jacobsen Productions,
Inc., donates a portion of proceeds to several Portland-area
charities.

Compromise ends Hyundai Motor's 36-day labor dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove garble
 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union officials of
strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. reached a compromise Monday, ending
a 36-day labor dispute at the nation's largest automaker.
	   The compromise allowing ``a minimum level of layoffs'' came in
last-ditch government-mediated negotiations carried out over the
past week. A breakthrough was made when both sides agreed on terms
of the layoffs in overnight talks.
	   ``The past one month was truly agonizing. I hope this will be an
opportunity for both labor and management to live together
peacefully,'' union leader Kim Kwang-shik told a news conference.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho, who led the last-minute mediations,
praised the compromise, calling it ``a great victory achieved
through dialogue and concessions.''
	   Hyundai's 26,000-strong union walked off their jobs July 20 in
protest of the company's plan to lay off 1,583 workers. Hyundai had
shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   But the compromise raised questions about South Korea's ability
to ensure a flexible labor market, a key to wooing back much-needed
foreign investment. It was criticized by some as being too
pro-labor.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, blasted the government's role, accusing it of siding
with the union because of the political risks involved in using
police force to break up strikes.
	   ``The legally guaranteed layoffs have failed in the case of
Hyundai. This has set a bad precedent and will negatively affect
other businesses,'' said Kim Young-bae, a managing director of the
federation.
	   The labor union demanded that the company cancel the latest
plans to lay off the 1,583 workers. Under Monday's compromise, the
company was allowed to lay off only 277 workers, with the remaining
1,261 put on 1 1/2 years of unpaid leave.
	   The 277 workers to be laid off will be given enhanced severance
payments and chances to be rehired by Hyundai Motor or other
Hyundai subsidiaries, said a joint statement by both sides.
	   The company also agreed to contribute 5 billion won (dlrs 3.8
million) to the workers' welfare fund and minimize legal action
against union leaders who have led the labor disputes, outlawed by
the government.
	   The last sticking point was a demand by the union that the
company drop lawsuits against 64 union leaders responsible for the
strike. The company accepted the demand on the condition that the
union ``does its best to normalize plant operations.''
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, was
the first major business to shed redundant workers. Observers saw
Hyundai as a test of South Korea's will to keep its promise to
ensure a flexible labor market.
	   After talks between Hyundai's management and union continued to
stall, government mediators intervened. The government ruled the
Hyundai strike illegal but withheld the use of police force to end
it because of its negative impact.
	   Resorting to force could have proved an embarrassment to
President Kim Dae-jung, a former opposition leader who routinely
criticized past governments of unfairly using police brutality to
break up strikes.
	   Hyundai needed to reduce its work force because of sharply
falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been operating at 40
percent of its annual capacity of 1.65 million units.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers have
resisted layoffs with a spate of strikes this year. And some
commentators were predicting more to come.
	   ``This kind of solution has the danger of inviting a second,
third similar dispute,'' the influential Chosun Ilbo newspaper said
in an editorial. 6 ``If a flexible labor market cannot be secured,
as in this case, foreign investment cannot be expected,'' it said.

Abubakar scraps Nigeria's oil ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler has scrapped the
country's oil ministry and will appoint a civilian technocrat to
oversee the West African country's lucrative petroleum sector, one
of the world's largest, an official said Sunday.
	   Although no one has yet been named to the post, a senior figure
in Nigeria's commercial petroleum sector is expected to head a new
directorate to be created by Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, a government
official said late Sunday on condition of anonymity.
	   The move follows mounting calls for Nigeria to abolish the oil
ministry in favor of an advisory body.
	   The oil ministry, including Minister Chief Dan Etete, had been
linked to wide-scale corruption and mismanagement allegations.
	   Although Nigeria has one of the world's largest oil industries,
the country is plagued by chronic shortages and a number of
refineries stand idle as a result of neglect and graft.
	   Abubakar has sworn in 31 new ministers in recent days after
dissolving the country's cabinet, which included key allies of the
notorious late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Among the new ministers
are Finance Minister Ismaila Usman and Foreign Affairs Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka.
	   Abubakar arrived in South Africa on Sunday for a three-day
visit, including talks to brief President Nelson Mandela on
Abubakar's announced intention to hand over power to civilian rule
by May next year.

Pirates 4, Cardinals 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Mark McGwire is hitting home runs so fast,
he's rewriting history with almost every prodigious swing of his
bat.
	   McGwire hit his 53rd homer to become the first National League
players to hit that many in 49 years Sunday as St. Louis lost 4-3
to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   McGwire became just the third NL player to hit as many as 53
homers in a season, joining the Pirates' Ralph Kiner (54 in 1949)
and the Chicago Cubs' Hack Wilson, who hit a league-record 56
homers in 1930.
	   McGwire, who broke Babe Ruth's record for homers over three
consecutive seasons with a tape-measure homer Saturday, hit a 2-2
pitch from Ricardo Rincon deep into the left-field seats with two
outs in the eighth inning.
	   McGwire's sixth homer in five days left him eight short of tying
Roger Maris' record of 61 in 1961 with 32 games to play, and it
rated him the rarest of ovations _ a curtain call on the road.
 &UR; Astros 13, Cubs 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa's 50th and 51st homers carried far over
the ivy-covered walls at Wrigley Field. The just couldn't carry the
Cubs.
	   Sosa's 51 homers are the second-most in the club history and
left him trailing McGwire by two in the race to overtake Roger
Maris' 61.
	   The Cubs' club and NL record is 56 homers by Hack Wilson in
1930.
	   Craig Biggio hit a pair of three-run homers and Brad Ausmus had
four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs as the Astros
increased their NL Central lead to 9{ games over Chicago.
	   Sosa had gone nine at-bats since his last homer Friday when he
drove a 3-2 pitch from Houston's Jose Lima (13-6) completely over
the bleachers in left-center field in the fifth inning.
	   The drive, that cut Houston's lead to 4-2, was estimated at 440
feet.
	   With a crowd of 38,714 at Wrigley Field standing and chanting
his name, Sosa stepped out of the dugout for a curtain call.
	   That was about all the fans had to cheer about until Sosa came
to bat again in the eighth. Then he hit a 1-0 pitch from Lima deep
into the left-field bleachers.
 &UR; Padres 13, Brewers 11 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jim Leyritz's two-run double in the 10th helped
San Diego win a wild one.
	   The teams combined for 33 hits against 12 pitchers in a game
that took 2 hours, 3 minutes to complete the first four innings.
Both teams had identical scorelines _ 8 runs, 10 hits and 3 errors
going into the fifth.
	   In the 10th, Steve Finley walked leading off and took third on a
single by Greg Vaughn before Leyritz doubled to right-center off
Bob Wickman (6-7). The Padres scored a run to tie it 10-10 in the
ninth when Andy Sheets grounded into a double play.
	   Trevor Hoffman (4-1) pitched two innings for the victory.
	   Vaughn set a career-high with his 42nd homer, a 455-foot
(138-meter) shot in the third inning that was the longest homer at
County Stadium this season. He his 41 homers in 1996.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, the host Mets blew a bases-loaded threat in the
ninth inning.
	   Trailing by two runs, the Mets loaded the bases with no outs
against Gregg Olson on singles by Brian McRae and pinch-hitter
Lenny Harris and a bunt single by Luis Lopez.
	   But Olson struck out pinch-hitter Matt Franco, got pinch-hitter
Carlos Baerga on an RBI grounder and retired Tony Phillips on a
game-ending groundout. Olson got his 22nd save.
	   Al Leiter (12-5), who has the second-lowest ERA in the majors at
2.36, lost for only the second time in 11 decisions since May 17.
	   Brian Anderson (9-12) won for only the second time in a month
despite allowing his major league-leading 33rd homer, a leadoff
drive in the fourth by Edgardo Alfonzo.
 &UR; Giants 10, Marlins 5 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Barry Bonds homered to become the first player to hit
400 home runs and steal 400 bases.
	   Bonds reached the unprecedented milestone in the second inning

Compromise ends Hyundai Motor's 36-day labor dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS number of workers to 1,538 in grafs 5 and 9; minor
editing &QL; 
 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union officials of
strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. reached a compromise Monday, ending
a 36-day labor dispute at the nation's largest automaker.
	   The compromise allowing ``a minimum level of layoffs'' came in
last-ditch government-mediated negotiations carried out over the
past week. A breakthrough was made when both sides agreed on terms
of the layoffs in overnight talks.
	   ``The past one month was truly agonizing. I hope this will be an
opportunity for both labor and management to live together
peacefully,'' union leader Kim Kwang-shik told a news conference.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho, who led the last-minute mediations,
praised the compromise, calling it ``a great victory achieved
through dialogue and concessions.''
	   Hyundai's 26,000-strong union walked off their jobs July 20 in
protest of the company's plan to lay off 1,538 workers. Hyundai had
shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   But the compromise raised questions about South Korea's ability
to ensure a flexible labor market, a key to wooing back much-needed
foreign investment. It was criticized by some as being too
pro-labor.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, blasted the government's role, accusing it of siding
with the union because of the political risks involved in using
police force to break up strikes.
	   ``The legally guaranteed layoffs have failed in the case of
Hyundai. This has set a bad precedent and will negatively affect
other businesses,'' said Kim Young-bae, a managing director of the
federation.
	   The labor union demanded that the company cancel the latest
plans to lay off the 1,538 workers. Under Monday's compromise, the
company was allowed to lay off only 277 workers, with the remaining
1,261 put on 1 1/2 years of unpaid leave.
	   The 277 workers to be laid off will be given enhanced severance
payments and chances to be rehired by Hyundai Motor or other
Hyundai subsidiaries, said a joint statement by both sides.
	   The company also agreed to contribute 5 billion won (dlrs 3.8
million) to the workers' welfare fund and minimize legal action
against union leaders who have led the labor disputes, outlawed by
the government.
	   The last sticking point was a demand by the union that the
company drop lawsuits against 64 union leaders responsible for the
strike. The company accepted the demand on the condition that the
union ``does its best to normalize plant operations.''
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, was
the first major business to shed redundant workers. Observers saw
Hyundai as a test of South Korea's will to keep its promise to
ensure a flexible labor market.
	   After talks between Hyundai's management and union continued to
stall, government mediators intervened. The government ruled the
Hyundai strike illegal but withheld the use of police force to end
it because of its negative impact.
	   Resorting to force could have proved an embarrassment to
President Kim Dae-jung, a former opposition leader who routinely
criticized past governments of unfairly using police brutality to
break up strikes.
	   Hyundai needed to reduce its work force because of sharply
falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been operating at 40
percent of its annual capacity of 1.65 million units.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers have
resisted layoffs with a spate of strikes this year. And some
commentators were predicting more to come.
	   ``This kind of solution has the danger of inviting a second,
third similar dispute,'' the influential Chosun Ilbo newspaper said
in an editorial.
	   ``If a flexible labor market cannot be secured, as in this case,
foreign investment cannot be expected,'' it said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the Russian
government Sunday and replaced his young prime minister with the
Soviet-style leader he'd fired five months ago. The surprise
announcement came in the midst of one of the worst economic crises
since the Soviet collapse, and one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble.
Yeltsin gave no reason for firing Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect from Western
economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem the collapse
of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation of the
economy. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Back from the brink, President Laurent
Kabila's quest for regional military support paid off Sunday when
his Angolan allies captured a key rebel stronghold in western
Congo. The rebels acknowledged losing the town, but said they were
continuing their advance on Kinshasa, the capital, and had also
captured the important eastern city of Kisangani. The strategic
Angolan victory was a much needed boost for an embattled Kabila,
but it also threatens to transform Congo into a proxy battlefield
for a region-wide war of shifting alliances and uncertain
prospects. With air support and rumbling tanks, Angolan forces
drove into the airbase at Kitona, near the Atlantic coastline,
effectively cutting off the advancing rebel army from its rear
supply base. (CONGO-REBELS)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The hospitality Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers have extended Osama bin Laden cooled Sunday, days after
American missiles hit an area in the eastern of the country where
he is accused of training an international army of Islamic
militants. Taliban spokesman Mullah Abdullah, reached on satellite
telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Afghanistan said
bin Laden would be allowed to travel only ``in Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan and he will be provided security by Taliban fighters.''
Abdullah described it as a security measure, but it amounted to a
restriction on the movements of bin Laden, whom Washington blames
for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The United States launched missiles Thursday at an alleged bin
Laden military training camp. (AFGHANISTAN-US BOMBINGS)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl rallied 18,000 party
faithful Sunday to energize his push for re-election, portraying
himself as a trusted statesman in uncertain times and his opponent
as a showman hiding behind vague promises. With just five weeks
left in his toughest campaign as incumbent, Kohl called on backers
at a Dortmund civic center to help him fight for every vote ahead
of the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections. The conservative Christian
Democrats lag in the polls, but with some putting nearly half of
voters' undecided, Kohl pledged, ``We can win. We want to win. We
will win.'' (GERMANY-KOHL)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Sporadic clashes on the dusty streets
of Hebron between Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and
Palestinians, some children, went on for several hours Sunday even
as an Israeli army curfew kept most of the population indoors.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burned American and
Israeli flags in protest of the U.S. strikes against fundamentalist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan. In Hebron, Israeli soldiers
scuffled with Jewish settlers and fired towards Palestinian
children. Angered over the recent killing of a rabbi from their
community, several settlers scuffled with Israeli soldiers and a
group of settler children pelted Palestinian journalists with eggs,
potatoes, and apples near one of six compounds Jewish residents
occupy in Hebron. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

	   LONDON (AP) _ And then there were six?
	   Days after newspapers reported that Posh Spice Victoria Adams is
pregnant, the News of the World on Sunday announced that a second
member of the hit band The Spice Girls is expecting.
	   ``I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no,'' the tabloid quoted
Scary Spice Melanie Brown as saying. But when the paper asked her
father for comment, he said: ``How did you find out? You're the
first.''
	   The News of the World said 23-year-old Ms. Brown ``and her
delighted fiance,'' dancer Jimmy Gulzar, plan to marry as soon as
the group finishes its U.S. tour, which ends this week.
	   ``The pair have already phoned Mel's family in Leeds to tell
them about the baby. Excited Mel has also bought a house and is
having builders install a nursery,'' the newspaper enthused.
	   No one answered calls at the office of The Spice Girls'
spokesman, Alan Edwards.
	   Ms. Adams, 24, and her fiance, Manchester United soccer star
David Beckham, have not commented on reports she is pregnant. They
plan to marry next year.
	   Ms. Adams will take time off from the Spice Girls' hectic
schedule but will not leave the band, reports said.
	   The fifth Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell, also known as Ginger
Spice, quit the band in June.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Readying for his new job on ``NYPD Blue,''
former child star Rick Schroder learned from some real Big Apple
cops.
	   Riding along with police, Schroder recently spent a day racing
around New York, visiting the sites of two homicides, a suicide,
the city morgue and watching undercover ``buy-and-bust'' narcotics
operations.
	   ``It was intense and extensive,'' Schroder said in Sunday's
Daily News. ``These guys do a hell of a job.''
	   Fans of the gritty TV crime drama weren't the only ones
surprised by the casting of Schroder, 28, to replace Jimmy Smits.
	   ``I feel like I won the lottery,'' Schroder said.
	   A native New Yorker, Schroder first appeared in a TV commercial
at age 3 months. Dozens of other commercials followed and he went
on to co-star in ``The Champ'' with Jon Voight and in the
Americansitcom ``Silver Spoons.''
	   Despite obvious benefits, stardom is no picnic for a child,
Schroder said.
	   ``It's pretty tough on a kid,'' he said. ``Then it's even
tougher to build a second career as an adult.''
	   Schroder's adult career has featured several TV movies and a
small part in the film ``Crimson Tide.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) _ Shaker Heights High School's choir
director didn't realize Shania Twain is ``still the one.''
Thankfully, his students do.
	   Nine singers from the school's a cappella choir and four
drummers from the marching band have been chosen to perform with
the country music star Tuesday night at Blossom Music Center,
between Cleveland and Akron.
	   Robert Schneider, choir director and chairman of the school's
music department in this Cleveland suburb, wasn't familiar with the
name when the singer's publicist called last week.
	   ``Shania who?'' Schneider asked.
	   ``I went out and announced it to the choir and they all went
wild. All these kids love her. And I feel really old,'' said
Schneider, 46.
	   The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, whose hits include
``You're Still the One,'' is on her first national tour. She

	   HITCHCOCK, South Dakota (AP) _ What's in a name? A lot of work
for the post office in tiny Hitchcock, which is getting hundreds of
requests from stamp collectors to hand-cancel stamps and
commemorative envelopes honoring movie director Alfred Hitchcock.
	   Postmaster Kathy Price hand-cancels the Hitchcock postage stamps
with a special ink stamp that prints out the movie director's
famous profile and the words ``Suspense Station, Hitchcock, S.D.
57348, August 4, 1998.''
	   That was the first day that the U.S. Postal Service offered the
Hitchcock stamp to the public.
	   Price said she knew offering the special cancellation _
available through Sept. 4 _ would interest collectors.
	   Hand-cancellation requests have come to Hitchcock (population:
100) from as far away as Germany, France and Italy.
	   Many collectors ask whether the master of movie suspense was
born in Hitchcock. The late director was born in London in 1899. He
died in 1980. His films include ``Rear Window'' (1954) and
``Psycho'' (1960), and he hosted the television series ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents'' from 1955 to 1965.

In an American suburb, Northern Irish teens find common ground
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY368 &QL; 
 &UR; By JENNIFER BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEVITTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Keelin Mullin was by the pool in
suburban Philadelphia when news came that a car bomb had exploded
15 miles (25 kms) from her hometown of Strabane, Northern Ireland.
	   She phoned her mother. Then the 15-year-old Catholic clasped
hands with Heidi Vaughan, a Protestant teen-ager also from
Strabane, and cried.
	   ``I'm so glad I was in America. I'm so glad Heidi was there,''
Keelin said four days later by telephone. She had just returned to
a Northern Ireland stricken by its worst terrorist bombing. Among
the 28 dead was her 17-year-old cousin, as well as one of Heidi's
classmates.
	   Before this summer, Keelin couldn't have imagined turning to a
Protestant friend for comfort. Back home, she has attended an
all-Catholic school for as long as she can remember. All her
friends are Catholic.
	   But eight weeks on neutral American ground, in the company of
other Northern Irish youngsters from both sides of the religious
divide, served to broaden her horizons. In the Philadelphia suburb
of Levittown, she discovered that Catholics and Protestants have
much more in common than she imagined.
	   The program that brought the 126 girls and boys to the United
States is the Children's Friendship Project of Northern Ireland, a
nonprofit group based in Atlanta.
	   It pairs Catholic and Protestant teen-agers, each from the same
Northern Ireland community, and places them with U.S. families for
a summer to foster friendship and tolerance. Heidi and Keelin were
roommates with Maggie Currey and her family.
	   ``We thought maybe if we could do something, when they grow up
things would change,'' said Mrs. Currey.
	   ``It's one pair at a time, who in turn influence others. It's a
slow process, but there is change,'' said Beverly Cassel, regional
coordinator for the project.
	   In the program's early years, sectarian arguments between
teen-agers were common, even leading in rare cases to violence.
Organizers have since excluded most inner-city youths as already
too hardened to change. They also require participating pairs to
meet before leaving Northern Ireland. If they don't get along, they
are disqualified.
	   The program probably doesn't reach the most critical youths,
like those who live in Belfast and may one day join the cycle of
violence, Mrs. Cassel admitted.
	   ``We do not have someone who's been in trouble, who probably has
so much hate in them they probably wouldn't be open to this kind of
program,'' Mrs. Cassel said. ``All of the children could really use
something like this. All have witnessed some horrific things: their
father being shot, their neighbor.''
	   ``These young people are the hope of the future,'' said former
U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who brokered the Northern Ireland peace
agreement last Easter.
	   ``They're raised in a segregated society and can really benefit
from these programs that bring people of different religions
together,'' he said at a ceremony in Philadelphia attended by eight
of the girls.
	   Of the 126 participants, 22 were from around Omagh.
	   ``It just gets you and all your friends and family. There's
nothing you can do,'' said Keelin speaking from her home as her
family was returning from her cousin's funeral.
	   Heidi, also reached by phone, said the bombing struck closer to
home for her than any previous act of violence in Northern Ireland.
``The other stuff seemed farther away. This was so close,'' she
said.
	   After the bombing, Keelin and Heidi stayed up all night talking,
Mrs. Currey recalled. ``They were a strength for one another,'' she
said. ``They didn't lay any blame at all. All they cared about was
how to get through it all. Keelin worried about Heidi's family;
Heidi worried about Keelin's family.''
	   The attack has been claimed by Irish Republican Army dissidents
opposed to the deal brokered by Mitchell.
	   ``Even though something this horrible happened at the end, I
know the program is still a really good idea. There are 126 people
that are changed, that have bonded with someone of another
religion. So there is an end to all this,'' Heidi said.
	   The youngsters who spent their summer here say it was strange to
watch events in Northern Ireland through the prism of American TV.
	   ``You see it here and it seems so big. They only televise the
big events,'' said Joanne McCracken. ``At home, it's like we see it
every day. Every roadblock, every detail.''
	   Heidi said that when she's at home, she often watches TV to find
out if roadblocks have closed any routes she might want to use.
	   Keelin added, ``But if you were scared every time you went
outside, you'd never leave.''
	   Keelin and Heidi say they learned much about the other's
religion _ especially the many similarities.
	   ``Hopefully some good will come out of it. Already, Catholics
and Protestants are coming together at chapels for funerals and
that wouldn't have happened before,'' Keelin said.
	   As a result of her close friendship with Heidi, Keelin is
considering enrolling at Strabane's integrated school, one of the
few in Northern Ireland that are attended by both Catholics and
Protestants.
	   Until now, Keelin said, she would have been frightened to go
near the school while wearing her school uniform, because its
insignia would single her out as Catholic.
	   But Heidi convinced her she would be safe.
	   To Mrs. Currey, forging such friendships is a way to break down
suspicion and ignorance chip by tiny chip.
	   ``This is how the argument would get continued to the next
generation. `Your neighborhood is dangerous,' or `Your friends are
paranoid.' But these girls are trying to change that,'' she said.
``Then maybe their kids and their kids' kids will be different.''

Wizards 2, Fusion 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Digital Takawira scored in the
first half Chris Snitko posted his first career shutout as the
Kansas City Wizards defeated the Miami Fusion 2-0 Sunday.
	   The win put the Wizards (11-14) in a tie for third place with
the Colorado Rapids in the Western Conference.
	   Takawira scored the game winning goal in the 36th minute. He got
an assist from defender Scott Vermillion, who also scored his
first-ever MLS goal with only five minutes left in the game.
	   Preki also had two assists, giving him 10 for the season and
moving him into the league's top 15 point producers.
	   Wizards coach Ron Newman removed starting defender Matt McKeon
and goalkeeper Mike Ammann, two of Kansas City's top producers,
from starting lineup, giving Snitko a chance to play.
	   The strategy paid off, as Snitko earned his first career shutout
in just his second game of the season and the sixth of his MLS
career. He also earned an assist on Vermillion's 85th-minute goal.
	   Kansas City and Colorado are tied in the division at 29 points,
with Dallas at 28 points. Kansas City holds a tiebreaker advantage
over both teams in the race for the final two playoff spots.
	   Miami (12-13) remained five points ahead of Tampa Bay for the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

Kipketer loses as Britain tops the gold medals table
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The European Championship ended with a
British triumph and a disheartening loss for Wilson Kipketer,
probably the biggest name of the six-day event.
	   Kipketer, still unfit after a bout of malaria delayed his
training schedule, finished last in the 800-meter final and failed
to bring his new country Denmark the only gold medal it could have
expected.
	   Britain, spearheaded by its sprinters who swept all men's
events, finished with a championship-high nine gold medals,
equaling its record of eight years ago. Britain ended with 16
medals overall.
	   It was a remarkable achievement for the nation that failed to
win a single gold at the 1996 Olympics and last year's World
Championship.
	   Germany, boosted by a three-gold performance on the final day
Sunday and some unexpected victories, brought its total to 23, tops
in the championship. Germany had eight golds, two more than Russia,
which had the second highest total of 22.
	   One of Germany's unexpected triumphs came in the 800, when Nils
Schumann, the 20-year-old European junior champion, broke through
to stun Kipketer.
	   Kipketer, a Kenyan-born runner who holds the world record and
the world title, went undefeated in 27 races over two years.
	   But he suffered a bout of malaria in February and did not start
training until late May. He won his comeback race in Monaco, but
then lost in Zurich less than a week before these Europeans opened.
	   Kipketer led the pack until the final bend. After some jostling
for position, Schumann attacked, going past Kipketer to win in
1:44.89.
	   It wasn't entirely clean, but it wasn't enough for the judges to
overturn the result.
	   Schumann said he had been bumped slightly from the outside by
another runner and leaned slightly onto Kipketer's arm.
	   ``It wasn't on purpose and it was unfortunate, but it wasn't
that bad,'' Schumann said.
	   Kipketer seemed to lose his stride slightly and gave up trying
to catch the German. He slowed down and ended eighth and last.
	   ``He has not been so strong in the finish this season and even
in the heats he did not look strong,'' Schumann said. ``At his
best, Wilson would have continued running and he would have
probably won.''
	   Kipketer said he obviously came to the championship short on
preparation, but insisted the bump from Schumann cost him the gold.
	   ``Someone pushed me from behind and I stopped running because
the race was stolen from me,'' said Kipketer, who almost a year to
the day (Aug. 24, 1997) smashed Sebastian Coe's record, lowering it
to 1:41.11.
	   ``I didn't have good preparation but there wouldn't have been a
problem on the way home if somebody didn't touch me,'' Kipketer
said.
	   Other winners on the final day included triple jumper Jonathan
Edwards of Britain, the world record holder, who soared 17.99
meters for the second longest jump of the year, just behind his
18.01.
	   Another Briton, Steve Backley, also smashed the championship
record with a 89.72-meter throw in the javelin, his third straight
European gold.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland clinched her second gold medal when
she won the 5,000 to add to her 10,000 gold.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, a sprinter with a drug-tainted past, led
Germany to the women's 4x400 title to add to her 400-meter
individual gold.
	   The only major record in the championship came in the women's
100 on Wednesday when Christine Arron of France, who also finished
with two golds, set a European mark of 10.73 seconds to establish
herself as the third-fastest woman in history.
	   There were some notable personal achievements.
	   Heike Drechsler of Germany won her fourth straight long jump
title, only the third athlete to do so.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain, the world record-holder (12.91),
clinched his third straight in the 110-meter hurdles and set a
championship record of 13.02.
	   The next Europeans are in 2002 in Munich, Germany.
	   The World Championships are next year in Seville, Spain,
followed by the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A small air force plane carrying supplies to a
remote community in Peru's Amazon jungle made an emergency landing
shortly after taking on Sunday, injuring the five people on board.
	   The single-motor plane landed amid houses on the outside the
jungle capital of Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) northeast
of Lima, minutes after taking off from Iquitos' airport, an air
force communique said.
	   Two crew members and a mother and father with their child
sustained light injuries in the forced landing. There were no
reports of injuries on the ground.
	   The plane was carrying blankets, food and ammunition to the
village of Angamos and its army post near the Brazilian border.
	   The air force is investigating the cause of accident, which is
still not known, the communique said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An Israeli implicated in an attempt to
ship three tons of cocaine to Russia in 1993 was arrested just
outside Bogota with a false Belgian passport, authorities said
Sunday.
	   Avi Salach was captured Saturday night after a five-year manhunt
by Colombian and Israeli police and Interpol, the international

	   Another Israeli, Elias Cohen, was arrested when the cocaine was

a vehicle carrying the seven family members.
	   Police said he was driving the bus to Iguacu Falls on the border

reportedly used false passports in a bid to travel to Miami.
	   A pregnant woman and three minors were among the 13 people
deported, human rights official Italo Antinori said. He said the
deportees might face reprisals when they return to Cuba.
	   The government acknowledged the Cubans were deported, but would
not say why.
	   Press reports said the Cubans used false passports when they
entered Panama. They were reportedly held at Panama City's
international airport, then sent back to Havana on Thursday.
	   Antinori, whose post has no enforcement power, recommended that
both governments allow the Cubans to return to Panama.

Wallabies hit hard by South African loss

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's rugby team has suffered a
major setback in its bid to sweep a three-test series against the
All Blacks for the first time since 1929.
	   Several players were injured when the Wallabies lost 29-15 to
South Africa at Ellis Park on Saturday as the Springboks claimed
the tri-nations series.
	   Australia will return home Tuesday for Saturday's match against
New Zealand in Sydney with as many as six players in doubt for the
third Bledisloe Cup match.
	   Centers Daniel Herbert and Tim Horan, winger Ben Tune, fly-half
Stephen Larkham, flanker Matt Cockbain and prop Andrew Blades are
all in doubt.
	   The injuries add to the usual terrors of jet lag and a
determined All Blacks team, which will be trying to avoid a
fifth-straight test loss.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett, whose team proved itself the
best in the world with the unbeaten tri-nations run, said Australia
would find it hard to overcome the obstacles.
	   ``Our Super 12 players know how difficult it is to have to
travel across the time zones,'' Mallett said after Saturday's win.
``Australia are going to be going home very disappointed, and the
All Blacks are desperate to stop their losing sequence. I think
it's going to be a very hard test for Australia.''
	   The players face a 17-hour return trip from South Africa while
the All Blacks have rested at home for the past week after the end
of their disastrous tri-nations campaign.
	   Australian team doctor John Best described Saturday's game as
one of the most ferocious he has seen.
	   ``The defense was certainly of a very violent nature and I know
both sides were suffering from several soft tissue injuries such as
ours,'' Best said. ``We've had a similar rate of injuries before
but not so many along those lines.''
	   Herbert was forced from the field in the opening minutes with a
hamstring strain. Herbert, Horan (knee) and Blades (Achilles
tendon) are considered the least likely to recover in time to play
the All Blacks.
	   While Australian coach Rod Macqueen admitted, ``luckily we have
already won the Bledisloe Cup,'' he was hoping the team could fire
up again on Saturday.
	   ``This side is very disappointed at the moment about losing to
South Africa,'' Macqueen said. ``But it is a team with a lot of
character.''
	   Australia's rugby press agreed that the Springboks deserved the
title of the best in the world after beating Australia and New
Zealand home and away to complete 14 test victories in succession.
The Sydney Morning Herald's headline hailed ``South Africa the
Great,'' and said the Springboks choked Australia with a defensive
stranglehold.
	   Former Australian winger David Campese said the strong defense
forced Australia into panic.
	   ``It looked like (Australia) thought `well we'll do a few
things, there'll be a few gaps and a few tries' but it didn't
happen,'' Campese said. ``Again the South African defense was
unbelievable, they just knocked them down every time.''

Rwanda, Uganda determined to safeguard sphere of interest

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Threats by Rwanda and Uganda to intervene
openly in the Congo rebellion are the clearest indication yet of
the two neighboring countries' determination to protect their own
long-term interests.
	   The two countries have so far apparently only provided
logistical and technical support for Congolese rebels fighting to
oust Kabila.
	   But when troops from Zimbabwe and Angola came to Kabila's aid,
it may have pushed impoverished Rwanda and Uganda toward a risky
adventure against wealthier rivals. Both now warn they will step
into the growing regional conflict if their interests are
threatened.
	   Rwanda's 35,000-strong army, already overstretched fighting Hutu
rebels at home, is hardly in a position to match the larger, better
trained and equipped Angolans. Uganda, too, is busy fighting rebels
on at least two fronts.
	   If drawn into the war, the two nations may only be able to focus
their troops in eastern Congo _ along their borders.
	   The area was used as a staging ground for attacks by Hutu
soldiers after Rwanda's Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and
ousted the extremist Hutu government, which had slaughtered more
than half a million minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   In 1996, the Rwandan Tutsi government decided to back Kabila's
rebels, attack the Hutu fighters across the border, force the
return of civilian Hutu refugees and put a cooperative Congolese
leader in power.
	   Uganda helped out, and Kabila was installed in power after the
rebels ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   At first, Kabila's soldiers cooperated with Ugandan and Rwandan
troops in flushing out rebels.
	   But cooperation stalled as Kabila moved away from his allies,
and the border region once again became dangerously unstable.
	   In July, Kabila ordered remaining Rwandan troops and military
instructors out of the country. The revolt by Congolese troops
against Kabila began Aug. 2.
	   Although Rwanda denies any involvement there are increasing
signs of its role in the crisis.
	   The Rwandan government has provided at least two Boeing 727s to
help deploy rebel troops, witnesses and aviation sources said.
	   Rwandan intelligence officers had directed flights transporting
troops and equipment from Goma to Kitona air base near the Atlantic
Ocean. Kitona fell to Kabila's Angolan allies on Sunday.
	   ``We are cooperating ... but Rwandans are not dictating to us,''
rebel chief commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said last week.
	   Ugandans, too, deny involvement. But residents in Bunia, 225
miles (350 kms) north of Goma, reported seeing Ugandan tanks and
troops cross into Congo.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The mystery surrounding the
pharmaceutical plant attacked by the United States remains, perhaps
hidden with the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of
antibiotics strewn among the rubble of red brick, splintered wood
and white plaster.
	   The United States says the plant was making precursors for
chemical weapons. Sudan says no such work occurred.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest some of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis, it planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval, it
was privately owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum.
	   Four main buildings were on the site: three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
The factories were destroyed, and fires still smoldered on Sunday,
emitting a stench of burning plastic.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered a line
of 87 products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, according to Umbadi and
Khartoum pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxycilin, which can be
used to treat malaria, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi
said.
	   All those products, packaged in El Shifa's blue and white
cartons, are available at Khartoum pharmacies. So are other El
Shifa antibiotics and drugs to treat ulcers and tuberculosis.
	   ``The spectrum of drugs they produce is very wide. No other
factory can produce all of it. There will be a loss,'' said Mona
Hamid, a doctor at Khartoum's Radiation and Isotope Center.
	   Among its products was Shifazole, an antibiotic to treat
parasites in animals. In January, the factory won a dlrs 199,000
contract to ship 100,000 cartons to Iraq under a U.N. exemption to
sanctions imposed in 1990, U.N. documents show. White cartons of
the antibiotic were scattered in the rubble.
	   The shipment was to be sent to Iraq by October, said Alamaddin
Al Shibli, the factory's export manager. The company began
exporting medicine this year to nearby Yemen and was scheduled to
send a shipment of veterinary medicine to Chad by month's end, he
said.
	   On Sunday, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was asked on
CNN why no evidence of anything but commercial pharmaceuticals is
evident in the wreckage of the plant.
	   To protect intelligence methods and sources, Berger refused to
describe ``physical evidence'' the government has of a dual role
but said, ``I have no question, the intelligence community has no
question, that that factory was used to manufacture a chemical used
in making nerve gas.''
	   The plant was owned by Salah Idris, a Sudanese businessmen who
has homes in London, Saudi Arabia and Khartoum, according to his
lawyer, Ghazi Suleiman. He denies Idris ever met Osama bin Laden,
the exiled Saudi millionaire the United States says is connected to
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, said Suleiman, who
himself is one of Sudan's most prominent opposition figures.
	   ``He didn't believe it at first, and he thought the news was
wrong. He was really taken by surprise,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris, described as charming and apolitical, purchased the plant
in March 1998, Suleiman said.
	   There are no signs of secrecy at the plant. Two prominent signs
along the road point to the factory, and foreigners have been
allowed to visit the site at all hours. Plant employees deny any
components of chemical weapons were made.
	   ``(Take) any chemical (and) you can produce poison out of it,
but you need special utilities and specialized personnel and, (on)
top of all, lots of secrecy,'' Shibli said. ``This factory was open
to everyone.''
	   Doctors differ on the impact of the plant's destruction.
	   Most agreed the products could be purchased from other plants in
Khartoum or abroad. But Honowa Hamad, a Khartoum pharmacist, said
prices of imported medicine could be three times higher or more.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel forces pushing to topple President
Laurent Kabila suffered their first major military setback when
Kabila's Angolan allies on Sunday captured a key rebel stronghold
in western Congo.
	   The rebels acknowledged the loss, but countered by saying they
would continue their drive toward the capital, Kinshasa, and had
also taken control of the important eastern city of Kisangani.
	   The strategic Angolan victory was a boost for Kabila, but it
also threatens to transform Congo into a proxy battlefield for a
regionwide war of shifting alliances.
	   Using tanks and backed by air support, Angolan forces took the a
rebel-controlled airbase at Kitona, near the Atlantic coastline.
The move effectively cut off the rebels from their rear supply
base.
	   ``The Angolans are at the base and have captured a large cache
of weapons and ammunition,'' a ministry-level official said on
condition of anonymity. He added that Angola had landed a number of
warplanes at Kinshasa's international airport.
	   Congo's Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed the
deployment of Angolan troops.
	   Quoting an unidentified Angolan military source, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported Sunday that Kabila's troops, aided by
Angolan soldiers, had moved on from Kitona to capture the nearby
towns of Muanda and Banana and then to Boma, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) to the east.
	   The report said the soldiers captured Matadi, Congo's only
ocean-going port on the Congo River and an important strategic
target, on Sunday.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   If true, however, it would mean that most of the major rebel
victories in the area southwest of Kinshasa had been reversed.
	   The military official told Lusa that Angola has a 2,000-strong
force in Congo's Lower Congo province.
	   Government officials declined to make detailed comment, but
Health Minister Jean-Baptiste Sondgi said that: ``There's fighting
in the area, I can't give exact details. There will be an important
announcement tomorrow.''
	   The rebels are caught between two foreign forces fighting on
behalf of Kabila. The Angolans to the southwest and Zimbabwean
soldiers deployed last week now shoring up Kinshasa's southern
defenses.
	   Rwanda and Uganda _ in support of the rebels _ have repeatedly
warned Zimbabwe and Angola not to get involved, threatening direct
retaliatory intervention if they don't withdraw.
	   Zimbabwe, having extended more than dlrs 200 million in military
credits to Congo, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
Angola's involvement may be partially driven by a concern that
Congo's rebels could link up with Angola's UNITA insurgent
movement.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, remains holed up at his residence in the
southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's former rebel
stronghold, Information Minister Mumengi said.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who fled to the
rebel side, said the fall of Kitona was actually a ``tactical
withdrawal.''
	   Kitona was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   But Karaha said the news was not all bad for the rebels,
claiming rebel fighters had captured Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city. That claim could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa.
	   In South African, meanwhile, President Nelson Mandela continued
efforts to salvage peace talks, despite the absence of Kabila and
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.
	   Mandela told reporters that an agreement was adopted unanimously
Sunday by 12 members of the Southern African Development Community,
calling for an immediate cease-fire and recognizing Kabila's right
to govern.
	   It seemed unlikely, though, that the call to lay down arms would
be heeded.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stock prices fall in early trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Monday,
boosted after Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his
government. Japanese stock prices fell sharply on the news.
	   The dollar bought 145.05 yen in early trading, up 2.11 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 144.91 yen
late Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 309.94 points, or 2.03 percent, to 14,988.86
points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the average
fell 93.21 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Share prices moved sharply lower as investors turned bearish on
worries about the political situation in Russia and the yen's
retreat against the dollar, traders said.
	   In the surprise announcement, Yeltsin reappointed former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was fired five months ago, as
acting prime minister in Russia, which remains in one of its worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   The dollar, often regarded a safe haven currency in times of
international unrest, benefited from the uncertainty.
	   The yen, meanwhile, remained vulnerable to selling pressure amid
concerns about the health of Japan's economy. On Friday, the
medium-sized trading company Okura and Co. filed for bankruptcy
with debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion), becoming
Japan's third-largest corporate failure this year.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 16.08 points, or 1.37
percent, to 1,160.43. The TOPIX closed down 5.16 points, or 0.44
percent, on Friday.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.145 percent from
Friday's finish of 1.180 percent, driving its price up to 112.12
yen from 111.87 yen.

<TEXT>
	   SHKOZE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A handful of rice. A tomato. A crust
of bread. Asking Kosovo's refugees what they've had to eat on any
particular day is one way to measure their tragedy.
	   Visiting ``homes'' is another.
	   The lucky ones are crowded dozens to a house in the shrinking
areas still controlled by the Kosovo Liberation Army, huddling on
blankets spread over dirty wooden floors. The less fortunate sleep
in open fields near houses.
	   The most hopeless cases _ an estimated 50,000 _ are scattered in
the forests and mountains. They fled there in past weeks to escape
a Serbian crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians that left dozens
of towns and villages in ruins.
	   And summer will soon end. With fields left unharvested and
livestock scattered or dead, human rights workers are warning of an
even bigger tragedy once the harsh Balkan winter arrives.
	   ``What can we do if people stay in the hills and do not return
to their homes before winter? Not very much,'' humanitarian agency
worker Fernando del Mundo said. ``We are afraid that people are
just going to die.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province of
the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where ethnic Albanians make up more
than 90 percent of the population.
	   Kosovo's refugee tragedy seems at first glance like a replay of
the Bosnian crisis. But while less people have been made homeless
in Kosovo, the chances of disaster are greater.
	   With Bosnian front lines relatively stable for much of that war,
hundreds of thousands of refugees were able to settle in friendly
territory relatively quickly after fleeing. That eased the task of
feeding and sheltering them.
	   But fighting between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels and an
alliance of Serbian police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army has
produced no such status quo.
	   Most weeks, several villages go up in smoke in the hunt for
separatists, swelling the pool of the homeless. Often, aid convoys
arrive to find that the refugees have fled somewhere else because
of new fighting.
	   Local and international medical workers say children with
dysentery have died because their parents feared passing Serb
police checkpoints for treatment.
	   Serbian authorities assert nothing will happen to non-combatants
wanting to return home. The refugees say otherwise.
	   Agram Kryezin fled his village in the central Drenica area a
month ago, leaving fields of wheat and corn, three cows, several
goats and some chickens. The lost harvest has left him and his
family of 10 with no winter provisions.
	   ``But we cannot go back,'' he says, speaking near the village of
Shkoze, about 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Pristina. ``The police
are in our house. They burn our fields.''
	   Kryezin, 24, says that of the five neighbors who went back to
Bubavec village to check on their property, three were killed and
the two others were missing.
	   Soeren Jessen Petersen, a senior UNHCR official, warned recently
that unless people were allowed to return home ``we would have
many, many people dying in the winter.''
	   But even some of those allowed to go back cannot live normally.
	   Del Mundo, who works for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, says ethnic Albanian farmers told a recent UNHCR mission
to Ade village, west of Kosovo's capital Pristina, that Serb police
prevented them from taking in the harvest.
	   In the Drenica region, the situation is already dire.
	   Each day, Merita Toci shares a kilo (a little more than two
pounds) of rice with 10 other people.
	   She shushes a visitor who asks if she's hungry, pointing at the
wide-eyed waifs around her sharing the thin-walled wooden school
house serving as their shelter. ``I can't say `yes' in front of
them now, can I?''
	   But 2-year-old Jedmine Hoti is not fooled. ``I'm hungry,'' she
wails. Her grandmother says the child subsists on bread crusts. Her
own meal of the day was a tomato.
	   Only a few miles (kilometers) away, corn nods on the stalk and a
summer wind rustles fields of wheat. Cows wander the roads in
villages where Serb police are the only residents and graffiti
proclaims: ``I'm not only perfect, I'm also Serb.''
	   ``You have the irony of a rich, fertile country and some people
starving because they cannot harvest,'' said del Mundo.

 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to CLARIFY that ball hit Corretja below the

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Alex Corretja survived a knockdown return by
Andre Agassi and then saved four break points in a crucial third
game of the final set for a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory Sunday in the
title match of the RCA Championships.
	   It was the first championship in the United States for Corretja,
No. 11 in the latest ATP rankings and seeded sixth in the
tournament, and was worth dlrs 122,500 to the 24-year-old Spaniard.
	   The victory cooled the hot summer streak of Agassi, the
winningest player on the ATP Tour this year, who is 50-12 with the
loss. He had won 19 of his previous 21 matches since falling to
Germany's Tommy Haas at Wimbledon.
	   Agassi, a four-time champion this year, had defeated Corretja
the previous four times they played. He appeared to be on his way
to another triumph when he knocked Corretja down with a hard smash
in the sixth game of the second set.
	   ``I didn't have much choice,'' said Agassi, who lined a forehand
shot below the right shoulder of Corretja that dropped him to the
court.
	   Agassi immediately jumped over the net to check on his opponent,
who rose up after a moment and resumed his match.
	   ``It's always a scary moment. He was close to the net and just
happened to be where I hit the ball,'' Agassi said.
	   ``When I got up, I didn't know where I was. I didn't know if I
was in Indianapolis or Barcelona (his hometown) or wherever,'' said
Corretja, who will break into the Top 10 in the next ATP Tour
rankings with the victory.
	   Agassi, who was seeded fifth in the tournament, was about to
even the set at 3-3 when the knockdown took place. He seemed to
lose his concentration and was broken when he double-faulted on two
of the last three points.
	   Corretja then held at love and claimed the set when Agassi
double-faulted once and won only one point on his serve.
	   ``I got a little tentative with my shots and got a little
conservative,'' said Agassi, who breezed though the first set in
only 34 minutes as he broke Corretja in his first two service games
while winning nine of the first 12 points on the Spaniard's serve.
	   The longest game of the match was the third in the third set,
when Corretja saved four break points before holding to go up 2-1
after six deuces.
	   The players held serve through the first six games of the final
set and Corretja took a 4-3 edge when he saved a break point, broke
Agassi while losing only one point and lost just one point in the
final game of the match.

Kobayashi wins Rainbow LPGA Classic in playoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPLE GROVE, Minn. (AP) _ Hiromi Kobayashi sank a 3-foot
(one-meter) birdie putt on the first playoff hole Sunday to defeat
Tracy Hanson in the LPGA Rainbow Classic.
	   After the two finished the final round tied at 10-under,
Kobayashi and Hanson replayed No. 18 at Rush Creek Golf Course.
Hanson lost a chance for her first career win when her third shot
flew over the green and went into the water.
	   Kobayashi, whose last win came in 1993 in Minnesota, took home a
first-place check for dlrs 90,000.
	   Kobayashi nearly didn't make the playoff, hitting her second
shot on the final hole of regulation into the bunker in front of
the green. She recovered nicely by blasting within 5 feet (1.5
meters) of the hole and making the par putt.
	   Kobayashi joined Liselott Neumann as the only players to win
twice in Minnesota. In 1993, Kobayashi defeated Cindy Rarick in a
one-hole playoff to win the Minnesota Classic at Ediburgh USA Golf
Course in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.
	   Second-round leader Michelle Estill had a chance to join the
playoff, but missed a 10-foot (3-meters) birdie putt on No. 18.
Estill shot a 71 Sunday to finish tied with Meg Mallon at 9-under
par.
	   Mallon, bidding for her 10th career win and second in three
weeks, led briefly on the back nine before a bogey on No. 16
dropped her back. She fired a final round 67.
	   Lisa Walters, Wendy Doolan and Leta Lindley all finished at
8-under par.
	   Completing the second round early Sunday morning after heavy
rain cut short play on Saturday, Estill moved to 10-under par after
four holes, but suffered three bogeys on the back nine to drop into
the tie with Ward.
	   Many of the top players on the LPGA tour skipped the dlrs
600,000 tournament.
	   Se Ri Pak, who has won two majors and four events this season,
withdrew earlier this month. Leading money winner Annika Sorenstam
played in the Compaq Open in Sweden.

Corporate America still chicken about investing in Russia
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When it comes to chicken, Russia and the United
States have a yin-yang relationship.
	   Americans like white meat. Russians like dark meat. And poultry
companies like Tyson Foods have made millions taking advantage of
that difference.
	   ``The Russian market is a complement to the American market,''
says Charles Clark, managing director of Tyson's office in Moscow.
``This is a very important country for us.''
	   Russia is a very important country for a growing number of
American companies _ several hundred of them, in fact _ that have
set up shop here in the seven years since the Soviet collapse.
	   But Russia is also a tough place to do business. Despite
Russia's rich stores of natural resources and nearly 150 million
potential consumers, many American firms, including Tyson, remain
reluctant to invest in production facilities.
	   U.S. business is hoping President Bill Clinton will use his
Sept. 1-3 summit with Boris Yeltsin to push Russia to improve the
climate for American companies doing business here.
	   Whatever the outcome, the summit alone is unlikely to inspire a
new burst of confidence in what foreign business executives see as
a volatile and sometimes hostile environment.
	   The U.S.-Russia Business Council estimates American corporations
spent dlrs 2 billion in Russia last year in direct investment.
While that's hardly chicken feed, it's a small fraction of the dlrs
40 billion that U.S. companies invested in China the same year.
	   ``It's a trickle compared to what it ought to be,'' says Z.
Blake Marshall, the council's executive vice president.
	   A major barrier for Tyson and many companies is psychological.
	   ``It's our internal comfort level,'' Clark says.
	   The skittishness has been especially evident in recent months as
financial investors _ whose bullishness on Russia made its stock
market the world's best performer last year _ have bailed out.
	   The International Monetary Fund organized a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout in July, but it was not enough to turn the tide and
Yeltsin's government had to devalue the ruble last week to avoid
default.
	   Clark doesn't think the ruble's fall will hurt Tyson's sales of
imported chicken much. Even though consumer prices will rise,
chicken legs will remain a bargain compared with other types of
meat. And the company stopped selling to distributors on credit a
while ago, so it does not expect major losses.
	   Nonetheless, Tyson remains cautious. Although Clark says the
financial projections look promising, Tyson executives don't feel
confident enough about Russia's economic and political future to
buy factories and start producing here. And that means Russia
misses out on the jobs those factories could generate.
	   Yeltsin's dismissal of his prime minister and cabinet Sunday
only underlined the fact that Russia's politics remain unstable at
best.
	   Bruce Bean, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Russia, says creating jobs is the key to reviving the Russian
economy on a long-term basis and promoting stability.
	   ``Political stability can't be legislated,'' he says.
	   A few U.S. companies have pushed ahead. Coca-Cola and Pepsi
operate bottling plants in Russia. General Motors is assembling
Chevy Blazers in Tatarstan, and Ford is setting up an assembly
plant outside St. Petersburg.
	   But they remain the exception.
	   During the summit, Clinton is expected to give Yeltsin a list of
suggested reforms needed to lure more American companies _ and
create more jobs.
	   Those include:
	   _Land reform. There are still tight restrictions on ownership of
property. Long-term leases are possible, but it is virtually
impossible for a foreign company to hold title to land.
	   _Tax reform. Russia's tax and customs rules are frequently
unclear and contradictory, making it next to impossible for foreign
companies to be in full compliance. A new tax code has been in the
works for a long time, but it has had trouble gaining parliament's
approval.
	   _Joint production. One of Russia's most promising areas is oil,
but parliament has not completed legislation to allow joint
U.S.-Russia production at new fields. Analysts say such projects
would bring billions of dollars worth of jobs, but lawmakers
complain the West is robbing Russia's natural wealth.
	   Perhaps foreigners' biggest concern is the Russian government's
solvency. Clinton is expected to hammer on the U.S. position that
austerity measures, especially tight spending and improved tax
collection, are the most powerful levers for righting the economy.
	   Despite its economic crisis, Russia remains a populous country
with enormous resources in need of extensive development.
	   ``The potential for American business here is wonderful,'' says
Bean of the American Chamber of Commerce. ``But it's hard.''

Mystery disease devastating Japan's pearl industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo, Graphic &QL; 
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOBA, Japan (AP) _ Just over a century ago, an enterprising
villager in this little fishing town on Japan's Pacific coast
robbed Mother Nature of one of her most charming secrets _ how to
grow a pearl.
	   Now, nature is striking back.
	   A mysterious disease the last several years has almost made
Japan's pearl oysters an endangered species. Unless a solution is
found soon, Japan's venerable pearl industry fears it may be on the
way out.
	   If the oysters die en masse again this year, ``most of us will
be forced to quit,'' said Toru Nishii, a pearl grower who has been
in the business for more than 40 years. ``I'm afraid the entire
industry will go belly up.''
	   The die-off is causing some shortages on the world market and
prices are rising, people in the American gem trade report.
	   Devin Macnow, executive director of the Cultured Pearl
Information Center, a trade group in New York, expects the shortage
to push prices up by 10 percent to 15 percent this year.
	   Elizabeth Parker, an appraiser for Curt Parker Jewelers in St.
Louis, offered a similar prediction, but considers that modest
given the situation. ``I was very pleased with the prices'' at a
fine jewelry trade show in June, she said. ``They were not as high
as I expected.''
	   Although the bigger and more expensive South Sea pearls from
Australia and Tahiti are gaining ground, Japan's Akoya cultured
pearls still dominate much of the world market _ including nearly
65 percent of sales in the United States.
	   But just keeping the Akoyas on the market has become
increasingly difficult.
	   In 1996, only 56.6 tons of pearls were harvested in Japan, down
22 percent from the amount harvested in 1993, the year before the
first widespread oyster deaths were reported. Those deaths were
caused by a ``red tide,'' a deadly plankton called heterocapsa.
	   What is killing the oysters now is unknown, however, but it is
undeniably deadly.
	   The mortality rate surged to more than 50 percent last year,
much higher than the average of 20 percent to 35 percent, according
to Fishery Agency statistics. Of the deaths, about 92 million _ or
nearly 55 percent _ were first- and second-year pearl-bearing
oysters.
	   Some marine biologists suspect viruses, but their findings have
been met with skepticism.
	   ``We haven't been able to isolate any virus, at least at our lab
here,'' said Dr. Toshihiko Matsusato, a pathologist at the National
Research Institute of Aquaculture. ``It could be even something
totally unknown.''
	   A government-led team recently speculated the culprit might be a
shellfish parasite called perkinsus, which devastated oysters in
the Mississippi River delta nearly 50 years ago.
	   Since Kokichi Mikimoto, founder of Japan's top pearl company,
Mikimoto and Co., started the industry 105 years ago by learning
how to induce oysters to grow pearls, technological improvements
have made the process relatively easy and amazingly exact. Even a
tint of pink or extra glow can be added to harvested pearls.
	   But some pearl growers suspect artificial insemination and other
scientific tinkering may have inadvertently spawned oysters that
are more prone to disease.
	   ``Decades ago, growing pearls was a lot of work, but oysters
seemed healthier and happier'' said grower Nishii.
	   ``Today, the environment is terrible,'' he said. ``The ocean is
polluted and oysters are artificially enlarged so they produce
larger pearls. Something's not quite right.''
	   Nishii said he has been forced to lay off seven of his eight
employees over the last couple of years because of the oyster
deaths. Many of his colleagues also cut down their purchases from
Ehime prefecture in southwestern Japan.
	   Officials believe oysters grown in Ehime, which supplies 80
percent of the pearl oysters used in Japan, may have been the
origin of the outbreak and are urging growers to stick with their
local stocks.
	   For the time being, shrinking demand at home because of Japan's
recession and tighter purse strings around Asia because of its
financial crisis have kept the lack of stock from driving up retail
prices too far.
	   Philip Schneider, chief executive of International Cultured
Pearls of the Orient Inc., a Chicago importer, said the weakness of
Japan's currency also is helping moderate price rises. In addition,
he said, the Chinese are producing more Akoya pearls.
	   Japanese jewelers increased their pearl stocks when they first
heard about the problem, but say they could soon start to run out.
	   ``So far we haven't been affected,'' said Hiroyuki Nakayama,
owner of Yamato Bros. and Co. pearl shop at Tokyo's posh shopping
district of Ginza.
	   ``But if the massive deaths continue this year, we'll have a
serious shortage of inventory.''

Smog leaves Parisian kids gasping for breath

	   PARIS (AP) _ Sunny weather means smog in Paris, where traffic
fumes not only leave small children gasping for breath, but also
are blamed for rising emergency room admissions for bronchial
ailments and asthma.
	   The issue has gained increased attention with the entrance of
the Green Party into the governing coalition, and from the release
of well publicized studies highlighting what many Parisians already
sensed: The air they breathe is filthy and dangerous.
	   ``We feel it more and more,'' said Helene Carlier, whose baby
has been hospitalized once for bronchitis and whose other two
children frequently suffer conjunctivitis.
	   On peak pollution days Carlier tries to keep her children
indoors. ``It's dangerous for them and for me, too,'' she said.
	   A survey in late April by the IFOP polling firm for Elle
magazine said air pollution is by far the biggest ecological
concern of urban women.
	   Watching traffic crawling down a boulevard next to the park
where her kids play, Carlier said: ``It's a question of becoming
aware of it. The French really didn't have that before.''
	   The fumes coming from all those cars, buses and trucks blanket
the City of Light with the same blight afflicting urban areas from
Singapore to St. Petersburg to San Francisco.
	   But Carlier, a lifelong Parisian, wouldn't dream of abandoning
her beloved city for a leafy suburb.
	   ``They need to limit the number of cars allowed into the city.
It's very irritating,'' she said.
	   An estimated 3 million cars enter Paris every day, and they are
the major cause of the yellow haze that veils the city during major
pollution alerts.
	   ``The car is king,'' said Dr. Manuel Maidenberg, a pediatrician
who belongs to Respirer (Breathe), a group of doctors studying the
effects of air pollution in Paris. ``The number of cars must be
reduced and urban transportation improved.''
	   A major study conducted by the Paris area Regional Health
Observatory found emergency admissions to hospitals for asthmatic
children jumps 30 percent during maximum pollution alerts.
	   The report, based on research in 1991-95 and released earlier
this year, said pollution is producing a ``damaged generation''
susceptible to chronic illnesses.
	   A study in 1996-97 by Maidenberg and about 100 other doctors
found that 42 percent of 250,000 visits to Paris pediatricians were
for respiratory problems.
	   Allergies, bronchitis, chronic coughing and conjunctivitis are
among ailments on the rise.
	   Serious pollution alerts tend to occur when the weather is at
its best, those stretches of glorious sunny days when there is
little or no wind.
	   The cloudless weather means there is no rain or moisture to wash
away or absorb auto emissions. Without wind, the toxic fumes
stagnate in thick smog over Paris and other French cities.
	   Last October, after a maximum smog alert, the national
government for the first time imposed temporary restrictions in
Paris that limited cars with odd and even license plate numbers to
driving on alternate days.
	   Although the measure helped reduce pollution, it caused huge
traffic jams and frustrated commuters who were crammed into subway
and commuter trains.
	   Officials are studying other measures, such as more public
transport, increasing the number of bicycle paths and further tax
reductions for cars with cleaner engines.
	   ``People are more and more aware of the problem,'' said
Maidenberg. ``But they have very few choices.''

<TEXT>
	   PACHUCA, Mexico (AP) _ It's what driver's education would be
like if your instructor was James Bond.
	   Tire-screeching, rubber-burning, stomach-churning turns at 50
mph (80 kph). Backing up at 25 mph (40 kph), spinning 180 degrees,
then speeding forward. Veering away from criminals shooting at your
car.
	   Crime is rising in Mexico and business is thriving for companies
that teach executives, their families and chauffeurs how to elude
kidnappers, robbers and other criminals.
	   In the last 1 1-2 years, about 1,000 students have taken the
course offered by O'Gara Services _ three or four times the number
in the first 3 1-2 years it was offered, said Jorge Navarro, the
training director.
	   No school can guarantee its students will not become victims.
Instead O'Gara and its competitors strive to teach clients to
become tough targets so criminals will pick on someone else.
	   ``There are many more easy victims than difficult ones,''
Navarro said. ``Once you decide to become a difficult victim, it's
impressive how your risks are reduced.''
	   The price of becoming a ``difficult victim'' is steep. O'Gara, a
division of Kroll-O'Gara Co. of Fairfield, Ohio, charges dlrs 900
(8,100 pesos) a person for a one-day course for executives and
their relatives and dlrs 1,400 (about 12,600 pesos) for a two-day
course for chauffeurs.
	   Other companies offer similar courses and prices tend to
fluctuate with the level of training. Security consultant Richard
P. Wright holds extensive training courses near Tucson, Arizona,
that includes actual crashes. ``We destroy two or three vehicles
per course,'' he said.
	   The three-day class for executives costs dlrs 3,500 (about
31,500 pesos); the six-day course for chauffeurs costs dlrs 5,500
(about 50,000 pesos).
	   ``Our philosophy is a little knowledge is dangerous,'' he said.
``People learn a little bit, but not enough, and they get
themselves into trouble.''
	   Wright said his clients are mostly Mexicans, but other companies
train a large number of foreigners based in Mexico. Most
participants in O'Gara's course work for multinational corporations
and about 40 percent of the executives are foreigners, Navarro
said.
	   O'Gara officials declined to identify its clients or their
companies, citing security concerns. They also asked that students
interviewed not be identified by name or employer.
	   The O'Gara course begins in a hotel in Pachuca, 60 miles (about
95 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City where students are taught
to identify dangerous situations and get out of them.
	   ``Simply, we put order to the common sense that everyone already
has,'' Navarro said.
	   That means learning to identify suspicious people or situations
when a driver might be vulnerable _ approaching a narrow bridge,
for example, when there is no room to maneuver.
	   Avoiding problems can be as simple as pretending to talk to
police by cellular phone or slowly approaching traffic lights
instead of coming to a complete stop.
	   When the threat is more imminent, it could be as extreme as
backing up suddenly, spinning around and speeding off.
	   That's where the main part of the training kicks in. It takes
place on a sun-beaten auto racetrack a few miles (kilometers) away.
Drivers learn what to do if precautions fail and they have just
moments to react to danger.
	   The first exercises include weaving through highway cones and
learning to stop suddenly and swerve to avoid obstacles.
	   By day's end, the exercises become more difficult. In one, the
drivers' vision is obscured by a companion holding a plastic plate.
The driver moves forward at about 30 mph (about 50 kph) while the
companion holds the steering wheel, keeping the car straight.
	   When instructors wave a flag, the plate is yanked away and the
driver suddenly sees road cones immediately ahead. In a split
second, the driver must decide whether to swerve right or left or
stop and back up. Meanwhile, O'Gara staffers pretending to be
assassins fire away with paint pellets.
	   On a recent afternoon, Roberto, a bodyguard-chauffeur working
for a large Mexican company, nervously awaited his first exercise.
Like some of the other 10 participants that day, he was driving a
rental car. His boss didn't want to damage a company car.
	   As he waited for the flag, he squeezed the steering wheel with
both hands and quickly turned it side to side.
	   ``Practice, practice,'' he muttered.
	   In the distance, the flag dropped and Roberto took off. His two
passengers swayed from side to side as he swerved around the cones.
He didn't knock any cones over, but an instructor found a minor
flaw: He was squeezing the steering wheel too tightly. Turns tend
to be smoother when the driver is relaxed.
	   He continued from one exercise to the next, his speed and
confidence growing with each lap. Soon it was a game.
	   ``Whoooaaa,'' he hollered, laughing. ``Let's go boys!''
	   His reaction wasn't unusual. Despite the serious purpose of the
training, the exercises often seem like amusement park rides.
	   ``Very important people turn into little children here,''
Navarro said.

	   MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota (AP) _ Hiromi Kobayashi sank a 3-foot
(one-meter) birdie putt on the first playoff hole Sunday to defeat
Tracy Hanson in the LPGA Rainbow Classic.
	   After the two finished the final round tied at 10-under,
Kobayashi and Hanson replayed No. 18 at Rush Creek Golf Course.
Hanson lost a chance for her first career win when her third shot
flew over the green and went into the water.
	   Kobayashi, whose last win came in 1993 in Minnesota, took home a
first-place check for dlrs 90,000.
	   Kobayashi nearly didn't make the playoff, hitting her second
shot on the final hole of regulation into the bunker in front of
the green. She recovered nicely by blasting within 5 feet (1.5
meters) of the hole and making the par putt.
	   Kobayashi joined Liselotte Neumann as the only players to win
twice in Minnesota. In 1993, Kobayashi defeated Cindy Rarick in a
one-hole playoff to win the Minnesota Classic at Edinburgh USA Golf
Course in Brooklyn Park.

Compromise ends Hyundai Motor's 36-day labor dispute

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union officials of
strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. reached a compromise Monday, ending
a 36-day labor dispute at the nation's largest automaker.
	   The compromise allowing ``a minimum level of layoffs'' came in
government-mediated negotiations carried out over the past week. A
breakthrough came when both sides agreed on terms of the layoffs in
overnight talks.
	   ``The past one month was truly agonizing. I hope this will be an
opportunity for both labor and management to live together
peacefully,'' union leader Kim Kwang-shik told a news conference.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho, who led the last-minute mediations,
praised the compromise, calling it ``a great victory achieved
through dialogue and concessions.''
	   Hyundai's 26,000-strong union walked off their jobs July 20 in
protest of the company's plan to lay off 1,538 workers. Hyundai had
shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   But the compromise raised questions about South Korea's ability
to ensure a flexible labor market, a key to wooing back much-needed
foreign investment. It was criticized by some as being too
pro-labor.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, blasted the government, accusing it of siding with the
union because of the political risks involved in using police force
to break up strikes.
	   ``The legally guaranteed layoffs have failed in the case of
Hyundai. This has set a bad precedent and will negatively affect
other businesses,'' said Kim Young-bae, a managing director of the
federation.
	   Some media also criticized the compromise as a surrender to the
union's pressure.
	   ``This kind of solution has the danger of inviting a second,
third similar dispute,'' the influential Chosun Ilbo newspaper said
in an editorial.
	   ``If a flexible labor market cannot be secured, as in this case,
foreign investment cannot be expected,'' it said.
	   The labor union demanded that the company cancel the 1,538
layoffs. Under Monday's compromise, the company was allowed to lay
off only 277 workers, with the remaining 1,261 put on 1 1/2 years
of unpaid leave.
	   The 277 workers to be laid off will be given enhanced severance
payments and chances to be rehired by Hyundai Motor or other
Hyundai subsidiaries, negotiators said in a joint statement.
	   The company also agreed to contribute 5 billion won (dlrs 3.8
million) to the workers' welfare fund.
	   The last sticking point was a demand by the union that the
company drop lawsuits against 64 union leaders responsible for the
strike. The company accepted the demand on the condition that the
union ``does its best to normalize plant operations.''
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, was
the first major business to shed redundant workers. Observers saw
Hyundai as a test of South Korea's will to keep its promise to
ensure a flexible labor market.
	   Government mediators intervened after talks between union and
management stalled. The government ruled the Hyundai strike illegal
but withheld the use of police force to end it because of its
negative impact.
	   Hyundai wanted to reduce its work force because of sharply
falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been operating at 40
percent of its annual capacity of 1.65 million units.
	   Hyundai said the strike cost it dlrs 690 million in lost
production. Its parts suppliers were believed to have suffered dlrs
566 million in lost production, it said.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers have
resisted layoffs with a spate of strikes this year. And some
commentators were predicting more to come.

Myanmar military says plan to convene parliament illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government warned the
opposition led by Aung San Suu Kyi that its plan to convene
parliament is illegal and will jeopardize possible talks with
military leaders, a government spokesman said Monday.
	   ``Such an action by any individual party would be in
contravention of Myanmar law, and seems designed to derail the
ongoing discussions between the government and the National League
for Democracy,'' said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
	   The comment came as Suu Kyi, her health problems mounting,
entered the 13th day of her roadside protest against government
restrictions on her right to travel freely.
	   The Nobel Peace laureate and three colleagues are staying in a
van on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon. They were
stopped there nearly two weeks ago by authorities. They were
attempting to travel to the city of Bassein to meet NLD members for
the fourth time in two months.
	   On Saturday, the authorities refused permission for Suu Kyi's
two doctors to examine her. In earlier examinations, the doctors
said she was suffering from low blood pressure, kidney problems,
dizziness and urinary tract problems.
	   Suu Kyi's party set Aug. 21 as the deadline for the military to
convene the parliament, which was elected in 1990. The NLD won 392
of the assembly's 485 seats.
	   Although it promised to hand over power to the winners before
the polls were held, the military refused to honor the result after
the NLD victory.
	   When the military ignored the NLD's latest deadline, the party
announced it would convene parliament on its own. Past attempts to
gather NLD lawmakers for party meetings were met with mass arrests
by the military.
	   The military held out an olive branch to the NLD earlier this
month when Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the junta's most powerful
generals, met face to face with Aung Shwe, the NLD chairman, for
talks.
	   Previous attempts at furthering discussions between the two
failed, however, when the general refused to include Suu Kyi in the
talks, something her party _ and the international community _ has
demanded.
	   ``The government hopes sincerely to continue meetings started
last week with the NLD,'' the spokesman said.
	   ``It is the government's view that those talks marked the
beginning of a period of conciliation, cooperation and mutual help
in building a better future for the people of Myanmar, and the
government would be disappointed if radical and provocative actions
by NLD leaders made further discussions impossible,'' he added.
	   The government did not mention if it was willing to include Suu
Kyi in the discussions.
	   Suu Kyi has offered to end her protest if the government
releases NLD members arrested since May this year. So far, the
government has not taken action nor commented on her offer.
	   As for her health, the NLD has said it would hold the government
responsible because it had denied her the right to medical
treatment.
	   It also said that should her health deteriorate further, she
will only accept treatment from her own doctors at her home in
Yangon.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The mystery surrounding the
pharmaceutical plant attacked by the United States remains, perhaps
hidden with the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of
antibiotics strewn among the rubble of red brick, splintered wood
and white plaster.
	   The United States says the plant was making precursors for
chemical weapons. Sudan says no such work occurred.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest some of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis, it planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval, it
was privately owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum.
	   Four main buildings were on the site: three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
The factories were destroyed, and fires still smoldered on Sunday,
emitting a stench of burning plastic.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered a line
of 87 products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, according to Umbadi and
Khartoum pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxicillin, which can be
used to treat malaria, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi
said.

Dollar soars, Tokyo stock prices drop in morning trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar soared against the yen Monday morning
after political turmoil in Russia prompted world investors to seek
a safe haven in the U.S. currency. Tokyo stocks plunged.
	   The dollar bought 145.06 yen in midday trading, up 2.12 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 144.91 yen
late Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average dropped below the psychologically-significant
15,000-point level, falling 408.69 points, or 2.67 percent, to
14,889.51 at the close of morning trading. On Friday, the average
fell 93.21 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Both Tokyo stocks and the yen tumbled after Russian President
Boris Yeltsin dismissed his government Sunday.
	   In the surprise announcement, Yeltsin reappointed former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was fired five months ago, to
pull Russia out of one of its worst economic crises since the
Soviet collapse.
	   The news boosted the dollar, often regarded a safe place to park
money in times of international unrest, against world currencies
like the yen and the German mark.
	   ``It's yet to be seen whether the market has already factored in
Russia's instability or the mark will be sold further on a view
that Chernomyrdin's appointment will add to the uncertainty,'' said
Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   The yen also suffered from concerns about the health of Japan's
economy. On Friday, the medium-sized trading company Okura and Co.
filed for bankruptcy with debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs
1.8 billion), becoming Japan's third-largest corporate failure this
year.
	   Political uncertainty also faces the government's plans to
stabilize the nation's shaky banking system. While Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi has promised more than 500 billion yen (dlrs 3.4
billion) to help ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. merge
with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., opponents have vowed to derail
the effort.
	   ``But investors are cautious about whether parliament will
smoothly pass bills designed to restructure the financial system,
including bills that would allow the use of public funds to support
LTCB,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division
at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The prospect of delays in the bank-clean up bills also weighed
on the stock market, where banks are the market's biggest
components.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 22.57 points, or 1.92
percent, to 1,153.94. The TOPIX closed down 5.16 points, or 0.44
percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.140 percent from Friday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price up to 112.16 yen from 111.87 yen.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The hospitality Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers have extended Osama bin Laden cooled Sunday, days after
American missiles hit an area in the eastern of the country where
he is accused of training an international army of Islamic
militants.
	   Taliban spokesman Mullah Abdullah, reached on satellite
telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Afghanistan, said
bin Laden would be allowed to travel only ``in Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan and he will be provided security by Taliban fighters.''
	   Abdullah described it as a security measure, but it amounted to
a restriction on the movements of bin Laden, whom Washington blames
for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The United States launched missiles Thursday at what officials
described as a bin Laden military training camp.
	   Foreigners in Afghanistan have been attacked since then, and
international aid workers are fleeing the country. Eighteen Red
Cross workers left Sunday, a day after the body of a U.N. military
observer killed in Kabul on Friday preceded them to Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital.
	   In an interview with the BBC Sunday, supreme Taliban leader
Mullah Omar expressed displeasure with reported statements from bin
Laden that called for Muslims to strike at the United States.
	   Omar was quoted as saying he was sending an envoy to bin Laden,
in an unknown location in Afghanistan, to make clear the Taliban
would speak for themselves about how to respond to U.S. action in
their country.
	   The statements Sunday clearly indicated unhappiness with bin
Laden. But after the U.S. missile strikes sparked large and violent
anti-American, pro-bin Laden protests across Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, it appeared unlikely Omar would completely disown the
man he has described as an honored guest.
	   Nonetheless, Taliban response to the strikes has been muted,
perhaps because they are undecided of their position on bin Laden.
Omar has said bin Laden would not be handed over, while Taliban
envoys at the United Nations have said they would be willing to
discuss such a solution if the United States could prove terrorism
charges against him.
	   The U.N. envoys are more exposed to international opinion. To
Westerners like U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, bin
Laden is a symbol of the Taliban's unwillingness to fight
terrorism. Albright told reporters recently that the Taliban could
show its desire to be part of the international community by not
harboring ``terrorist elements.''
	   That reputation as a harborer of terrorism is just one of the
issues bedeviling the Taliban's world image. There are reports they
are making money from heroin production, and they have a record of
denying basic rights to women and minorities.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The bodies of newborn twin boys have
been found dumped in a garbage bin near a shopping mall in the
resort city of Pattaya, local newspapers reported Monday.
	   The two boys, who appeared to be Caucasian, were found Sunday
morning, the Bangkok Post quoted police as saying. They both
appeared to have severe head injuries, the report said.
	   Pattaya is a popular beach resort 110 kilometers (68 miles)
south of Bangkok.
	   Police believe the boys died about two hours before being found,
the newspaper said. They were wrapped in bloody towels inside a
plastic bag, it said.

Personal computers top youngsters' wish list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ What Japanese youngsters want the most now is a
personal computer, according to a think-tank survey released
Monday.
	   In a survey by the Nikkei Research Institute of Industry and
Markets, 41 percent of the respondents said they wanted a personal
computer. A similar survey two years ago found the most wanted item
was a car, the institute said.
	   ``More and more young people are starting to use the Internet,''
said Kunihiko Nagao, a researcher who carried out the study.
	   The survey of 888 people, ages 12 through 29 living in
metropolitan Tokyo, conducted in June, also found that a mini disc
_ a Walkman-type digital disc player _ was also popular among
youngsters, followed by cars and motorcycles.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition lawmaker convicted
of sedition for criticizing the Malaysian judiciary appealed to
federal judges Monday for a reconsideration of his prison sentence.
	   If his appeal fails, Lim Guan Eng will be the first sitting
Malaysian Parliament member to be sent to prison.
	   Lim, 38, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party
and a Parliament member for 12 years, was convicted last year of
printing ``false news'' in a 1995 pamphlet entitled, ``The True
Story.'' He was sentenced to a year and a half in prison.
	   In his pamphlet, Lim criticized the government's decision not to
press statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a
former chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained, but not Abdul Rahim, a leading member of the
ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   A three-judge panel of the Federal Court of Appeal on Monday was
to decide whether to uphold Lim's sentence set by a lower appellate
court. In the morning, they denied Lim's request for the case to be
heard by a larger panel.
	   Lim's case has drawn the condemnation of Amnesty International
and local human rights activists, who say it highlights the
government's recent muffling of criticism amid a worsening economic
crisis.
	   Hundreds of Lim supporters surrounded the federal courthouse
Monday dressed in white T-shirts printed with the word ``Freedom''
and caps that read ``Justice.'' They stood silently, some with DAP
decals taped across their mouths.
	   Lim said he was prepared to go to prison.
	   ``I'm very hopeful that justice will prevail,'' he told The
Associated Press during a break in the hearing. ``Even if it
doesn't, I'm prepared to go down for justice and women's rights.
That's a cause worth fighting for, worth going down for.''
	   Lim's original sentence called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs 3,570)
fine. It was dismissed and replaced with a jail term by the Court
of Appeal in April, when Lim lost his first appeal.
	   Judge Gopal Sri Ram, in announcing that court's decision, said:
``It is time that the court sends a clear message that it cannot
tolerate any attack on the judiciary.''
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, is head of the DAP and the
opposition leader of Parliament. In a statement Saturday, he called
on the Federal Court to reconsider his son's application for a
bench of nine judges to hear the appeal.
	   That application was denied last month. Attempts for an even
smaller bench of five judges were denied Monday.
	   The elder Lim said the refusal of a hearing by a larger panel of
judges heightened ``grave concern'' that his son was ``a victim of
selective prosecution.''
	   ``On Aug. 24, it is not only Guan Eng who will be on trial, the
system of justice in Malaysia will also be on trial _ not only in
the eyes of Malaysians, but also in the eyes of the world.''

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with late games &QL;

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Brad Frank capped the longest
game in Little League World Series history with an RBI single in
the top of the 11th inning as Toms River, New Jersey, beat Jenison,
Michigan, 13-9 Sunday night.
	   The 3-hour, 11 minute-game topped in both time and innings the
2-hour, 51-minute, nine-inning marathon in 1971 between Tainan,
China, and Gary, Indiana.
	   Jenison's Derek Stempin hit two home runs, including a two-out,
two-strike solo shot to force extra innings.
	   In Sunday's other game, 12-year-old Sayaka Tsushima became the
first girl to play for the Far East team in the World Series, going
1-for-2 with a single, walk and two runs scored as Kashima, Japan,
defeated the defending champions from Guadalupe, Mexico, 6-1.
	   Jenison and Toms River went back and forth early, and Jenison
led 8-7 after the third.
	   Frank had an RBI single in the fifth to tie the game 8-8 and Joe
Franceschini's RBI hit gave Toms River the lead in the sixth. After
Stempin's homer tied it again, both teams went on a four-inning
drought.
	   Toms River finally took the lead for good in the 11th. Frank's
single up the middle drove in Chris Cardone with the go-ahead run
and two more scored when shortstop Sean Markle allowed Gabe
Gardner's grounder to go through his legs.
	   Casey Robrahn walked Casey Gaynor with the bases loaded to force
in the final run.
	   Billy Miller hit a two-run homer for Jenison, and Toms River's
Todd Frazier hit a 250-foot grand slam in the third.
	   While Toms River and Jenison were slugging it out, Sayaka was
beaming over her accomplishments.
	   ``I'm very happy,'' Sayaka said through an interpreter.
	   Sayaka has played baseball for about 2 1/2 years and is one of
the team's best athletes. She also plays golf and soccer.
	   ``She's the No. 1 fighter on the team,'' manager Atsushi Ohkawa
said also through an interpreter.
	   Starting pitcher Tetsuya Furukawa was the best player Sunday. He
gave up four hits, struck out seven and tripled, doubled and drove
in a run.
	   ``The whole game I was satisfied,'' Ohkawa said. ``The pitcher
pitched the whole game with patience.''
	   Kashima scored two runs in the second on a passed ball and two
wild pitches by Guadalupe's Daniel Lopez. A pair of throwing errors
on a sacrifice bunt in the fifth made it 3-0, before Furukawa's RBI
double.
	   Another passed ball and Tomoyuki Okawa's RBI single gave Kashima
a 6-0 lead.
	   ``Sometimes, when they're down, they can come back, but today
wasn't one of those days,'' manager Jose Valdez said.
	   Jose Oregel's sixth-inning home run provided the only run for
Guadalupe.
	   The Latin American champions stranded seven runners. They
threatened in the fourth and fifth, but Furukawa ended both innings
with strikeouts.
	   Guadalupe returns three players from the 1997 championship team,
and a coach, Jose Valadez, is now the manager. Only one team has
won consecutive titles on the field: Monterrey, Mexico _ a town
just a few miles from Guadalupe _ in 1957-58.
	   In 1992, after losing 15-4, Long Beach, California, was credited
with a 6-0 championship victory when the Philippines was stripped
of the title for using over-age and ineligible players. Long Beach
defeated Panama in the finals one year later to reclaim the crown.
	   The top two teams in both the U.S. pool and international pool
meet Thursday with a trip to the finals at stake. The championship
is Saturday.
	   ``The first win is very valuable,'' Ohkawa said. ``If we win in
the first game it makes it much easier to keep the pitchers in
rotation and keep the kids animated.''

Australia urges Russia to pursue economic reform

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Trade Minister Tim
Fischer on Monday urged the new Russian government to continue to
embrace economic reforms to promote stability.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin Sunday sacked his government and
named former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister,
a move analysts expect will weigh heavily on financial markets this
week.
	   ``We're obviously monitoring closely the events (in Russia),''
Fischer told reporters.
	   ``I hope the new government will stay a course of reform ... we
want to see as much stability as we can.
	   ``The key is to watch the linkage between Germany and German
banks and their support of Russia, and the modernization of the
Russian economy,'' he said.

Tainted liquor kills 33, blinds 3 in southern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Tainted liquor served at a village party
killed 33 people, blinded three and landed 127 others in hospital
in a southern Indian state, a domestic news agency reported Monday.
	   The dead included eight women in Paruveedhi village in the Tamil
Nadu state where potent locally brewed liquor bought from a village
shop was served to a large gathering Sunday night, Press Trust of
India quoted police as saying.
	   The drink was suspected to be arrack, a hugely popular local
brew, laced with methyl alcohol, PTI quoted senior police official
Shakeel Akhtar as saying.
	   Four people had been arrested for manufacturing and selling the
liquor. At least 30 policemen have been suspended in connection
with the tragedy, the news agency said, but did not give details of
the charges against them.
	   Liquor poisonings occur frequently in India. Unauthorized
manufacturers operate from homes and mix methyl alcohol with the
brew, which causes blindness and affects the nervous system.
	   Homemade liquor is cheaper than the cheapest brand sold at
authorized shops. Increasing alcohol deaths have also provoked a
violent movement for prohibition in several states in recent years.
	   Village women armed with brooms have publicly thrashed drunkard
husbands and picketed liquor shops, but two provinces which
officially banned liquor had to withdraw the move last year after
huge tax losses to the government.

Castro plays to another supportive audience in Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   BANI, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Playing to a supportive crowd,
Fidel Castro hailed a 19th-century Dominican general as a hero of
Cuba's independence struggle and said Cuba will do what it can to
return the favor.
	   Before more than 1,000 people in the south coast city of Bani,
including Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, Castro paid tribute
to Gen. Maximo Gomez, who fought for Cuba's independence from Spain
in the late 19th century.
	   Gomez, he declared in a more than two-hour speech Sunday, is an
example for small Caribbean countries still struggling with great
world powers _ a not-so-subtle reference to his own relations with
the United States.
	   ``Today, Cuba is enjoying the fruit of the long struggle''
launched by Gomez, a Bani native, Castro said. ``The roots are here
in Bani.''
	   To chants of ``Long Live Revolutionary Cuba!'' Castro laid a
wreath at a monument to Gomez and was presented a key to the
coffee-producing city, located 100 kilometers (65 miles) west of
Santo Domingo.
	   Castro noted that Cuba's 19th-century guerrilla war against
Spain was interrupted by the 1898 U.S. invasion of the island.
Spanish colonialism was replaced by U.S. domination, and full
independence wasn't won until his own revolutionary triumph in
1959, he said.
	   It was Castro's first public speech in a Dominican visit that
began Thursday and included a two-day summit with Caribbean
leaders. Long shunned by the region _ including the Dominican
Republic _ Castro and his communist system no longer are viewed as
threats in the Caribbean.
	   In recent years, and despite protests of his dismal human rights
record, Castro has been embraced by Caribbean leaders struggling
for a louder voice in global forums and resentful of what they call
U.S. neglect of the region.
	   ``Fidel has made Cuba a free country for poor people. The United
States has made a big mistake in imposing an embargo on Cuba, and
we're hoping it will be lifted,'' said retired chauffeur Juan Varia
Hijo, 70.
	   In what the Cuban leader himself called ``a beautiful gesture,''
Castro pledged dlrs 250,000 to help build a school in Bani. The
money had been given by Libya to the Cuban government in
recognition of its so-called defense of human rights.
	   Protests of Castro's visit have been few and far between. Cuban
exile organizations have published full-page advertisements in
Dominican newspapers condemning Castro's human rights record and
his system as totalitarian.
	   Amidst the Bani crowd, a lone Castro protester from Florida who
held up a poster of Gomez was jostled by other speech-goers before
being escorted away by police.
	   ``What about all the people he killed?'' protested Ruben Acosta,
70.
