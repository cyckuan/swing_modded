<HEADLINE> 20 Tehran Policemen to Be Tried for Dorm Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Judicial Organization of
the Iranian armed forces announced on Sunday that 20 policemen
would be put on open trial for the crackdown on students inside
Tehran University dormitory in July.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran military prosecutor has prepared an indictment
against four officers, seven non-commissioned officers and nine
ordinary policemen on charges of beating and injuring students
and damaging their property.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the organization said that 50 policemen
including officers and non-commissioned officers had been arrested
for being involved in the dormitory crackdown, but some have
been released later on bail.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred students staged a rally on July 8 outside
Tehran University dormitory to protest the newly-approved draft
Press Law and a ban on the popular daily Salam, which supported
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out after policemen forced into the students'
dormitory without permission from the Interior Ministry. It was
the worst violent clash since the 1979 Islamic revolution and
conservative plots were believed to be behind the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Supreme National Security Council announced in
August that three people, including a civilian opponent, a police
officer and a conscript of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps,
were shot by bullets in the incident. The conscript died in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces Judicial Organization said that the police's
illegal entry into the students' dormitory was ordered by a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
The policemen had attended the scene according to their legal
duty to disperse demonstrators and illegal gathering in front of
the university dormitory, it said, but the police officer issued
the order after the illegal demonstrations spread due to
officials' failure to adopt appropriate measures.
</P>
<P>
Under country's current law and regulations, the police's
entry into Tehran University dormitory without permit from any
judicial authority was illegal, the organization said. And
Interior Minister and the acting Commander-in-Chief of the police
Mousavi Lari had also ordered the police not to enter the
dormitory and not to use tear gas.
</P>
<P>
However, the police commander Brigadier General Nazari refused
to take heed of the order and some policemen entered the
students' rooms, broke windows, beat some students and arrested
some others.
</P>
<P>
It said that a number of civilians also entered the dormitory
and contributed to part of damage on students and to their injury,
while some part of the damages were caused by students in
retaliatory moves such as blocking roads and making fire to defuse
effect of canisters.
</P>
<P>
However, due to darkness, smoke caused by canisters and by
fire, plaintiffs failed to identify agents who had beaten up and
injured the students while most of the policemen present in the
area denied their role in injuring the students and damaging their
properties, it said.
</P>
<P>
The case is still open since no one has yet been identified to
be responsible for the shooting in the incident, it added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Rejection to British Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's top decision-making
body, the Revolution Command Council (RCC), said on Sunday that
Iraq would never deal with any U.N. resolution that does not
ensure a total lifting of the sanctions imposed on it for nine
years.
</P>
<P>
A RCC meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein reviewed the
visit made by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to Moscow where he
discussed with Russian officials the latest debate in the
U.N. Security Council on the British proposal on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reaffirmed Iraq's "declared firm stand rejective"
of the British proposal which recommends a conditional suspension
of the sanctions after Baghdad allows U.N. weapons inspectors to
return to the country and cooperate with them, said the official
Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed that it will never allow the return of
U.N. weapons inspectors who were pulled out from Iraq last
December by chief inspector Richard Butler prior to U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad accused that some U.N. weapons inspectors were spies
who were exploited by the U.S. and British administrations to
provoke aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have recently been pushing for the
adoption by the Security Council of the British proposal.

<HEADLINE> Albright Due in Riyadh on Iraq, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will arrive in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on
Monday for talks on the Iraq issue and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Albright, whose Middle East tour also includes Egypt, Syria,
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, will discuss with
senior Saudi officials efforts by U.N. Security Council to
approve a resolution outlining a new mechanism to deal with the
Iraq issue, diplomatic sources in Riyadh was quoted as saying on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been debating on a British-proposed
plan, which calls for the return of arms inspectors to Iraq in
exchange for a suspension of sanctions which have been in place
since Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Washington strongly advocates a resumption of the U.N. arms
inspection mission in Iraq, aborted after the U.S.-British
air-strikes against Iraqi targets late last year.
</P>
<P>
A body of mostly Western nations at the United Nations is set
to vote this week in the Security Council on a new arms inspection
regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq is demanding the sanctions lifted unconditionally,
insisting its banned weapons of mass destruction have already
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, the sources in Riyadh said
Albright and Saudi officials will also discuss means to revive
the peace process on the Syria-Israel and Lebanon-Israel tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top diplomat is said intended to carry out shuttle
diplomacy between Israel and Syria to get that phase of the Middle
East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the two tracks were halted because of the
hard-line policy of Israel's former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. The U.N. General Assembly urged Israel last Wednesday
to resume talks with Syria and Lebanon and respect commitments
reached in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace issue, the sources said
Albright will make sure a deadline set by the two sides for a
peace framework is met as the February deadline is quickly
approaching with hurdles still left to overcome.
</P>
<P>
She will try to help them reach a final status agreement, they
added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
again failed to reach an agreement on an overdue Israeli
withdrawal scheduled to take place two weeks ago from 5 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said that Albright would like to see
the two sides work out their difference over the planned Israeli
pullout and other issues on the table on their own.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Guinea Sign Two Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Guinea signed here on
Sunday two cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
One of the agreements was a general framework for economic and
technical cooperation and the other for cooperation between their
foreign ministries, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Guinean
counterpart Zainoul Sanoussy inked the accords after talks on
bilateral relations and African issues.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Moussa told reporters that the
deals represented a completion of the legal framework of the
Egyptian-Guinean relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between the two countries dated back to
their independence struggle era and the reconstruction of Africa,
terming it as historical.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, driven by the mutual interest of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his Guinean counterpart Lansana Conte
in boosting the bilateral ties, discussed ways to bolster economic
and trade cooperation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Sanoussy, for his part, said the agreements will give a boost
to cooperation between Guinea and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both Guinea and Egypt have abundant resources and free-market
foundations, Sanoussy said, adding that the favorable conditions
will help create opportunities for constructive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He called on Egyptian businessmen to hold trade exhibitions and
invest in his country. He further urged African countries to join
efforts in tackling the problems on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the African-European Union summit planned to take
place in Cairo next April, the Guinean official expressed hope
that the meeting will find solutions to the conflicts in Africa
and seek ways of helping promote the continent's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan's Economy Emerging From Stagnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ten months after King Abdullah
Bin Hussein took the throne, Jordan's economy is emerging from a
10-year stagnation, with a fairly amazing 2 percent economic
growth expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed that Jordan saw a 1.5 percent
economic growth rate in the first 10 months of this year, which
indicates that the kingdom can meet its 2 percent annual growth
target. Last year's economic growth was a negative 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official unemployment rate dropped to some 10 percent from 17
percent in 1998, although independent estimates still put the
figure at over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained at very low level and foreign currency
reserves rose to 1.92 billion dollars by end-August, enough to pay
for six months of imports, from 13.3 billion dollars in the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the positive economic performance to
efforts made by the king and his government to carry out economic
reforms, streamline bureaucratic apparatus, amend economic laws to
improve the investment atmosphere and the king's active diplomacy
to attract more foreign aid and investments.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has put economic development as the top priority for
the government headed by Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh,
which he appointed in March shortly after he assumed the throne in
February after his father King Hussein died.
</P>
<P>
Drastic measures are being taken on economic structure reform,
including efforts to change some of the non-profitable state
enterprises into share-holding companies. The national carrier
Royal Jordanian Airlines, the Jordanian Telecom and the railway
system in the southern harbor city of Aqaba are among the targeted.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is also going at top gear to join the 135-member
World Trade Organization (WTO) to promote trade with North
American and European countries while reducing dependence on its
traditional markets in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials are optimistic that the kingdom would be
admitted into the WTO by early next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Abdullah and the government strived to get more
foreign aid and investments into the cash-strapped kingdom, and
the U.S., the top donor, provide some 271 million dollars of
economic and military aid to Jordan in the fiscal year ending on
September 30.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rawabdeh said foreign investments would reach 1
billion dollars by the end of 1999, most going to mining,
fertilizer and tourism industries.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah visited the U.S., Britain, France and other major
creditor countries in a bid to partly write off or reschedule the
payoff of the country's 7.2 billion dollars of foreign debts, one
of the major stumbling blocks in the way for further economic
development.
</P>
<P>
But the economists pointed out that, given its weak economic
fundamentals and shortage in natural resources, the kingdom still
has a long way to achieve a economic prosperity.

<HEADLINE> First Palestinian-Israeli Meeting on Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli Steering
and Control Committee ended its first meeting Sunday on the
requirements of the third stage of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
There is still disagreement on the maps of the second
redeployment, said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in a
joint press conference with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the financial, economic, civil and legal
issues as well as the safe passage and international road. The
talks on these issues and others listed on the Sharm el-Sheikh
memo will be resumed on Monday, Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday meeting the two sides launched the work of
the joint committee on the third stage of Israeli redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian sides submitted a "letter of concept" on the
third redeployment to the Israelis, Erekat said. But he declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The third stage is crucial in the interim period, he added,
noting that the meeting dealt also with the second one.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the dispute on the maps of the second
redeployment was still there and that the two sides would try to
solve it.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh deal the two sides have to secure the
release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails before the
beginning of the holy month of Ramadan later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official renewed the demand for stopping the
Israeli settlement activities, which he said were "undermining the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eran said he promised the Palestinian side to
consider their "letter of concept" seriously and deemed it "very
important." However, he did not promise to accept it.
</P>
<P>
Eran gave special importance to the visit of U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross to the region and Ross's meeting with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the visit would push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He voiced confidence that the current bilateral talks would
lead to a "framework agreement" on a final settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in line with the Sharm el-Sheikh
memo.
</P>
<P>
The memo provides that the Israeli troops should pull out from
5 percent of the West Bank area by November 15, 1999, and 6.1
percent by January 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for opening the northern safe passage route
between Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the release of more
Palestinian political prisoners from Israeli jails.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
arrested two Iranians on Sunday at the Golan Heights and turned
them to the intelligence authorities for further questioning,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces did not identify the two Iranians,
but said they slipped into the Golan Heights from Syria and were
arrested shortly after their entering.
</P>
<P>
Although the motive behind their entry remains unknown right
now, the arrest was coincided with the United States' accusations
that Iran has speeded up arms shipments to "terrorist
organizations" in the region as part of Tehran's effort to
sabotage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iran is opposed to the peace-making between Israel and the Arab
countries, and has been supporting resistance groups in their
fight against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Friday that
the U.S. is concerned about Iran's increased support for
"terrorist groups that want to derail the peace process."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Sunday called on the country's rich people to help ease the
sufferings of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the call in a speech to congratulate the Egyptian
people on the advent of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"As we fast, we stick to all the noble values and offer our
society the best in this holy month that makes us remember the
sufferings of others and thank the Great Creator for his
blessings," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the rich people and businessmen to advance to the
society their excess money to assist, among other things, the
country's housing projects for the needy and young people in line
with the Islamic value of social inter-dependence.
</P>
<P>
"The Islam calls for help to solve the problems of others,
fulfilling the hopes of the poor and plants the seeds of love,
tolerance, and mercy in the hearts of people," the Egyptian leader
said.
</P>
<P>
The al-Mustakbal (Future) Housing Association for the
limited-income brackets announced recently a bank account for
social contributions for its projects.
</P>
<P>
During the Ramadan, which will begin around Wednesday, Muslims
are forbidden to eat, drink, smoke or have sexual intercourse from
sunrise to sunset to commemorate God's revelation of the Koran,
Islam's holy book, to the Prophet Mohammed. The fast is also said
to let the rich people experience the sufferings of the poor.

BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese private and public
school teachers are expected to go on strike on Tuesday to press
the government to meet their salary demands.
</P>
<P>
Aida Khatib, head of Beirut's League for Public Primary and
Intermediary School Teachers, said at a news conference that she
wished all teachers heed the union's call and do not go to school

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Highest Court Orders Re-trial of Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's highest court on Sunday
ordered the re-trial of four journalists who were sentenced to
prison terms or fined in August for libeling the country's deputy
prime minister, the country's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The editor-in-chief of Al-Shaab newspaper, the fiery mouthpiece
of the opposition Labor Party, Magdi Hussein, reporter Salah
Bedewei and cartoonist Essam-Eddin Hanafi were sentenced by the
South Cairo Criminal Court to two-year imprisonment. The three and
a fourth reporter, Adel Hussein, a columnist, were also fined
20,000 Egyptian pounds (5,900 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The court convicted the journalists of libeling Youssef Wali,
who is also minister of agriculture, in a series of articles and
cartoons, published over nearly a year, that accused him of
"treason" and destroying Egypt's economy by signing agreements
with Israel for the supply of seeds and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was handed down, the Egyptian Press Syndicate
and human rights groups cried out for the abolition of jail
punishment on journalists enshrined in the 1996 Press Law to
secure free expression.
</P>
<P>
The journalist appealed to the Court of Cassation, which
discussed the case last week and came to a conclusion that it
should be re-tried, the latest issue of Al-Ahram weekly, published
on Thursday, reported.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Cassation made the decision on the grounds that
the criminal court had made "several legal mistakes," including
rejection of Al-Shaab lawyers' request to summon Wali to testify
before the court, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sentences are expected to be quashed and the three
journalists may be released on Sunday or Monday, MENA said.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Expansion Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli peace groups and the
left political parties have criticized government's plan to
expand settlements in the West Bank and urged a halt to such
activities to facilitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Housing Ministry has recently issued
tenders for building 500 new houses for Jewish settlers in the
West Bank, with most near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace group "Peace Now" said Sunday that this new
settlement expansion plan will cause more damage to the delicated
Israeli-palestinian peace talks, with the two sides striving to
meet a short deadline for a permanent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The group also said that nobody understands why the Israeli
government led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak allows to expand the
settlements even now since the issue is the key stumbling stone in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The government led by Barak has issued tenders for building
3,200 new houses for settlers in the occupied territories since it
came to power in July and this figure is bigger than the total
tenders issued in three years by the former government led by
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu," the group added.
</P>
<P>
To push the peace process forward, the government has to take
actions to immediately halt such settlement activities, it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid said that he was
surprised to learn that the Housing Ministry has issued more
tenders for building new houses in the settlements.
</P>
<P>
While objecting to the plan, Sarid said after the Sunday
cabinet meeting that the question should be addressed, but why
this issue has not been discussed in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few days, the Palestinian side has repeatedly
asked Israel to halt all kinds of settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged the United States
to intervene to force a halt to settlement activities.

<HEADLINE> 20 People Injured in Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 people, including three
policemen, were injured in Bangladesh Sunday during the first day
of a two-day hartal (destructive strike), which was called by the
opposition alliance to press home its demand for the immediate
resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic incidents and clashes between police and
pro-strike activists in the capital city, the shutdown was largely
peaceful throughout the country, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 5,000 law-enforcing personnel were
deployed in Dhaka to maintain law and order during the stoppage,
and 62 people were arrested in the city.
</P>
<P>
Normal life was disrupted in the morning, but a large number of
vehicles came out to the streets in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League and its front organizations
brought out anti-hartal marches in the capital, chanting slogans
describing the opposition-backed strike as "anti-people."
</P>
<P>
This was the first countrywide shutdown organized by the
opposition since last week's leadership meeting of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the
Islamic Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) -- the four
components of the alliance, and the 17th of its kind this year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance has been staging a series of campaigns
this year in a bid to force the government to resign and it has
called for early parliamentary elections which are due in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Regrets Failure of WTO Talks, Promises More Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Sunday regretted the collapse of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle and emphasized the need for an
early negotiated settlement of trade issues in the world.
</P>
<P>
In his first response to Seattle ministerial meetings which
ended Saturday without any agreement, Vajpayee said developing and
large-population countries like India "have core interests to
protect."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Indian Economic Summit, organized by the World
Economic Forum and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII),
Vajpayee said the need for a negotiated settlement of trade issues
between countries "is obvious."
</P>
<P>
A spirit of consensus and avoidance of linking trade with
extraneous issues was necessary to reach a settlement, Vajpayee
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He warned rich countries to be sensitive to core interests of
developing countries, saying India "looks forward with renewed
anxiety to resumption of talks soon."
</P>
<P>
Globalization would increase interdependence of nations,
especially in trade and economy, Vajpayee said, adding that in an
unequal world, it tends to get distorted into a relationship
between the dominant and the dependent.
</P>
<P>
He outlined a globalization mantra, saying: "The greatest
challenge before all those in governance, business and
administrations is to steer the growth in global trade, business
and economy along with the lines of fairness, equity and
sustainability."
</P>
<P>
For this, Vajpayee said, the watchword would have to be "the
good of all and not the greed of a few; long-term growth and not
short-term gains; and cooperation based on complementary strengths
and not conflict rooted in unhealthy competition."
</P>
<P>
The three-day economic summit, which opened here Sunday, is
being attended by, among others, British Deputy Prime Minister
John Presscot and leading industrialists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the passage of insurance and foreign exchange
management bills last Thursday in parliament, Vajpayee declared
that his government would now embark on other financial reforms to
improve the efficiency of banks, financial institutions and stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
"India is on the move" and the government had resolved to
follow a bold pro-growth program of economic reforms for 7-8
percent growth annually, he told the participants.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee stressed the need for improving decision-making and
implementation of policies and projects to make all these sectors
more attractive to private sector and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government would radically simplify rules and
procedures that caused delays, Vajpayee promised.

JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak announced Sunday the establishment of two steering
committees to oversee final-status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's cabinet meeting, Barak named, in addition to
himself, Foreign Minister David Levy, Education Minister Yossi
Sarid, Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky and Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai

The permanent-status negotiations, which opened on September
13, will try to resolve such thorny issues as the status of
Jerusalem, borders, the future of the Jewish settlements on
occupied land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed by the two sides in
September, Israel and the Palestinians should reach a framework
agreement on final-status talks by next February and a final
accord by September 13, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Defends Nuclear Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Defending its project to build a
neclare power plant, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said
Sunday securing Turkey's future of a reliable energy supply is a
priority mission.
</P>
<P>
He added that if necessary precautions were not taken, Turkey
would soon face an energy shortage crisis which would negatively
affect development of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised speech, Ecevit said that the world
energy market is full of uncertainty, "we are trying to avoid
tying Turkey to limited and solitary resources."
</P>
<P>
He said although the joint Turko-Russian natural gas project,
code-named Blue Stream, is completed and Turkey can buy natural
gas directly from Russia via the Black Sea, it will not meet
Turkey's goals to "diversify its energy sources."
</P>
<P>
Turkish government decided last week to build a nuclear power
plant in the Akkuyu area in its south coast, which has drawn
concerns from environmentalists of Cyprus and other countries in
the region. But Ecevit said all power plants have such risks as
environmental dangers.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has debated its nuclear energy policy for many years,"
Ecevit said. The government must make a final decision on the
issue by the end of this year, or Turkey's credibility would be
damaged from the view of international companies which have
bidden for the project.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Critical of U.N. One-Week Extension of Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt was critical of the United
Nations Security Council's decision to extend the oil-for-food
program in Iraq for another week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution "draws a question mark on
the use of one-week extension of the humanitarian program,"
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In remarks carried by the Middle East News Agency, Moussa said
he "was surprised at" the U.N. decision, which he said "cannot be
understood as functional."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under trade sanctions imposed by the Security
Council after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The U.N.
oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine for its
people.
</P>
<P>
Six-month renewals of the program have been routine since its
inception in December 1996. But before its sixth phase expired on
November 20, the U.N. Security Council decided to extend the phase
by only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq rejected the proposal and stopped pumping oil for export.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the council endorsed the one-week extension,
which was again rejected by Iraq. The United States proposed the
draft resolution in an attempt to press other council members to
agree on a comprehensive policy that would resume arms inspections
in Iraq, suspended after the U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq
nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
One-week extension of the humanitarian program "is not enough"
to help ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East, occasionally distanced itself from Washington on Mideast
issues, including Iraq and the Arab-Israeli peace process.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks to Start in February: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Burundi peace talks should
get underway by February, next year, Nelson Mandela,
newly-appointed mediator and former South African president said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was chosen Wednesday to replace late Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere as mediator in the talks to end six years
of civil war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"I am setting no deadlines, but the sooner it takes place the
better. Because of my tight program, I hope I'll be able to start
this process sometime early in February," Mandela said on South
African television.
</P>
<P>
He said rebel groups so far excluded from the talks would no
longer be " ignored."
</P>
<P>
"We can't sideline anybody who can create instability in the
country and so we must find ways of accommodating them in these
discussions either by inviting them to join or by addressing them
separately," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of a wing of the Forces for the Defence of
Democracy (FDD) and the National Liberation Forces has been seen
as a stumbling block to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was confident about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt... that in every ethnic group there are those
who feel that violence, hatred, tension is not in the best
interests of Burundi as a country."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the process would not be easy. "A person
who has a delicate skin and frail nerves should never accept an
assignment this nature. There's going to be a lot of rough times,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi talks began in June 1998, bringing together
representatives of the Tutsi minority government in Bujumbura,
opposition parties and some of the Hutu rebel groups who first
took up arms in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 200,000 people have died and more than
one million have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
The talks have done little to stop the fighting, and since
Nyerere's death in October the peace process has grounded to a
halt.

<HEADLINE> Mt. Blanc Tunnel to Reopen Next Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The 12 km motor-way tunnel under
Mont Blanc of the Alps should be reopened no later than the autumn
of next year after the disastrous fire that killed 40 there on
March 24, Giancarlo Elia Valori, chairman of the Italian motor-way
company Autostrade, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Flames swept the tunnel, which straddles the Italian-French
frontier, when a heavy duty Belgian lorry carrying flour caught
fire. Temperatures rose as high as 1,200 centigrade thermometer
when the fire was blazing and were still as high as 100 centigrade
thermometer 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
Italian and French handling of the fire was criticized, but the
main culprit was seen as the tunnel itself whose traffic load on
one of the main thoroughfares between northern and southern Europe
far outstripped its facilities.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 million vehicles have been through the tunnel since it
was opened in 1965. Last year it was used by almost 2 million cars,
coaches, motorcycles and lorries as they drove from France to
Italy or vice versa.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Demand Declining in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The demand for coffee is
declining in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) though potential for
growth exists if large-scale promotional campaigns are carried
out, according to a study released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Coffee accounts for 25 percent of the domestic hot beverage
market in the UAE, but demand for the drink comes a distant
second after consumption of tea, as the ethnic mix in the country
comprises mainly of tea drinkers, said the study by the Emirates
Industrial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The study, which provided details of the coffee market in the
UAE, said there was a distinct decline in consumption of coffee in
the mid-1990s, in keeping with the worldwide waning habit of
drinking coffee, particularly among young people.
</P>
<P>
The demand in the UAE is more for decaffeinated variety of
coffee, with imports of this type being almost twice that of
non-decaffeinated coffee, the study noted, adding that the demand
is also confined to the winter season and grinds to a halt in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Indian coffee accounts for 35 percent of the market share in
the UAE, followed by Costa Rican coffee (30 percent), Indonesian
(10 percent) and Brazilian (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1997 indicated that the chief source for coffee
in the UAE is India, with imports valued at 13.5 million dirhams
(about 3.68 million U.S. dollars), followed by Indonesia, with
imports valued at 5.8 million dirhams (about 1.58 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The study observed that sizable promotion campaigns could
increase the market share and bring substantial gains to the
coffee industry, as coffee is both price and income elastic.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of global increase in production and decline
in demand resulting in a downward pressure on price, the scope for
growth in the UAE, in the absence of a big promotional campaign,
is marginal, the study added.

four-party alliance ended almost peacefully Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hartal, life was almost normal throughout the

</P>
<P>
A few clashes between hartal supporters and police took place

</P>
<P>
The opposition enforced the hartal demanding resignation of the

</P>
<P>
The hartal was the first since the November 30 meeting of
chiefs of the four opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The three other parties are Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and
Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, activists and supporters of the ruling Awami League

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet to Discuss Research on Measuring E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 6 (Xinhua)-- Some 200 statistical experts
from 27 countries (areas) are gathering here to explore ways to
develop acceptable and world-wide standards and protocols on e-
commerce with a view to achieve uniformity, consistency and
comparability in e-commerce statistics everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the three-day conference on the
measurement of electronic commerce, Singapore Acting Minister for
Communications &AMP; Information Technology and Minister of State for
National Development John Chen attached importance to the research
on measuring e-commerce, saying it is crucial that measurement
issues are highlighted and a set of tools and standards be
developed for measuring e-commerce in a bid to gauge the impact of
e-commerce on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the lack of an international standard definition on
e-commerce has led to widely disparate statistics on e-commerce
and generated much difficulty in drawing comparison between
different sources of information, Chen emphasized the need to
develop a common framework for conducting e-commerce surveys,
standardize concepts &AMP;definitions and develop a uniform
questionnaire for collecting information relating to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, e-commerce is growing rapidly with the
global number of internet users expected to reach 300 million and
the total e-commerce transactions projected to exceed one trillion
U.S. dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Singapore, Chen said 96 percent of large
enterprises and 86 percent of small enterprises are equipped with
internet access and 61 percent of large firms and 32 small
enterprises have their own websites.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said Singapore will further strengthen its support
for commerce developments by "encouraging academia, consultants
and business to take up thought leadership projects on Singapore
and the region", "encouraging leading e-commerce research
companies to be based in Singapore" with a view to build the
country's research capability, "facilitating and generating forums
for discussion on the latest thinking" and continuing to excel and
taking great leadership at international policy fora.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Calls for Arab Investment in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid on Monday called on Arab countries to invest more in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Mohasen al Kharafi, chairman of the
Kuwaiti Kharafi Investment Group, Obeid said Egypt began economic
reforms in 1991 and its economy has become one of the most
promising in the Middle East region, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the privatization process has helped open Egypt's
economy to foreign investments, a move which has been praised as a
model in the developing world by international financial
institutions, he told the Kuwait guest.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates have invested billions of U.S. dollars in
Egypt by setting up joint ventures or buying state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said Egypt is keen on reaching bilateral free trade
agreements with other Arab states in a bid to enhance inter-Arab
trade and ultimately set up the hoped-for Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed free trade agreements with Tunisia and Jordan,
and are negotiating with several others including Saudi Arabia and
Syria for the establishment of free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Kharafi lauded Egypt's
economic accomplishments achieved under the leadership of
President Hosni Mubarak, underlining his confidence in Egypt's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is among the countries in the region that are attractive
to world investors, Kharafi was quoted as saying by the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Kharafi Investment Group has invested in Egypt 2.5
billion Egyptian pounds (725 million dollars) so far. During the
meeting, Kharafi agreed to build an institute in Egypt for hotel
services and personnel training.

the statistical office of the European Union, Eurostat, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This compared to 10 percent in September 1999 and 10.6 percent
in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 15-nation EU as a whole recorded a 9.1 percent
unemployment rate in October 1999, the same level as in September.
The rate was 9.7 percent in October last year.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Complete Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- France Monday called for a "
complete and global solution" to the Iraqi crisis as the United
Nations Security Council will hold a session to vote on Iraq this
week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that France wants the "re-establishment of disarmament control"
and the "suspension of the sanctions" so that the economic and
social life in Iraq could return to normal.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the Security Council for its decision last
Friday to extend the "oil-for-food" humanitarian program for only
one week instead of six months as an extension used to be.
</P>
<P>
In New York last Friday, France refused to vote for a British-
sponsored resolution which linked the easing of sanctions to Iraq'
s acceptance of a new arms control regime.
</P>
<P>
"The content of the resolution was deliberately unrealistic,"
said the spokeswoman, adding that the Security Council harmed its
own credit by adopting such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has rejected the British-drafted resolution, saying that
its weapons of mass destruction have already been eliminated in
the long inspections led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has been severely criticized by Iraq for
collaborating with the United States and Britain in "new
aggression against Iraq". France has refused to comment on Iraq's
accusation.

<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Twenty six factories producing
fake famous-brand cigarette in the suburbs of Guiyang, capital of
southwest China's Guizhou Province, have been shut down in the
current nationwide campaign to crack down on fake cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 fake cigarette producing machines and a large
amount of cut tobacco, fake cigarettes and packaging materials
were seized during a recent blitz inspection by the State Bureau
of Quality and Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Fake cigarettes have flooded the Chinese market in recent years
causing a loss of nearly 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in tax revenues each year and violating both reputable
cigarette brand names and consumers, said Pan Yue, deputy director
of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made by state and local quality departments as
well as public security to effectively stamp out fake cigarette,
which will benefit the growth of local economy, he said.

<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian government is planing to open free trade
zones in the Gulf to foreign investments in various industrial and
services fields.
</P>
<P>
Iran has recently allowed foreign banking activities in the
free zones.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Iran Consultative Council ratified a law
on governmental safeguards for foreign investments in the Iranian
free zones where investments at present do not exceed 20 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Japanese cars are facing serious competition in
the Gulf markets from United States, European and Korean-made cars
due to the strong Japanese yen against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
Car market sources in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the
quota of Japanese cars in UAE markets has dropped from 86,170
vehicles in 1998 to 38,322 during the first nine months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The sources are anticipating that prices of Japanese cars in
the UAE domestic market will rise by the advent of the new year,
in conformity with the rising prices of the yen, a matter that
will boost the sales of other brands in UAE.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- A Gulf report said the improvement in oil prices this
year has added 23 billion dollars to the petroleum revenues of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quoted the annual report of the
Industrial Bank of the UAE as saying that despite the big rise in
the Gulf oil revenues this year, the revenues are behind the
registered 1997 oil revenues of 86 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth
Ali Bin Ibrahim Al N'aimi has disclosed that the Saudi Arabian Oil
Company (ARAMCO) has discovered two new fields of natural gas and
concentrates in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's local press quoted the Saudi Minister as saying that
preliminary estimates have indicated that the two fields contain
six billion barrels of concentrates and 120 billion cubic meters
of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery was made on November 29 at Niban, about
90 kilometers southeast Al Ghawar field. A little earlier, natural
gas was discovered at Shadin region, about 60 kilometers southwest
Al Ghawar.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen, the biggest importer of flour in the world in
1998, is scheduled to produce flour for the first time in the
coming few months upon the initiation of a flour mill by the end
of this month of December.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni plans to set up flour mills represent a strong blow to
European Union exporters whose activities are declining as
importers increase production of flour.

<HEADLINE> Over 800,000 Displaced in DRC, Says WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- There are more than 800,000
people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who have
been uprooted from their homes by the war and are living in
precarious conditions, the World Food Programs (WFP) announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said in a news release available here that aid
agencies working out of major urban centers in the DRC are
beginning to reach more people displaced by the conflict, adding
that countless others are still trapped in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, WFP staff visited six locations in
both government held and rebel controlled areas to try and gather
more information on the plight of the displaced.
</P>
<P>
"WFP have recently been getting greater access to more remote
locations in the DRC," said Kees Tuinenburg, WFP Country Director
for DRC, adding that "in some cases, entire village had shifted
to distant areas due to security problems."
</P>
<P>
Tuinenburg added that they found 4,000 displaced from distant
villages living with virtually no outside assistance and many
were traumatized, malnourished and in need of basic medical aid.
</P>
<P>
In June, WFP launched a 30-million-U.S. dollar program to
provide food assistance to 350,000 displaced on both sides of the
conflict in the DRC, but the agency only received a mere 29
percent of the funds needed.
</P>
<P>
If no new funds pledged in the coming weeks, WFP will
completely run out of food by next April, Tuinenburg said, adding
that agencies like WFP will unable to provide even survival
rations for those already malnourished and struggling to survive.

Finance of the SAR government, Yang Runzhen noted at the meeting
of a committee which oversees the appropriate investment with the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Francis Tam Pak Un, secretary-designate for economy and finance
of the SAR government, said at the meeting that the SAR government
will make the fund a kind of special reserve and will not use it
at will.

Macao government with the deduction of land development cost. The
total income is shared evenly by the current Macao government and
the future Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki has called for increased cooperation to make Africa
enjoy sustainable economic and social progress in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while opening the biennial meeting of the
Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Africa is still living with the legacy of colonization, he
said, noting that "Africans were forced into becoming nations of
primary producers rather than working together as builders of
enterprises and industries."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the fundamental task of Africa's intellectuals is to
develop the continent's economy.
</P>
<P>
African countries should form partnerships on shared visions

said.

the Chinese government is eager to advance its relations with
Jordan and hopes to bring a long-standing bilateral friendly

countries should increase high-level visits and exchanges at all
levels in order to promote mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should strengthen contacts between economic and
trade sectors and entrepreneurs, and set up various forms of
economic and trade relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, as an influential country in the Middle East, and China,
as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, both
are developing countries, and they should increase consultation

safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries, and
try to establish a new international order that is both
politically and economically reasonable.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Company Aids Beijing's Ancient Wall Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua)-- French company Lafarge has
donated 1,000 tons of lime to the Beijing Municipal Cultural
Relics Administration (BMCRA) for the renovation of the city's
ancient wall.
</P>
<P>
The lime will be used for repair of the 57-meter section of a
decayed city wall east of the Beijing Railway Station, said Dung
Van Anh, chief representative of the China office of Lafarge. The
wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Dung said that Lafarge will continue to lend financial support
for protecting Beijing's historical sites in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mei Ninghua, director of BMCRA, said that Beijingers donated
ancient city wall bricks they had collected for the rebuilding of
the city's ancient wall in 1996 and that the administration has
gathered about 60,000 bricks.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the bricks are only enough to build a 20-30 m
section of the extremely high city wall.
</P>
<P>
Lafarge currently has ten manufacturing companies in China
since it first entered the country about five years ago. Its
cement company in Dujiangyan City of southwest China's Sichuan
Province has an investment of 130 billion US dollars and will be
the biggest cement producer in southwest China when it is finished
in two years.

<HEADLINE> WFP Food Convoy Trapped by Heavy Rains in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- For more than two weeks, a
large convoy of food aid from the World Food Program (WFP) still
remains stuck at Muddul Brava village, about 205 kilometers south
of the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, consisting of more than 120 trucks carrying
cereals, porridge, cooking oil and other food items, was heading
towards the famine- stricken regions of Bay and Bakol of southern
Somalia when the road ahead of them became impassable for mud and
ruins owing to heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The situation is deadlocked and the hope for proceeding ahead
to the destination is diminishing one day after another as the
heavy rains are not even letting up for few hours.
</P>
<P>
According to officials accompanying the convoy, they have so
far made only one third of the journey, whilst the nearest group
of the target people dying of hunger are 400 kilometers away from
the point where the convoy remains stuck.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdi, one of the drivers
contacted on the telephone line in Muddul Brava village Sunday
morning, the situation is grave as dozens of drivers have begun
falling for malaria.
</P>
<P>
There are no enough substitutes for them to take over and the
tires of the vehicles are also getting punctured as they have been
under heavy weight for 15 days without making any movements, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another driver Hassan Ibrahim said they are still waiting for a
decision from the WFP officials in Nairobi whether to return back
to Merca or divert the destination of the food aid to other
equally vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
According to Qureisho Sheikh Ahmed Mohamed, chairperson of a
women organization who contacted the journalists in Mogadishu on
the VHF radio from Bur Dhubo town of Gedo region, 15 have died for
hunger in Bur Dhubo district last week alone, most of them are
children.
</P>
<P>
The local officials of Gedo region are complaining about
serious food shortages in the region since the heavy rains in
Lower Shabelle and Lower Jubba regions have made the region
together with Bay and Bakol almost isolated from the rest of the
country, the chairperson said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Optimistic About Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Monday
expressed confidence that it can make substantive progress in its
peace talks with the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to resume talks on December 13. We are optimistic
we'll reach a substantive agreement before year end," Secretary
Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier gave the government
panel and the MILF up to the end of this year to work out a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mercado indicated the government panel may even consider
recommending to President Estrada the extension of the talks, but
only if the MILF shows its sincerity in forging peace with the
government.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot finish everything, we might recommend that the
talks continue. But there should be substantive progress first,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, Mercado stressed, wants a guarantee from the
MILF that it would not attempt to set up any new camp or conduct
operations that will put civilians at risks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the MILF will resume
as scheduled on December 13, said Mercado.
</P>
<P>
According to National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre, the
December 13-14 peace talks will focus on substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
Formal peace negotiations between the government and the MILF
opened in Maguindanao province on October 25 with both sides
optimistic that the talks would lead to a lasting peace in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president said he may order the Armed Forces of
the Philippines to observe a Christmas cease-fire in Mindanao but
stressed that there will be no let-up in the campaign to protect
the people there from terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has pledged to bring peace and prosperity to Mindanao
by pursuing talks with rebels and developing Mindanao into the
country's new food basket and economic hub.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Recalls Three Commercial Attaches over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
recalled three commercial attaches based in Europe and North
America over poor visa service to foreign investors wishing to
visit the country.
</P>
<P>
The officials were reportedly recalled on the orders of
President Olusegun Obasanjo as a result of their shabby treatments
to prospective foreign investors, Daily Times newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Nigeria has been directed not
to deploy the recalled envoys to any other posts, the paper said,
adding that this move has thrown all commercial sectors of
Nigerian embassies over the world into fears of imminent shake-up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, all Nigerian missions based abroad were
directed by the president to ensure that prospective foreign
investors get their visas to Nigeria within 24 hours of
application.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has adopted the method of interviewing
visiting foreign businessmen on their experiences with Nigerian
embassies in their respective countries with a view to determining
how the missions are implementing the presidential order.
</P>
<P>
Feelers from the visiting businessmen showed that issuance of
Nigerian visas is still held up in bureaucratic red-tape,
virtually everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract foreign investors into the most populous
African country, the Nigerian government has also set up an
Investment Promotion Council to serve as one-stop establishment
for the handling of all bureaucratic matters involving foreign
investors.

<HEADLINE> China's Light Industry to Grow 9 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry is
expected to achieve a 9-percent growth in output value and a 100-
percent increase in profit this year, according to Chen Shineng,
director of the State Administration of Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
Chen said at today's national conference for light industry
that the sector has made remarkable progress in eliminating state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) deficits this year by focusing on a
number of state key industries and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry, for instance, reduced its deficit of 1.5
billion this year by cutting down superfluous production capacity,
adjusting prices and improving its technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, among 1,143 key debt-ridden sugar industry
SOEs, 105 have restructured their operations, 116 enterprises have
recorded gains and bankruptcies while 88 closed down. He said 24
key enterprises will initiate debt-to-equity swap shortly
involving a total capital of 11.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhigang, deputy director of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, stressed that next year is a crucial year for China to
achieve the goal of lifting most SOEs out of difficulties within a
three year period.
</P>
<P>
"The sector should step up efforts in establishing modern
enterprise systems in the sector's 61 key enterprises and key
industries," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Improving enterprise restructuring and technology is a long-
term task for the light industry," Chen said. The sector will take
concrete measures such as acquisition, bankruptcy, debt-to-equity
swap and improve its technology to transform the industries.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the light industry aims to achieve an industrial
growth of 9 percent and an added industrial output value of 7
percent next year. Light industry exports are expected to exceed
60 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that existing obstacles in the
development of China's light industry include an imbalance between
demand and supply and fluctuating factors in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The total industrial output value of the sector reached 1.32
trillion yuan in the first ten months, up 9.7 percent from the
same period last year. Exports grew 4.5 percent earning 47 billion
U.S. dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Six women and four men
were killed when a light aircraft crashed near Springs, east of
Johannesburg in South Africa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Police spokeswoman Captain Rochelle
Gouws, the Piper Chieftain crashed about 500 meters after take-off
from the Rand Airport in the East Rand around 7:00 a.m. local

</P>
<P>
The aircraft crashed in a dry, bushy and rock-strewn river bed
next to the junction of the N3, N12 and N17 highways, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the cause of the accident was not known, but the
problem arose just minutes after the take-off.
</P>
<P>
The passengers, all employees belonging to a Johannesburg
company called Communications and Training International, were on
their way to Oranjemund in Namibia for computer training.
</P>
<P>
There were no survivors, Gouws said, adding the names of the
victims would be released later.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Turkish Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday vehemently
condemned Turkish troops' fresh aggression against its northern
territories, demanding their immediate pullout and avoidance of
such aggressive acts in the future.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by
the Iraqi News Agency that on November 26, units of Turkish
troops, supported by tanks, long-range artillery and helicopters,
entered into northern Iraq
</P>
<P>
He added that on November 27, the Turkish troops launched a
wide-scale military aggression on areas of Kani Masi, Beikofa
Shiladzi, al-Amadiya, Dir Lok, al-Qudish, Trush, Jabal Kara,
Jabal Mitin and Jabal Hiftin in the Iraqi Kurdish autonomous
governorate of Erbil.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq absolutely rejects the "flimsy and
feeble pretexts and excuses" made by Turkey to justify its
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claimed that its troops were cracking down outlawed
rebels of Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) who have been
fighting for independence since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The new Turkish aggression came within a repeated string of
military operations carried out by Turkish troops against Iraqi
territories since the "the U.S.-led aggression" in 1991, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish aggression coincides with the military actions
taken by the United States and Britain against Iraq to interfere
in its internal affairs and to perpetuate the abnormal status in
northern Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government lost its control
of the northern Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish government
troops often launched cross-border offensives against rebels of
PKK who have been seeking shelters there.
</P>
<P>
"While the government of Iraq condemns the new Turkish
aggression on the Iraqi territories, it holds Turkey responsible
for the aftermath and consequences of such acts which contradict
the U.N. Charter and international law," the spokesman concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Optimistic About HK's Position as Maritime Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has a unique role
to play as a maritime and financial center after China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the SeaTrade Hong Kong Conference
held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Tung said
a Goldman Sachs report predicted that trade to and from China
"will be doubled in the next six years because of China's
accession to WTO."
</P>
<P>
The figure will be doubled and the shipping requirement could
also be doubled because of the trading requirement, Tung said.
"It's a huge need," he said.
</P>
<P>
The same report also predicted that foreign direct investment
into China will go from 45 billion U.S. dollars a year to close to
100 billion dollars, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 45 billion dollars a year makes China already the
second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the
world, a lot of foreign direct investment will enable Hong Kong to
play a very unique role as a financial center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the need for legal services, accounting services and
other professional services following China's opening up, will
also strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial center, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's overall economic performance, Tung said the
economy had bottomed out in the second quarter of 1999 and in the
third quarter there will be a positive growth of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are now moving out of the bottom, and we're
moving up," the chief executive declared.
</P>
<P>
However, Tung also pointed out many challenges that Hong Kong
is facing, including the increasing globalization of the economy,
and how Hong Kong can maintain its leading position amongst
China's other major cities in areas of infrastructure, human
resource provision and international relationship.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: Improving Quality of Rural officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow's edition of People's
Daily, China's leading official newspaper, will carry a commentary
calling for improvement in the quality of grassroots officials in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the rural economy since 1978,
agricultural and rural work are facing new problems which need
special attention, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' income has not been improved in some areas in spite of
the increased agricultural output. The structure of agricultural
production has not been properly adjusted because rural officials
at the grassroots level know little about the market. Meanwhile,
it is difficult to provide enough job opportunities for surplus
laborers in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Rural officials are playing a very important role in stepping
up rural reform and developing the rural economy, says the article,
noting that they should learn more about the market economy and
improve their ability in helping farmers make more money.
</P>
<P>
Cadres at the village level should be selected from a larger
group of people and through more a democratic but strict process,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The grassroot officials should be provided with basic knowledge
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the socialist market
economy, science and technology, and the country's legal system
through various training courses.
</P>
<P>
They should also be encouraged to improve their skills in
solving all kinds of problems in rural areas, the article says.

<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reassured the public Monday that there will be adequate supply of
basic commodities in store shelves after December 31, the time
when the millennium or Y2K bug is expected to strike.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary Zenaida Maglaya of the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) said the government and the private sector are
ready for any potential problem that may be caused by the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any panic. On our part, we have coordinated with
manufacturers, who assured us there will be an adequate supply of
goods on December 31 and January 1," Maglaya said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
She also said the DTI continues to do its part to make sure
unscrupulous traders do not take advantage of the Christmas season
to jack up their prices at the expense of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Other government agencies, Maglaya said, have made similar
preparations, with the Department of Energy assuring that the
energy sector is Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
She noted manufacturers themselves aired concern over the
energy sector's readiness for Y2K because they can ill afford
power outages disrupting their operations.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya also said the health sector is similarly ready, with
the government ensuring that there would be more than a month's
supply worth of inventories of medicine and supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maglaya asked the public anew to help the government
go after unscrupulous traders who unnecessarily increase prices of
their products.

JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said here Monday that the government will take
firmer action against drug traffickers and if necessary, mete out
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"God-willing, the government will take firmer action against
drug traffickers who have so far been untouched by the law," the
president said when opening the national extraordinary congress of
the Civil Servants' Wives Association at the state palace.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said many have suggested that drug traffickers be
subjected to as severe a sanction as possible in view of their far-
reaching impact on the community.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million Indonesians have reportedly become drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
"If people are proven to be drug traffickers they must be dealt
with, irrespective of who their parents are," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the imposition of the death penalty, such as
in Malaysia and Singapore, depends on the law and that support
from the House of Representatives was badly needed.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on the people to increase their
participation in the government's efforts to cope with the drug
trade.

over the weekend during a fresh clash between the militant Ijaw

become a major concern to many missions of Western countries and
investors showing interest in the country have been warned to hold

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's E-Banking Banking Industry to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's banking
industry is predicted to achieve about 500 million U.S. dollars in
revenue from the electronic banking (e-banking) business by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Malaysian banks are now exploring the e-banking
concept, a U.S. financer said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This will give local banks an idea of the expenditure they
have to deal with for setting up e-banking and to develop the
strategy to market the new system to the community," Rick
Richardson, the leader for the U.S. Financial Services Practice
and Global Banking for PricewaterhouseCoopers USA, said during the
media briefing on"Trends in Asia's Banking Sector" here.
</P>
<P>
He said the consolidation exercise currently being undertaken
by the Malaysian banking industry would give an added advantage to
the development of e-banking in the country.
</P>
<P>
"With the merger exercise, a bigger entity will be created
which will benefit them (banks) all as they become ready to offer
e-banking. What we need now is the approval from Bank Negara (
State Bank) Malaysia to set up the e-banking system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current conventional banking is beginning to give way for e-
banking, he said, adding "Once the restriction on virtual banking
is lifted by the central bank, we foresee that Malaysia would
definitely be among the first Asian countries to implement the new
trend and become a major player."
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility for Malaysian banks to go for cross-
border merger or partnership with the implementation (of e-banking)
, though not soon, he predicted, saying Malaysian banks might want
to develop its own e-banking system before moving further or
outside the country or region.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Cancel Military Deal If Bribe Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) (C The South African
government had insisted on clauses allowing it to cancel defence
contracts worth 30 billion rand (about 5 billion U.S. dollars) if
suppliers were convicted of bribing officials, Jayendra Naidoo,
chief negotiator of the military deal, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said the clauses were designed to ensure that
contractors fulfill their obligations.
</P>
<P>
South African Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota and
representatives of German, British, French, Italian and Swedish
defence manufacturers last Friday signed deals to supply new
ships, submarines and aircraft to the South African Defence
Force.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo led three South African teams and negotiated with 18
international suppliers and four European banks to nail down the
contracts, including financing arrangements and the all-important
investments made by the bidders.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa's Pan Africanist Congress accused some
government officials of taking bribes from the suppliers, and had
submitted a package of evidence to the Heath Investigative Unit
(an anti-corruption unit).

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
will work together to support projects in selected low-income,
food-deficit countries in Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB and FAO announced here Monday in a communique that they
will seek to collaborate on thematic studies relating to poverty
and food security and identify improved strategies to fight hunger
and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
They will also use their institutional strengths to identify
and design investment projects in agriculture and rural
development, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Following the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996, which
committed to halving the number of world's hungry by 2015, the FAO
is implementing a Special Program for Food Security (SPFS) to
raise and stabilize food production in low-income, food-deficit
countries.
</P>
<P>
The SPFS, also aimed at increasing farmers' incomes and
generating rural employment, is ongoing in 50 countries, including
12 in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB recently made poverty reduction its over-arching goal.
Since much of the region's poverty is in rural areas, food
security initiatives are integral to poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
A common focus on poverty and food security provides an
opportunity for the FAO and ADB to work together on SPFS projects,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Despite decades of progress for many, Asia and Pacific remain
home to over 900 million people who earn less that one U.S. dollar
per day while over 500 million of them suffer from chronic
malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Back at Work, UPDATE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to work early Monday, reported Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived at his office in Kremlin at 9:30 a.m. Moscow
time and is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma at around 11:00 a.m. in the Big Kremlin Palace, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma arrived in Moscow early Monday for a brief working visit.
Later he will leave for Paris and then travel to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will also meet with
Kuchma in the Kremlin. Yeltsin will hold a working
meeting with Putin after the talks with Kuchma, said an Interfax
news agency report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is back at work after treatment of pneumonia at the
Central Clinical Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The president was diagnosed as suffering from a viral infection
accompanied by bronchitis after a two-hour meeting in the Kremlin
with top aides on the war in Chechnya and a union treaty with
neighboring Belarus on November 25, and was hospitalized with
pneumonia on November 29. He was taken to the Central Clinical
Hospital in Moscow for examination and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Because of Yeltsin's sudden illness, a visit by Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko to Moscow, originally scheduled for
November 26 for the signing ceremony of the Russia-Belarus Union
Treaty, was postponed to December.
</P>
<P>
After the Kremlin announced the ailment of Yeltsin just when
everything was ready for signing the treaty to create a Russia-
Belarus union state, Minsk doubted Yeltsin's reported illness was
the true reason for putting off the union treaty. Media suspected
that Yeltsin's sudden sickness had some "special links" with the
signing of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kremlin categorically denied the links between
Yeltsin's illness and the union treaty on November 26, saying that
Yeltsin "is not suffering from a diplomatic illness but from a
genuine cold."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the NTV channel, Yeltsin's spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin denied Western press allegations that Yeltsin
wanted to remain in the shadows to propel Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin to the forefront of action, noting Yeltsin "will retreat
into the shadows from an active political arena only after a new
president is elected in Russia."

HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- DHL Worldwide Express, the

to establish its Central Asia hub in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
DHL's Central Asia hub will operate from Express Cargo Terminal

in partnership with such a highly regarded air express company as
DHL," said Cathay Pacific's Director and Chief Operating Officer

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Accused of Destroying Family in Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong, the evil cult banned
in China, was accused of destroying family life Sunday in Montreal,
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Canadian Chen Meili and her husband, who live in
Vancouver, told a gathering of leading Chinese Canadians in
Montreal that their family has been seriously ruined by the Falun
Gong organization
</P>
<P>
Their daughter Chen Xiaolin is still recovering from
schizophrenia as a result of practicing Falun Gong, which has
caused deaths of more than 1,400 innocent people on the Chinese
mainland, in addition to countless injuries.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin's husband said months ago that he wanted to divorce
because Xiaolin was too indulged in the weird concepts of Falun
Dafa to take any care of their little kids and the family,
according to the parents.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin, once a loving mother, had become so cruel that she
even attempted to stifle the months-old baby with a pillow, as she
felt disturbed by the baby's crying during her practice, the
parents said.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin was haunted by the so-called "sacred wheel" spinning
and cutting in her head and stomach.
</P>
<P>
The imagined "wheel" is what the cult leader Li Hongzhi
describes as a key fixed in a member's body which could lead to
the "heavenly kingdom" under the protection of his "sacred body."
</P>
<P>
Many Falun Gong members have committed suicides in pursuit of
the "sacred wheel" or the "heavenly kingdom," with some cutting
their chests open and others jumping to death from high buildings.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin told her mother that it was a matter of course for
Falun Gong members to "seek their heavenly kingdom" in one way or
another. She herself wanted to cut her head open, or jump into the
heaven," the parents told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin, a registered nurse in Vancouver, even rejected any
medical treatment when she became seriously ill, believing the
only way out was practicing Falun Gong, as preached by Li Hongzhi,
who threatens to take back his "sacred body" if any member sees a
doctor or takes medicine.
</P>
<P>
It was in a local hospital that Xiaolin was saved and began to
recover.
</P>
<P>
She has realized that she might have died elsewhere, but is
still in lingering fear of punishment by her "teacher" Li Hongzhi,
the parents said.
</P>
<P>
They voiced their sincere support for the Chinese government in
banning Falun Gong, saying many more people may have otherwise
fallen victim to the evil cult.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin's suffering aroused strong sympathy and indignation
among the leading Chinese Canadians in Montreal. Dai-Tong Lam,
president of the Chinese community in Quebec, said there are
enough facts showing that Falun Gong is an evil cult.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Canadians in Montreal fully support banning the cult,
he reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Li Xiaofeng, head of the local women and children society,
pointed out that the Chinese government is justified in outlawing
the cult, which should not be allowed any longer to victimize
innocent people and cause social instability.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the local Chinese community said they would
help make the facts better known in Canada so as to contribute to
the smooth development of Canadian-Chinese ties.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Offer Tax Rebate for Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to offer tax rebate for local manufacturers to encourage
export, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director of a local plastic-ware manufacturer, Leanne
Investments Limited, Bassam Mohsen, was quoted by the paper as
saying manufacturers, especially those producing good quality
products that can match to international standards, should receive
incentives in form of tax rebates to encourage export.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of exports with low income tax should be encouraged from
this country. This will help bring in the much needed foreign
exchange to buy raw material and help boost the private sector,"
Mohsen said.
</P>
<P>
He said once the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) Free Trade Area scheduled for October 31, 2000 comes into
effect, the local companies will face very stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
"When the COMESA free trade area initiative comes into effect
there will be a lot of competition, and to produce competitive
products and survive the stiff competition, local manufacturers
like us will definitely need tax rebates," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that discouraged by the low turn-over on the local
market, Leanne Investments Limited is planning to enter outside
markets in the neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African Post
Office and its management partner New Zealand Post International
have announced plans to restore the utility to profitability by
2001 and to improve its service significantly.
</P>
<P>
Top Executives from the two organizations have begun a
countrywide roadshow in South Africa to inform customers of their
turnaround plans, the Business Day newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the South African Post Office has lost
considerable market share to electronic communications and courier
services due to unreliable delivery times and mail theft.
</P>
<P>
The new partnership, formed in September, is aimed at turning
around the utility.
</P>
<P>
The partners plan to create four million addresses and
thousands of new postal outlets around South Africa and halt
postal crime over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The South African government recently decided to halt all
postal subsidies by March 2001 in the wake of the cabinet's
approval of the three-year management contract between the Post
Office and New Zealand Post International.

HARBIN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sanjiang wetland in Fuyun

approved as a nature reserve on the national level.
</P>
<P>
The wetland, covering an area of 53,900 hectares, is home to
over 200 species of wild animals including white cranes, red-
crested cranes and ernes, which are on the top national protection

</P>
<P>
More than 50 rivers and some lakes are also inside the wetland
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, the natural ecological system often referred to as
the earth's "kidneys", play an important role in water
conservation and the prevention of soil erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
China now has wetlands with acreage amounting to 65.7 million
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Company Plans to Acquire Kenya's Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) plans to acquire the 100,000 barrels per day
(bpd) refinery in Kenya to shore up its investments abroad, Daily
Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An NNPC team comprising consultants and officials from the
foreign investment department is scheduled to leave for Nairobi,
capital of Kenya, this week to finalize negotiations on the
acquisition, the paper quoted sources at the Kenyan High
Commission to Nigeria as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move to acquire the refinery in Kenya came ahead of plans
by the NNPC to shut down the Port Harcourt and Warri refineries
in the country between the first and second quarter of next year
for Turn Around Maintenance, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the acquisition is to send part of the
crude oil meant for the two refineries totalling 274,000 bpd to
the offshore refinery and ship the refined product back to the
country in a bid to forestall likely fuel scarcity.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investment plans of the NNPC have been boosted by
the Nigerian government's decision to fully deregulate petroleum
products supply and distribution where crude oil delivery to the
NNPC will be at export parity.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, NNPC group managing director, was quoted
as saying last week that part of the gains from the deregulation
of the petroleum sector was to make the NNPC fully
commercialized.
</P>
<P>
So, according to him, even when the local refineries are fully
back in operation, the NNPC intends to push the crude supplied to
it to its overseas refineries, where refined petroleum products
will be expected to bring in added value and interest in foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Voters Disenfranchised in Mozambique By Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Administration
Technical Secretariat (STAE) failed to open 11 polling stations on
Friday and Saturday in the central Mozambican province of
Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
STAE General Director Antonio Carrasco told a Maputo press
conference on Sunday night that the majority of polling stations
in the areas of difficult access did indeed open on Sunday, the
third day of voting.
</P>
<P>
However, it proved impossible to transport polling station
staff and election materials to three polling stations in Lugela
district, and eight in Mopeia district, which contradicts
Carrasco's assurance on Saturday that there were no longer any
problems in Mopeia.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters had been brought down from provinces further north
to airlift staff and materials to the polling stations unable to
open on Friday and Saturday. But in mid-morning on Sunday, stocks
of fuel ran out at the airport in the province capital Quelimane
and the helicopters had to be grounded.
</P>
<P>
Carrasco said the failure to open 11 stations meant that 8003
voters lost their right to vote. Since there are over 1.3 million
voters in Zambezia, the situation is tolerable, though doubtlessly
a disappointment for those residents of Mopeia and Lugela, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Just 0.6 percent of the Zambezia electorate was unable to vote.
So taking the country as a whole, the number of voters
disenfranchised is just 0.11 percent of a total of 7.09 million
registered voters nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Carrasco, the counting work began immediately
following the ballot casting which ended at 18:00 local time on
Sunday and the final results will be released on December 20.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian CPO Output to Reach 5.9 Mln Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua)-- The Indonesian Palm Oil
Producers Association (GAPKI) predicted on Monday that the country
's palm oil production in 1999 would reach 5.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of GAPKI Derom Bangun said demand for palm oil both at
home and overseas would continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 5.9 million tons of total production, about 45 percent
would be supplied by private plantations," he said at the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile contribution of the state-run plantations would be 32
percent and the people plantation is expected to reach 23 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangun also said that about 60 percent of total production of
crude palm oil is consumed at home while the rest is exported to
West Europe and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Palm oil has become an important export commodity for
Indonesia as the world demand for vegetables oil keep rising by a
rate of 3 percent annually," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said export tariff for crude palm oil (CPO) should be
lowered to zero percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently export tariff for CPO is 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Light Industry to Face Opportunities and Challenges after WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- "The light industry is to face
both opportunities and challenges after China enters the World
Trade Organization (WTO)," said Chen Shineng, director of the
State Administration of Light Industry at a national conference
for light industry in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, China's light industry enterprises are competitive
and overseas investment now accounts for a considerable proportion
of the industry," said Chen. China leads the world in the output
of many light industry products, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen believes that after China enters WTO, light industry
exports will increase coupled with less tariffs and the cost for
many products will drop considerably. WTO entry will also
facilitate Chinese enterprises to set up branches abroad and
upgrade technology by utilizing more overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
However, large quantities of sophisticated light industry
products will pose threats to domestic enterprises. China also
lags behind in management and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, related departments have conducted research
on what China's entry into WTO will mean for its light industry
and is keeping a close eye on the latest terms of the WTO
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chen has urged light industry associations to play a more
active role.

<HEADLINE> Ross Holds Talks With Arafat, Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross held separate talks Sunday night with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
discussed with them issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in Israel Sunday evening to prepare for
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit, went to the
West Bank city of Ramallah shortly after his arrival and held
talks there with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Ross about the implementation of the Sharm El
Sheikh peace deal and particularly the issues hindering the
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, according to a senior
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat urged the U.S. side to put pressure on
Israel to halt settlement activities and reiterated the
Palestinian stand on rejecting Israel's plan for the next 5
percent withdrawal from the West Bank," the official added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal, the second Israeli troop
withdrawal from another 5 percent of the West Bank was scheduled
for November 15, but that had been held up due to the disputes
over which areas should be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Barak late Sunday night in a session that
continued for several hours, but no details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to arrive here Tuesday evening to hold talks with
Barak and Arafat. But Israeli officials have already lowered their
expectations about Albright's visit, saying the visit is intended
to advance talks over a final-status treaty, not to intervene in
disputes over so-called interim issues like the housing tenders
or territorial withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The new peace deal obliges the two sides to reach a framework
agreement on final-status next February and a final peace treaty
in September the same year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel-based Wizcom
Technologies Ltd. has launched a portable pen-sized optical
scanner, in which up to 1,000 pages of printed text can be stored
and then be transferred to personal computers, laptops or cellular
phones, the company's website Quicktionary.com said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Business analysts believed this hi-tech product will
dramatically facilitate the onerous work of transferring data from
printed media, such as library books and journals, to the
computers.
</P>
<P>
The QuickLink Pen, which measures 15 centimeters in length and
weighs 85 grams, can scan random bits of material faster than a
traditional scanner.
</P>
<P>
The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine in it can store
large quantities of information by converting the image to text.
</P>
<P>
Once linked to PCs, the Pen also can transfer the scanned
information into different application software, which means the
scanned texts will be transferred directly to word-processing
applications, tables and charts to spreadsheet applications,
business cards to address book programs, and internet links to
internet browser bookmarks.

<HEADLINE> Rains May Ease Power Rationing in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing will ease in
next two weeks if the current rains continue, Kenyan Energy
Minister Francis Masakhalia has said.
</P>
<P>
The rains would raise water levels at the Seven Forks Dam and
increase electricity generation in the country, Masakhalia was
quoted by Monday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, if the dry spell persists, his government would be
forced to import between 30 to 60 megawatts of electricity,
Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government plans to negotiate with Ugandan to
increase the import to 50 megawatts, up from the current 30
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Due to the shortage of rains, power rationing in the east
African country has badly hampered the industrial sector and
caused inconvenience in people's daily life in the past several
months. It is also scaring off the potential foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce 1.4 Mln Barrels of Oil Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua)-- Indonesia's crude oil production
in the second semester of the current fiscal year, which ends on
March 31,2000, is expected to reach 1.4 million barrel a day,
Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the figure was lower than the first semester production
which reached 1.48 millions barrel a day.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, based on the development of the crude oil price
which expected to be much better, we estimate that price of crude
oil in the second semester (of the 1999/2000 fiscal year) to reach
20 U.S.dollars per barrel," Sudibyo said at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Currently, oil price in the international market is 25 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo also said the government would extend market for
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in a
bid to increase the national revenues from gas.
</P>
<P>
"We will extend (the market for LNG and LPG) as the production
is not ruled by quota," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC) is a constraint for the government to increase its revenues
from the oil sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the OPEC members whose oil quota
production is 1.1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999/2000 fiscal year, the country's target for oil
revenues is 20.9 trillions rupiah (2.8 billions U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attitude Toward Iran May Go Against UAE: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The conciliatory attitude
recently taken by the United States toward Iran could go against
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Tehran over
three Gulf islands, the local Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This situation does not serve UAE interests in resolving the
dispute over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs, the paper quoted Dr. Abdulla Fahd Al Nafisi, former Kuwaiti
member of parliament, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The well-known politician, currently visiting the emirates,
claimed that the U.S. could pressure the UAE into a solution that
would lead to the UAE loss of the three strategic islands, which
have been controlled by Iran since early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The UAE favors a peaceful solution to the dispute either
through direct negotiations or by international arbitration. But
the two countries can not agree on the terms of negotiations, and
Tehran refuses arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has given long-time support to the UAE on the
islands issue and regarded Iran as a threat to Gulf stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, especially after moderate Iranian
President Mohammed Khatami took office in 1997, Washington has
been seeking better relations with Tehran, with which it has had
no diplomatic relations for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. even offered to send a consular and other
officials to Iran to encourage people-to-people contacts. But
Iranian hardliners have so far refused Washington's overtures.

<HEADLINE> 75 Dinosaur Fossil Footprints Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese
scientists have discovered 75 dinosaur fossil footprints on a 200-
square-meter rock in the county of Luanping in north China's Hebei
Province, some 150 kilometers from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that the dinosaurs, both carnivorous and
herbivorous, inhabited the earth 130 million years ago. The recent
discovery includes footprints of the plant-eating dinosaur of the
genus iguanodon whose body was 10 meters long and had legs more
than two meters long.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that scientists have discovered
footprints of the iguanodon in Asia. Scientists from the Nanjing
Institute of Geology and Paleontology attached to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, as well as from Institutes from Tokyo and
Chiba in Japan believe that the footprints were left by the
dinosaur when it migrated eastward from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are expecting more finds in the area. Experts have
come up with suggestions on how the government can protect the
area.
</P>
<P>
To date, scientists have discovered many fossils of dinosaur
footprints, aquatic animals and plants in Luanping.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Close Higher in Tokyo Despite Weak GDP Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo Monday as a sharp gain on Wall Street last Friday boosted
Japan's export-oriented technology issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 139.06 points, or 0.76
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,507.20.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 21.55 points or 1.34 percent to 1,
632.80.
</P>
<P>
The weaker-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) data for
the third quarter of this year failed to have a significant impact
on the Tokyo stock market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said earlier in the day
that the GDP for the July-September period shrank a real 1 percent
from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the surge on Wall Street, where the technology-
heavy Nasdaq composite index hit a record high closing, offset the
weak GDP figures.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 546.24 million
shares from last Friday's 584.97 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Niigata Engineering was the volume leader of the day.
</P>
<P>
High-tech issues were generally higher, reflecting the
favorable performance on Wall Street last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Software-related issues were boosted by their U.S. counterparts,
while domestic demand-related issues fell prey to selling.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 648 to 579, with 122 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Sudanese Presidents to Meet in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart Omar el-Bashir will meet in
Kenya's capital Nairobi Tuesday in an effort to normalize the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will address the bilateral relations and other
issues," Hope Kivengere, Presidential Press Secretary, told Xinhua
Monday morning in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
She said the talks will start on Tuesday and continue on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When asked if former U.S. President Jimmy Carter would attend
the talks, she said "he was expected to take part in the talks,
but I have not yet received information from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs."
</P>
<P>
It is noted that amnesty and sanctuary for Lord's Resistance
Army rebel leader Joseph Kony is most likely to dominate the
Nairobi talks.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents were expected to hold talks in South Africa
last month. But the talks flopped due to President Bashir's poor
health.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan soured diplomatic relations in April of 1995,
accusing each other of backing rebel groups in the respective
countries. However, this year there appeared some indication of
improvement in the relations between the two countries with some
Sudanese MPs visiting the northern part of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Parliament is at present debating an amnesty bill
which, once enacted, would pardon all the rebels fighting the
government if they come out peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Rage on Israel's Mt. Carmel, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Another forest fire broke out
on Mountain Carmel outside Israel's northwestern city of Haifa
early Monday morning in a series of blaze seen as one of the
biggest forest fires in the country in years.
</P>
<P>
Two earlier fires broke out on the mountain Saturday morning
and Sunday night separately, which had destroyed 6,000 dunams
(about 1500 acres) of natural forests at least, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 fire engines and hundreds of fire-fighters endeavored
through the night Sunday to contain the blaze, aided by six Air
Force helicopters which had dropped one-ton buckets of water on
the blazing forests.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Fire and Rescue Service Chief Moshe Vardi
claimed that Sunday night's fire might be an arson.
</P>
<P>
Vardi, claiming that he was at the scene virtually from the
beginning of the fire, said he found that fires started in several
different places at the same time and light of torches as
suspected arsonists traveled in car form one spot to another.
</P>
<P>
Vardi pointed out that the blaze began at about 7 p.m. (1600
GMT), a time when there were no hikers, visitors, or agricultural
vehicles working, so the fires must not be started by negligence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky visited the fire
brigades' field headquarters Sunday night and pledged to find
those responsible for the damaged.
</P>
<P>
The dry and windy weather has increased dramatically the
possibility of forest fire. Seven other fires were reported
elsewhere across the country Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Remains High in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's inflation rate has
remained in double digits in the last three months, twice that
registered in the middle of the year, according to a report by the
country's Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The saddening figures may indicate that Uganda's economic
success story is going off course, the New Vision daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The annual headline inflation for November 1999 rose to 10.6
percent from some 10 percent over the two previous months while
that for May was only 5.1 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts blamed the sharp increase in inflation rate on
bad economic management by the government, while economists at the
Finance Ministry pointed the finger at regular hikes in the price
of food, a major component of the country's consumer basket.
</P>
<P>
The real cause of price rises has not been ascertained and the
recent drought in the country could have started taking its toll
on the economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Country
Representative Zia Ebrahim- Zadeh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He advised the government to look at the causes critically and
adopt strict monetary discipline to control the situation from
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other multilateral agencies use inflation as a
major benchmark and barometer to gauge their cooperation with
Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, from which Uganda has
been benefiting annually.

<HEADLINE> 67 Die in Renewed Floods in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Floods killed at least 67 people
in Vietnam's central coastal provinces which were hit by heavy
rains and severe flooding from December 1, barely a month after
the November inundation, Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The flood also submerged hundreds of thousands of houses and
tens of thousands of hectares of cultivated fields, and damaged or
swept away thousands of tonnes of rice seeds and foods.
</P>
<P>
Quang Ngai is among the hardest-hit provinces with 21 dead and
some 200,000 households now in urgent need of food, clean water
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
In Quang Nam province, many reservoirs are near bursting point
particularly the Phu Ninh reservoir near the provincial capital of
Tam Ky.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai paid special attention
to the protection of reservoirs in Quang Nam province during his
December 5 working session with the Central Flood and Storm
Control Committee of the country in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m.Sunday, two sections of the trans-Vietnam Highway 1A
were still submerged under one to two meters of water, causing
traffic holdups, according to a report of Vietnam's Ministry of
Transport and Communications.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three sections of the trans-Vietnam railway line
were still under repair, holding up 13 trains.
</P>
<P>
Terrible floods, caused by torrential rains, hit the Vietnam's
central coastal provinces in early November, killing 591 people,
injuring 250 others and causing losses worth more than 3.7
tillions Vietnamese dong (265.7 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua)-- A seminar on Sino-Japanese
relations and a new order in the Asia-Pacific region in the 21st
century sponsored by the Xinhua News Agency and Yomiuri Shimbun
was held here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scholars and experts from China and Japan
including Zhu Liang, vice-president of the Chinese Association for
International Understanding, former chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and
former head of the International Department of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, as well as Nakayama Taro, a
member of the Japanese House of Representatives and former foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu said good Sino-Japanese relations are vital
not only to the fundamental interests of both countries but to the
future of the entire Asia, adding that it is China's consistent
position to maintain and develop its friendly relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Nakayama Taro said peace and stability are the essential
conditions for Asia's prosperity. In spite of wide differences in
their politics and economics, the Asian nations all require
stability and development, and so both governmental and non-
governmental dialogues and cooperation are important venues for
achieving stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Participants held wide-ranging, in-depth discussions on Sino-
Japanese relations and bilateral cooperation, as well as economic
cooperation among the nations in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Deposits Increase in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency deposits at
South Korean domestic banks totaled 9.38 billion U.S. dollars in
November, up 580 million dollars from last month's 8.8 billion
dollars, the Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increase to high proceeds of
exports.
</P>
<P>
Many local companies have not converted the U.S. dollars they
earned from exports to the South Korean currency won as the
greenback is weak against the won.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the hike has helped slow down the fall of
the dollar against the won as those deposits absorbed much of the
excessive supply of hard currency on the local foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency deposits in the country declined from 9.48
billion dollars at the end of last year to 8.89 billion dollars in
June this year and 8.05 billion dollars in September before
beginning to rise in October.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economic Growth Rate to Hit 10 Percent This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy is
expected to grow some 10 percent this year due to brisk exports
and rising corporate capital spending, said a spokesman from the
Ministry of Finance and Economy Monday.
</P>
<P>
Revising its forecasts for this year's macroeconomic indicators,
the ministry predicted the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate may hover 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate will reach a mere 0.8 percent this year,
well below the government's target of 1 percent, while the current
account surplus will amount to 24-25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation's unemployment rate is expected to get to
a yearly average of 6.4 percent and its end-of-year usable foreign
exchange reserve is likely to reach 72 billion, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In July, the ministry set the economic growth at 5-6 percent
this year, but revised it to 7-8 percent in October and to 8-9
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we make a conservative prediction, it is certain that
the nation's GDP growth rate will top 9 percent," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The revised forecast was based on brisk exports, an upswing in
corporate facility investments in the second half of this year and
the strong Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
In November, South Korea's exports surged 22.2 percent year-on-
year to 14.26 billion U.S. dollars, the highest-ever monthly
growth rate. The strong yen helps the competitiveness of South
Korean products against Japanese ones in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Given a recent surge in exports, there is a high possibility
that South Korea's current account surplus will amount to 25
billion U.S. dollars this year, according to the ministry. In the
first 10 months of this year, the current account surplus stood at
21.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Labor, Alliance Sign Coalition Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Labor Party and
the Alliance, which won a combined total of 63 seats in the 120-
seat Parliament on November 27 general election, signed a one-and-
a half-page coalition agreement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A key element of the agreement is that it allows either party,
but more likely junior coalition partner the Alliance, to oppose
the forthcoming coalition government on an issue viewed as
important to that party's political identity.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Labor Party and prime minister-elect Helen Clark
said at the signing ceremony that it was not the two parties'
desire to negotiate a detailed policy manifesto of the kind New
Zealand First had insisted in 1996 when the National Party and New
Zealand First were negotiating a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Both she and Alliance Leader Jim Anderton had emphasized the
importance of offering stable government, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
On a matter of "party distinction," a party can speak and vote
against a Cabinet decision, she said adding: "That will not be
regarded as being in breach of the convention of Cabinet
collective responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Anderton said it is crucial the coalition agreement has a
clause that allows the Labor Party and the Alliance to agree to
disagree, so tensions do not build up within the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement a standing coalition management committee,
comprising Clark,  Anderton, their deputies and two senior whips,
will meet when necessary to consider issues of deference between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet, which is composed of 16 Labor ministers and
four Alliance ministers, will be sworn in on Friday by governor-
general Sir Michael Hardie Boys.
</P>
<P>
Three Labor ministers and two Alliance ministers will sit
outside the Cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Adhere to Independent Foreign Policy in New Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will continue to adhere
to its policy of striving to maintain friendly ties with all
nations in the world in accordance with its independent and active
foreign policy as the world is entering the 21st century, said the
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in an editorial that "Our actions will always be
guided by the norms of international relations and in the spirit
of making larger issues become smaller and smaller issues
completely resolved."
</P>
<P>
It accused some nations of attacking the very foundation of
international relations, the basis of which is state-to-state
relations based on equality between independent and sovereign
nations, in their efforts to shape the world according to their
mold, saying that it becomes a source of great concern for third
world countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed the supreme importance of unity and
solidarity of developing nations under these circumstances,
calling for due regard for each nation to pursuit its own
political and economic systems best suited to its own conditions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserves Up to 71 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves increased to 71.04 billion U.S. dollars last Friday, the
first time in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is the 10th largest in the world," a spokesman for
the Ministry of Finance and Economy said Monday. He added that "
the growing foreign exchange reserves signify that South Korea has
completely moved out of the external crisis."
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase to the country's
increasing account surplus, continuing inflow of foreign
investment and repayment of loans borrowed by domestic financial
institutions from the Bank of Korea before country was plagued by
a financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign reserves fell to 3.94 billion dollars on
December 18, 1997 when the nation was gripped by the financial
crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Because of the crisis, South Korea borrowed 58 billion dollars
tied to harsh conditions from the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Real GDP Shrinks 1.0 Percent in July-September Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product in
the third quarter of 1999 contracted a real 1.0 percent from the
previous quarter for the first shrinkage in three quarters, the
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter dip, which translates into an annualized
shrinkage of 3.8 percent, came after two straight quarters of
surprise growth.
</P>
<P>
Japan's GDP grew by revised 1.5 percent in the January-March
quarter and 1.0 percent in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
An EPA official attributed the latest downturn to weakness in
domestic demand, which is widely viewed as the key in getting the
economy back on the road to sustainable recovery.
</P>
<P>
For the July-September period, private consumption, which
accounts for some 60 percent of the GDP aggregate, weakened 0.3
percent from the previous quarter while corporate capital spending
fell 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment dropped 3.2 percent for the first decline in
three quarters, while public investment decelerated 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP measures the value of goods and services produced
within a nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and
seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor showing for the July-September, it is believed
that the Japanese government would be able to attain its goal of a
0.6 percent growth rate for fiscal 1999, which ends March 31, even
if the GDP were to shrink as much as 0.3 percent in each of the
remaining quarters.

<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned coal mines
will cut down their output by 50 million tons next year so as to
lay a sound foundation to revive the industry, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
China had closed down 30,500 small coal mines by the end of
October this year, reducing the output by 202.18 million tons.
</P>
<P>
To change the formidable trend that most companies in the
industry are operating at losses, more efforts should be made to
close redundant mines and slash coal production, Sheng Huaren,
minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, was
quoted as saying at a three-day national working conference that
ended on Saturday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Although the annual coal output has been decreasing in recent
years, oversupply is still the main headache for the staggering
sector, he said, adding that the country will strive to fulfill
the task of producing about 900 million tons of coal next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that small mines located within the boundaries of State
key mines or with underdeveloped technology will be completely
shut down next year.

<P>
VIENNA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and more
than 30 others injured, four seriously, in chaotic crowding and
trampling Saturday evening after a snowboard performance at a
stadium in Innsbruck, western Austria, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The mishap occurred when more than 40,000 young viewers were
leaving the stadium at the end of the performance. Slippery
ground and crowding were the main cause of the tragedy, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The five victims, all female and aged between 14 and 21, were
trampled and crushed to death instantly.
</P>
<P>
It was only after police shot into the sky that the chaos was
brought to an end, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some people attributed the tragedy to the inadequacy of
security facilities at the stadium, which was built in the 1960s.
Others said some young people had drunk too much and became over
excited, which worsened the chaos.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Middle Reaches Push for Eco-Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 60,000 hectares of
farmland in areas with serious water and soil erosion in north
China's Shanxi Province have been planted with trees and grass to
turn the problem around.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing project, part of an ambitious program by the
Chinese government to develop the vast western areas, is crucial
for the improvement of ecological conditions in the middle reaches
of the Yellow River, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials announced that another 30,000 hectares of
farmland will be used for planting trees and grass in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Not only has over-cultivation of wild land in the province
heavily damaged the ecology, the low yield of crops in some poor
farmland did little to solve the region's food shortage.
</P>
<P>
High-yield farmland development in the area in recent years has
to a large degree made it possible for some farmers to give up
their own infertile land.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be compensated for relinquishing their farmland,
and the central government has instituted preferential tax
policies related to agriculture in the areas involved, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation in the province, all the farmland
on slopes of 25 degrees must be returned grassland and forest
areas, which will involve 98 counties in the province.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Share Responsibilities on Turkey's European Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou Sunday night urged the European Union (EU) to accept
their responsibilities concerning Turkey's European course.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 3rd conference of the World Council of Hellenes
Abroad (SAE) in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Papandreou said that the EU should not hide behind a possible
Greek veto and accept their responsibilities towards Turkey's EU
course.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Turkey's entry into the EU means that Greece's
partners confront directly the existing issues.
</P>
<P>
If in essence Europe was ready to accept its responsibilities,
Greece would be the first to say "yes" in Helsinki, if Europe was
not ready to accept those responsibilities, then Europe would have
the responsibility of the possible Helsinki impasse, since it
would have shown its inability to undertake the resulting
responsibilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders will discuss Turkey's candidate status at their
Helsinki summit next week.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou urged Turkey to take seriously its own European
prospect and to move forward with courage on the steps required by
this prospect.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
With the recent improvement in the relations between the two
neighboring countries, Greece has taken a positive stance towards
Turkey's EU candidacy, but Athens wants guarantees from the EU
that if it supports Ankara's EU candidacy, this will not be
followed by a rekindling of disputes with the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned Thursday that Greece
wanted to endorse Turkey's candidacy at the EU Helsinki summit,
but would veto it without the EU's guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Returns to Top Place at Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- One vital goal from Ian Harte at
injury time gave Leeds United a 1-0 victory over Derby Sunday and
brought the team back to the top of the English premier league.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool moved to fifth place later on the day by defeating
bottom club Sheffield Wednesday 4-1, the fifth home win for Gerard
Houllier's team.
</P>
<P>
Leeds' young side had looked destined for a goalless draw and
second place in the table behind Manchester United before
Australian Harry Kewell was tripped in the box.
</P>
<P>
Harte blasted the penalty home as Leeds snatched an injury time
victory for the second week running. Last Sunday, they beat
Southampton by the same score thanks to Michael Bridges's stoppage
time goal.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win puts them two points clear of Man United, which
had a 5-1 victory over Everton Saturday. However, they have played
one more than Alex Ferguson's side.
</P>
<P>
At Liverpool, Swede Niclas Alexandersson gave Wednesday a
surprise lead with a stunning drive from the edge of the area
after 19 minutes but the home side equalized within two minutes
through a Sami Hyppia header and their win was never in doubt
after that.
</P>
<P>
David Thompson set up the second for Liverpool, with his angled
drive only palmed by goalkeeper Kevin Pressman into the path of
Danny Murphy who struck home with a firm drive.
</P>
<P>
Two of Anfield's young prospects finished off Wednesday in the
second half with two majestic pieces of skill.
</P>
<P>
Steven Gerrard beat two players in the area before curling the
ball into the net and Thompson capped a fine display with a
similarly clinical finish 10 minutes from time.

LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- American tennis legend John
McEnroe retained his Honda Challenge veteran tennis title at the
Royal Albert Hall when Frenchman Henri Leconte retired with back
trouble Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Leconte, with his waist heavily strapped, tried to end many of
the rallies too quickly and was down 6-2, 4-1 when the match ended.
</P>
<P>
The finale produced the first real altercation of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the first set Leconte twice asked umpire John Parry about
line calls but a more ferocious outburst came from McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe stood nose to nose with the linesman and screamed the
immortal words: "That ball was clearly wide."
