<HEADLINE> India Attacks West For Linking Trade With Environment, Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inaugurating the silver jubilee celebrations of the Energy
Research Institute of the Tata Group, President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan said that developed countries are "now taking advantage
of environmental issues to protect their own markets from the
products of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"This non-tariff barrier is another attempt to deny the
developing countries the much needed opportunity to rejuvenate
their economies," Narayanan said.
</P>
<P>
Talking on the environmental crisis facing the world, the
Indian President said "if the so-called first world is really
serious about containing the greenhouse effect and the depletion
of ozone, it has to transfer freely and in time these technologies
to the third world" to control pollution.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan accused the west of misusing the existing
environmental and labor standards and imposing new ones, saying
that "such measures will perpetuate inequity and negate efforts
for sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Labor Minister Satyanarayan Jatiya Friday
also expressed concern over renewed efforts of the west to link
international trade with labor standards, saying that New Delhi "
totally opposed to labor standards being turned into an instrument
of protectionism."
</P>
<P>
Such moves sought to deny the competitive advantage in trade to
developing countries and thereby cause further deterioration in
their economic growth and employment generation, he told the
visiting Director General of the International Labor Organization
Juan Somavia.

<HEADLINE> Liberia to Cut Half of Its Army by May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has ordered to begin cutting the 15,000 strong army by more
than half by May, reports reaching here from Monrovia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament should have been done after the 1997 general
election, in which Taylor, a former rebel leader, became president
of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor attributed the delay to the lack of funding from
international donors.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic difficulties, the army has become an unrest
factor in Liberia. Before the civil war started in 1989, the
western African country had only 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's police director colonel Paul Mulbah said on Thursday
that soldiers were partly responsible for a crime wave including a
spate of armed robberies.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were injured
Saturday in clashes with police following a protest in southern
Iran against the results of Friday's crucial parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people staged a violent protest in Shush Danial, the
southern Khuzestan province, after the result of the polling was
announced in the constituency, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The protestors accused the winner of the constituency of bribing
the electorate and attacked the premises of local government,
public buildings as well as several banks.
</P>
<P>
They hurled stones at policemen on duty and set fire on several
vehicles, the report said, and police shot in the air and fired
tear-gas to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been under control and those wounded were
taken to hospital, IRNA quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive sixth parliamentary polling was held nationwide on
Friday, which was believed to create a new power balance in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Estimates said that the reformers, main supporters of the
reformist policies of President Mohammad Khatami, would win the
election, though the final result has not come out yet.

<HEADLINE> China Promises Cooperation With Kuwait For a Peaceful Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China is committed to the
peace and stability in the Gulf region, visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Everything points to a strong
recovery in Italian exports, Italian Foreign Trade Minister Piero
Fassino said at the start of the Milan fashion week Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are counting on overcoming the fall we had in 1999,"
Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
"All the indicators show a trend of great recovery," the
minister said, citing data from his own ministry, those of the
employer's association Confindustria and "those which I consider
most important from the order books of the various categories."
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong increase in the North American market and
the Asian one, a significant recovery in eastern Europe and also
in Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Latin America, which was supposed to start picking up in the
second half of the year, is already showing signs of revival," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive short-term trend and we have to seize it,"
Fassino said, adding that fashion was "Italy's oil" and could make
a major contribution to any export-led recovery.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, DRC Facilitator Discuss Lusaka Pact Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni met with Ketumile Masire, facilitator of the national
dialogue in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), over the
issue of implementation of the Lusaka agreement, ahead of fresh
summit scheduled for next Wednesday in Lusaka on the DRC issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in Mpigi district, 40 kilometers southwest
of the capital city Kampala Saturday, a press release from the
President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Ketumile Masire, former President of Botswana, arrived here
for consultations with Museveni on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
They discussed regional issues of mutual interest, with
emphasis on the implementation of Lusaka cease-fire agreement
inked last July to stop hostilities in the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
As facilitator of the inter-Congolese national dialogue,
Ketumile is expected to consult all political organizations in
the DRC as well as the different rebel groups involved in the
18-month-old armed conflict. Uganda is backing DRC rebels and
signed the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka agreement, which was signed by all the parties
involved in the conflict, remained unimplemented most of time
following the cease-fire and was nearly brought to a faltering
edge with government and rebel forces continuing to exchange
gunfire in the eastern part of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission, set up under the Lusaka
agreement with the exclusive task of implementing the peace
accord, tried in vain to carry it out due to acute lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. Security Council's special session on the DRC issue
last month fell short of reaching agreement on sending
international peacekeepers to the vast central African country,
making the everlasting resolution to the DRC issue look even more
distant.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Visit Stresses Solidarity With Lebanon: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's visit to Lebanon showed Egyptian people's solidarity with
the Lebanese, presidential political advisor Osama al Baz said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit also told Israel to respect Lebanon's
sovereignty and the security of its people, Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Israel should abide by the April 1996 Understanding, baz said,
adding that it is Israel that violates the Understanding and not
Lebanon as claimed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Understanding that ended Israel's massive attacks on Lebanon
in 1996 bans attacks on or from civilian areas. But Israel bombed
three Lebanese power plants on February 8 in retaliation of
Lebanese guerrillas' killing of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The recent tensions in south Lebanon have cast shadows on the
future of already stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, an active role in promoting the Mideast peace process,
has just concluded a lightening visit to Lebanon for talks with
Lebanese leaders on the latest situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Baz warned that any further escalation of conflict in the region
may lead to grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that countries concerned would work to breathe life in
the negotiations at all tracks," Baz said.

Financing the Arab Trade.
</P>
<P>
The report, published on Saturday by local dailies, said that

local production.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Local dailies said on Saturday that 82 Lebanese

On the sidelines of the exhibition, the Lebanese official and

</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A United States delegation, comprising representatives
of eight industrial and trading companies, dicussed on Saturday the
investment opportunities in the Saudi industrial and commercial
sector and how to support the commercial exchange between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies on Saturday quoted Executive Manager of the

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured Saturday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on some
civilian and service installations in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 15:50 (1250 GMT), eight formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from the Turkish airspace made 16
armed sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The jets bombarded some civilian and service facilities in the
region, injuring three civilians and damaging properties, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired at the invading
planes and forced them to flee back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States and Britain launched four-night air
strikes against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made
18,868 sorties over the two no-fly zones in Iraq and have targeted
regularly their civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, saying they were
unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without authorization
from the United Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> AIPU Proposes Arab Parliamentary Committee on Conflicts in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Arab Inter-
Parliamentary Union (AIPU) Fathi Sorour reiterated here Saturday
the AIPU's support for Lebanon against the Israeli assaults which
targeted vital civilian facilities in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening debate of the AIPU Council's 35th
session, Sorour, also speaker of Egyptian people's assembly
(parliament), called for a firm Arab support for the Arab rights,
Algerian News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the establishment of an Arab parliamentary committee
to investigate Israeli violations of international law in Lebanon,
referring to Israel's recent air strikes against civilians and
civil infrastructure in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets targeted power stations and other infrastructure
across Lebanon last week in retaliation for the killings of six
Israeli soldiers by Lebanese Hezbollah militiamen over the past few
weeks. An ensuing Hezbollah revenge attack killed another Israeli
soldier.
</P>
<P>
"The committee is to submit copies of its report to all
international forums, especially the European Parliament, the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Euro-Mediterranean Conference,
to prompt them to adopt clear attitudes against these hostilities,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab governments need to ask the International Commission
for Investigating International Human Law Abuses, forged under the
Geneva Accords in 1977, to probe Israel's inhumane acts in Lebanon,
he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Arab solidarity is crucial to realizing the legitimate Arab
goals stressing the need for an Arab summit to chart the course of
the Arab work, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day AIPU meetings were participated by 19 AIPU member
states.

ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- An avalanche in northeastern
Italy, close to the Austrian border, killed one skier Saturday.

HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Eleven countries of the
14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) have
agreed that their military health services should cooperate in the
areas of research, management and training.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the 11 SADC countries reached the
consensus at the five-day military health workshop which ended in
Harare Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to identify capabilities of each country instead

The representatives have agreed to use the capabilities of one
country for the benefit of other members, the Zimbabwe News Agency

The military health services should strive to ensure high
standards of health care, taking into consideration the physical,
psychological and social health needs for the fighting forces so
as to maintain a high morale, he said.
</P>
<P>
Armies are also a major player in helping civilian authorities

However, not much has been done by SADC member states to help
each other improve health delivery, he pointed out.

He noted that SADC member states have not been so keen to
attend similar workshops held in the past.

<P>
The first was held in Zambia five years ago and another one in
Malawi last year.

<P>
The next meeting would be held in Botswana next year.

LONDON -- A murder investigation was launched Saturday after
the discovery of bodies on a roadside in Northern Ireland earlier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A local woman found the bodies near the village of Tandragee
in County Armagh, southwest of Belfast. The two dead men were aged
in their late teens or early 20s, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police declined to say whether the shootings were linked to a
feud between rival groups of Protestant pro-British "loyalist"
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jameson, said to be a leader of the Protestant Ulster
Volunteer Force (UVF), was killed last month, prompting fears of a
loyalist feud.
</P>
<P>
The rival Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) denied widespread
reports that it was behind the shooting. Jameson's relatives,
while denying that he was in the UVF, however insisted the LVF was
to blame for his death.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process is at a critical stage,
with the province's fledgling coalition government of Protestant
and Roman Catholic political parties suspended because the Irish
Republican Army has not handed in its weapons. (Britain-NIreland-

ANKARA -- A total of 1,366 members of the Turkish Islamic
radical group Hezbollah have been arrested and sent to court, with
669 imprisoned after trial, the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operation in Istanbul's Beykoz district on January 17
kicked off a nationwide crackdown on the terrorist group. Huseyin
Velioglu, head of Hezbollah, was killed in the operation in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
So far, the security forces have launched 780 operations
against Hezbollah and arrested 4,505 suspects of the group.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah was found to have committed 997 kidnappings, murders
and blackmails between 1991 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist group began its operations in late 1980s and
used to target mainly the outlawed separatist Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), which has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, and other sympathizers of
the PKK. (Turkey-Hezbollah)

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Experiment with New Free-kick Rule in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- FIFA will pick up a major
English competition next season to try out a rugby-style law in
which a free kick is advanced 10 yards (9.15 meters) if defending
players argue with the referee.
</P>
<P>
The International Football Board, FIFA's law-making body,
decided at their annual meeting to continue with the experiment
after positive feedback came from a league in Jersey, a cup
competition in England and in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen said the 10-yard
rule would be used at the next under-20 World Cup in Argentina in
2001 and would be presented to a gathering of FIFA referees in
Munich next week for further discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The International Board have been made aware by the English FA
that it had been a very positive development, but the general
feeling in FIFA is that it is a little too precipitous to have a
major change right now, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The English FA are enthusiastic to widen the experiment and it
will be introduced into either the premier league, the first
division or a major Cup competition from next season.
</P>
<P>
New laws agreed at the meeting included goalkeepers who will
now have to release the ball within six seconds rather than after
four steps, a move designed to speed up the game.
</P>
<P>
FIFA have also approved an experiment using goal-line
technology to decide whether the ball has entirely crossed the
line for a goal. The experiment will be carried out in English
leagues starting next season.
</P>
<P>
Experiments using two referees, which have been conducted in
five countries and received mixed reactions, will continue.
</P>
<P>
Assistant referees will also be instructed to have a more
active role in match officiating and will be allowed onto the
pitch to help referees.

<HEADLINE> China Upbeat About Title Defence in Table Tennis Worlds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coaches on Sunday
discarded their usual low-key posture in the world table tennis
championships by claiming their players would bring two team
trophies home.
</P>
<P>
"We are odds-on favorites for the team championships," said
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua. "We will try our best not to
disappoint Chinese fans."
</P>
<P>
Cai, who always insisted China held no advantage over Europeans
in the men's sport, said the Chinese players were not afraid of a
combined challenge by the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for any challenge, we are very confident," the
Chinese coach said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team, bundled in Group A with Belgium,
Austria, Yugoslavia, Romania and Spain, is set to top the group
and reach the top eight.
</P>
<P>
They won't meet serious threat until the quarter-finals where
the Chinese are expected to take on either France or Sweden.
</P>
<P>
France, led by former world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien,
Patrick Chila and Damien Eloi who all play a very aggressive game,
finished second to China in last world championships.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, world team champion in 1989, 1991 and 1993, is
spearheaded by 1991 and 1997 world singles champion Jan-Ove
Waldner and 1991 winner Jorgen Persson.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's squad was grouped with Sweden, Belarus,
Lithuania, Chinese Taipei and the Netherlands. Chinese coach Lu
Yuansheng tipped the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
Germany and South Korea as major rivals.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Concludes Lightening Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Saturday paid a lightening visit to Beirut during which he
discussed with Lebanese leaders the latest situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak voiced support to Lebanon's demand to seek
guarantees for a non-repetition of Israeli attacks on Lebanon, and
to revive the April Understanding Committee, Lebanese Prime
Minister Salim Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up to monitor the ceasefire in south
Lebanon that was mandated in the April 1996 Understanding which was
reached between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas to end Israel's "
Grapes of Wrath" massive attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The understanding also bans attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the month, the Israeli delegation walked out of an
urgent meeting of the committee, which convened to ease the
tensions in south Lebanon prompted by the escalating conflicts
between Israeli occupation troops and Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel bombed three power plants and injured 15 Lebanese
civilians in retaliation for Hezbollah's killing of Israeli
soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been spearheading a war against
Israeli occupation troops since they set up a security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985. Hezbollah has stepped up its attacks on
Israel since the breakup of Syrian-Israeli peace talks in January.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Syria of being behind the attacks and asked
Syria to rein in Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Mubarak's visit carries great symbolic meanings as it
comes in the wake of the Israeli raid on Lebanon's civilian
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's is certain that Egypt can help it by exerting its
regional and international weight to respond to any aggression,
Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has expressed readiness to help Lebanon rebuild the
electricity stations destroyed earlier this month, the prime
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is committed to siding with Lebanon in its crisis and is
ready to defend the Lebanese right on the international arena, Hoss
said.

Muslim Turkey into a strict Islamic-ruled regime by means of
violence and terrorism.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was leading a guerrilla
war against Israeli occupation troops in South Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UNCTAD X, a Meeting of Aspiration for  Development  by Yuan Li, Hu Guangyao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The eight-day 10th Meeting of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X)
ended here Saturday, vowing to promote the growth of the world
economy and development in the globalizing and ever interdependent
world.
</P>
<P>
As the first major inter-governmental economic and development
conference of the new century and the new millennium, UNCTAD X has
provided the international community with a unique opportunity to
take stock of and reflect on the recent experience of
globalization, to examine the strengths and weaknesses in past
approaches and policies, and to identify the major challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
After the spectacular failure of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) to straighten out the bitterly-divisive trade and related
issues at its Seattle meeting last December, UNCTAD X also
provided an appropriate venue not only to try to put the crucial
global trade talks back on track, but also to provide a sense of
direction on how to ensure successful integration of all countries
into the world economy on an equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people, including delegates from 120 out of the 190
UNCTAD members, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, officials from
key U.N. agencies such as Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus, President of the World Bank James
Wolfensohn and Director-General of the WTO Michael Moore, dozens
heads of state and government and representatives of non-
governmental organizations, national parliaments and civil society
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The conference adopted the Plan of Action, a guideline for the
organization in the next four years, and the Bangkok Declaration,
the political commitment of the member states.
</P>
<P>
The conference identified the major challenges ahead as
ensuring the effective integration of all countries into the
international trading system, improving supply capabilities,
overcoming the debt problem, strengthening the commitment to
social development, increasing women's economic participation,
generating adequate
financial flows for development, undertaking institutional reforms,
reducing financial volatility and enhancing the technological
capabilities of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
After holding unprecedentedly comprehensive and overall
discussions on the issue of globalization, delegates reached a
consensus that globalization can be a powerful and dynamic force
for growth and development and that if it is properly managed, the
foundations for enduring and equitable growth at the international
level can be laid.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that ensuring all countries enjoy the benefits of
globalization requires efforts to meet complex policy challenges
which arise, particularly at the global macroeconomic level, from
the growing interdependence of the various spheres of economic
activities, particularly trade, finance and investment, and the
downside risks which this interdependence sometimes carries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. trade body also committed itself to playing an active
role in consensus building around well-defined trade supporting
and development issues.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that a new round of multilateral trade negotiations
should take account of the development dimension.
</P>
<P>
To help shape international economic relations in the 21st
century, UNCTAD promised in its declaration that it will continue
the promotion of growth and sustainable development and the quest
for equity and participation by all in the opportunities created
by the technological revolution, the opening of markets and
globalization.
</P>
<P>
It will provide an arena for open and systematic debate on
diverse development-related issues of global interest among
partners in the development process, including the private sector,
NGOs, academia and parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
In the Plan of Action, UNCTAD proposed a series of measures and
initiatives to be taken by the international community to ensure
the successful integration of developing countries into the world
economy and reduce the risk of marginalization of the least
developed countries in the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The conference was widely acclaimed as a success and many
delegates praised Thailand for providing an atmosphere conducive
to reconciling developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Declaration, regarded as a milestone of
international cooperation and development, said that the
conference has created reasons for hope in the possibility of
creating a fairer and better world economic system, alleviating
poverty, redressing imbalances, and offering all people security
and growing opportunities to raise their standards of living and
lead a full and meaningful life.
</P>
<P>
Just as UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero said: "The so-
called 'Bangkok spirit' has helped narrow differences on aspects
of trade and development in the previous rounds of talks in Geneva
and Seattle and laid the foundation for open and transparent
negotiations in the future."

<HEADLINE> Three More Candidates Registered for Russian Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Election
Commission (CEC) Saturday approved three more candidates for the
presidential election in March 26.
</P>
<P>
The three are liberal Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the
reformist Yabloko bloc; famous film director Stanislav Govorukhin;
and Ella Pamfilova, leader of the Civil Dignity movement.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, 48, founded his Yabloko party in October 1993. He

Alexei Podberyozkin, a former Zyuganov ally, and Aman Tuleyev, the
left-leaning Siberian Kemerovo region governor, for the coming

</P>
<P>
Observers say that despite the size of the field, Putin is a
clear favorite of the voters. Opinion polls show him getting
nearly 60 percent support against the less than 20 percent
supporting rate for his main rival Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The commission on Saturday rejected the application of
businessman Ismail Ogly Tagi-Zade for a second time, saying he had
not collected enough signatures to run for president.
</P>
<P>
In order to register, each candidate is required to submit
property and income declarations and the signatures of at least
500,000 supporters to the CEC.
</P>
<P>
The commission on Thursday rejected the application of ultra-
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, saying he failed to report all
his assets.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea are confident that they can finish second
despite missing three players who played in Manchester three years
ago at the 2000 World Table Tennis Team Championships here.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korean women's team who finished second at the last
championships in Manchester were well prepared for the
championships here and eager to win all their matches, team
manager Chae Ra U said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said China would still be the favourites to retain
the title.
</P>
<P>
"We have done intensive training for two months and we believe
that we can repeat our performance here," Chae said.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea are drawn in Group D with Hong Kong, China; Hungary;
Ukraine; England and Luxembourg in the week-long championships.
</P>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong women's team
aim to upset group favourites South Korea at the Dawei 45th World
Team Table Tennis Championships which start here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, who finished fifth in Manchester three years ago,
are in Group D with South Korea, Hungary, Ukraine, England and
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
An upset victory against South Korea will place them in a good
position to improve their rankings, Hong Kong chief coach Hui Jun
told reporters Saturday after a training session at Putra Stadium
where the week-long championships are held.
</P>
<P>
He said they would give their best in their final group match
against the Koreans on Tuesday in order to win the group and
automatically advance into the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
He said they had a slight chance of beating the Koreans as they
know their (Koreans') players' strength and are ready well for
that match.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will start their matches against England on the first
day of competiton Sunday followed by a match against Hungary. They
will meet Luxembourg and Ukraine on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are really geared up for this championship. We hope to
finish better than what we did in Manchester but toppling
powerhouse China is not possible at the moment because they are in
a class of their own," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's best finish in the World Championships was third in
Dortmund, Germany in 1989 and Tianjian, China five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The official ceremony of the championships was held here
Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Accused of Massacring 76 Civilians  in Saripul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Afghan opposition Saturday
accused the ruling Taliban militia of massacring 76 civilians in
northern province of Saripul for their association with the
opposition the United Front.
</P>
<P>
"Following a recent attack on the towns of Sangchorak and
Gusfandy in Saripul, Taliban troops systematically killed and then
burnt local men after accusing them of siding with the United
Front," opposition commander Hussain Anwari said in a statement
released in northern Afghan province of Takhar.
</P>
<P>
"Initially they arrested 76 innocent locals accusing them of
maintaining ties with the United Front. Detainees were then
transported elsewhere where they were tortured for days on end,"
Anwari claimed.
</P>
<P>
Relatives in a search of nearby gorges discovered burnt corpses
of the 76 missing men, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The men were tortured to death and then dumped in these gorges.
These atrocities are a repeat of similar crimes committed by the
militia in Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamiyan last year," the opposition
commander said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari called upon the United Nations, the Organization of the
Islamic Conference and the "six plus two" group and human rights
organizations to investigate into these acts.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must continue its reassure on the
militia and render assistance to the innocent Afghan population,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's comment on the accusation was not available so far.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia, which control some 80 percent of the
territory of the war-torn country, have been combating the United
Front for the control of the rest areas during the past years.

<HEADLINE> China Powers Its Way Into Thomas Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China became the first team
to qualify for the Thomas Cup finals this May in Malaysia while
South Korea grabbed the ticket for the Uber Cup after a thrilling
five-set match against Indonesia here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a heavily lopsided match, the Chinese men whitewashed host
India 3-0 to register their fourth victory in a row in the asian
zone qualifier tournament which started here last Sunday and ends
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Even the Chinese reserve players were too strong for the
hopeless Indians, who had no guts to put up a fight and only sent
their benchers, as they wound up the match under two hours without
dropping a set.
</P>
<P>
" I'm quite satisfied with the result, as well as our players'
performance on the court," said China's chief coach Li Yongbo
afterwards. " We have achieved both of our two pre-set goals:
clinching a seat in the Thomas Cup finals and helping our young
players to gain experience in major world competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have achieved our goals for the early stages of
the Thomas Cup competition, we will start to prepare for the
finals and try our best to get a fine result in Malaysia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China will meet on Sunday the winner of the clash between South
Korea and Thailand in a much less important fixture which will
decide who was the table topper of the Thomas Cup qualifiers.
India will vie with the losers of the South Korean-Thai game for
the last qualifying berth.
</P>
<P>
In the Uber Cup women's team world championship Asian
qualifiers, South Korea toughed out a 3-2 marathon win over top-
seeded Indonesia to clinch the first Uber Cup finals ticket.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was forced to make an early clash with South Korea
after they lost to Hong Kong, China 2-3 yesterday and could only
qualify as the runner-ups.
</P>
<P>
In the five-and-a-half-hour encounter, it were the Indonesians
who took the initiative as Lidya Djaelawijay upset South Korea's
top singles player Kim Ji Hyun 13-12, 11-5 and Angelina Ellen kept
the momentum for Indonesia by beating Lee Kyung Won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
However, veteran player RA Kyung Min proved to be the life
savior for the South Korean side, who defeated Indonesian Marfuah
Yuli 11-9, 11-9 to give the country's doubles strenth chances to
demonstrate themselves in the later stages of the encounter.
</P>
<P>
And the South Korean duo of Lee Hyo Jung and Yim Kyung Jin won
the first doubles match, beating Indonesian pair Tantri Etty and
Tuwankotta Cynthia 15-13, 16-17 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
RA Kyung Min, playing again in the final doubles match along
with her long-time partner Chung Jae Hee, sealed the win for her
team by beating Eliza Nathanael and Lomban Deyana 15-8 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
With today's victory, the South Korean women's team has
advanced into the Malaysia finals and will play on Sunday the
winner of the Hong Kong-Japan clash for the number one place of
the qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the final chance for Indonesia, three-time Uber Cup
winners and runners-up of the 1998 women's team world championship,
to reach this year's Cup finals lies in its Sunday battle against
the losers between Hong Kong, China and Japan.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Attention to Employment of New College Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Personnel
today issued a circular calling on personnel departments at all
levels to pay particular attention to college students who will
graduate and be seeking employment this year.
</P>
<P>
A sound employment system should be established to help the
these graduates enter the talent market, the ministry said, adding
that continued efforts are needed to choose graduates to work in
the rural areas and grass-root public security units.
</P>
<P>
Selecting public servants from the graduates must strictly
abide to established regulations. An open, equal and competitive
atmosphere should be encouraged to refrain from "under-the-counter
deals."
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the government encourages high
performing graduates to devote themselves to key state-owned
enterprises, major scientific research institutes, and units
engaged in agriculture, water conservancy, energy, traffic,
telecommunications, and national defense.
</P>
<P>
China's western regions are required to provide more favorable
conditions so as to attract the graduates.
</P>
<P>
Personnel departments must open their working procedure,
simplify the examination and approval procedures, and raise work
efficiency. Those seeking to make profits under the name of
employing college graduates will be punished according to law.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UNCTAD Proposes Development Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Meeting of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) approved
here Saturday the Plan of Action with a call for making
globalization an effective instrument for development.
</P>
<P>
The 52-page Plan of Action outlined the development strategies
in an increasingly interdependent world and its engagement in
trade and development.
</P>
<P>
It said that globalization and interdependence have opened new
opportunities through increased trade liberalization and
advancement in technology for the growth of the world economy and
development.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community to reconsider and
elaborate development strategies and policies, taking into account
development's social, human and environmental dimensions so as to
help developing countries to prevent and overcome any negative
effect of economic and financial globalization.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for more bilateral and multilateral
efforts to safeguard vulnerable populations, especially during
time of economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action called on the international community to
secure the integration of developing countries into the
globalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
It said that an important challenge for the international
community is to secure the integration of developing countries,
including the structural weak and vulnerable and small economies
and countries in transition into globalizing world economy and to
reduce the risk of marginalization.
</P>
<P>
The document urged developing countries to enhance their macro-
economic policies at national, regional and international levels
in the face of globalization.
</P>
<P>
It called for mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of
international investment flows towards developing countries,
reversing the decline of aid from the big economies to the weak
ones and finding a last solution to debt problem of the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The plan also called for increasing Foreign Direct Investment (
FDI) to the developing countries, especially to the least
developed countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
Policies need to be developed by developing countries to
attract and benefit from FDI, while the international community
should support developing countries, especially LDCs in their
efforts to devise FDI strategies, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have introduced home country measures to promote
FDI flows to developing countries, and such measures should be
encouraged, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plan suggested that progress be made in
strengthening the solidity of domestic financial sectors as well
as macroeconomic performance.
</P>
<P>
It also called for improving the international financial system
with regard to transparency of flows from both the lending and
borrowing sides and prevention of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The plan said that imbalances and asymmetries existing in the
current multilateral trading system (MTS) need to be addressed
urgently to ensure that the MTS results in mutual benefit of all.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
rules contributes to a stable and predictable environment, though
it has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for
governments.
</P>
<P>
Trade policies and trade liberalization should be made more
consistent with overall developing objectives, it said.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in tariff levels and a simplification of tariff
structures would help raise developing countries' exports.
</P>
<P>
The plan said that barriers to entry in the sectors where
developing countries have the best chance of exporting need to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
Market access conditions for agricultural and industrial
products of exports interest to the LDCs should improved on as
broad and liberal a basis as possible, it said.
</P>
<P>
As many developing countries including a considerable number of
the LDCs are not WTO members, the accession process should be
facilitated and based on terms that take into account their stage
of development and the basic principles of special and
differential treatment, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action said debt problems are a serious obstacle to
the pursuit of economic and social development. And high debt-
serving burdens deprive many developing countries of the resources
for development.
</P>
<P>
It called on the G-7 countries to provide faster, deeper and
broader debt relief for the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Official development assistance remains a critical resource for
developing countries, the Plan of Action said, expressing concern
over the decline in the level of official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
The plan called on developing countries to make full use of
special and differential treatment (SDT) provisions to make them
better instrument for development.
</P>
<P>
Modernization and operationalization of SDT are needed to
adapt it to the changing international trading conditions and to
make it a better instrument for development, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
The widening gaps between developing countries' export
performance and international competitiveness call for stronger
emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural
production and investment conditions and reinforced international
support.
</P>
<P>
The special and differential measures in favor of the LDCs
should be implemented in full and as a matter of priority, the
plan stressed.
</P>
<P>
New trading opportunities created by improved market access to
developed countries within regional or multilateral agreements
need to be complemented by operational programs, technical
assistance and development financing, it said.
</P>
<P>
As for commodity trade, the plan said commodities continue to
provide an important source of foreign exchange earnings for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Commodity-based diversification offers a majority opportunity
for change in line with existing comparative advantages.
</P>
<P>
The important role played by commodity protocols in the socio-
economic development of certain developing countries should be
highlighted, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
A better understanding needs to be achieved of the various
channels for transfer of technology, such as FDI and trade, the
plan said.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the technological gap requires efforts on the part of
the developing countries to acquire and cultivate technology as
well as efforts on the part of developed countries to transfer
technology and know-how, it said.
</P>
<P>
New technologies such as information technology and electronic
commerce will revolutionize the way business is conducted and
could provide small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with
unprecedented access to global market.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they could also endanger the survival and
growth of some SMEs, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
All countries should establish an adequate regulatory framework
to provide effective protection of intellectual property, it added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Trade Meeting Ends in Bangkok with Adoption of 2 Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Meeting of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) ended here
Saturday after seven days' debate on a wide variety of topics
including globalization, trade and other development-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
It is the first world conference in history that has a
systematic and comprehensive discussion on globalization and
measures and initiatives to be taken by the international
community to ensure the successful integration of developing
countries into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero said that this conference has provided the opportunity
for a wide-ranging exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
"It has been instrumental in creating an atmosphere of greater
mutual understanding on the complexities of the globalization
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that UNCTAD's role in assisting the emergence of
more effective international economic institutions must be a
constructive one.
</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD must deploy for this purpose all of the three
instruments at its command, that is, research, policy advocacy and
technical assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai, who is also the current
president of UNCTAD, said that the integration of the developing
countries into the world economies can not be achieved by the
World Trade Organization (WTO) alone, all international sectors
concerned should make joint effort in this regard.
</P>
<P>
As UNCTAD X president and next director general of the WTO, he
pledged to play an active role in bringing the developing and
developed countries to prepare a better agenda for the future
world trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Two key documents, the Bangkok Declaration and the Plan of
Action, were adopted at the conference to clarify the consensus
reached by member states at the conference and to serve as the
guideline of UNCTAD for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action called for reduction of debt of the least
developed countries (LDCs), increase of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) flows to developing countries, more Official Development
Assistance (ODA) to developing countries and expansion of market
access.
</P>
<P>
The plan also urged the reduction of subsidizes for exports of
agricultural products, eradication of trade barriers, the increase
of technology transfer from developed countries to developing
countries, the improvement of international financial order and
the enhancement of regional co-operations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus,
World Bank President James Wolfensohn and Director-General of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Michael Moore called for more
efforts to bring about a new round of world trade negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The first summit between U.N. chief and leaders of the
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and ministerial meeting of the LDCs were also held parallel to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number countries had signed their bilateral
investment agreements during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the first global economic gathering in the new
millennium, the conference was inaugurated on February 12 with the
participation of more than 2,000 delegates.
</P>
<P>
The next session of UNCTAD will be held in the Dominican
Republic in 2004.

<HEADLINE> India Faces Huge Fiscal Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- India faces a fiscal deficit
of 520 billion rupees (12.09 billion U.S. dollars) and the "
expenditure has seeped out of the hands of the government,"
Minister of State of Finance V. Dhananjaya Kumar said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, he said that the budget this time would be a "
harsh one." While there was an assured income of 1,720 billion
rupees (40 billion dollars), there was an expenditure of 2,130
billion rupees (49.53 billion dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was contemplating imposition of Service Tax to
make up for the huge deficit, he said. However, there was stiff
opposition from small vendors for the imposition of this tax, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that increasing taxes would not help much, he said.
Instead, the quantum of revenue had to be increased by improving
the turnover, he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reaffirms Stand on Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that his government remains steadfast
in its decision to exclude any discussions about secession issues
on the negotiation table with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Estrada said that any talks
about secessionism should be ruled out in the agenda of the peace
talks between the government and the MILF, which has been fighting
for an independent state in Mindanao during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he is giving the peace process up to June
this year to come up with substantial results.
</P>
<P>
"There's only one country, one government and one constitution.
I told them that I am giving them up to June (to come up with a
peace agreement with the government)," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to reports that MILF Chairman Hashim
Salamat wants to meet him possibly to discuss ways of jump-
starting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that formal peace negotiations with the
MILF will yield positive results despite the on-going fighting in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the past four days, government troops and MILF rebels
have been engaged in a fierce fighting in the Southern Philippines,
and 89 people have been killed and dozens of others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Iran Agrees to Ease Malaysian's Visa Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran has agreed to ease
visa procedures for Malaysians travelling to the Islamic republic
to further boost trade and cultural relations, its Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysians coming into Iran would get their visas
immediately upon arrival at the port of entry.
</P>
<P>
"To promote more visits and more contacts we have decided to
waive the visa requirements reciprocally with the Malaysian
government," Kamal said at a press conference at the Islamic Art
Museum to mark the end of his three-day official visit here.
</P>
<P>
He said visitors would not longer need to apply for a visa
before going to Iran as the two-week visa would be issued at the
port of entry for Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
There were plans to extend the duration of the visa pending
further discussions between the two governments, Kamal said,
adding the new visa regulations would be implemented next month.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said Iran would also continue to improve bilateral
relations as well as economic, cultural and political cooperation
with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The two governments have tried their best to remove any "
obstacles" to facilitate better business contacts that would
improve more investment and trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kamal held wide-ranging talks with his
Malaysian counterpart Syed Hamid Albar on the gas and oil industry
as well as palm oil exports to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kamal arrived here Thursday for a three-day official visit at
the head of a high-level delegation which includes officials from

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Housing Problem Remains Severe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The housing problem remains a
crucial one as support from donors towards the resettlement and
re-integration efforts declines, according to a report by Rwanda
News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Joint Re-integration Program Unit (JRPU) survey of housing
needs shows almost 150,000 families still live in plastic
sheeting, 59,000 in severely damaged houses and 47 000 in houses
belonging to others.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that most non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) are phasing out re-integration activities. The donors argue
that re-integration is outside UNHCR's (United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees) mandate and should therefore be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the housing problem is further worsened by the fact
that about 100,000 families were displaced by the violence in the
north-west and were resettled in villages.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank country assistance progress report,
" the genocide created victims and vulnerable groups, who require
housing assistance."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the urban areas have a severe housing shortage,
which makes it difficult to resolve the double occupancy problem.
</P>
<P>
All of These will create a critical gap in the recovery of
Rwanda, and will undermine other efforts to reduce poverty and
achieve national reconciliation and peace, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President in Beirut for Talks on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
on Saturday held talks with his visiting Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak on containing the military escalation in south Lebanon and
removing obstacles to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mubarak offered to help the Lebanese
government reconstruct the infrastructures, including power
stations, damaged by the latest Israeli air raids on Lebanon,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Minister of Telecommunications Issam Naaman
told reporters that Mubarak's previously unannounced visit
constituted a "frank condemnation" of Israeli threat of further
airstrikes and "clear support" for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting came amid surging tensions in south Lebanon
after Israeli warplanes last week launched a series of airstrikes
on Lebanon's civilian targets that destroyed three power stations
and wounded at least 15 Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, along with other Arab states, strongly condemned the air
raids and warned that the military conflicts would have grave
consequences on the Mideast peace process which is now in a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had threatened to carry out
more reprisal strikes on south Lebanon if Hezbollah guerrillas
continued their attacks on Israeli targets, which led to the death
of seven Israeli soldiers since January 25.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived here after holding talks in Cairo with Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh earlier in the day which focused
on breaking the stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> World Trading System Should Benefit All: UNCTAD Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Imbalances and asymmetries
existing in the current multilateral trading system (MTS) need to
be addressed urgently so as to ensure that the MTS results in
mutual benefits for all countries, said a key document approved by
the U.N. trade conference held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) adopted the Plan of Action, which
serves as the guideline of the U.N. trade body's activities in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the trade issue, the plan said that the multilateral
framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules contributes
to a stable and predictable environment, though it has in certain
cases narrowed the range of policy options for governments.
</P>
<P>
"Trade policies and trade liberalization should be made more
consistent with overall development objectives," it said.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, ways and means need to be sought to
ensure that trade makes a more decisive contribution to
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Improved policy coherence in developed countries is also needed
both domestically and internationally. A reduction in tariff
levels and a simplification of tariff structures would help raise
exports of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The plan also pointed out that anti-dumping measures and
countervailing duties are used by many countries in sectors where
exporters from developing countries are competitive.
</P>
<P>
It also said that many developing countries face problems when
trying to diversify into higher value-added and manufactured
exports with more dynamic demand prospects.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, barriers to entry in those sectors where they should
have the best change of exporting need to be addressed, the plan
said.
</P>
<P>
Market access conditions for agricultural and industrial
products of exports interest to the least developed countries (
LDCs) should be improved on as broad and liberal a basis as
possible, it said.
</P>
<P>
As many developing countries including a considerable number of
LDCs are not WTO members, the accession process should be
facilitated and based on terms that take into account their stage
of development and the basic principles of special and
differential treatment, the plan said.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Document Offers Trade Measures Benefiting  Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries should
make full use of special and differential treatment (SDT)
provisions to make them better instrument for development, said a
key document adopted here Saturday by a U.N. trade conference.
</P>
<P>
Modernization and operationalization of SDT are needed to adapt
it to changing international trading conditions and to make it a
better instrument for development, delegates attending the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) agreed.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action, which is one of the two key documents
adopted by UNCTAD Saturday, said that widening gaps between
developing country export performance and international
competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action
in respect of structural production and investment conditions and
reinforced international support.
</P>
<P>
The special and differential measures in favor of the least
developed countries (LDCs) should be implemented in full and as a
matter of priority, the document stressed.
</P>
<P>
"New trading opportunities created by improved market access
to developed countries within regional or multilateral agreements
need to be complemented by operational programs, technical
assistance and development financing," the document said.
</P>
<P>
As for commodity trade, the Plan of Action said commodities
continue to provide an important source of foreign exchange
earnings for developing countries. Commodity-based diversification
offers a major opportunity for change in line with existing
comparative advantages.
</P>
<P>
The important role played by commodity protocols in the socio-
economic development of certain developing countries should be
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The existing mechanisms for helping to stabilize commodity
export earnings should be improved so as to respond to the real
concerns of developing country producers, it said.
</P>
<P>
On issues of trade competition, the document said that in order
to enable those countries to better address and discipline anti-
competitive practices, it is essential for countries which have
national competition rules in place to back them up with an
appropriate system of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The document also pointed out that strengthening developing
countries' domestic service capacity through technical and
financial assistance,is of utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries' institutional, financial and human
capacities and regulatory framework in the service sector should
be further enhanced to enable them to engage effectively in
international trade in services," it said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need assistance in upgrading and
developing their services infrastructure and in securing reliable
information on the extent of services trade and on market access
and barriers to service trade.
</P>
<P>
A more transparent and sounder regulatory framework would also
assist developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It also said that economic cooperation among developing
countries and regional and subregional economic integration retain
their full relevance.
</P>
<P>
Subregional and regional integration offers a multisectoral
framework of cooperation which combines the tools of trade
expansion with cooperation in respect of investment, services,
transport,customs facilitation and other areas which mutually
enhance each other's effectiveness, the document said.

<HEADLINE> Better Understanding Needed for Technological  Transfer: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A better understanding needs
to be achieved of the various channels for transfer of technology,
such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and trade, the Plan of
Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the technology gap requires efforts on the part of the
developing countries to acquire and cultivate technology as well
as efforts on the part of developed countries to transfer
technology and know-how, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action said that new technologies such as
information technology and electronic commerce will revolutionize
the way business is conducted and could provide small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) with unprecedented access to global
market.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, they could also endanger the survival and
growth of some SMEs, it said.
</P>
<P>
All countries should establish an adequate regulatory framework
to provide effective protection of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
The document also pointed out that technological development is
important for the integration and participation of developing
countries in the international trading system.
</P>
<P>
The plan also said that an exchange of best practices and the
provision of technical and financial assistance to countries
seeking to improve their technological capabilities is needed.

<HEADLINE> Steel Giant to Undergo Upgrading with Heavy Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA (Sichuan), February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Panzhihua Iron
and Steel (Group) Company (PISG), China's largest producer of rail
and vanadium and titanium steel, will spend a total of seven
billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) on technological upgrading
and improving of its product mix in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
PISG President Hong Jibi told Xinhua today that the program
will help his company increase its profits by about 55 times that
of 1999, from 20 million yuan to 1.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year the company had a sales revenue of 10 billion yuan,
and when the program is accomplished, the figure will become 14
billion yuan, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
The company is situated in Panzhihua City of Sichuan Province,
southwest China, where proven vanadium and titanium reserves top
13 million tons, accounting for one-fifth of the world's total.
Its vanadium products have secured 20 percent of the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that the implementation of the government's strategy
to develop the western region of China has provided valuable
chances for the development of PISG.
</P>
<P>
Hong did not disclose the source of the fund but said the money
will mainly be used to upgrade the company's vanadium and titanium
production lines and related technology and to improve pollution-
control facilities, with an aim to turn the company into the
second largest vanadium producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Hong said, the company plans to recruit an
increasing number of talent professionals from both home and
abroad, adding that a post-doctoral research center will be
established for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Woes British Investment in Ilisu Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- As the British government was
pondering whether to finance a controversial dam project in Turkey,
leading Turkish officials rushed to London to woo British
investments, Turkish Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ilisu Dam project, currently undertaken by an international
consortium to build a dam across the Tigris River, is an integral
part of Turkey's ambitious development blueprint Southeastern
Anatolia Project (GAP).
</P>
<P>
However, the Arab League and Turkey's neighbour Syria opposed
the construction of the dam for fears that Turkey, as the upstream
country of the Tigris, may use water as a weapon against water-
sparse downstream countries in case of tensions.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials in charge of the GAP said that Turkey is only
interested in economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no hostile intentions towards the downstream
countries. We regard water as a source of cooperation and
solidarity," one official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The British government gave green light to the dam project on
December 21, 1999 when Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
Stephen Byers announced that the government was "minded" to approve
the project, which meant that Britain was in favor of giving 200
million pounds (320 million U.S. dollars) in export credit to its
bidding company Balfour &AMP; Beatty for the time being.
</P>
<P>
However, the approval was made with four stipulations, namely,
guaranteeing water usage for Syria and Iraq, a resettlement of
local people, protecting local archaeological heritage and
provisions for water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials tried to convince the British government that
they had done well in all these fields, said the report.

Bangkok, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Plan of Action approved
Saturday by the 10th Meeting of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) called for increasing foreign
direct investment (FDI) flows to the developing countries.
</P>

increased ,the least developed countries (LDCs) share in total FDI
flow stood at less than one-half of one percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this situation, the PLan of Action said, policies
need to be developed by developing countries to attract and
benefit from FDI,while the international community should support
developing countries,especially the LDCs, in their efforts to
devise FDI strategies.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have introduced home country measures to promote
FDI flows to developing countries, and such measures should be
encouraged, it said
</P>
<P>
The developing countries should strive to create a favourable
and enabling investment climate to attract FDI flows, it said .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Action Plan suggested that progress should be
made in strengthening the solidity of domestic financial sectors
as well as macroeconomic performance .
</P>

gets underway in the coming days, Turkish Daily News reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on "Turkey's structural transformation
and foreign capital" held in Istanbul on Friday, Onal said that "
Telecom, mobile phone company GSM and energy sell-offs will follow
one another."
</P>
<P>
He commented that first month results of the government's
economic program were better than expected, easing concerns that
the program might fail.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that no one could alter the government's
ultimate goal of reducing inflation.
</P>
<P>
New foreign investment in Turkey has stayed below 1 billion U.S.
dollars annually in recent years, out of a permitted amount of 1.5
to 2 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Onal anticipated that combined with structural
transformation, Turkey's dynamism and potential would make it a
significant center of gravity for foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He said a major leap in foreign capital flows was expected once
the government's determination over restructuring was clearly
understood, and early positive results of the disinflation program
were revealed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been under way to massive privatization of its
economy and pull down its chronic runaway inflation in order to
integrate with the European Union, which has accepted its candidacy
for a full EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls For United Stand on Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada called here Saturday on all members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to forge a united stand and vision
in fighting poverty through rural development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the one-day ASEAN Ministers' Meeting on Rural
Development and Poverty Eradication here, Estrada said that ASEAN'
s task at hand is to look for inter-relationships, the underlying
principles and the mechanisms in place that can help propel rural
economies towards sustainability.
</P>
<P>
"We in ASEAN must first agree to help ourselves because our own
actions will determine our future, not the actions of people
outside the region. I trust that with better understanding and a
unity of purpose, the task we set out to achieve will be within
immediate reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we learn to work with one another with trust and
confidence, the better chances we will have for our countries and
our governments to succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the regional cooperation efforts of countries
presented at the meeting confirms the ASEAN commitment to pursue
rural development towards poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the economic recovery of ASEAN countries
from a financial crisis should provide member countries to look
ahead and reassess their vision for their countrymen and the ASEAN
region.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, each member country presented its program
concerning poverty alleviation in rural areas, where the incidence
of poverty is higher compared to the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in line with the ASEAN Plan of Action on
Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation that was developed at
the height of the financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
In its Plan of Action, the U.N. trade body said that
globalization and interdependence have opened new opportunities,
through increased trade liberalization and advancement in
technology, for the growth of the world economy and development.
</P>
<P>
"With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the
early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based
on global market forces would be more rapid, more sustainable and
more widely shared than in the past," the document said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the record has been "mixed", citing that
while some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and
benefited from globalization, many developing countries,
especially the least developed countries, have not received
significant or continuous increase in their gross domestic
products per capita over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action urges the international community to
reconsider and elaborate development strategies and policies,
taking into account development's social, human and environmental
dimensions, so as to help developing countries to prevent and
overcome any negative effect of economic and financial
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The document also calls for more bilateral and multilateral
efforts to safeguard vulnerable populations, especially during
time of economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denounces Rubin's Statement on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
late Friday  denounced U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin's Thursday statement on the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the ministry called Rubin's remarks "
absolutely inadmissible both in essence and in form, and
resembling the improper NATO statements in the period of
aggression against Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"It is puzzling that the American State Department spokesman
again keeps silent about the facts of numerous atrocities by the
Chechen terrorists and bandits. Their methods are borne out by ("
Chechen President") Aslan Maskhadov's statement that 'any Russian
who falls in our hands should be stabbed and trampled upon with
pleasure,'" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Rubin in his comments at a briefing Thursday
was aiding "information terrorism" by speculating about "credible
reports of the killings of civilians and other violations."
</P>
<P>
The quarrel came amid new reports from human rights groups that
Russian forces in Chechnya beat, "raped and summarily executed
civilians suspected of aiding the separatists."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Moscow should investigate the reports, a move it has
promised to make, and accused Russia of denying reporters access
to the war zone, which it does, though it says it is in the
interests of their safety.
</P>
<P>
Russia was also angered by a meeting between a Chechen official
and the U.S. State Department this week, which Rubin said was to
gather information on the human rights situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry statement noted that Rubin, "
operating with clearly tendentious data and even outright bias
supplied by the terrorists themselves, talks about false reports
of the murders of civilians and other violations of behavioral
norms by Russian servicemen. In fact, this amounts to assistance
in information terrorism."
</P>
<P>
It accused Washington of being little interested in unbiased
information about the situation in Chechnya, describing the
western reports of the mass killings and graves of civilians as "a
complete lie."
</P>
<P>
"It is hardly proper that those who harp on the suffering of
the Chechens are also the ones who dropped hundreds of thousands
of bombs and missiles on the residents of Yugoslavia, continue
bombing innocent children, women, and old men in Iraq, have not
spoken a word in support of the 700,000 Russian citizens who were
forced to flee Chechnya out of terror, and tacitly gaze at the
suffering of 200,000 Serb refugees from Kosovo," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
It said the real facts that scores of Russian and foreign
journalists are working in Chechnya and many international
organizations' delegations and representatives have visited the
region recently "can be ignored only by cynically applying double
standards."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting between the
Philippine government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) in Maguindanao, Mindanao, entered its fourth day Saturday,
and 89 people have been killed so far.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, Maj. Gen. Gregorio Camiling said
that in the latest fighting which erupted in Ampatuan Friday
morning, two more MILF rebels were killed and 10 government
soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Ampatuan has become a war-torn town since the MILF launched a
major offensive four days ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The general said that so far 87 MILF members and two government
soldiers were killed while 37 government soldiers wounded in the
action.
</P>
<P>
The Army has captured Camp Omar, the second largest MILF camp,
he said.

harassments, particularly probing attacks on their army
detachments.But government troops launched a counter-offensive
Tuesday to stop MILF harassments.
</P>

Last year, the 12,000-strong MILF also launched two major
offensives in January and September. Both of them were suppressed
by government troops, forcing the MILF to sign a ceasefire
agreement.

NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of Kenya will
receive lower rainfall than normal level during the March-May long
rains season, Kenyan Meteorological Department has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Saturday quoted Director of the

poor distribution of rainfall in most parts of the east African

seeds and plant at the right time.

Rainfall deficit in the last three seasons led to crop failure
and lack of pasture for livestock in eastern and northern Kenya,
where 2.7 million people are still threatened by famine, the

<HEADLINE> Power Station in Southwest China Ready to Send Electricity to East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, Sichuan, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan
Hydroelectric Power Station in southwest China's Sichuan Province
has met the requirements for sending its electricity to east China
provinces, an official with the power station said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Liu Junfeng, general manager of
the Ertan Hydroelectric Development Company, said the power
station will soon start to carry out a national plan for sending
electricity to east China.
</P>
<P>
Although the Ertan power station supplies electricity for both
Sichuan Province and the Chongqing Municipality, about 60 percent
of the electricity it generates is left unused, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Unused electricity is expected to reach 18 billion kilowatt
hours by the end of this year," he said, "We'd like to transmit
our electricity to the more developed east China provinces whose
demand of it is increasing day by day."
</P>
<P>
The transmission plan is part of China's strategy to develop
the resource-rich but underdeveloped western areas, aiming to help
promote west China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the transmission wire of the Ertan power station has
reached downtown Chongqing while the wire of the Three Gorges
Project has reached Changshou County, some 40 kilometers from
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
If these two wires are connected, electricity in the Ertan
power station and other parts of southwest China will be sent to
central and east China provinces before the three Gorges Project
generates electricity in 2003, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Power Station was completed at the end of last year.
It is the second largest hydro-power project in China following
the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
It has six generators with a total installed generating
capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Ertan power station is located on the Yalong River, a tributary
of the Yangtze River and is 46 kilometers away from Panzhihua, a
new industrial city in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to build 10 power stations on the Jinsha
River and Dadu River as well as the Yalong river, three major
tributaries of the Yangtze River.

which three agreements were inked on tourism cooperation, air
services and establishment of sister cities between Bagan (Myanmar)
and Siemreap (Cambodia).

<HEADLINE> Montreal Meeting Agrees Anti-doping Recommendations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from about 30
countries and regions reached a consensus Friday on anti-doping
recommendations at the close of a two-day workshop.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal meeting of the International Intergovernmental
Consultative Group recommends that professional athletes undergo
the same random drug testing as amateurs if they are to compete at
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations include labelling food supplements and
other products that may contain banned substances, exchanging
information on anti-doping programs and technologies, as well as
implementing an equity policy regarding the sexes and disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are yet to be studied by the new World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) at a board meeting slated for March 22 in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The agency expects a role as overseer of dope-testing in place
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal meeting also saw representatives select its half
of membership for the drug agency board. The other half of the
board will be represented by the International Olympic Committee,
sports federations and athletes.
</P>
<P>
Robert Crick, head of the Australian Sport and Tourism Division,
said that Friday's agreement is a key to ensuring drug-free sports.
</P>
<P>
"We have a vested interest as the next host of the Olympics in
trying to ensure that Sydney is, if not drug-free, then at least
the drug cheats will be caught," Crick said at the conclusion of
the Montreal meeting.

A big crowd lined the Viaduct Basin, cheering and sounding
hooters as the black boat from Team New Zealand and then Prada's
steel grey Luna Rosa pulled away from their docks.

Sunday the first race of the 30th Cup match as winds on the inner
Hauriki Gulf blew less than five knots.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the tournament, the two teams are scheduled
to have nine races, with each race worth one point, and the first

<HEADLINE> Rebuilding of Famous Ancient Pavilion Near Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction of Guanque (
Stork) Pavilion in Yongji City of north China's Shanxi Province
is near completion after more than two years' efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the rebuilt pavilion will be ready
for sightseeing before October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Guanque Pavilion, situated near the Yellow River in the old
town of Puzhou, Yongji City, is called one of China's four major
ancient pavilions. The other three are Yellow Crane Pavilion in
Wuhan City of Hubei Province, Yueyang Pavilion in Yueyang City of
Hunan Province and Tengwang Pavilion in Jiujiang City of Jiangxi
Province. All the pavilions were built on riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
Guanque Pavilion was first constructed in Northern Zhou (557-
581 A.D.) and was destroyed during warfare in 1272 of early Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368). It became famous because of a poem entitled "
Climb Guanque Pavilion" by Poet Wang Zhihuan of Tang Dynasty ((618-
907).
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, Yongji City Government amassed 35.5 million
yuan to reconstruct the old pavilion. Reconstruction of the main
building is finished.
</P>
<P>
With a height of 73.9 m and a total floor space of 8,222 sq m,
the main building has eight floors and takes the style of Tang
Dynasty architecture. Some modern construction and building
materials are used in the reconstruction endeavor, said the local
sources.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Down in Singapore Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Crime declined by 21 percent
in Singapore in 1999 with all the nine index crimes except rape
and murder coming down, according to an annual crime situation
report released Saturday by the Singapore Police Force (SPF).
</P>
<P>
The total number of seizable offenses dropped to 39,143 cases
from 49,384 cases recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared to 1998, immigration offenses, rioting, and property
offenses such as robbery, snatch theft, motor vehicles theft fell
significantly by between 22 to 33 percent while offenses such as
cheating, housebreaking and outraging of modesty also registered a
dip.
</P>
<P>
Theft-related offenses, which accounted for 52 percent of the
total seizable offenses, declined to 20,249 cases in 1999 compared
with 27,807 cases in 1998, a drop of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, rape and murder cases in 1999 increased to 124 and 38
cases respectively, up 19 and 3 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Home Minister Wong Kan Seng said the fall was one of
the largest decreases since records of statistics were kept in
1955.
</P>
<P>
The police attributed the downtrend in crime to successful
enforcement operations by the SPF, the community policing system
and improved cooperation between the police and the public.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Meet on Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from the 10-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gathered in Manila
Saturday for a one-day meeting to discuss poverty alleviation in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Second ASEAN Ministers Meeting on Rural Development and
Poverty Eradication was being held in line with the ASEAN Plan of
Action on Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation that was
developed at the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1997,
conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said the meeting will tackle poverty reduction plans of
the member nations so that the best practices and models of
poverty reduction through sustainable rural development can be
applied.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the sources said, each member country will
present its program concerning poverty alleviation in rural areas,
where the incidence of poverty is higher compared to the urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Secretary of Agrarian Reform Horacio Morales, who
was chairing the meeting, said the ASEAN members must primarily
address the regional financial crisis and the social dislocations
that resulted at the regional level through concerted, coordinated
and integrated action.
</P>
<P>
He called on member nations to make "spending for safety nets"
a permanent fixture of the national budget, and to further pool
these allocations into a "regional safety fund."
</P>
<P>
"As our concern in this meeting is rural development and
poverty eradication, this means restructuring our national budgets
and moving major allocations in the direction of social
development initiatives that are focused in the rural areas," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Labels Mitrovica As "Most Dangerous Place in Europe" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Richard Holbrooke Friday expressed his concern over
the developments in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, saying it is "
the most dangerous place in Europe."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after talks with Portuguese Prime
Minister Jaime Gama, Holbrooke condemned recent violent waves that
had led to the aggravation of security in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, and
the assault against French peacekeeping troops there.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the month, ethnic Albanian terrorists and
separatists repeatedly attacked Serbs in Mitrovica and clashed
with French peacekeepers last week, killing at least 12 Serbs and
injuring many others. The situation in the northern Kosovo city
has grown tense.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of East Timor, Holbrooke, who arrived here
Thursday for a four-day visit to Portugal, promised that the
United States will continue to support the former Portuguese
colony for reconstruction and implementation of peace.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Indonesia to bring to justice those responsible
for last year's bloody violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the U.S. ambassador exchanged views with
Gama on issues such as the situation in the Middle East and Africa,
as well as European-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Technological Revolutions to Increase Globalization, Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Technological revolutions
will keep globalization on track and the trend will make the world
increasingly competitive, a U.S. economy policy expert said Friday
at a science meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The increased economic integration is driven by three
fundamental technological revolutions: one in the transportation
sector, one in the communication sector, and one in the
information sector -- in the latter case driven by the computer
revolution, said G. Edward Schuh at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from
February 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
These technological revolutions have dramatically lowered the
costs of transportation, communication, and information services,
and thus have dramatically increased the scope of markets, and the
benefits from international trade and capital market interactions.
</P>
<P>
"As society rarely ever give up the benefits of cost-reducing
technological breakthroughs of this scale, there is little
likelihood that we will see a turning back on the process of
globalization," said Schuh, Reagents Professor in International
Economy Policy at University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
However, the technological revolutions have hardly reached the
low-income developing countries, where some 80 percent of the
world's population live.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, what the future holds is an increasingly well
integrated global economy as the revolutions reach those countries,
and an increasingly complex and competitive world," Schuh said in
a topical lecture titled "Competitive, Research, and Global
Development: How Will The United States Compete?"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the continued expansion of globalization, driven by
the geographic spread of the technological revolutions, will bring
about new sources of competition as additional nations adopt the
new technology and continue their economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
To contend with an increasingly complex set of challenges as
the United States seeks to find its way in the international
economy, Schuh said, the country should invest in those activities
that help to make its economy more competitive, such as education
and training, improved health and nutrition, new production
technology, and efficient institutional arrangements -- those
important forms of human capital.
</P>
<P>
Schuh emphasized that an increasingly globalized and
competitive world need not result in abandonment of the poor and
disadvantaged, as many seem to think.
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, he said, a stronger knowledge base, and
investments in human capital, are the key to alleviating poverty,
not only here in the U.S. but in other countries.

Alstom hopes to further contribute its experience and expertise
to the modernization of the urban transport system in China
through close cooperation with its local partners, said Pierre
Lenfant, president of Alstom China.
</P>
<P>
Alstom's basic strategy in China is to be present locally and
industrially, which means the development of its local staff and
the creation of industrial presence in China in either joint
ventures or cooperation with its partners.
</P>
<P>
"We are here in China for the long run," Lenfant was quoted as
saying.
</P>

BELGRADE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Serbia Lifted Friday a ban on
using the cyanide-polluted water and consuming fish from the
Danube and Tisa, according to a bulletin released on the same day
from the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said that test results from the Yugoslav
republic's hydrological department showed that the contents of
cyanide and heavy metals in the water samples of the two rivers
are far below the prescribed standard.
</P>
<P>
Serbia banned its citizens from any use of the water and
consumption of fish from the Danube Monday, one day after the
cyanide-polluted water flowed via Hungary into Yugoslavia from a
Romanian gold mine that spilled two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The toxic water has polluted the downstream of Belgrade and
killed hundreds of tons of fish.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 18 (Xinhua ) -- Exports to Canada from
South America increased by 3.1 percent in 1999 because of the
price hike of raw materials, while sales of Central America,
Mexico and the Caribbean countries to Canada rose by 19 percent,
the Canadian Statistics Agency received here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 billion U.S. dollars of goods sold by Latin
American and the Caribbean countries to Canada in 1999 were 12.4
percent more than that in 1998, said the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to a price increase in oil and mineral
products.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian exports to Latin America and the Caribbean during
the same period amounted to about 3.55 billion dollars, a 13.1
percent drop over 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's foreign trade
volume contracted by 18 percent in 1999 with exports dropping by
five percent and imports by 28 percent, said the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a series of measures taken by the government, balance
of payments gained moderate improvement, with the surplus hitting
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's trade volume with countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) shrank by 35 percent. Its exports to and
imports from those countries dropped by 38 percent and 35 percent
respectively, with the amount of deficits reaching 800 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its two-way transactions with CIS countries also
shrank in terms of proportion in the country's overall trade
volume as compared with 1998, with imports falling by 15 percent
and exports by four percent.
</P>
<P>
Its trade with non-CIS nations declined by three percent with
exports growing by 20 percent and imports falling by 23 percent.

since 1998 under the adverse impact of the financial crises in
Southeast Asia and Russia. Its deficits rose sharply to 1.7
billion dollars in 1998.

<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a national

response to the alarming number of fake documents showing up in
employers' personnel files.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Academic Degrees Committee of the State
Council made the announcement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the development of China's higher education
system, over 400,000 students had received masters' degrees and
about 40,000 had earned Ph. D.s by the end of 1998. Every year
about 400,000 students receive bachelors degrees.

<P>
The degree authentication plan involves verifying diploma
certificates and school transcripts so that employers can weed out
unqualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
He said the center will cooperate with universities and
research organizations in setting up an information network
through which it can relay authentication reports to employers and
provide on-line support.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Chinese Taipei in Thomas Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China beat Chinese Taipei 5-
0 with an all-win record in their group and marched into the final
stage of the Thomas Cup Men's Team Badminton World Championship
Asian Zone Qualifier here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Today's match, however, was of little significance for both
sides, as China, following two consecutive victories against
Thailand and Hong Kong, China, had been assured to qualify as
group winner on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, losing their first two matches to Hong Kong,
China and Thailand, had lost all hope to reach the Thomas Cup
finals due in May in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
As in the first two matches, China's head coach Li Yongbo sent
in three young singles players Chen Hong, Ji Xinpeng and Xia
Xuanze, whom Li described as "being in desperate need of team
match experience", and continued to rest the team's top player,
world number two Sun Jun.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qiqiu, a young Chinese doubles player also with no team
play experience, was given his first chance to play on the court
of the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium as Li used him to replace
veteran doubles player Liu Yong this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chen, along with his partner Yu Jinhao, didn't fail Li's trust
and beat their Chinese Taipei opponents 2-0, 15-1 in the second
game. China also took the four other matches easily, all at a game
score of 2-0.
</P>
<P>
In a decisive clash in the same group, Thailand edged Hong Kong,
China 3-2 to clinch the remaining qualifying berth. The match was
much more even-odded, but Hong Kong's fate was decided as their
first singles player Tam Kai Chuen lost 1-2 to his Thai opponent
Polsana Boonsak in a fierce opening match.
</P>
<P>
Boonsak, who beat China's world No. 11 Chen Hong 2-0 on
Wednesday, won over Tam although Tam made a miraculous comeback
from 11-14 to win by 17-15 in the first game.
</P>
<P>
In the other group of the Thomas Cup qualifier, India beat
Singapore 5-0 to qualify as group number two, while Japan, losing
to South Korea (1-3 by press time) this afternoon, was denied a
step further in the qualifier.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Japan's fate was early decided as they lost to India 1-
4 in the opening match of the group. South Korea, also with an all-
win record in group matches, qualified as group number one.
</P>
<P>
In the final group matches of the Uber Cup women's team
qualifier today, Indonesia won a significant 4-1 victory against
Chinese Taipei to avoid the fate of being disqualified in the
early stage of the Uber Cup.
</P>
<P>
All coaches and players of Indonesia, three-time Uber Cup
winner and runner up of last women's team world championship which
suffered a shameful 2-3 defeat to Hong Kong on Thursday, jumped up
in great joy and clapped their hands in celebrations as the team's
second doubles players Tantri Etty and Tuwankotta Cynthia won a
hard victory against Chinese Taipei's Chien Hsui Lin and Cheng Wen
Hsing and put Indonesia at a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which had been secured the group number one position
after their surprise victory against Indonesia, sent in their
reserve players to play against India and lost 1-4.
</P>
<P>
The team's top two players, Ling Wan Ting and Wang Cheng, who
took all the three winning points for Hong Kong on Thursday, didn'
t appear on the court at all.
</P>
<P>
In the other Uber Cup qualifier group, South Korea and Japan,
and Thailand and Singapore played two much less important matches.
South Korea beat Japan 3-2 while both teams, with two previous
wins, qualified as group winner and runner-up. Thailand beat
Singapore 4-1 to find some consolation for itself.
</P>
<P>
Starting Saturday, teams that have qualified will have cross
matches to make their final dashes to the Cup finals in Malaysia,
while only three of the four teams in the men's and women's
competition will be granted admission.
</P>
<P>
The lineup for matches on Saturday is as follows: Thomas Cup:
China vs India at 11 a.m. and South Korea vs Thailand at 3 p.m.
Uber Cup: South Korea vs Indonesia at 11 a.m. and Hong Kong, China
vs Japan at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Winners of each match will directly get the ticket to the Cup
finals while losers will fight each other on Sunday for the only
remaining seat.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that faced with strong contenders like South
Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, the Indonesian women's team, young and
quite inexperienced, might still have a long way to go before they
can reach the Uber Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> Robson Agrees Newcastle United Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Robson is to stay on as
manager of English premier league soccer club Newcastle United for
at least another 12 months after agreeing a new rolling contract.
</P>
<P>
The former England boss celebrated his 67th birthday by
securing the new deal, which comes less than a week after his side
's stunning 3-0 victory over Premiership champions Manchester
United.
</P>
<P>
Durham-born Robson took the St James' Park hotseat last
September following the resignation of Ruud Gullit.
</P>
<P>
He was initially appointed until the end of this season, with
concerns raised in the media about his age and ability to cope
with the pressure of one of the most high-profile jobs in English
football.
</P>
<P>
But Robson has proved a huge success with the Magpies, leading
them away from relegation and into the quarter-finals of the FA
Cup.
</P>
<P>
And he shrugged off suggestions that, after turning 67, he
might prefer the quiet life.
</P>
<P>
"I had retirement in the palm of my hand and threw it all up in
the air to come here," Robson said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm enjoying working at a difficult end, but I'll only measure
my enjoyment when I know that we are in a far more healthy and
satisfactory state," he said.
</P>
<P>
A club statement said: "The board are delighted with what Bobby
has achieved in such a short period and look forward to working
with him to bring us the success that the Newcastle supporters
deserve."

<HEADLINE> British Sports Minister Attacks Snarling" Footballers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- British Sports Minister Kate
Hoey said on Friday that football authorities and club should
consider bigger penalties for players who misbehave.
</P>
<P>
Hoey said football is being blighted by an "angry, snarling"
approach - and the Football Association and soccer clubs must act
to bring about a change.
</P>
<P>
She was reacting to a week which saw fights in matches at Leeds
and Chelsea and Leicester City players being sent home from a trip
to Spain following incidents at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Minister said fines of two weeks wages for players
who misbehave were for some a lot of money, but for others "very,
very little indeed".
</P>
<P>
She said: "I think the FA itself needs to look at some of the
penalties and the rules.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kinds of things the governing body has to
address and the clubs themselves can do more in setting examples."
</P>
<P>
Hoey, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said everyone
involved in football, including the Professional Footballers'
Association, must work together "to really change this whole
attitude of players, and the whole attitude around getting angry,
snarling, (so that) the game becomes no more than a battle."

<HEADLINE> Unprecedented Tourism Boom in South China's Zhuhai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, the nearest inland city
to Macao, had an unprecedented tourism boom during this year's
Spring Festival, which fell on February 5.
</P>
<P>
In the seven-day holiday season, about 500,000 people visited
scenic sites in Zhuhai, located in Guangdong Province, including
200,000 overnight tourists, with the occupancy rate at some hotels
and restaurants reaching 100 percent, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the success to the return of Macao to the
motherland on December 20, 1999, saying that the event prompted
many domestic tourists to use their holiday vacations to visit
Zhuhai and Macao together.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from February 5-11, some 38,000 people
visited Macao after brief stays in Zhuhai, up 23,000 from last
year's lunar New Year season.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zhuhai has invested heavily in improving its
environment and building new scenic sites. Various transport
companies added additional bus services and lengthened operating
schedules.

KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni traveled to the Bwindi national park to demonstrate to
the world that it is safe to track mountain gorillas in the east
African country's famous tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office on Friday said
that the president's trip to the southwestern Ugandan national
park is aimed at encouraging tourists to come back.

Rwandan Hutu rebels killed eight foreign tourists and one park
warder last March in the park, some 420 kilometers southwest of
the capital Kampala, causing heavy losses to Uganda's tourism.
</P>
<P>
Bwindi national park is habitat to more than 300 mountain
gorillas nearly a half of the world's total and 100 bird species.
The park accounts for 70 percent of the country's tourism revenue.
 Foreign tourists usually have to book tickets to the park one
year in advance.

<P>
With rehabilitation of roads and improved security in the park,
tourism has showed signs of recovery.

TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ambitious Iranian reformists
have won a remarkable victory in some provinces as partial returns
of the parliamentary election have showed, dealing a serious blow
on the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said that the reformist
coalition with centralists has seized at least 55 of the 82
announced seats, while the conservatives gained 21 seats and the
remaining went ot independents.
</P>
<P>
The reformers have won about 67.1 percent, the conservatives 25.
6 percent and the independents 7.3 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier estimates said that the conservatives might win more
seats in provinces since the reformers have more supporters in big
cities.

...big cities.
</P>
<P>
The reformist coalition, led by the Islamic Iran Participation
Front, has vowed to oust the conservatives from the powerful Majlis
(parliament) to help the moderate President Mohammad Khatami
accelerate his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The reformers had predicted they would win 60 percent of the
expanded 290-seat legislative body, which has the power to veto
Khatami's programs and retard the reform process in the Islamic
Republic under theocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
After the unexpected overwhelming victory in the 1997
presidential elections, President Khatami initiated a series of
political and social reforms in the country, promising more freedom
of expression and democracy, paving the way for the people's
participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the call of the reformers during the week-long campaign
which ended on Thursday morning, Iranian voters once again showed
their strong support for President Khatami with a massive turnout
in support of the reformers.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the over 75 percent of the 38.7 million
eligible voters cast their ballots in Friday's sensitive polling,
which was believed to be a turning point in the 21-year history of
the Islamic regime.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Put Former Puppet PM on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti criminal court will
hold its first session Sunday for the trial of Al Aa Hussein, prime
minister of the puppet Kuwaiti government under Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein is facing charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein, accompanied by his four children, returned to
Kuwait last month aboard a Dutch flight with a Norwegian travel
document valid for only one trip.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by state security and taken to the Central
Prison immediately after his entry. His children were handed over
to their relatives here.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa, once a young lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army, along with
other eight who worked in the Ministry of Defense, was said to be
taken to Iraq just a few days after the invasion on August 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was announced later that they had formed the provisional
(Kuwaiti) government, headed by Al Aa.
</P>
<P>
After the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, the eight men were
released at the Kuwaiti border and each given 50,000 U.S. dollars
by Iraq. As they said on their return they were forced to cooperate
with the Iraqi regime, Kuwaiti legal authorities, which found their
claims genuine, acquitted them of any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa, who left Iraq for Norway about two years ago, was
given a death sentence in absentia by a Kuwaiti court in 1991 on
charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
The main aim he choose to return to Kuwait was, in his own
words, to appeal against the death sentence. His lawyer Khalid
Abdel Jaileel has submitted a petition objecting the death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Jaileel said he has documents proving that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein had intimidated Al Aa that his four children would
be killed if he returned to Kuwait.

</P>
<P>
Moderate Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi Lari said at a
press conference on Saturday that about 80 percent of the Iranian
eligible voters took part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's presence on the scene of the sixth
Majlis election had been more extensive than the May 23
presidential elections in 1997, in which President Khatami won over
20 million votes from a total of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Such a presence signifies the spirit of freedom, freedom
seeking, sound understanding of situation and true recognition of
needs, he said, and the people's massive turnout rejected claims
that the presence of parties had discouraged people and distanced
them from political activities.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic elections showed that people are awaiting
reforms within framework of law, he noted, adding that the polling
would strengthen national security and security of economic
investment as well as solidarity and national unity.
</P>
<P>
Lari underlined that all the people, parties and factions,
including the losers, should accept the result of the polling. "Any
elections have the majority and the minority, but the real victory
belongs to the people and the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA said that hundreds of people Saturday staged a
violent protest in Shush Danial, the southern Khuzestan province
after Seyed Jasem Saedi, an incumbent parliament member of the town
and an independent candidate in Friday's polling, was announced to
have won in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people were injured in clashes with police as the
protestors accused the winner of the constituency of bribing the
electorate and attacked the premises of local government, public
buildings as well as several banks.
</P>
<P>
They hurled stones at the policemen on duty and set fire on
several vehicles, forcing the police to shoot in the air and fire
tear-gas to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Political experts warned of more violent incidents in the
country, if the final result proved a face-losing defeat for the
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Win Remarkable Victory in Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ambitious Iranian reformists
have won a remarkable victory in some provinces in the
parliamentary elections, dealing a heavy blow on the powerful
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said that the reformist
coalition with centralists has won at least 55 of the 82 announced
seats, while the conservatives gained 21 seats and the remaining
went to independents.
</P>
<P>
The reformers have won about 67.1 percent, the conservatives 25.
6 percent and the independents 7.3 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier estimates said that the conservatives might win more
seats in provinces since the reformers have more supporters in big
cities.
</P>
<P>
The reformist coalition, led by the Islamic Iran Participation
Front, has vowed to oust the conservatives from the powerful Majlis
or parliament to help the moderate President Mohammad Khatami
accelerate his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The reformers had predicted they would win 60 percent of the
seats in the expanded 290-seat legislative body, which has the
power to veto Khatami's programs and retard the reform process in
the Islamic Republic under theocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
After the unexpected overwhelming victory in the 1997
presidential elections, President Khatami initiated a series of
political and social reforms in the country, promising more freedom
of expression and democracy, paving the way for the people's
participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the call of the reformers during the week-long campaign
ended on Thursday morning, Iranian voters once again showed their
strong support for President Khatami with a massive turnout in
support of the reformers.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the over 75 percent of the 38.7 million
eligible population cast their votes in Friday's sensitive polling,
which was believed to be a turning point in the 21-year history of
the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi Lari said at a
press conference on Saturday that about 80 percent of the Iranian
voters had taken part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's presence on the scene of the 6th
Majlis election had been more extensive than the May 23
presidential elections in 1997, in which President Khatami won over
20 million votes from a total of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Such a presence signifies the spirit of freedom, freedom
seeking, sound understanding of situation and true recognition of
needs, he said, and the people's massive turnout rejected claims
that the presence of parties had discouraged people and distanced
them from political activities.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic elections showed people are awaiting reforms
within framework of the law, he noted, adding that the polling
would strengthen national security and security of economic
investment as well as solidarity and national unity.
</P>
<P>
Lari underlined that all the people, parties and factions,
including the losers, should accept the result of the polling. "Any
elections have the majority and the minority, but the real victory
belongs to the people and the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA said that hundreds of people Saturday staged a
violent protest in Shush Danial, the southern Khuzestan province
after Seyed Jasem Saedi, an independent candidate was announced to
have won in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people were injured in clashes with police as the
protestors accused the winner of the constituency of bribing the
electorate and attacked the premises of local government, public
buildings as well as several banks.
</P>
<P>
They hurled stones at policemen on duty and set fire on several
vehicles, forcing the police to shoot bullets in the air and tear-
gas shells to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Political experts warned of more violent incidents in the
country, if the final result proved a face-losing defeat for the
conservatives in the polling.

<HEADLINE> Three Die in Mexican Army, Rebel Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Three persons have died in
a confrontation between Mexico's rebel Revolutionary Popular Army
(EPR) guerrillas and the army in Mexicao's southern state of
Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas Friday shot at the army troops who were aboard
military vehicles, according to unofficial reports published
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the army soldiers repulsed the attack,
causing three casualties to the EPR guerrillas, who had AK-47
rifles known as "goat horns."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the army said that the combat started at 06:00
Friday and ended near 13:00 local time, at a site near the Las
Palancas village.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas were dressed in military-like uniforms and
carried banners with slogans with which they tried to justify
their armed struggle. The army troops seized three AK-47 rifles,
caliber 12 shotguns, and a caliber 22 handgun.
</P>
<P>
The last time the EPR was involved in an armed confrontation
with public order forces was in October of 1998, when the armed
group claimed an attack against state police agents in the
community of San Juan de las Flores of the Atoyac de Alvarez
municipality, in the state of Guerrero.

<HEADLINE> Panama Declares Medical Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Panama has declared a
medical alert after several deaths presumably caused by mice in
the Los Santos province, in the center of the country, according
to a communique issued Saturday by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The communique recommended that the population keep calm since
the disease that caused the deaths is not highly contagious.
</P>
<P>
However, the same authorities recommended hygienic control
measures such as keeping feet tightly covered to prevent rodents
from attacking, cleaning yards and properties, putting mouse traps
in homes and handling the dead mice with gloves and plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
The deaths, attributed to respiratory problems, have been
occurring since last December, exclusively in Las Tablas, in the
Los Santos province, where there have been nine serious cases,
with four deaths.
</P>
<P>
The same information said that this rare disease was caused by
mice that die in that small town.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has already sent samples of DNA (
deoxyribonucleic acid) of the dead persons to specialized
laboratories in the United States to obtain a definitive diagnosis
about the rare deaths.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- At least one man was
injured Saturday by the detonation of a car bomb across from a
building that belonged to the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar
in Medellin, Colombia's second city, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Investigations Technical Corps (CTI) of the
Attorney General Office said the man was wounded by the explosion
which occurred in the first hours of Saturday.

The sources said that a car loaded with 40 kilos of explosives
was left across from the building where there are some CTI
administrative offices, causing big material losses.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the institution, Alfredo Rodriguez, said that
the attack was made by drug traffickers who protested in this way
against the confiscation of the building, located in the El
Poblado neighborhood, an exclusive residential district of
Medellin.

The building, called Monaco, has six floors and was built in
the 1980s by Escobar as a family residence.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM to Visit Jordan, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
will be in Amman Monday for talks with King Abdullah II on the
Middle East peace process and the consolidation of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the first stop on a tour that will take D'Alema on to
Damascus Tuesday, where he will meet President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, D'Alema is expected to reaffirm Italy's support on
the bilateral and multilateral level, Italian Ambassador to Amman
Stefano Jedrkiewicz told the Italian news agency Ansa.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema will be preceded by Foreign Trade Minister Piero
Fassino who will arrive in Amman Sunday evening with a delegation
of 62 businessmen and operators ranging from banking to chemicals,
engineering and textiles.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's talks in Damascus will further aid an assessment of
the peace process which is going through a particularly difficult
period.
</P>
<P>
Among the topics on D'Alema and Fassino's agenda with King
Abdullah and the government of Premier Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh will
be two accords to convert part of Jordan's debt into development
projects and reschedule over 20 million dollars of Jordanian debt
within the framework of a Paris Club decision in May.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of cooperation and trade relations with
Jordan, Jedrkiewicz said, takes on even greater importance in
light of future regional economic integration according to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Italy is already among the leading partners of Jordan but Amman
is hoping to attract greater Italian investment, especially in the
sectors of clothing, leather and hide working and the management
of water resources.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Implement Oil Supply Reduction Accord: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will fully honor
the agreement of the reduction of the oil supply until March 31,
Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said during a joint press conference with his visiting U.
S. counterpart Bill Richardson at the end of a bilateral meeting
that Mexico "has a gentlemen's agreement with the rest of the oil
countries" until March 31 "and the deadline will be maintained."
</P>
<P>
Tellez said he had a "candid, cordial, and open conversation
with Richardson, in which they discussed the theme of the low oil
inventories and the convenience of raising the crude supply."
</P>
<P>
The Mexican energy minister said that a series of new measures
that will be agreed by consensus with the crude producing
countries to increase exports goes in force April 1.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed the Mexican government position of having
stable and profitable high prices, but at the same time "we want
to have a dynamic economy that will permit the growth of the
country."
</P>
<P>
Richardson dismissed that the United States will use its oil
reserves to counter the present international crisis caused by the
rise in the oil prices, saying that he agrees with the output rise.
</P>
<P>
He said that the price of 30 dollars per barrel is "
inflationary" and that if it continues so, the United States will
have to raise the rates of interest, "which would cause a world
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that the price of crude should be between 10
and 30 dollars per barrel, although he said that "it must be the
market which establishes the best price."

<HEADLINE> L.American Left Meeting Opens in Managua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of more than
60 Latin American leftist political parties inaugurated Saturday
in Managua the Ninth Meeting of the Sao Paulo Forum.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan "The Left at the Start of the New Century:
the Struggle Continues," the delegates will discuss topics like
the experiences of war against neo-liberalism, the challenges of
Latin America in the new millennium, the situation of women and
youth, and the generational relieving of the left.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss topics like the situation of the
indigenous peoples in Latin America, the electoral alliances, as
well as the theme of the party interests in front of people's
interests in the electoral processes.
</P>
<P>
Jacinto Suarez, deputy of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front (FSLN) in the Central American Parliament and member of the
meeting's organizing committee, told Xinhua that the Ninth Sao
Paulo Forum is an open exchange in search of the new alternative
for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The Forum of Sao Paulo was founded in 1990 in that city of
Brazil at the behest of the Workers Party (PT) of Brazil. Some of
its most outstanding founders are Luiz Inacio da Silva (Brazil),
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas (Mexico), Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua), and
Shafik Handal (El Salvador).
</P>
<P>
More than 200 delegates from 32 Latin American, European,
African, and Asian countries attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The forum will conclude on February 21, issuing a Latin
American statement of leftist political parties in Niquinohomo,
some 20 kilometers south of this capital.

<HEADLINE> Newly Detected Massive Particle Might Explain Dark Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The particle, called a weakly interacting, massive particle (
WIMP), weighs at least 50 times as much as a proton and can pass
through other matter without a trace because of an extremely weak
ability to interact with it.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rita Berndbei, who led the physicist team, said a "
cumulative analysis" of data collected over three years in an
underground experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory east
of Rome "favors the possible presence of a WIMP."
</P>
<P>
Their finding also suggests that the space is swarming with
enough of the particles to account for the long-sought "dark
matter" which astronomers believe makes up some 80 percent of the
total universe mass in the universe, The New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed correct by other scientists, the discovery "would
definitely be at the level of a Noble Prize," said Dr. Frank
Avignone, a physicist at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The team will present its paper to the Fourth International
Symposium on Sources and Detection of Dark Matter in the Universe
to be held next Friday in Marina del Rey, California.
</P>
<P>
Among the eight authors, four are Chinese from the Institute of
High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
