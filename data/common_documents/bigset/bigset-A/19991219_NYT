   MACAU _ Five hundred years of European colonialism in Asia
sputters to a close here this weekend on a desolate, rain-swept
waterfront dredged out of Macau's once-beguiling harbor. At the
stroke of midnight on Sunday, China will reclaim this tiny enclave
from Portugal, raising its red flag over another patch of Chinese
soil and setting the stage for what it hopes will be eventual
reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Britain's hand-over of nearby Hong Kong two years ago,
which was heralded by years of Chinese anticipation and British
angst, this is not the reluctant surrender of a prized possession.
Portugal tried to give back this enclave of 430,000 people once
before, after the revolution that ended decades of dictatorship in
Portugal in 1974, but China's leaders, fearful of losing a trading
channel to the outside world, demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Portuguese administration has presided over
Macau's steady deterioration into a disreputable, vaguely sinister
gambling destination for weekend wagerers from Hong Kong. As feuds
between rival Chinese gangs have terrorized the colony over the
last few years, the economy has withered and Macau has become ever
more hooked on the casinos, which generate more than half of its
tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a local, I'd have to say the Portuguese haven't done a good
job,'' said Eric T.M. Yeung, a prominent Macau businessman who
makes toys. ``But in fairness, they had their own problems and
couldn't pay attention to a little spot of land on the other side
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Chinese official in the future local government, who
asked not to be identified to avoid offending the Portuguese, said:
``Hong Kong is so successful that Hong Kong people always think
they are superior to the Chinese. We are happy in Macau, but I
don't think anyone is proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese officials are keenly aware of their checkered legacy.
They were the first Europeans to colonize in Asia, driven by a lust
for adventure and discovery, and a desire to spread the
Christianity that had helped free Portugal of Moorish, Muslim rule.
But for all the centuries they have lingered here, the Portuguese
have left behind no lasting political culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, they have worked diligently to promote
the artifacts, old and new, of 442 years of colonial rule:
meticulously restored buildings in Portuguese pastels, a
state-of-the-art airport and gleaming causeways that connect Macau
with its outer islands.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, said that in the last
decade Macau had taken on many of the hallmarks of a liberal
Western state, including the rule of law, freedom of religion and a
free press. ``Well, it could have been done 300 years ago,'' he
said in an interview on the eve of the hand-over, ``but that was
not the habit of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's ceremony, the departing colonial masters from a
small nation on the other side of the world have produced the
trappings of a momentous occasion. Last week, workers frantically
hammered the last planks on an $8 million pavilion where President
Jiang Zemin of China will take control of the 8-square-mile
territory from Sampaio. Officials say the translucent building is
meant to resemble a Chinese lantern. In truth, it looks more like a
giant, softly lighted bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese have also sought to account for the dark side of
their rule: a stunted political system, with few local Chinese
trained to take over the government, shaky courts, a corrupt police
force, and a democracy movement that can be summed up by the fact
that it has exactly one elected legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can build an airport in five years; we can build a bridge
in two,'' said Jorge Alberto Rangel, the secretary for public
administration, who is coordinating the hand-over ceremony. ``But
forming people takes time. We really did what we thought was best
for Macau.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's sense of conflict is deeply felt. A native Macanese _
part Portuguese, part Chinese _ he comes from one of the colony's
oldest families.
</P>
<P>
   But he also served in the Portuguese Army as an infantry
commander in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa. There, Rangel witnessed
Portugal's chaotic departure from its African colonies after the
1974 revolution. With no leadership and no capacity to govern
themselves, formerly Portuguese Mozambique and Angola fell into
bloody strife, which in Angola continues today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Africa was disaster,'' Rangel said. ``We made
no preparations, like we have here. I believe Macau deserved to
have it done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's sudden renunciation of empire was not just a tragedy
in Africa. Its retreat from East Timor 25 years ago opened the door
for Indonesia to invade and turn the colony into an unwilling
province. Guerrilla rebels fought the Indonesian army until this
year, when Jakarta unexpectedly agreed to allow the East Timorese
to decide their own future. The Indonesian army left, but not
before reducing much of the territory to cinders and attacking the
Roman Catholic Church, whose strength in East Timor is arguably
Portugal's most lasting legacy there.
</P>
<P>
   Macau was spared such predations, mainly because China
effectively gave Portugal squatter's rights after its seafarers
landed here in 1557. Satisfied as long as the Portuguese paid
tribute, the Chinese allowed them to build a bustling trading post
in the 17th and 18th centuries. Along with the traders came the
Jesuit priests, who used Macau as a base to launch missions into
China. The richly detailed facade of Sao Paulo, the surviving
fragment of a church that burned down in 1831, attests to the
church's deep roots here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that a European power could remain on Chinese
soil for all this time,'' said Fok Kai Cheong, a professor of
history at the University of Macau. ``They survived every kind of
Chinese government: dynastic, xenophobic, nationalistic,
Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Macau kept the peace with China, it could do little
about the thrusting British colony 38 miles across the Pearl River
delta. Hong Kong, which was ceded to Britain in 1842 after the
Opium War, rapidly supplanted Macau as the preferred trading hub in
the region. By the early 20th century, Macau was a backwater known
mostly as a refuge for families fleeing from China's war with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's next shock came in 1966, when Chinese laborers caught up
in the fever of the Cultural Revolution rose up against the
Portuguese. The unrest was quelled, but it shook Macau's
administrators and soured Lisbon's appetite for its vestigial
foothold in Asia. As the Portuguese retreated, local Chinese _
mostly bankers and traders _ emerged as the de facto powers in the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among those shadow leaders was Ho Yin, a banker who is revered
by many here for mediating between the Chinese and the Portuguese.
His son, Edmund Ho, was chosen to be the first postcolonial chief
executive of Macau by a Beijing-appointed committee last May.
</P>
<P>
   Like his counterpart in Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, Ho is a
conservative businessman who is not likely to ruffle the feathers
of the Chinese leaders. He even looks a bit like Tung, with
razor-cut hair that would pass muster in boot camp. But unlike the
courtly Tung, he can be blunt.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here on the eve of taking control, Ho, 44, came
across like a big-city mayor who wanted to let people know who was
boss. His target was the Chinese gangs, or triads, which have waged
an ugly war for control of Macau's casinos since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic policy on the triads is that they have to learn how
to behave,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll have to go house to
house, arresting people and putting them in concentration camps.
But they must know how to behave. If you are in the underworld,
learn to keep it under.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho also welcomed Beijing's decision to deploy army troops in
Macau after the hand-over. Portugal had protested the move, noting
that it had withdrawn its troops in 1974. Sampaio even briefly
threatened to boycott the ceremony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although Ho said the troops would not be used for police work,
he clearly relished having a garrison at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``One major advantage is that I will have psychological support
for making drastic changes in the police,'' he said. ``Because if
they say, `We're not happy, we don't want reforms, we don't want to
do our jobs,' I'll say, `You can just step aside and I'll put in
the soldiers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Remarks like that would cause a tempest in Hong Kong, where
pro-democracy leaders are on the lookout for any authoritarian
tendencies in the government. Among Macau's overwhelmingly Chinese
population, however, they are seen as an overdue return to law and
order.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most local people don't object to the Chinese army coming to
Macau,'' said Ng Kuok Cheong, the lone pro-democracy member in the
territory's legislature. ``They believe that mainland China can
control crime, but that the Portuguese government can't.''
</P>
<P>
   China is happy that most Macanese see it that way. For Beijing,
the ceremony Sunday is another step in its push to reunify all of
China, including Taiwan, the seat of the Chinese Nationalist
government whose 22 million people seem unlikely to accept any move
that would place them under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Ng, a soft-spoken former loan officer at the Bank of China who
lost his job because of his politics, said that democracy had
little future in Macau. But he blames that less on China than on
Portugal. ``The British established a pro-Western capitalist elite
in Hong Kong,'' Ng said. ``The Portuguese never did that. Their
primary concern was preserving Portuguese culture.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A magnificent salmon-pink edifice housing the public security
department here attests both to that Portuguese concern and to the
accompanying failure to curb the gang wars that have killed
government officials, scared off tourists and brought gun battles
and car bombings to otherwise tranquil streets.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Macau sentenced its most flamboyant triad leader,
Wan Kuok-koi, to 15 years in prison. It was a victory for the
authorities, who had seethed as Wan strutted around town with an
aura of invincibility. Yet Wan, who goes by the nickname Broken
Tooth, got in some telling last words. As he was being led away, he
screamed at the police: ``You're corrupt. You've taken dirty
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people here believe Wan's demise will end the mayhem. But
they note approvingly that China has arrested hundreds of suspected
triad members in neighboring Guangdong Province. Now, they say, the
new government must figure out how to clean up Macau's casinos,
which have contributed to the crime wave by allowing gangs to take
control of VIP rooms that cater to high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped, dark and crawling with prostitutes, Macau's casinos are
worlds away from the theme-park ambience of Las Vegas. The gambling
industry is controlled by Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong billionaire who
has held an exclusive government license since 1961. That license
expires in 2001, and Edmund Ho, who is not related to Stanley, has
not revealed whether it will be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Macau's next leader is busy building a government
``from ground zero,'' Edmund Ho notes in a swipe at the decamping
colonials. He is also putting out the word that Macau intends to
remain a distinct enclave, with its own laws and customs. Even he
acknowledges, however, that it will live mostly in memory _
Europe's last foothold in Asia, soon to be lost in the enormity of
modern China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here would like the world to remember that there's a
Macau somewhere in this region,'' Ho said a bit wistfully. ``But we
have to be realistic.''

Houston's late-game lapse bails out Georgetown
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ Kenny Younger's 3-point shot with 3 minutes, 44
seconds to play lifted the Houston Cougars into a tie with
Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars never scored again and, taking advantage of
game-turning offensive rebounds and two critical UH turnovers, the
Hoyas sealed an up-and-down 83-75 victory Saturday that was a far
cry from the teams' 1984 NCAA championship matchup.
</P>
<P>
   That game, won by the Hoyas 84-75 at Seattle, was eons ago in
terms of where both programs are today, with Georgetown, coming off
a 15-16 record, now 6-3 and the 5-5 Cougars, in coach Clyde
Drexler's words, ``making progress back to respectability.''
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, who retired as Hoyas coach Jan. 8, 1999, was
among the sparse MCI Center crowd of 7,198. President Clinton, a
Georgetown alumnus, attended the Washington Wizards game Thursday
night but passed on this one.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown, aggressive as ever on the boards if not as skilled
in other areas, hammered the Cougars 29-15 on the glass in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemed like it was five times as much,'' Drexler said of the
near 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   After Younger's shot, only his second field goal of the day,
Georgetown rebounded two consecutive Hoyas misses to set up guard
Kevin Braswell's 3-pointer. The game's 17th lead change restored
the lead for good to the Hoyas with 2:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UH failed to score on its ensuing trip down the court, and Rhese
Gibson fired in his only basket of the game from the right corner
after another offensive rebound by Georgetown, which claimed 21 of
its 46 at the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Younger then missed another 3-pointer, and Gee Gervin had his
3-pointer blocked by 6-11 center Ruben Boumtje Boumtje. After
Braswell charged, George Williams, UH's 6-8 freshman, saw his
baseline shot go in and out, and the Cougars were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were letting them get rebounds until they made a shot,''
Drexler said of the second half, when the foul-plagued Cougars were
forced to play about six minutes with four reserves and Williams on
the floor. ``For the second game in a row, Gee and Kenny got in
foul trouble, and it's tough on us when they are on the bench. We
had guys come off the bench and play enormous roles, and that's
what we are going to have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   UH's Torrence Botts, a 6-1 sophomore walk-on, contributed nine
points, a team-high six rebounds, five assists and a steal. Tega
Moceanu, a 6-8 junior walk-on, added nine points, including a pair
of treys, but he picked up a flagrant foul and an ensuing technical
for two personals late in the first half. Both Younger and Gervin
went to the bench for a long stretch with their fourth personals
with 11 minutes to go, Gervin's occurring in a loose-ball scramble
when he was kicked in the nose and an official changed the foul
call to Gervin from Larry Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin scored 16 of his game-high 24 in the first half as the
Cougars led most of the way. Younger, who was 2-for-10 shooting
after a 3-of-13 effort in the one-point loss at Louisiana-Monroe on
Wednesday, added 12 points and Chad Hendrick had 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny was (Conference USA) Player of the Week last week,''
Drexler said. ``Since then, we haven't seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington scout Wil Robinson, one of a platoon of NBA talent
evaluators watching, said of Gervin, ``He'll be playing in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, Gervin and the Cougars need to do something about
their costly lapses at the end of close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get rebounds at the end and come down and score, I feel
like it would have been our game,'' Gervin said. ``But we gave them
too many chances to score after they missed shots and those late
turnovers were killers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoyas' 23 turnovers helped the Cougars, who shot only 27.6
percent in the second half and 37.9 for the game. Georgetown
blocked nine shots, including five by 6-11 Jameel Watkins, who also
had nine rebounds. Victor Samnick, a 6-8 freshman, helped hold UH's
Williams without a first-half field goal and also scored 17 points.
Braswell (18), 6-3 guard Anthony Perry (15 points with nine
rebounds) and Boumtje Boumtje (10) helped give the Hoyas four
double-figure scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if we will play a team this year that changes as often
and plays as many kinds of zone defenses as Houston,'' Georgetown
coach Craig Esherick said. ``Until the end of the game, we couldn't
get an offensive flow going.''
</P>
<P>
   But that flow came just in time to swing the game to the Hoyas.

UCLA GIVES DEPAUL FROSH-BITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Searching for answers and desperate for victory,
UCLA coach Steve Lavin got his wish Saturday against No. 19 DePaul:
gifted big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso played together for
the first time this season. They did not disappoint, combining for
32 points, 20 rebounds and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of UCLA's return from its Gonzaga grave was not
the hulking front-liners with their thunder dunks and intimidating
swats. It was a black headband worn by unassuming freshman forward
Jason Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wasn't playing well, and I needed to do
something to change things up,'' Kapono said. ``I put the headband
on, and I came out loose. The next thing I know, we're out there
playing well and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono scored a team-high 20 points and drained three 3-point
baskets early in the second half to propel UCLA to a 76-58 victory
before 10,024 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   His first strike, from the top of the key, gave UCLA a 31-30
lead it would never relinquish. A minute later, he struck from the
right corner for a 36-30 lead. Three possessions later, his swish
from the right wing gave the Bruins a 42-30 margin and forced the
Blue Demons to call timeout.
</P>
<P>
   When the surge ended _ it was, by far, UCLA's best offensive
stretch of the season _ the Bruins had outscored DePaul 23-5 and
were cruising to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first four games, I wasn't scared, I was just hesitant,''
Kapono said. ``I told coach Lavin that I was just trying to find my
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   He has _ as the vortex of UCLA's offense.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 18 Bruins (4-1) spent all week correcting the flaws in
their zone offense _ flaws exposed last season in the NCAA
Tournament and last week against Gonzaga. The coaches emphasized
passing and discouraged dribbling, and they stationed Kapono, their
smartest player, in the middle of the court _ the optimum spot for
him to direct the offense and distribute the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, he'd catch a pass with his back to the basket,
spin, and hit open teammates on the wings or in the corners. The
crisp ball movement spread DePaul's zone defense and enabled the
Bruins to shoot 54.5 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us to pass instead of dribble and keep the ball
moving like a hot potato,'' Bruins guard Ryan Bailey said. ``We had
to make the defense honor each person.''
</P>
<P>
   DePaul, which shot 30 percent against UCLA's long-limbed zone
defense, made Kapono's job easier by sending four players to the
offensive boards. The strategy generated 25 offensive rebounds, and
it ruined the Blue Demons' floor balance and enabled UCLA's dormant
fast break to shift into high gear. Each of Kapono's 3-pointers
came in transition, as did most of its baskets during the 23-5
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very bad offensively,'' said DePaul coach Pat Kennedy,
who was without injured point guard Rashon Bruno. ``We didn't get
any good looks, and UCLA's defense was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kapono was the Bruins' vortex, Bailey was their initiator.
Healthy for the first time in weeks _ he had tendinitis in his foot
_ Bailey totaled seven rebounds, five assists and three steals in
26 crafty minutes at point guard. His presence enabled Earl Watson
(1 of 9 from the field) to slide to wing guard, his natural
position. That subtle change sparked UCLA's best ball movement
since it dismantled Syracuse in February.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see Watson on the wing more often, with the ball in
Bailey's _ or Kapono's _ hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan gave us a great lift,'' Lavin said. ``He and Kapono can
kick it ahead to Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: The question is when, not if, ineligible forward Matt
Barnes will be reinstated. Barnes said he has passed three of the
four classes needed to lift his academic suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grade I don't know is from an English class, and I had an
A going into the final, so I know I'm OK,'' Barnes said. ``Now, I'm
going to sit in my dorm and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the grade is posted _ Barnes hopes it's today or Monday _
he'll hop a plane and join the Bruins in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I !ital!read!off! about UCLA's embarrassing loss
to Gonzaga last weekend at Pauley Pavilion. The 17 second-half
points, the 26-percent shooting, the sullen postgame quotes (``We
rolled over'').
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't there, though. And now I don't believe it really
happened. I'm not sure there's even a university called Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe last Sunday's newspaper was somebody's idea of a prank.
</P>
<P>
   A team couldn't play as badly as UCLA supposedly did against
Gonzaga, and turn around and destroy 19th-ranked DePaul 76-58 the
way the Bruins did Saturday in front of 10,024 fans at Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   The guys from DePaul _ you want to talk about sullen? _ must
have thought the same thing I did.
</P>
<P>
   These weren't the Bruins they read about. These weren't the
Bruins they watched on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gonzaga tape, I told our kids, was going to be
misleading,'' DePaul coach Pat Kennedy said. ``Gonzaga is a very
good, experienced team that executes that flex offense very well.
If Gonzaga could shoot the 3 like that all the time, they could
beat anybody. Now UCLA had its back to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our kids that other than Duke, this is the most
talented team we'll play all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The result for those talented Bruins, a 27-7 run after they
trailed at halftime, had DePaul sounding like UCLA the Saturday
before.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Demons, like the Bruins before them, noted the absence
of a key player (injured point guard Rashon Burno).
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to a critical, second-half offensive lapse.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded, as tomahawk-jamming guard Paul McPherson put it,
``We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Demons did have an excuse worth listening to. Their
flight west Friday was five hours late getting off the ground in
Chicago because O'Hare Airport had to be closed for a couple of
hours after a jet skidded off a frozen runway. They thought they
might have to cancel the game, and got to Los Angeles too late to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were all screwed up,'' Kennedy said. ``I don't know
(if it's an excuse), I'm just saying it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, DePaul was grounded by a UCLA team that responded
to a bad loss the way coach Steve Lavin's teams have done
repeatedly the past three seasons, the way they did after losing to
Tulsa, to Kansas (by 13), at Stanford (by 48), to North Carolina
(by 41) in Alaska, and at Duke (by 36).
</P>
<P>
   They played as if they had something to prove _ as a team and
not only to the seven NBA clubs that were represented Saturday.
(The Lakers' Jerry West and the Clippers' Elgin Baylor were in the
crowd.)
</P>
<P>
   Another loss would have slotted the Bruins below the nation's
ranked teams for now and cost them rungs in the NCAA Tournament
seedings in March. Another loss would have put Lavin under fire
from more than the talk-radio jocks.
</P>
<P>
   The guys on the radio pregame show, by the way, were predicting
a defeat for 18th-ranked UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The victory inserts UCLA into sentences with 15th-ranked Texas
and 11th-ranked Duke, which handed DePaul its only losses in nine
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, they're athletic,'' McPherson said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   He compared UCLA more to Texas, with its physical center, than
Duke, with its emphasis on the perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Forward-center Jerome) Moiso makes things happen inside, and
(center Dan) Gadzuric gets everything around the basket,''
McPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely a good team,'' said Quentin Richardson, the
game's top scorer with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, as much as anybody, was affected by UCLA's strength,
its defense. DePaul's leader got only eight shots in the first half
and finished 8 for 23; the Blue Demons shot 30.1 percent in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They switched into and out of their zone really well, and we
didn't adjust to it well enough,'' Richardson said of the Bruins.
``They stayed packed in the whole game, and with Moiso and Gadzuric
in there, I had a pretty hard time getting to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense resulted in a fast break like none the Blue
Demons have seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they clearly beat us was in the offensive transition,''
Kennedy said, ``and nobody had done that to us this year. They kept
getting behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   That made the Bruins (4-1) look pretty good as they go to Hawaii
for a three-game tournament and look ahead to their next big test
against No.24 Purdue Dec. 30 at Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's best not to get too excited just because they
dominated a ranked team. One game does not a season make, as we
were reminded after the loss to Gonzaga, the game that might not
really have taken place after all. &QL;

HOSTAGE STANDOFF ENDS AT LOUISIANA JAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
(No byline)    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ The end of the siege at the St. Martin
Parish jail in this small southern Louisiana town came suddenly
late Saturday night as six detainees released their seven hostages
in a whirl of colored lights as ambulances rushed to the jail. As
suddenly as it started, it was over. Dozens of members of Swat
teams ran from the building cheering and high-fiving, stripping off
their riot gear and throwing it in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' they yelled to reporters standing nearby.
``Everyone is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Stretchers were brought down with two hostages who had been held
the longest, the jail's warden, Todd Louviere, 35, and deputy Jolie
Sonnier, 20. Louviere had grown a beard over the six days he was
held hostage by a group of six detainees who were protesting their
long imprisonment. Five of the detainees were Cubans and one was
from the Bahamas. Five women inmates had also been held.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the hostages rushed to the scene, weeping and
seeking information in the confusion. ``Thank god they're OK,''
sobbed a woman who identified herself as Ms. Sonnier's mother.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, FBI special agent in charge Charles
Mathews III announced that the hostage crisis had ended at 10 p.m.
``It's all over,'' he said. ``Everybody is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Martin Parish sheriff, Charles S. Fuselier, said, ``I
don't think we could have asked for a better Christmas present than
this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the release was negotiated by federal and
state officials along with a local spanish-speaking television
producer and the mother of one of the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Placer, a television producer in Lafayette, La., said the
authorities asked for her help on Friday as the detainees were
demanding that the media be involved. The hostage-taker's mother,
Mercedes Villar, said Saturday that she had been promised that the
detainees would be returned to Cuba. Asked repeatedly to confirm or
deny this, Mathews would say only ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began in the jail in this town of 8,000 on Monday
when five inmates, armed with a knife and a screwdriver, overcame
Louviere, Ms. Sonnier and another guard, Brandon Boudreaux. Three
other prisoners later joined the ringleaders, the police said. The
rebel inmates had demanded safe passage from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, two Cubans involved in the uprising surrendered,
and Boudreaux, 20, was released along with three female inmates.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the authorities at the jail had cleared the
remaining 54 prisoners from the jail.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police said the 54 inmates, the last of 172 who were in St.
Martin Parish jail, 110 miles west of New Orleans, when the siege
began, left through a hole cut in an interior wall so the
hostage-takers could not see them. The inmates, who were taken to
other jails, were not involved in the uprising and had asked to be
moved, said Mathews.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hostage-takers are immigrants who have completed
sentences for crimes committed in the United States but have
remained in custody because they cannot be deported home, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said. One has been held for
nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agency has said that the Cubans came ashore in
the Mariel boatlift in 1980, during which Fidel Castro sent
hundreds of criminals to the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to explain any of the releases, but the
flurry of activity occurred a few hours after Louviere and Ms.
Sonnier used the jail public address system to speak out in support
of their captors' cause.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They criticized United States policy on Cuban detainees and
urged that a helicopter be brought in to take the detainees to
freedom.  &QL;

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 475 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's
FA-18 E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter which will serve all the
services.
</P>
<P>
   There have, however, been some signs of a political backlash in
Congress against ``tac air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Republican congressman whose half-desert district
contains weapons-testing sites, led a successful move in October to
stop the first procurement money for the F-22. He would rather
spend the cash on more research.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that all these aircraft-building programs are
backed by powerful lobbies in the armed forces, as well as by
legislators whose districts contain the factories which make the
fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is little evidence that defense
planners are taking to heart what is perhaps the chief lesson of
Kosovo. That would mean questioning the whole logic of
manpower-intensive weapons systems such as fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo fight, the average $50 million tactical bomber
which took off from an airfield in, say, Italy to drop its deadly
load over Serbia had to be accompanied by a ``strike package'' of
electronic-warfare aircraft and refuelling planes as well as
interceptors to protect it from enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of highly trained rescuers had to be at the ready to
recover pilots if they were shot down. And the tactical bombers
that were not operating from land bases needed billion-dollar
aircraft carriers to get them close enough to where the war was.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining and protecting all these forces at overseas bases
was such an expensive and politically sensitive business that it
apparently makes sense for the American Air Force to send
$2-billion, two-man B-2 bombers, each of which can drop up to 32
big bombs or missiles, directly from the United States to anywhere
in the world, and then have them fly home again.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding casualties is a costly business. So would it not be a
good idea to put some of the money instead into the development of
unmanned aerial vehicles which can do everything a piloted aircraft
can? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade or so, UAVs could be as effective as manned
fighters at dropping bombs, air-to-air combat and silencing the
enemy's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there remains a powerful bureaucratic resistance to the
development of a technology which could make a generation of
much-loved aircraft irrelevant. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo war poses a similar challenge to naval planners. If
the main purpose of sea power is to deliver explosives to targets
on land, is there not some cheaper way of doing it than building
aircraft carriers which cost $5 billion each, and need an armada of
other ships to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   An alternative exists in the idea of small ``arsenal ships''
which could be packed with every known type of projectile, and yet
need a crew of only 50 (compared with a big carrier's 5,000) and
cost only about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the Navy has shown hardly any interest in these
deadly little boats. It plans to build up to 30 small new
destroyers, which need fewer men than the existing sort; but this
is only half a step forward. And it still intends to build three
new carriers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vago Muradian, who keeps an eye on military matters in
Washington, says that there is support for radical changes in
defense technology _ including unmanned aircraft, arsenal ships and
airborne lasers _ at the highest levels of the Pentagon, and among
junior officers.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance comes chiefly from middle-ranking officers who
cannot bear to wave goodbye to the weapons with which they have
grown up. So it is just a matter of time, reckons David Bookstaber,
an Air Force lieutenant who has written a lot about UAVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, unmanned weapons systems will prevail over
their manned equivalents by every indicator,'' he predicts. ``To
products of the Nintendo generation like myself, that's obvious.'' &QL;

   The Kosovo war poses a similar challenge to naval planners. If
the main purpose of sea power is to deliver explosives to targets
on land, is there not some cheaper way of doing it than building
aircraft carriers which cost $5 billion each, and need an armada of
other ships to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   An alternative exists in the idea of small ``arsenal ships''
which could be packed with every known type of projectile, and yet
need a crew of only 50 (compared with a big carrier's 5,000) and
cost only about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the Navy has shown hardly any interest in these
deadly little boats. It plans to build up to 30 small new
destroyers, which need fewer men than the existing sort; but this
is only half a step forward. And it still intends to build three
new carriers. &QL;

   Vago Muradian, who keeps an eye on military matters in
Washington, says that there is support for radical changes in
defense technology _ including unmanned aircraft, arsenal ships and
airborne lasers _ at the highest levels of the Pentagon, and among
junior officers.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance comes chiefly from middle-ranking officers who
cannot bear to wave goodbye to the weapons with which they have
grown up. So it is just a matter of time, reckons David Bookstaber,
an Air Force lieutenant who has written a lot about UAVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, unmanned weapons systems will prevail over
their manned equivalents by every indicator,'' he predicts. ``To
products of the Nintendo generation like myself, that's obvious.'' &QL;

<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL;

<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>

if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Others have fallen into the trap of buying software packages
that suited them when they were small, but which cannot be scaled
up to process larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Sharp, who left Microsoft to become the chief technology
officer at iTurf, a Web site and catalogue retailer for teenagers,
says that without integrated systems firms cannot assess what
people are doing on their site or the value of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get their computer systems right, most online
retailers are ill-prepared for the difficulties of handling
thousands or millions of small, frequent and individual orders. &QL;

   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is

educational toys _ no Barbies or Pokemons here _ and has built and

<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their

   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>

   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to

``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation

   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants

   Handspring, which makes handheld computers, is paying the price.
Its customers are being billed several times, and many have been

<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick

   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has

   Moreover, once a system is in place, it is hard to slot in new
features. And that is the real lesson from all the bodging and
jerry-building.

   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The
solution is to build top-notch distribution centers and warehouses.
But, as Amazon _ probably the best online retailer _ is
discovering, that is very expensive, indeed. &QL;

<P>
   Has the millennium bug been crushed?
</P>
<P>
   The world must wait until Jan. 1 to see if all of those Y2K
projects have done the trick. But the nerds seem to have persuaded
us that disruption will not be serious and on New Millennium's Day,
life will carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That emerges from the latest world poll, carried out by Angus
Reid for The Economist. The Canadian polling firm interviewed
representative adult samples in 21 countries from mid-November to
early December _ nearly 12,000 respondents in all.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our sample group if they thought the bug would cause
``serious and widespread economic disruption'' in their country, or
``some economic disruption, but not serious'' or ``little or no
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 percent, weighted by population, said they had never
heard of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Though practically everyone knew about it in, say, America and
Hong Kong, 32 percent of Russians and 29 percent of Turks professed
total ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Others had heard of it, but were unsure of its likely
consequences. Overall, this was true of 6 percent of our sample.
</P>
<P>
   What follows ignores such answers and concentrates on the rest.
Globally, only 8 percent of those who have an opinion expect
widespread disruption in their own countries. However, a further 41
percent expect some economic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those expecting some trouble and those expecting none
are evenly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The share of pessimists varies greatly. In America and Canada,
only 2 percent expect really serious trouble, as do 4 percent in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for most people, the only reason to think that the bug is
safe is that experts say so. And, although events may prove the
scientists wrong, most people seem inclined to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, people can still be persuaded by scientists, provided
it is done right. &QL;

MAVERICKS' LOSING WAYS HAVE MADE THEM THE RUNNING JOKE OF
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ /This guy goes into a 7-Eleven and leaves two Mavericks
tickets on the dashboard of his unlocked car. When he comes back he
finds six tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Mavericks. They just can't win for, well, losing.
</P>
<P>
   The losingest pro sports franchise of the decade has become a
running joke. Turn on ``SportsCenter.'' Pick up the newspaper. Tune
in to sports-talk radio. Everyone is making fun of the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, rightfully so,'' Mavericks guard Hubert Davis said.
``Until we start winning, jokes are going to be made about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad coaching, bad drafts, bad trades and bad free-agency
signings have doomed the franchise to a laughingstock. The
Mavericks have had seven head coaches and 94 players on their
roster this decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten so bad for the Mavericks that comedians no
longer regularly take their name in shame. Four Day Weekend Comedy
Troup in Fort Worth has not done a spoof on the Mavericks in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so pathetic that no one even comments about them
anymore,'' said David Ahearn, a partner in the comedy club.
``That's how bad it's gotten. The Mavericks are almost a parody of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   /Did you hear that the Mavericks played a scrimmage against
themselves _ and tied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' record is laughable. They are 612-938 (.395) in
their 20-year history, and in a league that has more than half of
the 29 teams in the playoffs each year, the Mavericks have gone
nine seasons without a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks can't even console themselves with a claim of ``at
least we're not the Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clips may have a worse reputation, but the Mavericks have a
worse record. The Lakers' NBA stepsisters were 282-506 (.358) from
the 1989-90 to the 1998-99 season; the Mavericks were an NBA-worst
246-542 (.312).
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Mavericks (8-16) lost at home to Vancouver, a
team that had a 30-game road losing streak. And after Phoenix lost
a recent game in Dallas, Danny Ainge quit as the Suns' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mavs are like Kmart,'' said Aaron Richard, 25, of
Lewisville. ``They're never going to be taken seriously until they
either change their name or move.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been all the Mavericks' fault. They have had bad
luck, too. The Mavericks lost a team-record 363 player games to
injury in 1997-98. Last season, guard Robert Pack missed 25 of 50
games, and forward Cedric Ceballos was out for 37 as the team
finished 19-31.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Mavericks have had 10 players miss a total of
128 games, including 22 by Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the Bambino Curse,'' Mavericks guard Erick Strickland
said. ``What about the Maverick Curse?''
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. The Mavericks once were good.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the seventh
game of the Western Conference finals in 1988? Second-year
Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki doesn't. He was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said Brad Davis, 43, who played with the
Mavericks from 1980-92 and now is the team's radio analyst. ``It
was a lot like what the Stars are going through now. We were
selling out season tickets, and you know, every time we went out on
the court, we thought we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, every time the Mavericks go out on the court, everyone
expects them to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kissell, 26, of Crowley is a sports fan. He is not a
Mavericks fan. Asked if he owns any Mavericks apparel, Kissell
said, ``You mean other than a paper bag I can put over my head?''
</P>
<P>
   Tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bumper sticker seen on a police car: ``Go Cowboys ... and
take the Mavericks with you!''''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the NBA lockout and the Mavericks' history, the team
still averaged 14,513 at Reunion Arena last season. This season the
Mavericks' slogan is: ``One Fan At A Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim White, 29, isn't buying it _ or tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really like the Mavs to stop sending me things in the
mail,'' said White of Keller. ``I do not want season tickets to see
a semi-professional team play. Save your stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hamilton, 45, recently moved from Omaha, Neb., to McKinney.
He attended his first Mavericks game this season but hasn't decided
if it will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out if I'm going to become a Mavs' fan or
not,'' Hamilton said. ``I haven't quite figured it out. That tells
you something, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime Mavericks fans _ no, that's not a misnomer _ have
a sense of humor about their team.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Luna, 27, grew up with the Mavericks. His family has had
two season tickets since the team's debut in 1980-81. Every year he
keeps believing the Mavericks will be better. Every year he's
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Luna said, laughing, ``they are my team. I'm going to
give them one more chance. Just one more year. I know they don't
deserve it. I'm just a diehard fan. Stupid, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   /Did you hear about the new McDonald's value meal? For a $1.99
you get a cheeseburger, fries, a drink and two Mavericks tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have two banners hanging in the rafters of Reunion
Arena. One honors the retired jersey No. 15 of Davis. The other
remembers the 1986-87 NBA Midwest Division Champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who have called Reunion home only since the 1993-94
season, have 10 banners, including one for winning the Stanley Cup
championship last season. The Stars began this season with only 13
fewer victories than the Mavericks in four fewer seasons this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where playoff berths are expected and championships
are celebrated, the Mavericks are in a no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the fans have faith in us?'' guard Steve Nash said.
``We haven't won in 10 years. It's been a perpetual cycle of
inadequacy. We're just the latest inheritors of the situation.
We're trying to fight out of it. There are not a lot of ways to get
better. There's free agency, and there's youth. We're going with
youth. It's going to take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have almost the same roster as last season.
Strapped by the salary cap, coach/general manager Don Nelson could
not afford to keep forward Samaki Walker from leaving for San
Antonio. They were only able to add bit players like Randell
Jackson and Damon Jones.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mavericks and their fans didn't laugh, they might cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the Mavs are the Mavs,'' said Reed Williams, 22, of
Dallas. ``But one day, the Mavs are going to shine again.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Mavericks will play the part of punchline. Their
best hope is to have the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laugh at the things people say,'' Strickland said. ``I
laugh at it. I think it's funny. I think the team wants to work
that much harder to prove them wrong.''

STARS RESPOND WITHOUT HATCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Captain Derian Hatcher has, at
times, been a lone steadying influence n this tumultuous Stars'
season, marked by injuries and struggles.
</P>
<P>
   He began this season a lot as he ended last, a defensive
stalwart. When losing streaks and scoring droughts swooped in, he
took responsibility for returning the Stars to Stanley Cup-winning
form.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates took his cue and followed his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Hatch and he's a big guy, and you look at him and
go `You know what? He's a machine,''' Stars defenseman Brad
Lukowich said. ``And so you don't think anything is going to happen
to a guy like that, and then to see him in that state, like he was
after the game, it was a shocker. I was blown away. I was like,
`Wow, this is for real.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A glance at Hatcher, hobbling around on crutches with a
six-to-eight-week recovery prognosis, redefined reality for a Stars
bunch that finally appeared be improving. Now, the Stars have to
find another steadying influence to hold together a fragile
confidence that Hatcher had helped build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Derian, along with our goalie, are the two players who
have outperformed the norms and kept our team floating lots of
nights,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said. ``There comes a
time when we either need an upgrade across the board from a group
of players who are underperforming, or different players to grab
that challenge or responsibility and help to diminish what we're
going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said the answer has to come from within because neither a
trade nor a free-agent signing is imminent. He already had been
shopping around and found little help available.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's sink or swim time without the best defensive defenseman
in the NHL serving as a life vest.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 of Life Without Hatcher began last night with a 4-2
victory against the Vancouver Canucks at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   While Hatcher returned to Dallas on Saturday after sustaining a
laceration on his lower calf that punctured his muscle midway
through Friday's game against Edmonton, news on forward Joe
Nieuwendyk proved to be better. Nieuwendyk also exited Friday's
game after a cross check caused cartilage damage around his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Nieuwendyk felt better and might
be ready to return as soon as Tuesday's game against Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Stars players had been preparing to be without both players.is
enough].
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you lose a guy like Derian, it's an immediate
impact,'' said defenseman Richard Matvichuk, Hatcher's defensive
partner for four-plus seasons. ``What Derian brings to this team is
like what nobody brings to any other team. He's our captain, our
leader, and don't forget, he's doing it for 35 minutes a night.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who replaces Hatcher?
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't one person. Everybody said it has to be a team
effort, forwards included.
</P>
<P>
   Said Matvichuk: ``Playing without him is going to be weird. ...
Myself, Darryl \RSydor\S and Zubie \R]Sergei Zubov\S are going to
have to take the blunt end of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have been without Hatcher before, including the first
five games of the playoffs last season. Times, however, were
different. The Stars had a certain swagger about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to lose a player, a good player, when
everything was functioning well,'' Gainey said. ``You could sort of
plaster over that crack more easily. But when it's not ...''
</P>
<P>
   The way Hitchcock sees it, the Stars can use Hatcher's injury as
a way to become a better team if they start fixing the cracks
instead of relying on Hatcher and goalie Ed Belfour, to cover them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, our team is not going to be the same,'' Hitchcock said.
``What I mean by not the same is this is either going to make us
better or worse. But we have a real chance for it to make us better
because it's going to force people to really come together.

   The team will go on, but the person who is reeling a bit is
Hatcher. He had been mounting what possibly was a Norris
Trophy-like season. He was averaging 30-plus minutes a game and had
solidified his reputation as the best defensive defenseman in the
NHL.

   ``He just shrugs,'' Hitchcock said, ``but he's a very emotional
person. He's very disappointed, and he recognized that the team was

<P>
   To assess a diabetic's risk of heart disease, a doctor typically
takes a blood sample to look for biochemical telltales such as the
level of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional method certainly does not involve sitting the
patient down on a psychiatrist's couch to see if a glass of water
looks half empty or half full.
</P>
<P>
   The latter technique may, however, turn out to be as much to the
point as blood tests, because some new research suggests that
depressed diabetics are, quite literally, prone to getting their
hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   This study, which is to be published in January's
``Atherosclerosis'' by Trevor Orchard, an epidemiologist at the
University of Pittsburgh, is one piece of a mosaic that
psychologists and epidemiologists have been fitting together over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece is an answer to the question of why depressed
people seem particularly susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that is emerging as the pieces fit together suggests
that the old tag ``a healthy mind in a healthy body'' frequently
needs to be inverted.
</P>
<P>
   An unhealthy mind can lead directly to an unhealthy body _ and
therefore another old medical tag ``treat the patient, not the
disease'' takes on a new significance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard explored this interaction between mind and body
using data collected during the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes
Complications Study, which was designed to identify those factors
that worsen the health of people already suffering from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``juvenile-onset'' (type-I) diabetes, these complications can
be as deadly as the ailment itself. Type-I diabetics cannot produce
insulin _ a hormone which regulates the level of sugar in the
blood. They must therefore inject themselves with insulin at
regular intervals or else risk coma or sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if this were not sobering enough, type-I diabetics also
have a tendency to suffer from early and severe arteriosclerosis, a
condition in which the walls of the blood vessels thicken and
harden.
</P>
<P>
   Arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries is particularly
dangerous, for these vessels supply blood to the muscle of the
heart. As the coronary-artery walls narrow, the flow of nutrients
and oxygen to the heart slows, and coronary heart disease (CHD)
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard's analysis involved more than 600 diabetics, who
were examined at two-year intervals over six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to undergoing the usual physiological tests, the
participants were also evaluated at the beginning of the study by
the ``Beck Depression Inventory.'' This test rates individual
symptoms of depression (such as pessimism, suicidal ideas, social
withdrawal and loss of libido).
</P>
<P>
   The more depressed a patient is, the more points he accumulates.
A patient's score on the Beck scale turned out to be a good
predictor of his eventual level of CHD _ better, indeed, than high
levels of blood sugar, the standard symptom of diabetic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Those without CHD scored significantly lower than those with it.
And patients who developed angina, a painful heart condition
resulting from arteriosclerosis, had depression scores that were
nearly twice as high (12.2) as diabetics whose hearts stayed
healthy (6.6).
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics, of course, whether depressed or not, are seriously
ill people. But it has been known for a long time that people with
no serious illness other than depression are more likely to die
than those who are otherwise similar, but mentally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their causes of death have some visible connection with
their disease _ suicide, violent accidents and drug abuse are high
on the list. But depressed patients also die more often than the
mentally healthy from ``natural'' causes such as pneumonia and
influenza. &QL;

<P>
   The question of why severely depressed patients suffer from
infections more often than the average person attracted the
attention of Gregory Miller, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon
University, also in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal body, infectious organisms are met by a battalion of
cells known as lymphocytes. Some of these attack the invaders
directly. Others produce antibodies that gum them up. But the
immune systems of the severely depressed tend to mount a weaker
counterattack than those of the mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and his colleagues think they have the explanation
for this immunological apathy. In the past, studies relating mental
depression to depression of the immune system have usually been
performed on patients stuck in hospital. This complicates matters,
because the mere fact of being in a hospital affects a patient's
mood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. Miller studied 32 depressed women who were not in
hospital, and matched them with a control group of healthy women.
As he reports in the latest issue of ``Psychosomatic Medicine,''
lymphocytes from the depressed women responded much less than those
from the normal women when exposed to agents that induce
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this relies on the observation that
depression is often accompanied by a hormonal imbalance in the
brain. The disease is associated with abnormal levels of
norepinephrine and estradiol, hormones that are known to help
regulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's results, however, showed that this biochemical
difference could not, by itself, account for the weakness of the
responses shown to infection by the depressed women. There must be
something else involved.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his colleagues started examining the women in
question, they found that the depressed subjects had very different
ways of life from the controls. They smoked more, drank more
caffeinated drinks, slept more fitfully, and exercised less.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps surprisingly, only one of these differences, that
in physical activity, proved to have a significant relationship
with lymphocyte production. Dr. Miller found that physical activity
accounted for about half of the difference in immunity between
depressed and normal women.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that exercise represents the first clear behavioral
link between depression and a dysfunctional immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If that speculation proves correct, encouraging depressed people
to exercise should help to protect them from illness _ and the
strange correlations between depression, pneumonia and influenza
may finally make some sense. &QL;

SPELLMAN FINDS SELF, REVIVES NFL CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In one unforgettable day during the summer,
Cowboys defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman's life completely changed
while he lounged inside his first-story master bedroom at his
Chicago home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord came to me, and it was like a cool breeze over my
body, then all of a sudden I couldn't keep my eyes dry,'' Spellman
said. ``I had been praying every day for 5 1/2 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones worked a deal with
agent Leigh Steinberg to bring Spellman into a team environment
that prides itself on a strong support system _ namely former
Cowboys running back Calvin Hill and his staff, which has been set
up to counsel players in a myriad of off-field matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Spellman said, ``God comes right on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman was shown a picture of himself from the 1992 Chicago
Bears media guide and was asked to talk about that person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man! That guy right there? He was extremely motivated,''
Spellman said. ``Wow! That guy ... well, he thought he knew
everything. He thought he was going to be the next great defensive
end of the Chicago Bears. Nothing was going to stop him. Fast cars.
Fast money. Fast women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 20-year-old's dream. But he wasn't a bad guy. He
didn't drink. He didn't smoke. But in every other area, he was
always going 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when Jesus Christ came back into my life, I knew I wanted
to start fresh because the Lord had taken away that old spirit.
With my renewed spirit, I didn't want to be reminded of that old
person that I used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I used to put a premium on clothes and shoes, so I gave
away probably $30,000 to $50,000 worth of shoes and maybe $100,000
worth of clothes to family members. It was good for them. It was
even better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate Alonzo Spellman is to measure how far he has come
in five months with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Or in seven months since renewing his faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Or in 20 months since he went spiritually bankrupt and
behaviorally helter-skelter during a SWAT-team standoff in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's the image we have of the old Alonzo Spellman,
unexplainably barricading himself inside the suburban Chicago home
of his publicist for eight hours during a tense standoff with
police that ended only when former Chicago Bears teammate and Hall
of Famer Mike Singletary stepped forward and talked Spellman down
from his emotional ledge.
</P>
<P>
   That same bizarre day, amid the standoff, linebacker Derrick
Thomas of the Kansas City Chiefs tried to convey to Spellman by
telephone that not all was lost, and that Thomas was ready to go to
the wall for him to get the Chiefs to trade for his talents.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a quick happy-ending, the next day Spellman _
shirtless and shoeless _ broke through a hospital door and escaped
what everyone around him felt he needed: medical evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the Bears, who had drafted him as a
20-year-old junior and first-round pick from Ohio State to become
the next Richard Dent, now gave him his unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   Except for some short-lived interest shown by the Jacksonville
Jaguars in August 1998, Spellman remained on the NFL unemployment
line until the Cowboys signed him for the $400,000 veteran's
minimum July 29.
</P>
<P>
   No other NFL team even bid for his services.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this same time that Spellman was given a diagnosis
of] bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. Spellman since has
debunked the diagnosis, although he stops short of explaining what
he means.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Spellman is a Pro Bowl-type player, a model citizen, a
walking-talking testimonial for Jesus Christ, and one of the most
genuine and engaging personalities on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said, ``Alonzo has inspired me in a way that I haven't
been inspired in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's words get stuck in his throat whenever he is asked
about an Aug. 2, 1998 Chicago ``Sun-Times'' report that claimed he
``told \Rhis publicist\S he wanted to kill himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman won't go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to get into what was going through my head \Rin
April 1998\S. But it was a lot ... a lot,'' said Spellman, his
words at first partially choked with emotion, then merely conserved
for another time perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one day I will be able to have a true testimony to
young saints walking into the Christian way of life,'' Spellman
said. ``I know the Lord will put me in that place, and I can talk
to a group of young Christians about the marathon of faith that you
have to run.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had an emotional problem before joining the
Cowboys, Spellman shook his head. And when asked if he has taken
any medication for depression, he shook his head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My medication was my Bible,'' Spellman said. ``It was only my
Bible, because I would never have been able to come back \Rto the
NFL\S with anything else. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman is content for the rest of us to be left in the dark a
little bit about his darkest hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the \RImmaculate Reception\S catch that Franco
Harris made,'' said Spellman with a belly laugh. ``It's not on the
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was careful to say that he doesn't take his unwanted
past lightly, he admitted there is no pain or shame or fear in
recalling these events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he explained, ``I'm completely delivered from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years ago this month, Spellman was baptized in the
Methodist church. He was 3 months old. He was raised in a rough New
Jersey neighborhood by his mother, who worked two jobs, and no
matter if young Alonzo was asleep when he came home, she would wake
him up and have him recite The Lord's Prayer before going back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman experienced peer pressure to join a gang when he 10. By
the sixth grade, he was smoking cigarettes. But he dropped that
habit _ cold turkey _ in the eighth grade because his state
championship basketball team had a chance to participate in the
Junior Olympics in Iowa City, Iowa. His team took home the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could begin to see then how much money you could really make
playing sports. That's why I quit smoking cigarettes,'' recalled
Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's mother kept after him to find a ``church home'' when
he arrived at Ohio State, but he never did, and that's when he
began to drift.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he hit the NFL after his junior year, Alonzo's
drifting had turned into serious running in the fast lane. At that
speed, it was inevitable, somebody was going to get hurt when the
wheels fell off.
</P>
<P>
   And that somebody was him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound strange,'' Spellman said, ``but going through
what I went through is good in one sense. No one can ever say that
it wasn't God who touched my life and who changed me. Only God
could have done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``No human could have done that, it's just not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   His troubled past is a kaleidoscope of wrongdoings and wrong
turns.
</P>
<P>
   He had a confrontation with a Detroit hotel security guard in
which the 6-foot-4, 292-pound Spellman had to be subdued by pepper
spray. Another time, he was found asleep in his car, parked along a
freeway, with an open container of alcohol and no driver's license.
Michigan police once termed him ``a real threat to society.''
</P>
<P>
   And all this happened as recently as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life that I was living was unreal ... something you
normally see only in the movies,'' Spellman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wouldn't have accepted Jesus Christ back into my life, I
wouldn't have been productive in anything every again. Forget about
football ... I wouldn't have been productive in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever think about back-sliding?
</P>
<P>
   Spellman gave an incredulous look, then laughed.

Q&AMP;A WITH ALONZO SPELLMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman sat down and played
``20 Questions'' with Star-Telegram staff writer Ray Buck:
</P>
<P>
   1. You read the Bible every day. How old is your Bible and where
do you keep it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a Bible all my life, but my present Bible is about 2
1/2 years old. I keep it on my bathroom vanity at home. And when I
travel, I always have it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Your favorite Scripture?
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite ``book'' in the Bible is the book of Psalms. It's
basically a book of prayers. I love Psalms. Certainly one of my
favorites, which is really a good one if you find yourself under
attack or fighting out of a hole, is Psalms 35.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The dirtiest player you've ever played against?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, Steve Wisniewski of the Raiders. Kevin Gogan
\RDolphins\S is bad, too, but not as bad as Wisniewski. One time,
Wisniewski chopped me probably five or 10 seconds after the whistle
blew. Gogan's thing is to taunt you into making a mistake so you'll
get a penalty. Wisniewski is flat-out dirty. He's trying to hurt
you, know what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   4. Does the devil exist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's truly a devil. There are evil spirits that lurk
on the dark side, and there is a chief of those evil spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Would you go spend $7.50 to see ``End of Days,'' a movie in
which Arnold Schwarzenegger's character is confronted by the devil?
</P>
<P>
   ``I might go see it. I don't have a problem with a movie like
that because I've seen that kind of stuff for real. So to me, that
wouldn't be a big deal, as long as you stay prayed up.''
</P>
<P>
   6. The last good movie you did see?
</P>
<P>
   ``''Blue Streak'' with Martin Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Do athletes have a responsibility as role models to children?
</P>
<P>
   ``''Athletes responsible?'' We are not responsible for nothing!
I hope to God that no parent tells his or her children to be like
any athlete. One, they never see us in person. Two, what we do on
Sunday is just an act. We do it very well, but it's an act.
Quarterbacks don't walk down the street saying `hut' and defensive
linemen don't walk down the street tackling people. No, I don't
think athletes should ever be put in the light of role models for
children. In my opinion, the only athlete who has been able to do
that _ even he faltered a little bit _ is Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   8. You were Mike Ditka's last first-round draft pick in Chicago.
What was it like being a 20-year-old rookie in 1992 and playing for
Iron Mike?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great. With Mike, there's not much middle ground.
Either you're a player he liked or a player that he didn't like at
all. I was a player he liked, so it was good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   9. How did you get the name Alonzo?
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather. Alonzo was his middle name.''
</P>
<P>
   10. Complete this sentence: The best quality I've gotten from my
mom is _____.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her faith. She has the faith of a giant.''
</P>
<P>
   11. You are 6-foot-4, 292 pounds and considered to be one of the
two or three strongest players on the Cowboys. Is there anyone in
your family close to your size?
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is 6-8. I still look up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   12. You wear a size 18 shoe. How many pairs do you own, and
where do you find them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I own about two or three pairs of dress shoes. I get them from
Atlanta, mail order. But I used to own 25 to 30 pairs of shoes at
one time. I gave them all away about a year ago to my cousins. My
cousins are not small.''
</P>
<P>
   13. Your musical preference?
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay away from music except in the weight room. On my own,
if I was going to listen to music, it would be gospel. What I do
listen to are the tapes of Bishop T.D. Jakes. I listen to him all
the time, every day, whenever I get in my car. That's like music to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   14. You meet an atheist. Do you pity him, ignore him or try to
convince him there is a God?
</P>
<P>
   ``None of those exactly. I would ``warn'' him. To tell an
atheist there is a God would be wasting my breath. But to warn him
... well, there would be no excuse for him later to say, `I didn't
know it was going to get this bad.' That's the direction I would
take.''
</P>
<P>
   15. How much time do you spend in the weight room?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four to eight hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   16. How much time do you spend praying?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in constant prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   17. You are NFL commissioner for a day. What is your first order
of business to improve the league or make the game better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make it that all offensive linemen had to line up with
their feet on the ball. No more advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   18. If you could have anything in the world to eat, what would
it be and who would cook it?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's homemade baked macaroni and cheese. She has an
unbelievable recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   19. You fall asleep and dream. In your dream, you accomplish
something so exhilarating, so unimaginable, but it has nothing to
do with football. What did you dream?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely that I'm playing basketball at the pro level. Me
with about six more inches of height playing in the NBA ... that
would be a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   20. Your biggest pet peeve?
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard stuff around the top of toothpaste and mayonnaise,
anything like that.''

AINGE CALLS THE RIGHT PLAY: FAMILY FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Ainge should be commended for retiring from coaching so he
can spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches must remember their lot in life doesn't mean they should
``fit'' their family in whenever they can. On the contrary. It's
family first, then the job.
</P>
<P>
   That Ainge passed up guaranteed millions to continue coaching
the Phoenix Suns is a testament to his admirable commitment to his
family. Why anyone would believe that no one in this day and age
would dare put their family ahead of work is incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest downfall of our whole society is that
families are being destroyed,'' Ainge said. ``I think fathers need
to take more responsibility and be better fathers, but that's not
my motivation here at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always hoped and prayed we'd have better families in our
whole society. A lot of people miss their children and what's going
on in their families. A lot of families have to have both parents
at work just to survive; it's not easy. But I do have the ability
to spend more time with my children and to make this choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Suns assistant coach Scott Skiles, who has
replaced Ainge, orchestrated an ``ousting'' of Ainge to enhance his
own career. If that's true, then Skiles should know that what goes
around comes around.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge has a wife and five children. With the demanding NBA
schedule, that's a lot of birthdays, PTA meetings, dinners, movies,
outings at the park, and soccer, basketball and football games,
etc., that he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Any precious moment missed with his family can never, ever be
recaptured. Never! Ever!
</P>
<P>
   Those who have children, and really care about their well-being
and moral upbringing, can relate to Ainge. He simply chose his
family over his career, and that's a novelty in a world where
people are too often judged by how much money they make, the size
of their house, the car they drive, and how much power they wield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family unit is probably a little stronger in my \RMormon\S
faith, and my family is obviously very important to me,'' Ainge
said. ``It's been very difficult for me to enjoy seven-game winning
streaks, when the people that are the closest to me, I feel like
I'm not living up to my responsibilities as a father and a husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when you have somebody who devotes 21 years of
their life to you. My teen-age children, my wife and their lives
have completely revolved around mine for my entire career. I want
my life to revolve around theirs at this time in my life. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that simple. It's also true that the world would be a
better place if there were more people who conducted their lives
like Danny Ainge.
\Nsubheds:AROUND THE EAST New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy has
some thoughts on trying to balance his affection for 37-year-old
center Patrick Ewing, and doing what's best for the Knicks. ``I've
learned one thing: Coaching a player on the same team, as he ages,
is the most difficult coaching there is,'' Van Gundy said. ``It
ends ugly far too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Heat coach Pat Riley refers to Charles Barkley as ``one of
the great talents the NBA has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were playing in the Miami Arena a year ago or two
years ago, he went after a loose ball, and he landed in my wife's
lap,'' Riley said. ``And he looked at her and said, `You tell your
husband he can't guard me or stop me.'''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey forward Keith Van Horn shot 50 percent or better from
the field once in his first 17 games. He followed up with four
consecutive games of shooting 50 percent or better (33-of-61),
before going 6-for-15 against Cleveland. During that five-game
stretch, the Nets were 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   During his past 11 games, Chicago's Elton Brand has been the
league's most productive rookie, averaging 18.5 points and 10.2
rebounds per game. In that same period, Houston's Steve Francis was
averaging 19 points and 5.2 assists, while Lamar Odom of the Los
Angeles Clippers was averaging 15.5 points and 6.1 rebounds.
\Nsubheds:AROUND THE WEST The Los Angeles Clippers set an NBA
record for fewest points in a half since the advent of the
24-second shot clock in 1954, when they scored 19 Tuesday against
the Los Angeles Lakers. ``Hey, I almost outscored them by myself,''
said Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who had 16 points by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In a loss to Portland this past week, Sacramento rookie Jason
Williams was ejected for the first time in his career, and cursed
himself afterward. ``I wasn't shooting well,'' Williams said, ``and
I was frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo was all but fired after his
team's 2-16 start. Then he was given a reprieve after the Warriors
beat Atlanta, Minnesota and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle guard Vernon Maxwell averaged 18.7 points during his
first 12 games off the bench, but is only averaging 7.1 points
while shooting 24.1 percent from the field in his past seven games.
``I can go into a funk at least once a year,'' Maxwell said. ``I
just hope this is it _ an early one.''
Douglas C. Pizac Jazz center Greg Ostertag, called for a foul on
this play against Mavericks center Sean Rooks, has been part of a
block party this season.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT Jazz's middle men lead defensive renaissance
Don't look now, but those old guys up in Salt Lake City have
apparently taken their Geritol and are slowly climbing the Western
Conference ladder.
</P>
<P>
   And the Utah Jazz can thank its center-by-committee tandem of
Olden Polynice and Duncanville native Greg Ostertag for the
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Before losing Friday night at Indiana, the Jazz had won seven
consecutive games with a defensive surge led by Polynice and
Ostertag. The Jazz limited opponents to 84.8 points and .403
shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz also averaged 7.4 blocked shots and 9.3 steals per game
in that seven-game span.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in its previous 15 games, Utah allowed 92.6 points
and .460 shooting, and could muster just 4.6 blocks and 7.1 steals
per game. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan knows who gets the kudos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ostertag and Polynice are playing better,'' Sloan said.
``Those guys have been blocking shots and making people aware that
we have somebody in the middle. That's critical to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year veteran, Polynice signed a free-agent contract with
the Jazz during the offseason. Polynice admittedly was tentative
early in the season while learning his new defensive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Polynice has tried to be more aggressive early in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season when I was not sure about things, teams
were just driving in, and I blame myself because I have a lot of
pride in that,'' Polynice said. ``Lately, it hasn't happened as
frequently because psychologically, I've been going into the games
with that mindset that nobody's coming in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, himself a defensive stalwart during his playing days with
the Chicago Bulls, appreciates what Polynice and Ostertag are
giving his team in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about our team,'' Sloan said. ``We're trying to
do the right thing, trying to execute, trying to find the right
person.''

GRETZKY UNDERRATED IN ESPN CENTURY LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What in the heck was ESPN thinking? Better yet, were they
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Wayne Gretzky is only the fifth-best athlete on
their Top 50 list of the century's greatest athletes has to be a
joke. The not-so-funny punch line is that ESPN thinks there are
four athletes who dominated their sport more thoroughly, did more
to promote the game they played or did more to change the sporting
landscape than Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there is only one.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers 1-4 have been surmised to be Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan,
Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown. Gretzky stands second to only Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jordan was good. But did he dominate basketball as
thoroughly as Gretzky dominated hockey? No.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Brown was good. But did his ability change football from a
Canadian game to all the rage in cities like Phoenix and San Jose
and Dallas? No.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Babe Ruth was larger than life. But did his off-the-field
persona rival Gretzky's image as a consummate gentleman and
ambassador of the game? No.
</P>
<P>
   He has the numbers to hang with Jordan, Brown and Ruth. Gretzky
scored 894 goals and assisted on 1,963 more, including his amazing
92-goal season. Gretzky has the championships, too, leading his
team to four Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Only Ali with his dominance and grace on so many levels did more
for sport and society.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is the folks at ESPN used the same line of thinking
that goes into how they do their highlights. You can see every slam
dunk and chest bump from the NBA and every tackle and touchdown
from the NFL and every strikeout and double play from MLB, but the
NHL is often relegated to scores only.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that hockey isn't as big as basketball, football or
baseball, so therefore Gretzky can't be as big as Jordan, Brown or
Ruth. They're right. He's bigger and should have his rightful spot
behind Ali because of it.
Yzerman a throwback, but one that's admired What does an NFL
touchdown minus a dance, Don Nelson admitting he's wrong and the 17
years that Steve Yzerman has spent with the Detroit Red Wings have
in common?
</P>
<P>
   They're all about as rare as a Cowboys victory away from Texas
Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman has spent all 17 of his seasons as a Detroit Red Wing,
growing up with a franchise and a city. In the age of free agency
and trades, it's a feat about as common as the aforementioned
Nelson apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely meaningful to me, absolutely; particularly in
the fact that we have been able to win the Stanley Cup here,''
Yzerman said. ``But the most important, from my perspective, the
biggest reason I am in a good situation, because I play on a good
team with a lot of good players, I don't feel the burden of having
to carry a team or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has been able to float through what has been a
couple of milestone-filled months for him.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, he recorded his 900th assist making him the 10th
player in NHL history to reach that plateau. With an assist on Nov.
20 vs. Edmonton, he became the seventh player in NHL history to
record 1,500 points in a career. Then on Nov. 24, he played in his
1,200th NHL regular-season game, following that up two nights later
on the 26th _ also against Edmonton _ when he became the 11th
player in league history to score 600 goals. Let's just say, it's
been a busy 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it has gone by fairly quickly actually,'' Yzerman said.
``I feel like I have played on four different teams, with four
different groups of guys. ... I have kind of gone through different
groups of players so it felt like different teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman has seen a lot in 17 seasons. The first couple of years
were spent rebuilding. The next couple were spent getting better.
The next couple falling back. The last few have been spent reaping
the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1997 and 1998. But,
Yzerman says he appreciates the not-so-good times, too, especially
now that it is getting close to ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it a difficult time, you know, early in the '90s. Our
team suffered some disappointing playoff losses in the first round.
One to Toronto, one to San Jose, and it was getting very difficult
to play because there was so many questions, you know, was our team
good enough, was our leadership strong enough,'' Yzerman said. ``So
it became difficult, and then to find out we were able to win a
couple of Stanley Cups and now it is kind of _ I guess it is almost
like _ it makes it a lot easier to play right now because we have
answered a lot of questions. So it is a lot of fun to be playing
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after 17 seasons, does Yzerman look to the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get going in the hockey season, you get so caught up
in the present and how you are playing now and how your team is
doing and what is happening right now, you don't think too far
ahead,'' Yzerman said. ``But, again, I hope to play 20 years, you
know, that would take me three more after this. Whether I play 19
or 20 or 21 or 22, I am not sure, but I tried to set a goal of
20.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost guarantee they'll be spent in Detroit.
 &LR; subheds:Around the East  &LR; agatea:What's that your mother used to
say? It's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's exactly what the NHL SuperSkills competition used
to be until Florida Panthers goalie Trevor Kidd dislocated his
right shoulder during the Rapid Fire competition. The Panthers'
best player so far this season will be out for at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. And all for a couple of drills meant to be fun and
gather] participants for the SuperSkills competition at the NHL's
All-Star game in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   If the on-the-verge-of-moving Ottawa Senators think that every
pro sports-hungry U.S. city is going to embrace hockey, thereby
pumping money into owners' wallets the way Dallas did, had better
take a look at the Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four seasons in North Carolina, their first in their
new arena, and they're already having trouble selling out the
place. Meanwhile, another tenant at the recently finished
Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh, the North Carolina State
Wolfpack men's basketball team, doesn't have enough seats to fill
the demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Pack has already sold out all of its Atlantic Coast
Conference games. The Hurricanes, meanwhile, are averaging 12,660
fans a game, a number that looks only to decrease when ACC play
begins in January.  &LR; subheds:Around the West  &LR; agatea:OK, so Clark
Griswold has nothing on the media covering the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   After the charter plane scheduled to take the Oilers and the
accompanying media from New York to Detroit on Tuesday night was
grounded, the team and media were left scrounging for hotel rooms.
There weren't that many available at 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They finally found a place at around 1:30 a.m., but there wasn't
enough room. Guess who was the first to go? Yep, the media. They
were taken by shuttle bus to a nearby motel that, as Oilers beat
writer Robin Brownlee put it, ``was, let's say, not listed in the
NHL media directory.''
</P>
<P>
   They were charged $120 for the night, the transaction taking
place by sliding credit cards to the night clerk hidden behind
bullet-proof glass. The reporters were greeted by, well let's just
say females willing to offer companionship in the lobby, and rooms
that might have been part of a crime scene at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Colorado. Forget Phoenix. Forget San Jose. If the Stars
are going to get back to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Western
Conference road looks to once again go through Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings have won five consecutive games, seven of their
past eight and nine of their past 11. They have the league's best
home record at 15-3-1. They have 46 points through 32 games, the
most they have had at this point in a season since 1995-96, when
they had 48 and finished with an NHL-record 131.

CONTRACTS, NOT TALENT, DICTATE TRADING HABITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was general manager of the San Diego Padres, ``Trader''
Jack McKeon once made a deal while waiting in line to check out of
his hotel during the winter meetings. He tells an amusing story
about plying a fellow GM with drink until he agreed to another
trade.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, now the Reds' manager, would not enjoy being a GM today.
This year's winter meetings concluded with only a couple of trades
of significance, not because the modern-day GMs don't have McKeon's
appetite for dealing, but because they are constrained by
economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much fun as I had, I was in a different era,'' McKeon said.
``You made trades the old fashioned way. You traded player for
player. You didn't have to worry about contracts, you didn't have
to go to management and see if you had the finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, finances and free agency dictate everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time you mention a guy, the first thing they look at
is the contract instead of the statistics,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a handful of GMs deserve credit for making _ or trying
to make _ trades this off-season despite the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers traded for Juan Gonzalez even though he can became a
free agent at the end of next season. It cost them a solid starting
pitcher in Justin Thompson, a talented young outfielder in Gabe
Kapler and a future closer type in Francisco Cordero for a player
who might walk after one season.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies gave up a couple of former No. 1 draft choices for
Andy Ashby, another player who can become a free agent after the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox surrendered a top prospect in Adam Everett for
Astros outfielder Carl Everett, knowing they might only have him
for one season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were willing to send their closer, Armando Benitez,
plus talented youngsters Octavio Dotel and Roger Cedeno, to the
Mariners for Ken Griffey Jr., knowing full well he too can be a
free agent this time next year. Griffey vetoed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, clubs aren't willing to take that gamble.
Mike Hampton, Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez and Mike Mussina, four
more high-profile members of next year's free-agent class, could be
had for the right price but received scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, I think you're going to find those players back
with the same team,'' Dierker said. ``I don't think anyone can
justify giving up a number of players and a vast amount of money.
The Mariners have not won their division year after year with
Griffey, so there's no guarantee you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Braves never were a serious entry in the Griffey
sweepstakes. It widely was assumed they would be the front-runners
when the superstar outfielder went on the block, but when
preliminary conversations with the Mariners included names such as
Andruw Jones and Kevin Millwood, the Braves dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they pay a high price in young talent when they can
shower him with Ted Turner's millions next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested, but if you're talking about some of the
players I've heard, the price is pretty steep,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said. ``Especially if you can bid on him next year
without giving up players.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different era, it's a chance Trader Jack willing would
take. Now, the cost is simply too high. Good deal The Astros went
to the winter meetings with a glut of outfielders and hoped to deal
one for help elsewhere, but were finding no takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have extra outfielders, and almost everyone
needs pitching depth,'' Larry Dierker said. ``It's hard to offer a
team an outfielder when they're trying to give you an outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meetings, though, they made a good trade by swapping
Adam Everett for Carl Everett, a deal that helps both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost their shortstop when Ricky Gutierrez became a
free agent. Adam Everett played at the Double-A level last year and
probably needs more minor-league seasoning, but eventually he
should be an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett gives the Red Sox a major upgrade in center field
over Damon Buford and Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The trade also means that Moises Alou, who missed all of last
season while injured but had an MVP-caliber year in '98, isn't
likely to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be best taking him to spring training and playing him,''
Dierker said. ``He's clearly one of our best three outfielders.''
Hot-stove embers Cubs manager Don Baylor expects new second baseman
Eric Young's defense to improve once he's reunited with Gene Glynn,
who coached him in Colorado. ``I saw the improvement from working
with Gene,'' Baylor said. ``Everyone in the infield I assigned Gene
Glynn to got better. I wanted to let EY know that program was going
to start again. I told EY he could be a good second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox talked before the winter meetings about making an
offer for Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez but didn't send GM Ron
Schueler to Anaheim, Calif. Was a Rodriguez pursuit just wishful
thinking? ``That was prayerful thinking,'' manager Jerry Manuel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon wasn't upset that GM Jim Bowden wasn't able to trade
for Ken Griffey Jr. ``I don't think there's any club in baseball
that wouldn't like to have him,'' Bowden said. ``But I like the
guys I have, too. They played hard for me last year.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon sees NL rookie of the year Scott Williamson as one of the
most dominating closers in baseball in the near future. ``I
envision him being a Trevor Hoffman in another year or two,''
McKeon said. However, the Reds will consider making him a starter
if they have a hole in the rotation next season.

REPORT: STANLEY SUED PIGGIE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The men involved in JaRon Rush's suspension are
reportedly at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles sports agent Jerome Stanley has sued Myron Piggie,
Rush's former AAU coach, for $43,500 in unpaid loans, according to
a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's suit was filed earlier this year, according to the
Kansas City Star, and seeks payment on loans made to Piggie between
Aug. 1, 1997 and May 8, 1998. Rush was a senior at Pembroke Hill
School at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The loans were intended to help Piggie promote Stanley's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rush reportedly received $200-$300 from Stanley, a violation of
the NCAA's extra-benefits rule. UCLA is also examining Rush's
financial relationship with Piggie, who's under federal
investigation for tax evasion and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie denied receiving the loans and said he and Stanley have
done nothing improper.

CELTICS DROPS 9TH STRAIGHT ON ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ No relief here. What looked to be the Celtics' best
hope for a win on the road this week ended up like all the others
in the past seven days. Geez, can Paul Pierce be this valuable?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Celtics followed the same suicidal pattern
that has plagued them all week _ poor defense, falling behind,
inopportune breakdowns, late rotations, rushed shots, and, needless
to say, another loss. This one was a 100-94 setback to the Rockets,
who themselves are struggling and rebuilding and, as is their wont,
came close to blowing a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't, and now we have to deal with the math. It isn't
good. The Celtics have dropped five in a row to fall to 10-13. They
have lost nine straight on the road since their win in Toronto on
Opening Night. They are falling like a stone with no relief on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time to get down,'' said Kenny Anderson, who had 23
points. ``I've been through this before. You have to stay
professional, stay together, and continue to play hard. (If you
don't), the roof will cave in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might suggest it already is falling. Coach Rick Pitino
watched in equal parts exasperation and disbelief as his team again
unraveled. The Celtics led early but fell behind in the second
half, the greatest deficit 17 with 9:04 left. They trailed by 13
with 4:18 left. They did get to within 4 but no closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the collapse was in again,'' Houston coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. His team had lost five straight and only
Wednesday had blown a fourth-quarter lead in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics were forced to foul, and Houston made its free
throws _ 15 of 21 in the quarter. That made up for horrible
shooting (27 percent) from the floor in the fourth quarter _ the
Rockets made one field goal in the final 9:04 and still won the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to finally get a win,'' said Kelvin Cato, who had a
career-high 27 points and 12 rebounds. ``It ain't the championship.
But it's better than losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hallway, Antoine Walker, who had a dreadful first half
(1 of 7, 0 rebounds) and a terrific second half (20 points), was
making what has now become a daily request: Please let us get us a
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fight our way through it,'' he said. ``Obviously,
we're disappointed. But we have got to find a way to win. We can't
wait for Paul or Danny (Fortson) to come back. We have to do it
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics did have Vitaly Potapenko back after a three-game
absence due to a calf strain. He had 8 points and 6 rebounds in 30
minutes. But the Celtics were again beaten up inside, as Houston
had a 48-38 rebounding advantage and shot 40 free throws to
Boston's 24. The Celtics also didn't rotate well when they
double-teamed Cuttino Mobley (21 points) or Steve Francis (15
points.) Cato (11 of 13) got a lot of dunks, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is getting annoyed by all this, Pitino said, ``I
made up my mind this year I'm not going to get upset at anything.
Even this type of basketball at the beginning is not going to break
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a close game into the third, when the Rockets made their
first breakaway move. A 9-0 ran capped by a Cato 3-point play (and
a Rudy T fist pump) made Houston's lead 59-50, up to then the
largest of the game. Houston got it to 12 and led, 76-66, entering
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets appeared to settle things with a 10-3 run to open
the final quarter, capped by, of all things, an unchecked stroll
across the lane from Bryce Drew for his only hoop of the game. That
made it 84-67. Boston, however, awoke and went on an 11-0 run to
get to within 6 before a quick, 7-0 Houston counter (capped by a
Mobley trey) made it 93-80 with 4:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as the Celtics have been in digging holes, they've
been just as resilient in trying to dig their way out. They got to
within 4 (94-90) on a Walker trey with 1:27 left. But instead of
fouling Cato (a 59 percent free-throw shooter) or Kenny Thomas (a
59 percenter), they went after Mobley, who shoots 85 percent from
the line, or Francis, a 75 percenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, when you have a chance to win, you foul the wrong
people. You can't do that,'' Pitino said. ``You've got to be
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't. That's how you end a rally and lose a game.

BRUINS OUT OF SYNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Burn the video, folks, because this one wasn't
pretty. Saturday night's game was delayed almost a half-hour
because of a problem with the boards at the Kiel Center. Perhaps it
would've been better for the Bruins if it had never gotten started.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins looked slow afoot, out of synch, and offensively
challenged as they were run over by the Blues, 4-0, the third time
this season Boston has been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins couldn't get control of the puck and when they did,
they couldn't do anything with it. After a victory in Atlanta
Friday night, it was a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, forward Rob DiMaio was one of the most visibly
upset Bruins. ``It's a shame,'' he said, ``because the coaches know
exactly what to say and when to say it and how to win. We go out
and we're on our own program some nights. We know better and it's
got to stop. This is nuts. It's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe was equally perplexed. ``We kept it close,''
he said, ``but I don't know. The emotion was not there tonight.
It's been a bit of a trend the last 10 games or so. We come out
with a good game, and then, for some reason or another, we're not
getting up for the next game. It's a serious problem that we really
have to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins actually came out pretty well, getting their first
scoring chance just over a minute into the game. Forward Steve
Heinze, who has struggled offensively with one goal in his last 16
games, made a nifty move down the slot to avoid Blues' captain
Chris Pronger, who was diving. Heinze dished a pass to DiMaio,
whose shot at 1:07 was turned back by goalie Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:25 gone, left wing Dave Andreychuk centered a pass to
defenseman Darren Van Impe, whose one-timer from the left circle
rocketed on net only to be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Thornton, who went into the game with no shots in his
last three games, took a shot from the left point at 10:26, setting
up a rebound chance for right wing (and ex-Blue) Joe Murphy. But
Murphy's shot from the right circle was gloved by Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game turned completely around with St. Louis
outshooting Boston, 10-3, the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   One of their best chances came at 13:32 as a result of a Bruins'
turnover. Left wing Tyson Nash relayed a long lead pass for center
Craig Conroy. Conroy tested Dafoe with a backhander from the left
side, but Dafoe made the save.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues got on the board with a power-play goal at 16:45. With
St. Louis skating with a four-on-three advantage, Pronger, at the
left point, slid the puck across for defenseman Al MacInnis, who
possesses one of the hardest slap shots in the league. He
demonstrated it again as he drilled a shot from high in the right
circle that blistered past Dafoe high to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   It was MacInnis' fifth goal of the season and the Blues were up,
1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins struggled even more in the middle period as they
simply couldn't get their offense on track. They had a power play
early in the period when left wing P.J. Axelsson was high-sticked
at 4:34. But the only shot they mustered was by Heinze at 6:13. The
rest of the time, the Bruins were hard pressed to keep the puck in
the offensive zone and at one point, the Blues had a two-on-one
shorthanded break.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's fortunes took a turn for the worse at 9:59, when
Clinton native and former BU standout Scott Young gave the Blues a
2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Scott Pellerin scampered up the left side and made a
perfect feed across the slot for Young, who banged a shot in at the
right post.
</P>
<P>
   Through two periods, the Bruins were having a hard time in the
faceoff circle and center Jason Allison, who had been able to take
them faceoffs the last few games, didn't take any.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was called on to make tough saves back to back with about
four minutes left. Center Mike Eastwood tested him with a forehand
shot from in tight and then got the puck back, this time trying a
backhanded wraparound at the right post but the goalie held the
fort.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' most inspired moment came at 3:05 of the third
period, but it was also one of the more devastating because the
Blues wound up with a five-minute power play.
</P>
<P>
   Nash battled Ray Bourque along the boards and Bourque knocked
him down. Taking exception, Nash charged Bourque from long distance
and hit him from behind. Bourque turned and threw Nash to the ice.
Murphy, seeing Nash's hit, jumped him and started pummeling Nash in
defense of Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was the only player penalized, being hit with a
five-minute major and game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said it was not the proper time for such an
action. ``I don't think it was the right way to do it,'' he said.
``I was shocked and surprised more than anybody on the whole thing.
At least he showed some fire and some care anyway, but it's not the
way you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the devastation began as the Blues scored twice on the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Young picked up his second goal of the night at 3:54, scoring on
a breakaway. MacInnis sent a long lead pass for Young, who got
behind Bourque and Hal Gill, and charged in, beating Dafoe to the
glove side.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis assisted on the fourth St. Louis goal at 6:49. His slap
shot was stopped by the glove of Dafoe, but the goalie couldn't
hang on to it and Michal Handzus buried it from in front for the
4-0 romp.

KINGS RIPPED BY BLACKHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's too bad every last person didn't get one of
those juicy, chocolate-dipped strawberries they were serving in
some of the suites and in the press box. Then they would have at
least gotten something appetizing for the big bucks of venturing to
pricey Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   They were rich, tempting to the palate, aesthetically pleasing
and, above all, prepared impeccably.
</P>
<P>
   They were everything the Kings were not.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in five days the Kings were humiliated.
Jean-Pierre Dumont scored twice as the lowly Chicago Blackhawks
blasted the Kings 8-4 before a sellout crowd of 18,118 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kings coach Andy Murray held a team meeting in which
he stressed accountability, singled out players for poor play and
said lineup changes are next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could go wrong in a game went wrong for us,
but you create your own environment,'' Murray said. ``We created
ours with turnovers and poor execution in our game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, you need your leaders to pull you through a
situation like this. What you're dealing with now is somewhat of a
question in the belief system, and the belief in themselves,
probably, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season the Kings (16-11-6) lost three in
a row, though that's not the problem. The reason for the meetings
and the contemplated changes are the results: A 7-1 loss at New
Jersey, an 8-3 loss at the New York Rangers and then the debacle
against the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Kings been outscored 23-8, but they've allowed
13 first-period goals in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to think you hit rock bottom,'' Murray said.
``I thought we hit rock bottom after New Jersey. It's a pretty sick
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Kings, the darlings of the NHL the first two months,
could find themselves last in the Pacific Division if the Mighty
Ducks beat Detroit tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all mental right now,'' Kings winger Luc
Robitaille said. ``Everybody wants to make the right play, get a
steal in the middle, instead of playing our simple game.''
</P>
<P>
   More distressing for the Kings is they had two days of meetings
and hard practices to stop the free fall. Murray tried to stop the
``same ol' Kings'' mentality from sinking in during a 65-minute
team meeting Thursday, including a gruesome viewing of all 15 goals
on videotape. That was followed by a rigorous, up-tempo practice
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It did nothing to stem the downward spiral that threatens to rip
apart all the good things the Kings did during the first 30 games
of the Murray era.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings played fundamentally poor hockey. They chased
in their own zone, made ill-advised cross-ice passes, lacked hustle
on the backcheck and were beaten to loose pucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings committed silly penalties, fell behind early, at times
showed disinterest and demonstrated none of the fire and
desperation some players talked about the previous day. They also
allowed four power play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six minutes in, the Blackhawks led 3-1. Less than nine
minutes into the second period the Kings accomplished another
dubious feat. For the third consecutive game, their starting goalie
was pulled, this time Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, I didn't make the big save to keep the team
in the game,'' said Fiset, pulled after the Blackhawks' sixth goal
in less than 30 minutes. ``We don't want to live that video again,
those meetings again. We've been through that the last few days,
but we have no choice here.''

FISET IS A FLOP IN RETURN AS STARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There seemed to be at least a morsel of good in
the previous two blowouts. Sure, the Kings were thumped and goalie
Jamie Storr failed to play beyond the first period in losses to New
Jersey and the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the other side of it was Stephane Fiset got to shake off the
rust of five weeks of inactivity with 80 minutes of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   That surely would prove crucial since it was later discovered
Storr was suffering effects of post-concussion syndrome. He was
placed on injured reserve, but with Fiset proving his injured right
hand was again healthy, it cushioned the blow of losing Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fiset was bombarded in the first period by the Chicago
Blackhawks on Saturday. The Blackhawks scored on three of their
first four shots, and knocked Fiset out less than 28 minutes into
his first start since Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who missed 14 games with a right hand contusion, allowed
six goals on 21 shots before being yanked in favor of Marcel
Cousineau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the puck was the size of a pea,'' Fiset said. ``I
couldn't stop it. I was fighting everything. I was probably too
nervous at the beginning and probably putting too much pressure on
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Fiset was injured, he was one of the best goalies in the
league and perhaps the biggest reason the Kings were consistently
among the top few teams. He was 7-4-3 with a 2.45 goals against.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered the contusion to his right hand just five days
after inking a three-year contract extension with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goaltending isn't at the level we need to have it,'' Kings
coach Andy Murray said in summarizing how Storr and Fiset played
lately.
</P>
<P>
   It brings up an interesting scenario as the Kings enter a
difficult three game spell against San Jose, Phoenix and Colorado.
Will Cousineau will remain on the bench, or get a shot if Storr
doesn't return and Fiset doesn't return to early-season form?
</P>
<P>
   Smokin' Smolinski: Bryan Smolinski's first-period goal extended
the center's point-scoring streak to seven games. His value to the
Kings goes beyond his goals and assists, but the scoring doesn't
hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski entered the night leading the Kings with 24 assists
(third in the league) and 31 points. He also had 14 assists in his
past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the guys who kept us afloat here,'' Murray said.
``He's been strong down the middle, has been a guy that I feel I
can depend on, and as coaches, we can depend on him.''

   From the point: For the third time in less than a week the Kings
faced a former coach. Chicago coach Bob Pulford coached the Kings
from 1972-1977 and still hold the franchise mark with 178 wins. New
Jersey head coach Robbie Ftorek and Devils assistant Larry Robinson
are both former Kings coaches. . . . The Kings' next win will be
the 1,000th in franchise history.

 &HT;    There's a dazzling array to keep track of the day
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Stumped about what to give the friends and
relatives remaining on your holiday shopping list?
</P>
<P>
   What better year to give a calendar than 2000? (OK, so some of
you will argue for 2001.)
</P>
<P>
   With an average price of $10 to $16, a wall or desk calendar is
an affordable, easy-to-wrap _ even mail _ last-minute gift that
recipients of all ages will find useful.
</P>
<P>
   Today's calendars not only help keep track of our busy lives,
but entertain and educate as well.
</P>
<P>
   A calendar can be a personal gift: Just match the recipient's
hobby or special interest.
</P>
<P>
   And the choices are amazing. Today's mega-bookstores stock as
many as 400 calendar titles with categories ranging from Irish and
Religious to Girlfriends and Golden Retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who love beautiful photography can spend their days gazing
at colorful cardinals or sun-drenched village streets of Provence.
Sports enthusiasts can pick up tips on fly fishing, golf or tennis.
Bridge players can spend 366 days perfecting their game.
</P>
<P>
   You can begin each day with a horoscope, inspirational verse,
quips from your favorite humorist or a gourmet recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the kids. Calendars help the little ones understand
the concept of time, and those aimed at older children provide
interesting information on subjects ranging from the Civil War to
baseball. Educators say a calendar, with its bite-sized bits of
information, motivates children to read.
</P>
<P>
   Some calendars include coupons, and a calendar purchase can
benefit your favorite charity. ``The Millennium of Hope'' calendar,
with colorful artwork done by children affected by AIDS, benefits
pediatric AIDS research. Call (877) 687-5437 or e-mail
hope(at)vtechkids.com.
</P>
<P>
   Visit a local museum store for art and nature calendars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most appreciated calendars is the one you create
yourself. Print shops, such as Kinko's Copies, can help you turn
favorite family photos into a yearlong keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of 2000's interesting calendar possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   _ In ``Look-Alikes'' (Workman, $9.95) nothing is what it seems.
Award-winning artist Joan Steiner has created a clever
three-dimensional world using commonplace objects that look like
something else. The whole family will find this one intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mom's Plan-et'' (Avalanche, $12.99) is a 16-month organizer
that includes 198 stickers (everything from ``haircut'' to
``vet''), extra-large grids, a storage pocket and magnetic hanger
for the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cynthia Hart's ``Family Scrapbook Calendar'' (Workman, $11.95)
is intended to become a scrapbook when the year has ended. It comes
with plastic templates and suggestions for cropping photos. The
calendar and stickers are printed on acid-free paper with acid-free
inks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workman's new Page-A-Day Stickies are clever. You can tear off
the pages and stick them anywhere _ on the fridge, a computer
screen, bathroom mirror.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Popular Mechanics'' calendar includes 365 helpful tips
for maintaining your home and car ($10.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ What's neat about the daily spin calendars from Avalanche
($11.99) is their shape. The pages are swirled and they sit on a
removable plastic easel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top-selling calendars for the kids this year, according to
Border's Books, Music and Cafe: Make Your Own Calendar, American
Girls, Winnie-the-Pooh, Curious George, Wizard of Oz and Stickers
and Scribbles.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best-selling calendar in the United States for the past 14
years? ``The Far Side Off-The-Wall 1999 Calendar'' sold 2.8 million
copies. Its publisher, Andrews McMeel, publishes 100 titles each
year. According to Ann Binkley of Border's, the ``Far Side
Millennium Boxed Calendar'' is one of this year's top sellers along
with: Pokemon, artist Thomas Kinkade, the Dilbert box calendar,
Backstreet Boys, Ansel Adams, Mary Engelbreit and the Sierra Club.

 &HT;    Fund-raising looms larger in GOP race
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The kind words and warm smiles that marked
relations between the top Republican candidates disappeared in the
chill of an Iowa evening last week as the campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination entered a more combative phase.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) tangled
over campaign finance reform and, to a lesser extent, taxes at
Monday's debate in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the week unfolded, the Bush and McCain campaigns traded
criticisms over each other's stands on campaign finance reform.
``Bush stands as guardian of special interest control of political
process,'' one McCain news release began.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign Web site headlined the candidate's opposition to
McCain's proposal to ban the unregulated, unlimited contributions
to political parties known as soft money. The McCain proposal ``has
a huge loophole that benefits Democrats and would hurt the
Republican Party and our conservative principles,'' Bush said in a
statement. Bush wants to block the mostly-Democrat labor unions
from designating a portion of members' dues for political activity.
</P>
<P>
   These exchanges were a far cry from the stout praise each man
had offered the other in recent weeks. They reflect one major
point: To the extent that Bush has a serious challenge on his
hands, McCain is the only Republican candidate who appears capable
of upsetting his carefully laid plans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has drawn even with Bush or pulled ahead in various polls
in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary Feb. 1.
McCain's independent streak and call for reform play well in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is counting on attracting traditional Republican voters
and social conservatives by portraying campaign reform as a
detriment to the GOP. Those voters play a more important role in
such states as South Carolina, another early test Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Dollars providing Bush organizational advantage
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign operates on a much smaller budget than Bush's.
And while the senator has tried to use his more nimble organization
as a symbol in his underdog campaign, last week provided two
glimpses of Bush's massive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced comprehensive organizations in Michigan and
Florida. Michigan's Feb. 22 primary is potentially significant, if
McCain wins in New Hampshire or South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain laid out a modest package of health care reforms Tuesday
in South Carolina. But for the second straight week, campaign aides
scrambled after the fact to provide an estimate of how much the
proposals would cost. A speech on defense policy a week earlier
also lacked price tags.
</P>
<P>
   California justices sink proposal on redistricting
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court last week blocked a proposed voter
initiative that would have stripped the state Legislature of its
power to draw congressional and other electoral districts and
handed it to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a victory for Democrats, who control both houses
in the Legislature as well as the Governor's Mansion. Legislatures
around the nation will draw new district lines in 2001, following
release of the results of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, fearing huge losses in the largest state, sought to
limit the Democrats' influence on the process.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans already had poured $1 million into
building support for the issue. But the strategy they settled on
was, in the end, their undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that most voters would be indifferent, at best, to a
mundane ballot question about redistricting, the measure's backers
combined it with a provision to reduce the salaries of state
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The court decided that putting the two issues together violates
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: Campaign gifts are at root of problems
</P>
<P>
   As McCain and former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley held their
unusual joint meeting on campaign finance reform Thursday, Bradley
began airing a new ad on the topic in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Using a town hall setting, Bradley tells the audience that
eliminating soft money is important ``to virtually everything
else'' he would try to do as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``National health insurance: Give me a world with campaign
finance reform, (and) it's gonna be a lot easier,'' Bradley says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most presidential candidates will spend the early
part of the week in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, then
retire from the campaign trail until after the new year.

   EDITORS: The New York Times News Service plans the following
stories from the year-end Business Outlook section of The Times,
which is being published Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   (The stories and accompanying artwork will move beginning Sunday
afternoon in the ``f'' news file. This material replaces the Monday
Business section of The Times.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-ECONOMY (Undated) _ Historians say the Internet
should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a
successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological
step than a leap forward. Still, whether labeled a revolution or an
evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to
become greater and greater. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic showing
business investment in computers, peripherals and software.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-REFLECTIONS (Undated) _ When eight well-known executives
were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last
100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably
talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad
forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet. By
Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-READER-VISIONS (Undated) _ Asked for proposals to
improve the human condition in the next century, people were
generous with their ideas. Many visions fell into broad categories
like health, nutrition, education and transportation. This article
offers a sampling of responses.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-DEMOGRAPHICS (Undated) _ Five years into a booming
economy, America is ``depleting its pool of available workers'' _ a
warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of
known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply
an expanding work force _ and sustain a robust economy _ into the
new decade. This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and
potential immigrants. By Louis Uchitelle. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-FED (Undated) _ A look at the past and future of the
Federal Reserve, which has risen from virtual obscurity to near
omnipotence. By Richard W. Stevenson. (With graphic showing GDP for
the last 100 years.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CURRENCY (Undated) _ The history of money and its
future. The century began with a universal money _ gold _ and ends
with gold all but eliminated. In its place are national currencies,
some floating, some fixed to major currencies and one supernational
currency, the euro. A look at what lies ahead. By Floyd Norris.
(With graphic showing the value of the U.S. dollar since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BIOTECH (Undated) _ For several years, the big quest in
biotechnology has been to determine the complete sequence of human
DNA, the genetic code of life. Now, however, that task is nearing
completion, and the biotechnology industry is facing an even
tougher job _ deciphering that code so that new drugs and
diagnostic tests can be developed. By Andrew Pollack. (With graphic
on biotech stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AGRICULTURE (Undated) _ Agribusiness leaders are as
confident as ever that the need to feed a growing world population
makes it both essential and inevitable that biotechnology will play
a central role in 21st century farming. But for now it looks like
the industry may be pulled over by consumers and fined by investors
for recklessly speeding toward such a future. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans who have complaints about
the health care system may soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many
health care professionals expect the medical system in the United
States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades
that many patients will not be able to recognize it. By David J.
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AUTOS (Jackson, Mich.) _ A look at how the car-buying
experience may change in the coming decades. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AIRCRAFT (Washington) _ Aviation, which enters its
second century in 2003, is still far from a mature industry, and
for the next decade it seems likely to move in two directions at
once. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-OIL (Undated) _ Of all the pressures on the oil industry
as the century turns, the one most likely to transform it over the
next two decades, industry experts say, will be the fervent
campaign to improve the environment. By Kenneth N. Gilpin. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS-REED (Undated) _ As a young Citicorp executive
more than 20 years ago, John S. Reed earned a reputation as a
technology guru. Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the
country's largest financial services concern and the creation of
last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his
interest in technology, Reed admitted in an interview that the
impact and importance of the Internet escaped his attention until
recently. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS (Undated) _ In the wake of the historic changes
made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation
is expected among financial services companies, creating more
conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United
States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment
bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say. By Patrick
McGeehan. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The changes remaking retailing come
not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases but in
what they expect their dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than
they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet
that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes,
than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores. By Leslie Kaufman.
(Graphic showing Wal-Mart vs. online retailers.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HOTELS (Undated) _ A look at trends that will take the
hotel industry profitably into the next decade. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BLOOPERS (Undated) _ A look at the century's biggest
business blunders. By Floyd Norris. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SCAMS (Undated) _ A look back at the century's major
scandals. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ If using the Internet rather than
spread sheets and word processors is driving the growth of the
personal computer industry, then mobile access to the Internet is
likely to dominate in short order. Who could possibly argue that
surfing the Web while trapped sitting in a chair at a desk is
natural or inevitable? The one flaw in this argument is that PC
sales are not shrinking. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-DAD (Undated) _ The Internet has many fathers,
but few deserve the label more than Robert W. Taylor. In 1966, as a
director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency
Information Processing Techniques Office, Taylor came up with the
idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. An interview. By
John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WEB-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ If 1999 was the year everyone
started saying that Internet-based software would replace
conventional programs, 2000 will surely be the year the transition
begins in earnest. By Lawrence M. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET (Undated) _ Future developments in the Internet
regarding business should come in waves. Those who are studying the
relationship between business and the still-primitive and slow
Internet say that in five or 10 years those waves could well
reshape the way business is conducted. This transformation will
happen because, very basically but profoundly, the Internet permits
ease and breadth of communication, provides newfound mobility and
allows complex transactions to take place among numerous parties in
far-flung regions. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-E-COMMERCE (Undated) _ Ten years ago, Internet
prognosticators sounded overzealous when they suggested that a
network of computers would recast every facet of society. Some of
the most futuristic and utopian predictions may never play out, of
course. But the Net does seem to be bringing irrevocable change to
one part of life: buying stuff. The E-commerce column. By Bob
Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMUNICATIONS (Undated) _ Over the last decade,
cellular telephones have evolved from oddity to indulgence to
everyday accessory. Discuss the future of wireless technology with
leading communications executives, and the words ``phone'' and
``telephone'' may not be used at all. That is because they see the
future of wireless technology as having little to do with talking
and everything to do with putting the Internet into pockets and
purses around the world. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-PATENTS (Undated) _ The patents column: The debate, and
resulting litigation, over the importance of patents in the
Internet's development. By Teresa Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-NEWSPAPERS (Undated) _ Challenged to recreate themselves
both online and in print, newspapers _ and their advertisers _ have
a greater appetite for information about their appeal, their
audiences and their competition than ever, according to both those
who gather data on the Internet and those who use the data. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Shakespeare's exclamation ``O
brave new world'' is an appropriate way to begin an examination of
what advertising will be like when years no longer begin with 19.
It is even more appropriate that those words are from ``The
Tempest'' because the changes facing Madison Avenue in the next
decade will be nothing if not tumultuous. By Stuart Elliott. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MOVIES (San Francisco) _ Throughout the entertainment
industry, from the major studios to Internet start-up companies,
people are attempting to figure out how the rapidly emerging
digital technology will affect the movies people see and the ways
they see them. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-TELEVISION (Undated) _ Although executives in the worlds
of television and entertainment are not entirely certain about the
details of the convergence of television, computers and broadband
cable systems, all agree that the experience of watching television
will prove extraordinarily different in 26 years from today's
viewing. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WALLSTREET (Undated) _ Electronic trading is driving new
market structures, so Wall Street is approaching the new millennium
the way superstitious pilots approach the Bermuda Triangle _
fearing the worst, hoping for the best but prepared for just about
anything. By Diana B. Henriques. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MARKETS (Undated) _ The upward march of the stock market
indexes has become so inexorable in recent years that most
strategists no longer weigh whether the market will rise next year.
Instead, they speculate on just how much higher it will go. By
Gretchen Morgenson. (with graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ Last month, with about
six weeks left in the century, Mary Meeker, head of the Internet
research team at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Jeff Camp, who
follows Internet data services for the firm, sat down to talk about
the future of Internet stocks. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MUTFUNDS (Undated) _ Are the mutual fund industry's best
days behind it? Sales gains are slowing. Fund company stocks are
lagging. Some fund investors have taken their big gains and cashed
in. And challenges from cheaper institutionalized money managers,
online brokerage firms and other new competitors have led some
analysts to predict that the industry is only starting to see tough
times. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMODITIES (Undated) _ If the decade of the '90s was
the greatest ever for stock prices, it was one of the poorer for
commodity prices. But as the decade ends, there are signs of life
in commodities. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing the
CRB Index since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTEREST-RATES (Undated) _ Inflation is calm. The
Federal Reserve is vigilant. And the Federal budget deficit has
disappeared. So conditions should be right for long-term interest
rates finally to fall decisively below 5 percent, a level they have
seen only briefly in the final third of the century about to end.
Maybe. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing interest
rates since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WORKPLACE (Undated) _ Across the country, thousands of
people who tried working from home part time during the 1990s have
returned to the office full time. It is enough to make one wonder
whether the workplace of the early 21st century will in fact
resemble a traditional office much more than was once thought. Do
not be fooled, workplace experts say, contending that in reality
this is the lull before the telecommuting storm. By David
Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CORPORATIONS (Undated) _ For five years a klatch of
management scholars and forward-looking executives has met at the
Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology to ponder a question: What will be tomorrow's model for
business success? By Fred Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-GLOBAL (Washington) _ A decade ago it would have been
hard to imagine that at the end of the century the world economy
would mix unparalleled American ascendancy with such pervasive
global anxiety, or that free-marketeers would be celebrating the
triumph of market capitalism while so many around the globe
questioned the cost of its victory. By David E. Sanger. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-JAPAN (Tokyo) _ To almost everyone's surprise, the
Japanese economy showed remarkable _ and remarkably diverse _ signs
of life this year. But there are many contradictions in the
economy, making it difficult to be either optimistic or pessimistic
when it comes to Japan's prospects as the century turns. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CHINA (Beijing) _ When negotiators from China and the
United States clinked their champagne glasses here last month to
celebrate a trade agreement between the two countries, nobody
exulted more than China's Internet entrepreneurs. The deal, which
opens the door to China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
will also allow foreign companies to own stakes of up to 50 percent
in Chinese Internet companies by 2006. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ After weathering a year of debt
defaults, a currency crash, an absentee president and governments
that change with the seasons, Russians have one piece of good news:
The economy has not collapsed. By Neela Banerjee. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Europe enters the new year
and the new millennium on a mission of staggering scale: an
expansion of the European Union by 13 countries and some 170
million people. By Edmund L. Andrews. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ On the theory
that things cannot get much worse, Latin America is looking to the
start of the new decade with anticipation. The past year has been a
difficult one, more onerous even than the crisis that followed the
Mexican meltdown in December 1994: It began with a currency
collapse in Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with
the numbers now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's
large economies struggling to emerge from recession. By Larry
Rohter. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-ASIA (Singapore) _ Southeast Asia's battered economies
have bounced back this year, and the most serious concern in the
year 2000, economists say, will not be the region's enduring
banking mess but the possibility that things could unexpectedly
turn ugly in the United States or Japan. By Wayne Arnold. (With
graphic.)

</P>
<P>
   (The stories and accompanying artwork will move beginning Sunday
afternoon in the ``f'' news file. This material replaces the Monday
Business section of The Times.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-ECONOMY (Undated) _ Historians say the Internet
should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a
successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological
step than a leap forward. Still, whether labeled a revolution or an
evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to
become greater and greater. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic showing
business investment in computers, peripherals and software.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-REFLECTIONS (Undated) _ When eight well-known executives
were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last
100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably
talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad
forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet. By
Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-READER-VISIONS (Undated) _ Asked for proposals to
improve the human condition in the next century, people were
generous with their ideas. Many visions fell into broad categories
like health, nutrition, education and transportation. This article
offers a sampling of responses.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-DEMOGRAPHICS (Undated) _ Five years into a booming
economy, America is ``depleting its pool of available workers'' _ a
warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of
known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply
an expanding work force _ and sustain a robust economy _ into the
new decade. This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and
potential immigrants. By Louis Uchitelle. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-FED (Undated) _ A look at the past and future of the
Federal Reserve, which has risen from virtual obscurity to near
omnipotence. By Richard W. Stevenson. (With graphic showing GDP for
the last 100 years.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CURRENCY (Undated) _ The history of money and its
future. The century began with a universal money _ gold _ and ends
with gold all but eliminated. In its place are national currencies,
some floating, some fixed to major currencies and one supernational
currency, the euro. A look at what lies ahead. By Floyd Norris.
(With graphic showing the value of the U.S. dollar since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BIOTECH (Undated) _ For several years, the big quest in
biotechnology has been to determine the complete sequence of human
DNA, the genetic code of life. Now, however, that task is nearing
completion, and the biotechnology industry is facing an even
tougher job _ deciphering that code so that new drugs and
diagnostic tests can be developed. By Andrew Pollack. (With graphic
on biotech stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AGRICULTURE (Undated) _ Agribusiness leaders are as
confident as ever that the need to feed a growing world population
makes it both essential and inevitable that biotechnology will play
a central role in 21st century farming. But for now it looks like
the industry may be pulled over by consumers and fined by investors
for recklessly speeding toward such a future. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans who have complaints about
the health care system may soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many
health care professionals expect the medical system in the United
States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades
that many patients will not be able to recognize it. By David J.
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AUTOS (Jackson, Mich.) _ A look at how the car-buying
experience may change in the coming decades. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AIRCRAFT (Washington) _ Aviation, which enters its
second century in 2003, is still far from a mature industry, and
for the next decade it seems likely to move in two directions at
once. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-OIL (Undated) _ Of all the pressures on the oil industry
as the century turns, the one most likely to transform it over the
next two decades, industry experts say, will be the fervent
campaign to improve the environment. By Kenneth N. Gilpin. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS-REED (Undated) _ As a young Citicorp executive
more than 20 years ago, John S. Reed earned a reputation as a
technology guru. Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the
country's largest financial services concern and the creation of
last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his
interest in technology, Reed admitted in an interview that the
impact and importance of the Internet escaped his attention until
recently. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS (Undated) _ In the wake of the historic changes
made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation
is expected among financial services companies, creating more
conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United
States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment
bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say. By Patrick
McGeehan. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The changes remaking retailing come
not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases but in
what they expect their dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than
they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet
that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes,
than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores. By Leslie Kaufman.
(Graphic showing Wal-Mart vs. online retailers.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HOTELS (Undated) _ A look at trends that will take the
hotel industry profitably into the next decade. By Edwin McDowell.

   RUSSIA-VOTERS (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Her husband walked
through mushy snow, still in his thick brown knit sleeping shirt,
to vote early in Russia s parliamentary elections Sunday, but Maria

democracy. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (MozdoK, Russia) _ Mikhail A. Kashpurin is a
frail old man with years of valorous service in the Soviet army, an
unblemished labor record and a story to tell. It boils down to
this. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place was
Grozny and the time was Russia's ongoing military campaign. By
Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   MACAU-CHINA (Macau) _ With the solemn lowering of one flag and

   JAPAN-EXECUTIONS (Tokyo) _ Japan executed two convicted felons

   GATSBY-OPERA-1920S (New York) _ The technique of evoking
vernacular music has a long heritage in opera, and John Harbison
conceived ``The Great Gatsby'' as an extension of the tradition.
The iconic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, on which the opera is based,
is set in the Jazz Age, the early 1920s. So the narrative is filled
with popular songs, dance music and show tunes from the period. The
work receives its world premiere Monday at the Metropolitan Opera.

   GATSBY-OPERA-LYRICIST (New York) _ Murray Horwitz has been a

National Public Radio. So when the composer John Harbison was

AS DATA ABOUT READERS GROWS, NEWSPAPERS ASK: NOW WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., La., Ill., N.Y., Fla., Calif., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, around midafternoon, Jennifer Musser, an editor of
philly.com, finds out more about her audience than any print editor
has ever known. On Dec. 5, for instance, she knew that the Web
site's most-visited article was The Philadelphia Inquirer's account
of a 76ers' basketball game, with 4,097 hits, and that the average
visitor stayed three-and-a-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer's article on a crack addict who starved her
daughter to death got barely a third as many hits, but the average
visitor lingered almost five-and-a-half minutes over the wrenching
account. Another article, a review of a performance by the rock
singer Beck, had an unusual number of hits _ because, Ms. Musser
later discovered, a Web site for the artist's fans had set up a
link to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Musser's Web site, www.philly.com, is owned by Knight Ridder
and offers visitors every article in the company's two Philadelphia
papers, The Philadelphia Inquirer and its rival, The Philadelphia
Daily News. Then it makes available to the newspapers' editors the
core data accumulated on those visits.
</P>
<P>
   Such data _ similar to the feedback that Nielsen ratings have
given television programmers and far more detailed than gross
measurements like circulation or even readership _ is golden to
newspapers as they enter the year 2000. Challenged to recreate
themselves both online and in print, newspapers _ and their
advertisers _ have a greater appetite for information about their
appeal, their audiences and their competition than ever, according
to both those who gather and those who use the data.
</P>
<P>
   What they find and how they use that information is likely to
reshape the business of newspapering, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a proliferation of news and information
sources, so people's expectations have changed,'' said Greg
Martire, the managing partner of the research firm of Clark,
Martire &AMP; Bartolomeo. ``The traditional role of the newspaper has
been nibbled away from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free weekly is doing a better job reporting on soccer
leagues; CNN is doing a better job of providing instant worldwide
coverage,'' he added. ``Given that, the newspaper has held up
remarkably well.''
</P>
<P>
   But declining circulation figures over 15 years reflect the
erosion of the audience. And years of increasing data about
audience preferences offer tempting solutions. In addition, highly
advanced presses and increasingly computerized delivery systems now
provide more opportunities to adapt to reader preferences.
Newspaper Web sites offer even more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   One core question is how willing publishers should be to marry
the data about audience preferences to the technologies that allow
them to accommodate those preferences.
</P>
<P>
   J. Walker Smith, the president of Yankelovich Partners, the
market research firm based in Norwalk, Conn., said studies by his
firm argue for more customization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to customize things,'' he said. In a world of
incessantly expanding choices, ``it will be harder and harder for
media to intrude their way into people's attention spans,'' he
added. ``Instead, they are going to have to find a way to get an
invitation to be in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, then, have an incentive to customize. But how?
Customizing for the mass market _ giving most prominence to the
articles that tend to attract the most readers _ may result in a
less attractive product.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in the news business,'' said Tom Rosenstiel,
the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a press
watchdog group based in Washington, ``my first editor said: Assume
that no more than 15 percent of the people want to read any of
these stories. So lay out your front page so that everyone who is a
potential reader wants to read at least one story.'' He added,
``The great risk of knowing how many people read every story, but
not knowing who the people are, is that you start producing only
those stories that will reach a large number of people, and in the
end, the result is you end up with even fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how people behave (their true news tastes) may not, for
instance, be the same as knowing how they see themselves. For 12
years, the Pew Research Center in Washington has conducted surveys
on the most-followed news events. There is no easy way to correlate
these with Nielsen ratings, which come closer to measuring actual
behavior. But some of the most closely watched news events, like
the O.J. Simpson trial and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales,
do not even make the top 20 on the Pew list.
</P>
<P>
   The probable gap between what people say and what people do
reflects a basic problem in the customization effort, at least when
it comes to general news. It is unclear how audiences will react if
editors tailor products to what readers show they care about at the
expense of what they say they care about _ or the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the audience for newspapers is not necessarily the
same as the audience for news online. Ms. Musser at philly.com, for
one, says that the demographics of her online news audience are
different _ younger and more male _ from those of the average
newspaper audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carol Perruso, president of latimes.com, the online site of The
Los Angeles Times, has found in recent surveys that online news
consumers themselves can be divided into two groups. ``People who
went to portal sites and television news sites such as MSNBC tended
to put a higher premium on breaking news and news summaries,'' she
said. ``And people who went to newspapers' sites favored in-depth
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while many newspapers are splitting into offline and online
versions of themselves, with slightly different audiences, they are
finding that both audiences value one of newspapers' traditional
strengths _ their depth.
</P>
<P>
   On the business side, too, there are similarities between
newspapers and their online offspring. For instance, they share the
need to keep the high-margin classified-ad franchise from being
taken over by online help-wanted sites like monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   But they have different business imperatives. It is not at all
clear that the print business model _ a combination of advertising
and circulation revenue _ will work online, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new business model is one reason Knight Ridder,
Tribune Company and The New York Times Company are exploring the
ways to have their digital properties _ Knightridder.com, Tribune
Interactive and The Times Company Digital _ issue securities that
will tap into the high value of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting infusion of capital, the companies hope, could pay
for everything from acquisitions to technological experiments that
could reduce dependence on advertisers and create services or
information packages for which subscribers would pay a premium.
</P>
<P>
   The printed newspapers, more than half of which are part of
larger newspaper chains, are meanwhile rethinking everything from
their size to their delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers, like The Washington Post and The Miami Herald,
have cut costs by reducing the width of their pages by half an inch
to save paper.
</P>
<P>
   And The Arizona Republic is perfecting a computerized delivery
system that would break apart the six-day or Sunday or both
subscription schedule and allow subscribers to opt for, say, just
the Wednesday newspaper, with the grocery ads, and the Friday
paper, with its entertainment listings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that has changed in the newspaper business in the
last century, one thing has remained constant, the amount of time
people say they spend with their daily newspaper: 15 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the average amount of time 4,000 Chicago businessmen
said they spent when they were surveyed in 1916, amid World War I.
It is the average 1,761 New York college students said they spent
in 1920. And it is the figure that emerged from focus groups
convened in recent years by Clark, Martire &AMP; Bartolomeo, the
research firm, in dozens of cities. Martire said the number did not
change even when the number of pages changed. ``The smaller paper
they just read more intensively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philly.com visitors stay, on average, 11.5 minutes, according to
the Web monitoring firm I/Pro. In the Internet Age, with the
nirvana of large broadband information pipes said to be just around
the technological corner, such persistent results are a reminder
that at the end of the bursting pipes is a human brain with an
appetite for general news that is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply has vastly expanded,'' said Rosenstiel, the media
critic. ``The natural human instinct for how much news you need,
how much time you spend absorbing the world around you, has not
changed.'' At least not in terms of reading habits.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, casts doubt on the proposition that people will
eagerly take on the task of sorting through the new avalanche of
information themselves. ``If people aren't spending any more time''
reading news, in print or online, he said, the idea ``that everyone
will be their own editor doesn't work in real life; people do not
have time.''

BOOKS THAT WILL GIVE YOUNG READERS HOURS OF ENJOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable

paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times

TELECOMMUTING, THE NEXT PHASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ill., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there was a company likely to take to telecommuting, it
is AT&AMP;T. The huge corporation has thousands of employees around the
world. Many perform white-collar tasks that can be accomplished on
computers and sent over the Internet. Even the company's bottom
line can benefit when its workers dial into the company's network
or pick up the phone to call headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1999, five years after AT&AMP;T began a formal telecommuting
program, the percentage of managers who worked from home at least
once each week dropped to 24 percent, from 29 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is AT&AMP;T alone.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, thousands of people who tried working from
home part time during the 1990s have returned to the office full
time. Many felt disconnected from their colleagues, became
frustrated about slow computer hookups or simply grew tired of
trying to be a parent and an employee at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to make one wonder whether the workplace of the
early 21st century will in fact resemble a traditional office much
more than was once thought.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be fooled, workplace experts say, contending that in
reality this is the lull before the telecommuting storm. Companies
and workers alike are working out early kinks and awaiting new
technology, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to transform the workplace,'' said John A.
Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a
Chicago outplacement firm. Over the next few years, analysts say,
flexible work arrangements will force companies to reassess how
they use space and cause more people to take part-time jobs or
become independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   As broadband Internet access begins to enter homes in the next
year _ the change AT&AMP;T says its telecommuters are waiting for _ the
office computer will no longer be so much faster than the home PC.
And as the cost of videoconferencing equipment continues to fall,
the technology will soon be affordable to many more people.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic forces are playing a role, as well. As the number of
baby boomers taking care of elderly parents grows, the ability to
stay home will become more attractive. The current tight labor
markets, meanwhile, are certainly vulnerable to economic cycles,
but they are also a product of population trends that will continue
through the first few years of the new decade, forcing employers to
look for highly skilled workers wherever they can find them.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of human resource executives recently polled
by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas said that telecommuting would be
the most important workplace trend of the 21st century _ ranking it
higher than any other subject. And while statistics on the subject
are notoriously unreliable, most analysts agree that at least 10
million Americans now telecommute regularly, and that number is not
expected to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The hiccups of the last few years are not uncommon when new
technology is adopted. Such practices often go through three
stages, said John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems,
which builds much of the networking behind the Internet. First
comes an initial excitement; then skepticism that the trend will
truly take off, and, finally, widespread acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is now moving out of the second of those stages,
many workplace experts say.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 1990s, telecommuting captured workers'
imaginations as a way to hold on to their careers and salaries
while removing some of the strain of long weeks at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Managers, for their part, realized it could help them cut down
on real estate costs and potentially even improve productivity by
making workers happier. Often, however, both sides underestimated
the ensuing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many companies rushed into telecommuting,'' said Rick
Wald, a principal at the human resource consulting firm William M.
Mercer, who advises companies on flexible benefits. ``It really
requires training for managers. They need to manage people
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the lesson that Merrill Lynch learned, and its
response offers a glimpse of what telecommuting could become. In
1994, it started a pilot program but quickly discovered that
neither telecommuters nor their bosses were ready for all the
questions that arose: How often should a worker check voice mail?
Is day care still necessary? Do telecommuters really work full
time?
</P>
<P>
   So two years later Merrill Lynch created an elaborate training
program for people who wanted to work at home sometimes, said
Janice Miholics, a vice president for alternative work arrangements
in the private-client technology group. Employees must write a
formal proposal to enter the program. Both they and their bosses
then sit through a two-hour training session. Finally, the
telecommuters spend their first two weeks in transition, dialing
into the office from an on-site laboratory, where they are given a
laptop, printer and other equipment to take home.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Miholics' division, 350 of the 1,800 workers now
telecommute at least once a week. Only one employee has ever
stopped telecommuting for a reason other than a job change, she
said. ``It's allowed us to retain some critical people who
otherwise would have left,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Other companies are learning the same lessons. ``We're starting
to sift out a lot of the failed programs,'' said Christena
Nippert-Eng, a sociologist at the Illinois Institute of Technology,
who has studied telecommuting. ``The programs that exist now are
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The next problem will be deciding what to do with the office
when it has fewer people in it, workplace experts said. One
solution, called hoteling, involves getting rid of permanent
offices and instead assigning full-time workers to a new office or
cubicle each day, depending on what is available.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's largest consulting firms, where employees
are often out of the office on assignment, have adopted hoteling
and cut down their real estate costs. But it has failed to catch on
elsewhere because employees often find it dehumanizing. ``When you
play with someone's space, you're playing with 8 to 10 to 12 hours
of their day,'' said Robin Szumyk, a principal in William M.
Mercer's human resources practice.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Lisa Hilbish, an account executive in Charlotte, N.C.,
for Ceridian Employer Services, which sells payroll software to
companies. She works from home about twice each week and said it
was a benefit that made her more likely to remain in her job. The
one complication, however, is that, when she decides to come into
the office on short notice, there are often no desks available, and
she must work in a room used for employee breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of loud,'' Mrs. Hilbish said. ``You don't get as
much done.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, some companies are building space for specific
departments or teams so that workers can feel at home there, even
if they are sharing it with colleagues, said Susan L. Boyle, a
managing partner at HLW International, a New York workplace
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, does not solve the problem of what to do when
everybody shows up on the same day. Such questions will loom over
the workplace in the next few years as telecommuting becomes more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology piece will get itself worked out. The security
piece will get itself worked out,'' Ms. Boyle said. ``But there's
an emotional piece, too.''

LIFE OF PROSE AND POETRY: AN INSPIRING COMBINATION

 By MARGE PIERCY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever I face an audience with at least minimal familiarity
with my work, there are two questions always asked: ``Why do you
write both fiction and poetry?'' ``What's the difference between
writing poetry and fiction?''
</P>
<P>
   I have various glib answers I whip out of my failing brain. I
mention that while it may be rarer for men to cross genre lines,
some, like Richard Price, who produces fiction and film scripts,
do. However, many women work in more than one genre, and then I
rattle off a list: Margaret Atwood, Erica Jong, Adrienne Rich,
Alice Walker, Rita Dove, Colleen McElroy, Nikki Giovanni, Joan
Didion, Lillian Hellman, Linda Hogan; and that's without trying
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I say that if a writer works in more than one genre,
the chances of getting writer's block are greatly diminished. If I
am stuck in a difficult passage of a novel, I may jump ahead to
smoother ground, or I may pause and work on poems exclusively for a
time. If I lack ideas for one genre, usually I have them simmering
for the other.
</P>
<P>
   I am always going back and forth. It's a rare period that is
devoted only to one. That happens when I am revising a novel to a
deadline, working every day until my eyes or my back gives out, and
when I am putting a collection of poetry together, making a
coherent artifact out of the poems of the last few years and
reworking them as I go.
</P>
<P>
   I see this essay as an opportunity to ask myself about writing
both poetry and fiction in a more incisive way. Poetry feels as if
I transcend myself while working on what is often very personal
material. When I am fully engaged in writing a poem, the ``I'' is
less intrusive, less present than at any other time except deep
meditation. But the intense concentration of making a poem is quite
different from the intense focus of meditation, because rather than
clearing the mind, the mind is wildly busy and open. The stray
images and thoughts that the meditator blows away are the rich
suggestive stuff of poems. Every little gnat of irrelevancy may
turn out to be what the poem is really about.
</P>
<P>
   Some poems come entire, bless them, dictated by the muse or
ha-Shem or the tooth fairy. They arrive. They may be important or
trivial. When I am discussing inspiration with students, some of
whom always want to overvalue the spontaneous, I tell the old
chestnut about the Boston Brahmin who woke in the middle of the
night from the revelation of the truth of human relationships,
wrote down the awesome words and in the morning found, ``Higgamous
piggamous, men are polygamous; hoggamous, poggamous, women,
monogamous.''
</P>
<P>
   Poems start from a phrase, an image, an idea, a rhythm insistent
in the back of the brain. I once wrote a poem when I realized I had
been hearing a line from a David Bryne song entirely wrong, and I
liked it my way. Some poems are a journey of discovery and
exploration for the writer as well as the reader. I find out where
I am going when I finally arrive, which may take years.
</P>
<P>
   Poems hatch from memory, fantasy, the need to communicate with
the living, the dead, the unborn. Poems come directly out of daily
life, from the garden, the cats, the newspaper, the lives of
friends, quarrels, a good or bad time in bed, from cooking, from
writing itself, from disasters and nuisances, gifts and
celebrations. They go back into daily life: people read them at
weddings and funerals, give them to lovers or soon-to-be ex-lovers
or those they lust for, put them up on their refrigerators or over
their computers, use them to teach or to exhort, to vent joy or
grief.
</P>
<P>
   The mind wraps itself around a poem. It is almost sensual,
particularly if you work on a computer. You can turn the poem round
and about and upside down, dancing with it a kind of bolero of two
snakes twisting and coiling, until the poem has found its right and
proper shape.
</P>
<P>
   There is something so personal and so impersonal at once in the
activity that it is addictive. I may be dealing with my own anger,
my humiliation, my passion, my pleasure; but once I am working with
it in a poem, it becomes molten ore. It becomes ``not me.'' And the
being who works with it is not the normal, daily me. It has no sex,
no shame, no ambition, no net. It eats silence like bread. I can't
stay in that white-hot place long, but when I am in it, there is
nothing else. All the dearness and detritus of ordinary living
falls away, even when that is the stuff of the poem. It is as
remote as if I were an archaeologist working with the kitchen
midden of a 4,000-year-old city.
</P>
<P>
   Prose is prosier. No high-flying language here. My urge to write
fiction comes from the same part of my psyche that cannot resist
eavesdropping on strangers' conversations in airports, in
restaurants, in the supermarket. I am a nosy person. My mother was
an amazing listener, and she radiated something that caused
strangers on buses to sit down and begin to tell her their life
stories or their troubles. I have learned to control that part of
myself, but I am still a good interviewer and a good listener
because I am madly curious about what people's lives are like and
what they think about them and say about them and the silences
between the words.
</P>
<P>
   I always want to hear how the stories come out, what happens
next, a basic urge all writers bring to fiction and one pull that
keeps readers turning page after page. Another drive is the desire
to make sense of the random, chaotic, painful, terrifying,
astonishing events of our lives. We want there to be grand
patterns. We want there to be some sense in events, even if the
sense is that no one is in charge and entropy conquers; that all is
illusion or a baroque and tasteless joke. Each good novel has a
vision of its world that informs what is put in and what is left
out.
</P>
<P>
   I write character-centered fiction, which means it is almost
never high concept, and my plots are neither tight nor ingenious. I
get to know my major characters very well indeed before I write a
word of the novel. Most of what happens simply proceeds from the
interaction of the characters with one another and their
environment, their history, their circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my training as a novelist came from listening to adults,
mostly women, talk, eavesdropping on gossip and scandal. My mother
read palms and dispensed advice freely but clandestinely, for my
father would have been furious if he had known. He disliked
irrationality. I overheard and pondered: What did Mrs. G. walk in
on between her husband and her sister? Why did Mr. A. disappear
after he hit on the numbers? Why did my mother sigh whenever she
mentioned the young woman next door?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My other early training was in the importance of viewpoint. My
grandmother Hannah, who lived with us part of every year and shared
my bed in our tiny house, was a storyteller in the shtetl mold. She
told me tales of the golem, Lilith, dybbuks, flying rabbis, but
also stories of our extended family. My mother told those stories,
too, but quite differently. If I heard the same story from my Aunt
Ruth, who was midway in age between my mother and me and more like
my girlfriend than my other aunts, there were three versions of
every story: the spiritual and moralistic, the sensational and
dramatic, and the factual, exactly what happened and what was the
evidence for various opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For me the gifts of the novelist are empathy and imagination. I
enter my characters and try to put on their worldviews, their ways
of moving, their habits, their beliefs and the lies they tell
themselves, their passions and antipathies, even the language in
which they speak and think: the colors of their lives. Imagination
has to do with moving those characters through events, has to do
with entering another time, whether of the recent past or 300 or
500 years ago, in Prague or Paris or London or New York or the
islands of the Pacific. It has to do with changing some variables
and moving into imagined futures, while retaining a sense of
character so strong the reader will believe in a landscape and in
cities and worlds vastly different from our own.
</P>
<P>
   Do the genres ever overlap? Oddly enough, fiction and poetry
approach most closely when I am doing research for a novel. I have
a series of poems in ``Available Light'' that come from researching
``Gone to Soldiers,'' finding the precise places where certain
events happened during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of place is extremely important to me in being able to
enter a characters past or present. I may not need long in a city
or in a landscape, just a matter of hours or days; but without that
immersion, the writing is much harder. Out of these journeys poems
arise, sometimes directly, finding the exact spot through a maze of
logging roads in the Montagne Noir where the Armee Juive met the
Germans in battle, from surviving descriptions; sometimes
accidentally, as in encountering a hungry dog outside the ramparts
of Aigues-Mortes, giving him a baguette as a joke and being shamed
by his joy and pride in his find.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas for poems come to me any old time, but not generally ideas
for revising poems. The notion that revising poems is a different
process from revising fiction occurred to me on the treadmill, but
I cannot imagine that I would ever think about actually revising a
poem there. When I rewrite a poem, I go back into the space of the
poem and contemplate it. I read it aloud. The only other time when
I work on revising a poem is the first or second time I read it to
an audience, when all the weak and incoherent parts suddenly
manifest themselves big as the writing on billboards.
</P>
<P>
   With fiction, since I live inside a novel for two or three
years, the problem is letting go when I am done for the day. Ideas
for what I am working on come in the night, in the tub, on planes,
in the middle of supper. I keep a notebook on the night table, so
that when an idea bombs in at 2 a.m., I will not get up and turn on
the computer. One reason I learned to meditate was to control my
fictional imagination and not let the characters take me over.
Learning to let go except for those occasional flashes is central
to keeping my sanity and my other, real relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, I perform poetry regularly for audiences and thus enjoy
the same feedback a musician does: applause, emotional response,
that heat a crowd whose attention you have captured gives off. With
fiction I am dependent on fan mail and critical articles. Although
people have asked me to write a novel for them about their lives, I
have never been tempted. But with poetry I have written poems for
occasions, as most poets do. I have also written liturgy that is
used by some Reconstructionist and Reform congregations and also
Unitarian poetry intended for public performance by people who are
not poets. I think poetry ultimately is a more communal activity
than fiction, but I love both equally.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a young Citicorp executive more than 20 years ago,
John S. Reed earned a reputation as a technology guru for his
stubborn insistence that automated teller machines _ faceless boxes
that spit out money _ would eventually make legions of human bank
tellers unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   After the bank initially lost millions of dollars on his ATM
bet, Reed was vindicated: the gizmos are now as common as corner
newsstands. And empty teller windows at many banks attest to the
fate of the machines' human counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the country's
largest financial services concern and the creation of last year's
merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his interest in
technology, Reed admits that the impact and importance of the
Internet escaped his attention until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has now snared the attention of everyone in the
banking industry. Companies are rushing to create Internet banking
capabilities, either as part of the bank, as in Citigroup's case,
or as an entirely separate entity. While no clear leaders have
emerged among the banks, Wells Fargo and Bank One have been
particularly aggressive competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that tackling the challenges of the Internet was now a
high-priority at Citigroup. Indeed, a job reshuffling in July put
Reed in charge of Citigroup's Internet strategy, while Citigroup's
other co-chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, retains most of the
other operational duties at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Midtown Manhattan office, Reed shared his
thoughts about the Internet, online financial services and the
future of banking.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Reed: First of all, this is a revolution. I believe we are
living through a sea change. In the next few years, a lot of
customers are going to be dealing with their finances over the
Internet. Today, about 25 percent of the U.S. population is on the
Internet; 75 percent is not. It is growing rapidly. Around the
world the numbers are different, but, still, the growth is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What regions around the world are growing fastest in Internet
usage?
</P>
<P>
   A: Japan, Brazil, Singapore are hot spots. The problem right now
is, No. 1, the terrestrial competition is pretty good. Sitting down
and paying bills with a check, having a checking account and cash
machines is pretty easy. So in order to have the Internet be
attractive, it has to be better than things that are already pretty
effective and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that will make a significant difference over
time is pricing. Pricing on the Internet will be significantly
cheaper. You pay more for terrestrial banking services because of
the cost of operating a branch network. The Internet world won't
have those costs and, therefore, should be priced more
attractively. We need to be able to translate those cost savings to
the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is a difference between being ``on the net'' and
``of the net.'' ``On the net'' means someone comes on, they find
us, and they find what they're looking for. ``Of the net'' means
we're embedded in someone else's offering.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why has online stock trading taken off so much more rapidly
than online banking?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're happy writing checks and dealing with your bank in
the normal way, there is not tremendous motivation to get you onto
the Internet. I think one thing that is causing banks to be slow
compared to brokers is that banking is a much more complex
relationship. In Japan, 20 percent of our customers are coming to
us through the Internet or by phone. When they sign up, we send
them the forms and they sign. They never see a branch; they never
deal with us physically.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason they deal with us is they are looking for the
products we offer that are not available from their local Japanese
banks. For whatever reason, they are electronically comfortable,
and they come in and deal with us. It is an important part of our
growth. I think here in the States it will come in time, but it
will come when there is a clear price advantage.
</P>
<P>
   We should be able to pay people a lot more for their money. I
think we are going to develop a set of people who deal with us
differently. They are going to deal with us over the Internet and
with cash machines and they will never see a branch. They won't
care about a branch. Then the question will be, why did they choose
us, and it's going to have to be some sense of ``OK-ness'' with who
we are and some degree of the quality of service of the
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that this notion of community is very important in the
electronic world. I think the bank will have to establish some kind
of community feel. The customer has to enjoy interacting with us,
feel good about interacting with us. We are going to have to do a
lot of experimenting as to what constitutes that kind of community.
Advice is going to turn out to be one of the key issues. I think to
a much greater degree than we recognize, people come into the
branches of banks because they want to talk to people. That
dialogue gives them a sense of how they should manage their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that is broken up demographically _ that younger
people may be willing to find their advice in a medium like the Net
rather than rely on an adviser in a branch?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that is true. I just don't have the data to support
it. I have a feeling most of us are quite ignorant about finance.
It's amazing to me _ I have friends who are professors at famous
universities who are absolutely naive with regard to money. That's
because there isn't any part of the normal education process that
teaches you, unless you're raised in a family where your parents
talked to you about these things. It's just not a subject you run
into.
</P>
<P>
   So I would guess that half of the people who run into
difficulties with a credit card never learned the fundamental
disciplines of a budget. And it doesn't make any difference how
much money you have, whether it's a lot of money or a little money.
Actually people with a little money tend to learn a lot more
quickly because they get forced by the world to learn how to manage
their resources. The good news is I have a feeling that, 30 to 45
years from now, we will have a much better-educated public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are these things getting increasingly commodified as the
consumer is getting more educated?
</P>
<P>
   A: If somebody arrived from Mars and you put a Ford and Chevy in
front of them, I think they would have a hard time deciding what
the difference is. The point is, a car is a car is a car, and big
differences are really quite subtle. So from the perspective of a
Martian, let's face it, most banks aren't all that different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the differences matter in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will matter, but we need to form these communities, and we
are going to have to be warm and fuzzy and meaningful. Yes, there
will be subtle differences with presentation and style and so
forth. I was talking to Bob Pitman from America Online. He
estimates that 80 percent of the people on the Net are looking for
convenience and 20 percent are looking for price. So a feeling of
convenience is going to be important. Someone has to know who you
are, who they are taking money from and so forth. It isn't as
though you can just go in and buy a share of stock with anyone _
you have to set up a relationship. And once you set up the
relationship, the likelihood is you'll stick with it. But it is all
open space right now.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you worry about Quicken or AOL getting between you and
your customers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. I do believe that it will be a revolution. Like all
revolutions it will be very easy to get lost. We have not figured
it out. You can see the P/Es of these Internet companies, and you
say to yourself, ``You know what? What the market is saying to you
is, `If you can get your business into the Internet space, it is
more valuable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it more valuable? Because your cost of acquiring
customers is very small compared to terrestrial stuff. Your cost in
serving a customer is almost negligible. If you do want to play,
you have to confront the question of ``OK, how do I operate in this
space? How do I get from here to there?''
</P>
<P>
   I just spent an extended period meeting with Internet companies.
I was probing to see what sort of inner contradictions there were
that might bring this all to a screeching halt. I was trying to
figure out if this thing is really going anywhere. And I believe it
is. Maybe 20 percent of the G.N.P. is highly susceptible to
disintermediation by the Internet. That's a lot of money. This will
be profound.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who do you worry about the most?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't worry about anybody. The challenge is ours. I admire
_ and that's a little different from worry _ AOL. AOL is clearly
predominant. I have been in business for a very long time, and
there are very few instances where people start from zero and end
up with 20 million customers. And they have done precisely that. We
did that with our credit cards. Maybe _ and I don't know the facts
here _ our friends at Fidelity did that with mutual funds. This
idea of being able to gain customers at that speed is more
noteworthy than people think.
</P>
<P>
   I am a revolutionary, as you may know, and anytime you give me a
fork in the road where the choice is a slow change or a revolution,
I will always take the revolution. I am a great believer that that
is how changes take place. The Internet is real. It is fundamental.
And it is also a young person's game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a manager of this, what are the questions you are not
seeing answered that you would like to see answered, or issues
explored that are not being explored?
</P>
<P>
   A: From my point of view, we have to figure out fundamental
economics. We have to worry a lot about privacy, how to treat
customers. And we have to get working on some of these expert
systems and selling and so forth and so on. We bring some specific
knowledge of how our business works, and we are going to have to
let people who know a little bit more about the Internet worry
about how to do the software.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is going to be fun and games. It's going to
be quite a big change in the next 10 to 15 years.

DOES A SLOWING OF NEW CASH PORTEND PROBLEMS FOR THE FUND
INDUSTRY?

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are the mutual fund industry's best days behind it?
</P>
<P>
   Sales gains are slowing. Fund company stocks are lagging. Some
fund investors have taken their big gains and cashed in. And
challenges from cheaper institutionalized money managers, online
brokerage firms and other new competitors have led some analysts to
predict that the tough times for the industry are only starting.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the amount of new money flowing into stock mutual
funds has slowed: In the first 10 months of this year, cash flows
into equity funds totaled $142.9 billion, slightly ahead of $141
billion for the period last year but well below the record pace of
1997. That year investors poured in a net of $193.6 billion through
October and $227.3 billion for the full year. What is more, sales
growth for taxable bond funds has slowed considerably, as just
$14.4 billion flowed in this year through October, in contrast to
$50.7 billion for the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior fund flows were extraordinary because a good bit of it''
was from large companies creating 401(k) plans, said A. Michael
Lipper, the chairman of Lipper Inc., the fund research company in
Summit, N.J. ``That's a one-time impact.'' Lipper added that
household ownership of funds might be approaching a saturation
point as the growth in the percentage of people who own funds
begins to decelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most people in 401(k) plans have already shifted money
from bonds, money market funds and other conservative investments
to equity funds. That means future growth will come mostly from
additional contributions to retirement or brokerage firm accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the slowdown in fund inflows is lingering
investor trauma from late 1998, when the Russian economic crisis
and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. sent
markets plunging. Another factor, no doubt, is the rise in
popularity of online stock trading. Given all these factors,
analysts and fund company executives say fund inflows could remain
tepid for some time, even if the stock market continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that many longtime fund investors are now
redeeming fund shares to enjoy some of their gains. Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve Board chairman, for example, has suggested that
gains in the stock market and in home values have led to increased
consumer spending and helped sustain the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   A first-ever joint survey conducted this year by the Securities
Industry Association and the Investment Company Institute lends
support to Greenspan's theory: Outside of employer-sponsored
retirement plans, only 57 percent of investors put all the proceeds
from their most recent mutual fund sales back into the market; the
other 43 percent spent at least part of the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The high stock market volatility of the last year has not helped
fund sales. And funds have been feasting off the stunning market
run-up of the last five years, adds John C. Bogle, founder and
senior chairman of the Vanguard Group, the nation's No. 2 mutual
fund company after Fidelity Investments. Without that wind at their
backs, he saidfunds are likely to be merged into other funds
or liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market-dependent business,'' Bogle said. ``The
forecast for the future is basically what the markets are going to
do. If we're in for a more subdued market, that's going to put
pressure on cash flows. I would look for pressure on cash flows to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the industry's worries is that the new money that has
flowed into funds has gone mainly into the hottest funds, while
some weaker funds have suffered net redemptions. Consequently,
Bogle predicted that more than a quarter of today's funds could be
liquidated or merged out of existence over the next five years. ``I
don't expect these great markets to continue,'' Bogle said.
``Reversion to the mean will take its toll'' on many funds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, funds that mimic the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index have significantly outperformed most general equity
funds, and that, too, has dimmed the luster of actively managed
funds _ even though many funds managed to beat the S&AMP;P for part of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funds have for a long time underperformed the market,'' said
Harold Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. People
``perceive they can do better buying their own stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   That dissatisfaction with actively managed funds has led some
investors to forgo funds in favor of accounts at online brokerage
firms. Forrester Research has estimated that total assets in online
accounts will approach $400 billion this year, triple the total
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from clear just how much money is being taken out
of funds to buy stocks: In the joint survey, only 6 percent of
investors said that the money for their most recent stock purchase
came from selling equity fund shares; in contrast, 8 percent said
the money for their most recent mutual fund purchase came from
selling shares of individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems may loom for the industry. The 401(k) flows
that have become a bedrock source of new money _ one-third to
one-half of sales each year at some fund companies have been to
employer-sponsored retirement accounts _ are facing increased
competition from separate, or co-mingled, accounts, where money is
pooled and managed for less than a retail fund typically charges to
handle accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The shift of 401(k) money away from funds has been significant
among employer plans with more than 5,000 participants, said Ryan
Tagal, an analyst at Cerulli Associates, a Boston consulting firm.
Lower cost is the biggest reason, he said, with managers of
co-mingled accounts willing to handle money much more cheaply than
retail funds do. ``Mutual funds are probably too expensive for
these large plans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A serious and prolonged market slump, were it to occur, could
devastate fund company profits and batter their already beaten-down
shares. When the S&AMP;P 500 index fell almost 20 percent in the fall
of 1998, shares of some of the largest publicly traded fund
companies fell more than twice that much.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the industry's future have taken a further toll
on those stocks this year, as shares of some big fund companies
have stayed flat for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the poor recent returns mask the stunning prosperity that
many fund companies have enjoyed over the long term. Shares of two
of the largest publicly traded fund companies, Franklin Resources
and T. Rowe Price Associates, have given 19-fold and 35-fold
returns, respectively, over the last dozen years. That compares
with an eightfold total return for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, many fund families still manage returns on equity of
more than 25 percent. And even with little money coming in, they
can count on their revenue base expanding by up to 10 percent or so
every year, assuming stocks revert to their historical average
annual returns. And many companies are branching into other areas.
</P>
<P>
   But many smaller funds and fund families, particularly those
that do not match the performance of their peers, can expect things
to get worse over the next five years, Bogle said. ``A lot of funds
are going to give up the ghost,'' he said.

STOCK MARKET OF THE FUTURE MAY EVOLVE FROM THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late one evening, sometime early in the next century,
you settle into your lumbar-support leather recliner and tell your
wireless voice-activated computer to sign you on to eBay, where you
enter the spirited bidding for an antique Nokia cellular telephone,
a slightly foxed first edition of ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' _ and
10,000 shares of United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched? Maybe. But electronic technology is having such an
immediate impact on American financial markets that a team of
analysts at Lehman Brothers recently suggested that the stock
exchange of the future might evolve not from traditional
institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, but from e-commerce
companies or Internet auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that is only one very long-term possibility, the
analysts said. And the evolution might work in reverse _ with the
Big Board transforming itself into a 24-hour Internet market that
could challenge the auction sites of today.
</P>
<P>
   As that speculation suggests, Wall Street is approaching the new
millennium the way superstitious pilots approach the Bermuda
Triangle _ fearing the worst, hoping for the best but prepared for
just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will be constantly remaking itself,'' predicted
William C. Freund, director of the Pace University Center for the
Study of Equity Markets in Manhattan and a former chief economist
of the New York Stock Exchange. ``The model of today is a scene of
creative destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have tried to create an environment that will foster
greater innovation and competition in stock trading. A remarkably
long-lived bull market has attracted millions of new investors. But
the real engine driving market change today is computer technology:
cheaper, faster computers connected by high-speed communications
lines and guided by innovative software.
</P>
<P>
   This fast-forward evolution has given rise to a host of
bargain-priced online brokerage services that, in turn, have
produced an awesome increase in the amount of stock trading
Americans do each day. Forrester Research estimates that the number
of online brokerage accounts, which stood at roughly three million
in August 1998, will reach 5.4 million by the end of this year and
more than 20 million in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Further, trading volume on Nasdaq increased 28 percent annually
between 1994 and 1998, on average, while the year-to-year increase
on the Big Board during that period was 23 percent, Salomon Smith
Barney reported recently. That compares with average annual growth
rates of roughly 19 percent on Nasdaq and 13 percent on the Big
Board between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the same technology that has unleashed this tidal wave of
fresh business has also helped Wall Street cope with that flood by
fostering the birth of more than a dozen computerized trading
networks, called electronic communications networks, or more often
simply ECN's, where buy and sell orders can be matched in seconds.
In recent months, some ECN's have started staying open for trading
after the traditional stock exchanges have closed, making it even
easier for investors to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some ECNs now handle enough trading to pose a competitive threat
to the Nasdaq market and, to a lesser extent, the New York Stock
Exchange. But those markets are not ceding their territory without
a fight. Both Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq
market, and Richard Grasso, the president of the New York Stock
Exchange, are working on plans to convert their markets into
for-profit corporations. They argue that the new ownership
structure would allow them to react more quickly and compete more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   And competition among the ECNs themselves is rising, prompting
widespread predictions that only a few of the current crop will
survive very long into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it becomes very quickly clear that this is a business that
requires scale and yet it's one in which very little distinguishes
the different players _ in short, it's a commodity business,'' said
Guy Moszkowski, a brokerage industry analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each ECN further fragments the market when customers
want the broadest, deepest market possible. ``So they face an
almost self-defeating business challenge,'' Moszkowski added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, new competitors continue to arrive. By summer, Wall Street
expects the debut of Primex, an ECN that advertises itself as an
``electronic auction market.'' Its hefty backers _ including
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith
Barney _ account for more than half the trading volume on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the stock market the only place where the ground is
shaking. The nation's major options exchanges _ the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the American Stock
Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange
_ are all facing increased electronic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The International Securities Exchange, an electronic options
exchange based in Manhattan and sponsored by a group of large
brokerage firms including ETrade and Ameritrade, plans to open its
virtual doors in March, if regulators agree. Another electronic
rival, backed by the Chicago Stock Exchange and Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., is on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory demands for greater public access to the prices at
which bonds trade is also likely to push that traditional
marketplace toward greater reliance on electronic trading,
Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The deep, relatively homogeneous markets for Treasury debt will
probably be the first to adopt electronic trading broadly, he said,
but the corporate and municipal markets will not be far behind.
More than a dozen bond trading systems are already operating or are
expected to open in the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Though European and East Asian markets have been quicker to
adopt electronic trading equipment, American markets remain in the
forefront of these changes simply because this revolution is being
driven largely by the demands of individual investors, who play a
much larger role in the American marketplace than they do
elsewhere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, individuals play a much greater role in American markets
than they once did. From the cloudy vantage point of the mid-1970s,
the American securities market seemed to be a purely institutional
party, with big pension funds and mutual funds pumping in giant
orders and elbowing aside the little guy. But last year and into
the first half of this year, more than 51 percent of the Big
Board's volume consisted of trades of fewer than 10,000 shares
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   While some small orders are submitted by large index funds,
which constantly adjust their portfolios to reflect the larger
market, the growth in small orders also reflects a larger role by
individuals, Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But as foreign markets catch up, American investors will no
doubt push for cheap, fast access to them as well. That will add to
the pressure on Wall Street and its regulators to find a way to
develop a global electronic market that has adequate regulation,
sufficient financial safeguards for all participants and ready
access to accurate, comparable information from market to market.
</P>
<P>
   Already, this technological revolution has produced a long ``to
do'' list for regulators. As the new year opens, they must wrestle
not only with the competitive and regulatory issues surrounding
ECNs and their traditional stock exchange rivals, but also with
some important developments prompted by the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most are fairly technical, but one change that individual
investors are sure to notice will be the conversion of stock quotes
from the traditional fractions into less unwieldy dollars-and-cents
prices, a change that is scheduled for next summer. Market experts
like Freund expect that this change will put additional pressure on
Wall Street profits by reducing spreads, the difference between the
prices at which a trader can buy and sell the same stock.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a market maker might buy a stock for $10 a share and sell
it for $10 1/16 _ a difference of 6\ cents. With decimal pricing,
that gap could shrink to perhaps 5 cents, or even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversion can't compare with the Y2K problems, as a
technological challenge; this is not like converting to the metric
system,'' Freund said. ``But it will change the economics of market
making. It will narrow the spreads, and that will put some market
makers out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for everyone on Wall Street, from the brokerage giants
to the newest ECN's, competing effectively in the new century is
going to mean finding the right balance between computers and human
beings, according to Moszkowski, the securities analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can be automated must be automated because of
the competitive pressures to keep costs low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work left for human traders _ using their firms' capital to
ease the handling of giant orders from big institutions that will
have to pay handsomely for the service _ is going to require far
more than routine skills as the difficulty of conducting these
trades increases. ``Institutional orders will need people much more
skillful than ever before,'' Freund said. ``The seat-of-the-pants
trader is not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Korins, the chief executive of the Security Traders
Association in Manhattan, acknowledged that technology was
reshaping the life of his members in significant and unpredictable
ways. But he cautioned against confusing technology as a means with
technology as an end in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets work so well because we have risk takers in them,
not because we have a particular technology,'' Korins said.
``Electronic systems will do away with certain work experiences.
But as long as we make sure the risk taker is included as we go
forward, I don't have a big problem with these changes.''  &QL;

   To glimpse the future intersection between industry and the
Internet, peer not into a crystal ball but inside Cisco Systems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   What is notable is how the high-technology company sells its
routers, hardware essential to the distribution of Internet
traffic. From its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., Cisco sells
roughly $12 billion of products a year over the Internet _
representing fully 85 percent of its business _ to customers who
shop, order and receive technical support online.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco uses a network internally, too. Employees file expense
reports, handle procurement, receive training and deal with 401(k)
plans and health benefit changes on an internal computer network
that saves paper, time and management resources, a marked change in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before long, other companies are going to look like Cisco
looks today,'' said Greg Wood, spokesman for Internet2, a
next-generation, high-speed network being developed by universities
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Future developments in the Internet regarding business _ and the
lauded concept of e-commerce _ should come in waves. The next wave,
perhaps one to two years out, will find traditional businesses
increasingly gravitating, like Cisco, to making sales and doing
procurement online, and to dealing with human resource matters on
internal networks, so-called intranets.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are studying the relationship between business and
the still-primitive and slow Internet say that the waves that will
follow in five or 10 years will be much more powerful and could
well reshape the way business is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   This transformation will happen because, very basically but
profoundly, the Internet permits ease and breadth of communication,
provides newfound mobility and allows complex transactions to take
place among numerous parties in far-flung regions. Although this
may sound like yet more hyperbolic praise for technology,
researchers like Stuart I. Feldman, director of the Institute of
Advanced Commerce at IBM, say these Internet assets could lead to a
new type of marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, echoing a view shared by numerous researchers, suggests
that in the next decade, huge, far-flung, industry-specific
marketplaces will emerge _ for food or clothing, for example. In
these marketplaces, the lines between individual businesses will
become blurred as companies find new and unusual ways, both
competitive and cooperative, to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is that these Internet-based marketplaces will act
like a combination of ancient barter-based marketplaces and
Internet auctions. Consumers, whether individuals or businesses,
will submit requests for products over the Internet, and businesses
from around the world will vie to fill their orders, competing on
service, price, quality and other features. In some cases, however,
businesses may collaborate to fill orders, or turn to 3rd, 4th or
10th parties to join in elaborate barter deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the marketplace harks back to the old-fashioned
marketplace, or market ground,'' Feldman said. ``People got
together; they argued; they traded things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new markets will not be so limited as those on the
fields of ancient Greece. In a cyberspace environment, they will
increasingly use video and become more mobile. Buyers may
point-and-click their orders on a personal digital assistant
whether they are trading stocks, bales of hay or tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said he could imagine a consumer, while returning from
work, instructing his portable device to find him the best deal for
groceries on the route home. ``You'll say you need a pound of
hamburger, two fresh onions and a bottle of ketchup _ who will sell
this to me near here in the next hour?'' Feldman said. ``All the
markets in the area will be screaming: `Me! Me!'''
</P>
<P>
   An early example of the marriage of mobility, networks and
commerce is an experiment IBM is conducting in England in
partnership with Safeway PLC, the supermarket chain. There, IBM has
given 170 shoppers Palm Pilots equipped with scanners and modems.
The shoppers can punch in their grocery orders and the devices
automatically send the orders to Safeway to be packed for the
customers. A shopper can also restock the home larder by running
the scanner over the bar code on items on hand (a can of peaches,
say, or napkins).
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Coca-Cola from vending machines in Finland
illustrates another example of new technology at work. In an
experiment, using software made by the Oracle Corp., a consumer
punches an order for a soda into a cellular phone. The phone then
instructs the vending machine to kick out a Coke and debits an
account to pay for it. (Of course, those without cell phones may go
thirsty.) In addition, the vending machine, which is also on a
network, dials its owner when it is time to be restocked with soda.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., knows whereof it speaks
when it comes to network possibilities. Like Cisco, it is
considered to be on the cutting edge and a model for the near-term
changes expected in many industries. But companies looking to
emulate Oracle should know that the company had to undergo a
substantial transformation to get to this point.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the company relied on in-person product-demonstration
seminars that cost $350 per attendee to stage, including
invitations, hotel space, special crews and more. Today, the
company holds the majority of its seminars online _ it had 61
online presentations in October, for example, presenting material
in text, video and audio, and taking questions via e-mail. The
cost: $1.98 per attendee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking a factor of even 100 less; we're talking a
huge amount less'' in cost, said Mark Jarvis, senior vice president
for worldwide marketing for Oracle. ``We were used to running
marketing seminars in 144 countries worldwide. Now we do one for
the entire globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cisco, Oracle has also moved many of its human resource
tasks online. For example, an employee files an expense report into
an automated system that not only e-mails the report to a manager
to approve, but also checks the report for any anomalous expenses
that could lead to an audit. Jarvis said it cost $100 to process a
paper-based expense report, but $1 for one in a digital
network-based world.
</P>
<P>
   Like Feldman of IBM, Jarvis predicts that this wave of
networking technology will look insignificant compared with the
waves on the horizon. He said that Oracle and other companies
needed to prepare themselves for a world in which geography and
price were far less significant in buying and selling decisions,
and that businesses must prepare themselves to compete against and
cooperate with other businesses in a virtual environment with few
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at putting their product catalog online
and thinking, `I'm done,''' said Mark A. Tonnesen, a senior
director of information technology at Cisco Systems. ``But you've
got to think about having an entire ecosystem of products and
services online.'' The world ahead, he said, is one ``with multiple
buyers, multiple customers and multiple complementary processes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Money is a funny thing. Everyone knows what it is. But money is
something that can change a lot over time.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, there was little question about what money was.
It was gold, period. Or, to be a little more exact, it included
national currencies like dollars and pounds, but only to the extent
they were convertible into gold. There was but one real money.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are dozens and dozens of national currencies, none of
them tied to gold. But there is a hierarchy of currencies that in
practice significantly reduces the real number. That hierarchy is
based not on relative value, which can and does fluctuate, but on
their function in the world economy. The U.S. dollar is clearly No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nature of money is changing. With no
anchor in precious metals, the task of maintaining the value of
currencies has fallen to central banks, few of which even existed
in 1900. It was the central banks _ most notably the Federal
Reserve in the United States and the Bundesbank in Germany _ that
were given credit for slaying the inflation dragon in the 1980s,
leading to what might be called the cult of the central banker.
</P>
<P>
   The big questions for the international monetary system in the
21st century will revolve around those points: Will the dollar
maintain its supremacy, or will the euro, and perhaps even the
Japanese yen, gain comparable status? How will other countries
manage the value of their currencies? And, perhaps most important,
will central bankers maintain their power and prestige, or will
they stumble and take the blame for some economic problem?
</P>
<P>
   The current supremacy of the dollar does not reflect a brilliant
record as a store of value. If one uses consumer price inflation as
a measure, a 1999 dollar is worth about a nickel in 1900 money.
Measured against gold, the dollar is down 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the dollar's primacy reflects the United States' role
as the world's largest economy, with capital markets that lead the
world. The dollar is the most likely currency to be held as
official reserves by other countries. It is the premier currency of
international lending. Companies from Brazil to Indonesia owe
dollars, not reais or rupiahs. When the real and rupiah were
devalued in the crises of the late 1990s, local companies that had
thought they were in good shape found themselves in severe
financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the currency of 11 European countries, was created in
part to challenge the dollar's supremacy. Its first year has not
been a smooth one, and the value of the currency has fallen. But
the euro's use in international borrowing has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Some major economies, such as Britain and Japan, can easily keep
floating exchange rates with the dollar and the euro, in part
because those countries have capital markets that can allow
companies to borrow in local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But for many other currencies, the options are not so clear.
Until the Asian currency crisis, many countries opted for a sort of
nonbinding fixed rate. Their currencies were tied to the dollar,
sometimes with a planned gradual depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis, however, saw many such currencies plunge in
value and led to a growing consensus that countries must choose one
of two options. They can choose freely floating exchange rates that
rise or fall against other currencies moved by market forces, a
plan that gives governments maximum flexibility but can make it
hard for businesses to plan their affairs. Alternatively, they can
adopt an absolute fixed rate versus a major currency.
</P>
<P>
   That has meant proposals in Latin America for ``dollarization,''
in which the local currency is simply replaced by the dollar. At
the extreme, that could lead to the entire hemisphere, and perhaps
much of the rest of the world as well, adopting the dollar. Such a
policy would give Latin American businesses the ability to borrow
at relatively low dollar interest rates, with confidence that
devaluation would not devastate them.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to that arrangement for other countries is that the
Federal Reserve, in designing its monetary policy, is unlikely to
take into account the effect a given policy might have on a foreign
country that has dollarized but whose economy is not moving in
tandem with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The role of central banks is the other major issue. A century
ago, there were only 18 central banks, 16 of them in Europe, plus
Japan and Indonesia. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 172 central banks, and more and more of them claim
some degree of independence from national governments. The European
Central Bank represents a new degree of independence since no one
government appoints all its members. The claim for such
independence rests largely on the success of tight monetary
policies in quelling inflation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the European Central Bank might prove to be the most
controversial of the next decade. While one can argue that the
economies of the euro zone, from Naples to Helsinki, are no more
diverse than those of the United States, from Boston to Birmingham,
this country has a political unity to go along with a common
currency. It has much greater labor mobility, aided to no small
extent by a common language, and it has a more developed system to
allow fiscal transfers _ via welfare and unemployment benefits _
from prosperous regions to struggling ones.
</P>
<P>
   All that means that the challenges confronting the European
Central Bank in bad times could be of a different order of
magnitude than those that confront the Fed, simply because the
nonmonetary means of stabilization are less developed. It is
conceivable that a prolonged economic downturn could lead one
European country or another to elect a government that blamed the
central bank and wanted out of the euro, thereby precipitating a
crisis since no exit from the euro is supposed to be possible.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank is not, of course, the only one that
could end up being vilified if economies went bad. The most
important question for the future of the international monetary
system may be what would happen if faith in central banks were
damaged so badly that alternative ways of managing currency values
were sought. Some think that gold would make a comeback, as the
only real money. Alternatively, a currency's value might be tied to
a basket of commodities.
</P>
<P>
   One central banker, Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the Bank
of England, has even suggested that new computer technologies might
end up making it possible for financiers effectively to bypass
government-created money, creating their own relative values
through trading. The unit of account, he said, might be a commodity
standard, leaving central banks out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, he said in a speech last summer,
``central banks would lose their ability to influence monetary
policy'' and ``the successors to Bill Gates would have put the
successors to Alan Greenspan out of business.''

SURVIVING THE FOOD FEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wondering how to enjoy holiday festivities and ward off
unwanted pounds? Here are a few strategies,'' begins an article in
Northwest Health, an HMO newsletter. Along with their suggestions,
I have inserted some of my observations.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Never go to a holiday event hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   That means I have to eat before I go, right? That's a great
start to a holiday diet plan. I won't even attempt to explain to my
wife when I walk out the front door gnawing on a chicken leg.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Don't sit or stand near the buffet table.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll stand in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Allow yourself just two visits to the buffet table. Start
with cold foods and fill up on the fruits and vegetables. Then go
back for hot foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. I have spent a large part of my life learning how
and when to attack a buffet table. You begin with the expensive
stuff, like prawns, crab legs and smoked salmon. Apple slices and
celery sticks are ``foods of last resort'' and are to be considered
only if or when the fudge brownies run out.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``As you select foods, keep items within the inner circle of
your plate. For an added challenge, leave a half-inch to an inch of
space between each item of food.''
</P>
<P>
   With a battle plan like that, you don't need a plate, you need
something the size of a garbage can lid or manhole cover.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Burn off extra calories. Take the stairs instead of the
elevator. Park farther from stores and walk. Turn on music and
dance at home.''
</P>
<P>
   I challenge the author of that article to skip down the stairs
and dance down the street while clutching a 16-pound smoked turkey,
which is the kind of baggage most of us hope to acquire during the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. Your neighbors will burn up a few calories
laughing when they see you tango past the living-room window.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, just thinking about all that exercise makes me hungry. How
about some:
</P>
<P>
   Rye Cocktail Snacks
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup minced green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 4-ounce can chopped black olives
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf party rye bread
</P>
<P>
   Moosh together first four ingredients and let stand an hour.
Spread on sliced party rye. Freeze on baking sheet until needed.
Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Bean Dip
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half teaspoons cumin powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 16-ounce can refried beans
</P>
<P>
   Cook the onion in oil 4 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, oregano,
chili powder, salt and pepper and stir-cook another minute. Add the
tomato sauce and simmer another 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pan from heat, let sauce cool for 5 minutes, then mix
with the refried beans. When well combined, serve at room
temperature with tortilla chips for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Low-fat Chix Snacks
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Whack the chicken into bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Dump all the other ingredients into a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
then add chicken and simmer 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and
let sit, covered, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer chicken to an airtight container and keep in the
refrigertor. Serve at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   You can refrigerate the sauce in a covered jar for your next
batch of chicken snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's Snack
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the cheese onto an 8-inch plate. Mix together garlicand olive oil and drizzle over cheese. Combine other ingredients
and pour over the cheese. Refrigerate one hour. Sprinkle with
pepper and serve with wheat crackers.
</P>
<P>
   I first tried this dynamite appetizer, prepared by niece Megan
McNamer, at a gathering in Montana. Meg said she found it in a book
written by one of my favorite Seattle cooking authorities, Sharon
Kramis. In turn, Kramis credited the recipe to an unnamed Mercer
Island cook, who submitted it to a weekly newspaper. I have no idea
where the Mercer Island cook found the original recipe, but I'm
pretty sure it did not originate in an HMO newsletter on holiday
dieting strategies.

ROCKY OUTLOOK FOR GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agribusiness leaders are as confident as ever that the need to
feed a growing world population makes it both essential and
inevitable that biotechnology will play a central role in
21st-century farming. But for now it looks like the industry may be
pulled over by consumers and fined by investors for recklessly
speeding toward such a future.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of genetically engineered crops soared in 1999, but a
sharp slowdown in growth, if not an actual decline, seems likely in
2000, and even industry optimists are saying it may take several
years to get rolling again. Crop surpluses, which undermine
farmers' willingness to pay for new technology; trade tensions; and
antitrust concerns have all contributed to the uncertain outlook.
But the biggest jolt to the visions of the multinational giants
that dominate agribusiness has come from a surge in consumer fears
about the safety of the novel crops.
</P>
<P>
   It has made no difference that regulators and major food
companies agreed with the industry that there was scant evidence of
any significant human health hazard. Nor has it mattered that most
researchers contend that critics have wildly exaggerated evidence
that biotechnology is likely to create superweeds or widespread
destruction of beneficial insects like Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, governments and the industry's biggest
customers began deciding it was better to retreat than to ignore
negative public sentiment. The backlash was strongest in Europe,
where supermarket chains took foods containing oil from genetically
modified corn and soybeans off their shelves, and regulators tabled
applications to plant new genetically altered strains of beets and
canola despite the opinions of their own science advisers that the
crops were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest drug, food and chemical giants have already
retreated from the once popular model of becoming ``life sciences''
companies with strong footings in every sector affected by
biotechnology. Early this month, AstraZeneca PLC of Britain and
Novartis A.G. of Switzerland, announced plans to spin off and then
merge their agricultural businesses into a new company to be called
Syngenta. ``We went three steps forward in recent years, but we are
now taking two steps back,'' said Sano M. Shimoda, founder of
BioScience Securities, a research firm based in Orinda, Calif.,
that concentrates on agricultural biotechnology. ``I don't think
we've seen the worst of it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest business beneficiaries of the biotechnology backlash
may be the manufacturers of the traditional agrichemicals that have
been losing market share and money while battling to slow the move
of farmers to new crops that are devised to work best with just one
herbicide or, in some cases, to eliminate the need for certain
insecticides. Some chemical giants like DuPont, Dow Chemical and
Aventis have major commitments to biotechnology as well, but
others, like the struggling American Cyanamid pesticides business
of American Home Products, have little to lose from a setback for
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   One development many foresee for next year is the adoption in
many countries _ perhaps even the United States _ of labeling
standards for food containing genetically modified products.
Opponents of biotechnology predict confidently that labels will
lead to widespread rejection of modified products, pointing to
recent experience in Europe, where retailers have raced to
advertise ``GMO-free'' products, referring to genetically modified
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that outcome depends largely on whether both
kinds of products remain on the shelves, and the level of fears
about health hazards and pricing. In the United States, they point
out, milk produced from cows that have not been injected with
Posilac, a bovine growth hormone that Monsanto produces in
bacteria, is labeled, but it is usually premium-priced and only a
very small percentage of consumers seek it out. Monsanto said that
Posilac sales expanded 20 percent this year and that its new
production plant under construction in Georgia was expected to
begin producing the hormone by the end of next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barring stronger evidence that biotechnology poses major new
hazards, analysts and the industry's major players believe that any
slowdown or decline this coming year is likely to be reversed. The
underlying forces that had made agricultural biotechnology such a
hit on Wall Street as recently as last year continue to gather
strength. The world's population passed six billion and, although
the growth rate is slowing, the demand for rice, wheat and corn,
the three mostly widely planted grains, is projected by the
International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington to
increase 40 percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   With the acreage of arable land basically unchanged over the
last 30 years, there is increasing pressure to use biotechnology to
make agriculture more productive. And researchers continue to
expand markedly the industry's tools and potential.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Humphrey, president of DuPont's nutrition and health
businesses, notes that public and private money is pouring into
research on human, animal and plant genetics and into study of
their interaction with the environment. ``When all that starts to
intersect in two or three years, it's going to be incredible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent breakthrough was a project to alter rice so that
it would produce the protein necessary to create vitamin A in its
grain. That development is estimated to be five years from
commercialization, but it was widely hailed in developing nations
as a way to help prevent the deaths of up to three million children
annually and eliminate millions of cases of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main risk is that we keep talking and don't move ahead,''
said Per Pinstrup-Andersen, director general of the International
Food Policy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we create biotech options, farmers will take them if they
like it,'' Pinstrup-Andersen added.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds logical enough, but one hot question is whether
farmers actually have much choice. Industry critics contend that
the new technology has become so concentrated in the hands of
powerful multinationals that they have the marketing influence with
international aid agencies to force some products on farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that blown pollen can transfer traits from
genetically modified crops to the fields of organic farmers and
others that want nothing to do with the technology. They are
pressing for much stronger regulation and a very broad
interpretation of what kinds of effects might be classified as
damages for which corporate sponsors of biotechnology could be
sued.
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell of public fears and opposition came too late to
have much impact on what was planted this year, but farmers are
watching the futures markets for signals about what seed to buy
this winter. With a growing number staring at bankruptcy after two
years of bumper crops and low prices, farmers are worried about
paying higher prices for genetically modified seed and then finding
the next harvest difficult to sell because of opposition to such
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has the most to lose from such fears, especially in
soybeans. Nearly half of the United States soybean crop this year
was modified to tolerate spraying with Roundup, the company's
best-selling weed killer. Analysts predict market declines in the
United States for both the modified beans and the company's
modified corn (farmers say the latter's ability to generate a
pesticide was not worth the cost in many areas this year because of
low insect populations). Monsanto says it remains somewhat
optimistic that the market for both will continue to grow both at
home and abroad, according to Hugh Grant, co-president of the
company's agricultural business.
</P>
<P>
   One key to the year will be Brazil, where approval of
Roundup-Ready soybeans has been recommended by the Government but
tied up in court. Biotechnology critics say that thanks to the ban,
Brazil will have higher exports to Europe, but the real world may
not provide a clear test. Reports suggest that anywhere from 5
percent to 15 percent of the Brazilian crop planted this fall has
been grown from Roundup-Ready seed smuggled in from Argentina,
where the crop is legal and very popular with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Such percentages could make it too expensive for Brazil to
certify its crops as free from modification, since crops from many
farms get mixed together during shipment.
</P>
<P>
   For biotechnology backers, such complications are just one more
reason to believe that the past year's turmoil will not derail the
industry for long. Safety fears may slow growth, they say, but each
year will bring new products that make farming easier or consumer
products more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie is out of the bottle with regard to the
technology,'' said Michael Phillips, executive director for food
and agriculture of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a
Washington trade group.

JAPAN'S CONTRADICTIONS CLOUD FUTURE DIRECTION OF ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To almost everyone's surprise, the Japanese economy
showed remarkable _ and remarkably diverse _ signs of life this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, reassured by the seemingly endless stream of
corporate overhauls that began taking place, drove the stock market
higher, pushing the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index up by more
than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Topix index, a broader measure of the market, was up an even
more robust 50 percent, and an index of smaller Japanese stocks
more than doubled. Further, the need for yen to buy all those
stocks helped push the currency up against the dollar by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there the picture begins to get muddied. A stronger yen
crimps the earnings of Japan's exporting giants like Sony, Honda
and Hitachi, whose stocks are favorites of foreign investors. And
so those investors' enthusiasm for Japanese assets actually
imperils the very recovery in which they are so eagerly investing.
</P>
<P>
   Contradictions like this mark many aspects of what is shaping up
as Japan's economic renaissance after nearly a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very bumpy ride ahead for the next five years as
reform battles against anti-reform,'' said Richard Katz, author of
``Japan: The System That Soured'' (M.E. Sharpe).
</P>
<P>
   That makes it difficult to be either optimistic or pessimistic
when it comes to Japan's prospects as the century turns.
</P>
<P>
   Take consumer spending. Economists were pleasantly surprised
earlier this year when consumers started opening their wallets
after the government shored up the financial system and offered a
menu of tax breaks to encourage the spending that is needed to
reinvigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of falling wages, deferred bonuses, job cuts and
hiring freezes, the spending spree stalled late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here, noted that the
monthly Family Income and Expenditure Survey on which the
government bases some of its economic predictions was small and
included the responses of a disproportionate number of civil
servants, who have largely escaped the impact of the restructuring
sweeping the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, in the first three months of this year, when gross
domestic product was at first reported to have grown at a stunning
7.9 percent annualized rate _ later revised to 6.3 percent _ sales
of minicars were exceedingly strong because manufacturers, seeking
to dress up their performance in advance of the fiscal year-end in
March, offered deep incentives. The minicar sales boom soon
quieted.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there are two interpretations of the economy, which
slowed significantly after that strong first quarter. The growth at
the start of the year was still better than generally expected and
probably ensures that the government will live up to the growth of
six-tenths of 1 percent it pledged for the fiscal year that will
end March 31, in contrast to a decline of 2 percent in gross
domestic product in the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But a good part of the current life in the economy that has so
excited foreign investors comes from government spending _ a
whopping $177 billion at current exchange rates this year alone in
supplementary spending aimed at lifting the economy _ much of it
devoted to restoring moribund businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the government halts that spending, as it
surely must in the not-too-distant future because it cannot sustain
that level in light of its rising debt burden? If data issued at
the end of November _ when the effects of the government's previous
spending package were wearing off _ are any indication, consumer
spending will fall, housing starts will fall and construction
contracts will dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's fiscal situation is growing more worrisome. The nation
has unseated Italy as the industrialized world's biggest debtor,
with government debt climbing to an estimated 123 percent of the
country's gross domestic product. For the first time since World
War II, government bond issuance will exceed tax revenues in the
fiscal year that ends March 31, and economists expect the
government to go on spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is that, if the current economic stimulus
programs fail to create a self-sustaining recovery, they will not
be abandoned in favor of something else but rather they will be
redoubled,'' said Marshall Gittler, chief currency strategist for
Asia at Bank of America in Hong Kong, who recommends a halt to the
debt-financed supplemental spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats, politicians and some economists argue that Japan's
vast savings and extremely low interest rates make the problem less
pressing than the numbers would suggest. Privately, however, many
of them worry that they are saddling future generations with an
enormous burden, particularly since Japan has one of the lowest
birthrates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government's finances fall into ever greater
disarray, the private sector finally seems to be addressing its
financial mess. Banks and corporations have started working to
repair their balance sheets, shedding both debt and underutilized
assets.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter sold the first set of
securities backed by bad real estate debts; it was the first sign
that banks are finally admitting that the problem loans that pushed
them so perilously close to collapse in 1998 will never be
recovered and must be cleared away.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi and NEC have allied to manufacture commodity memory
chips; in the past each would have insisted on going it alone. And
Nissan Motors is writing off five factories that it is closing.
Throughout Japan, companies are finally acknowledging, and in some
cases writing off, huge deficits in their pension plans as they
face changes in accounting rules that will go into effect next
year, creating improved clarity for investors.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside here, however. While these companies attempt
to put their houses in order, they are sharply curtailing capital
investment and, in the process, crimping the economy. When Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone said it would cut its spending by $8.5
billion, NEC, one of the telephone giant's biggest suppliers and
itself in the throes of an overhaul, groaned. It, in turn, will no
doubt cut its spending, passing the pain on to its own suppliers in
a ripple that is being repeated throughout Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I cut my costs, I also cut your sales,'' Katz, the author,
noted.
</P>
<P>
   As long as that sort of reorganization continues, the economy
will be under pressure. Most economists _ and several prominent
Japanese officials, including the head of Japan's central bank,
Masaru Hayami, and Koichi Kato, a potential candidate for prime
minister _ believe that the pain will eventually lead to
self-sustaining economic momentum as leaner companies begin to
perform more competitively.
</P>
<P>
   But a good deal of hard work remains. Robert Alan Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo, said that for
Japanese companies to raise their return on assets to the levels
they enjoyed in 1990 _ about 4 percent on average, which is meager
by Western standards _ they would either have to cut labor costs by
something like 13 percent or write off as much as 50 percent of
their assets, neither of which is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' Feldman said, ``investors have probably
underestimated the required scale and scope of the restructuring
effort.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inflation is calm. The Federal Reserve is vigilant. And the
federal budget deficit has disappeared. So conditions should be
right for long-term interest rates finally to fall decisively below
5 percent, a level they have seen only briefly in the final third
of the century about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Other factors, like the strong stock market, work against
any slippage in rates, and many analysts say that only a
significant slowdown in economic growth will push rates down any
time soon. But just the fact that this decline can be contemplated
shows how much the financial and economic environment has changed
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The overall Consumer Price Index was up a mild 2.6 percent over
the last 12 months through November. While that is above the 1.6
percent in 1998, much of this year's rise has come from the jump in
oil prices. The core rate, which excludes food and energy, is up
just 2.1 percent through November, down from the 2.4 percent core
rate for 1998. All of these are far below the 12.5 percent that the
overall Consumer Price Index rose in 1980 when long-term government
interest rates topped 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, which now has 20 years of credible
inflation-fighting behind it, is trusted to pounce on any
inflationary threat. Even with inflation low this year, the Fed
raised its short-term interest rate target a quarter of a
percentage point three times to slow the economy and take upward
pressure off prices.
</P>
<P>
   And with the monetary side of policy secure, the fiscal side has
also improved. At least for the time being, the federal budget has
a surplus, which should take some pressure off the government's
$5.7 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all that, long-term government interest rates fell
below 5 percent only briefly in late 1998 _ and it was panic over
the global financial crisis that produced the fall. Money poured
into this country as investors sought safety. When foreign markets
stabilized, some of that money left, and bond yields in this
country rose again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some forecasters say that even though the conditions for a
further rate decline are in place, it will still take a slowdown in
the pace of United States economic growth to get long-term interest
rates much below their current levels, 6.37 percent for Treasury
bonds and 7.59 percent for corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are there yet,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief
economist at Merrill Lynch, who is forecasting that the yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond will be around 6 percent in the fourth
quarter of next year. ``First, we need to see some significant
slowing in economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   With a forecast of 3.6 percent growth from the fourth quarter of
this year to the fourth quarter of 2000, he does not expect that,
unless ``something unpleasant happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Such unpleasantness could come in two forms: a stock market
crash, which would dampen consumer spending enough to slow growth
significantly, or aggressive rate increases from the Federal
Reserve. Steinbergis is expecting one quarter-point increase in the
Fed's short-term interest rate target as early as February. But
three increases, he said, would surely convince investors that the
economy was going to slow a lot, bringing interest rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are combining to make a rate decline less likely,
despite the positive environment. One is that real interest rates,
which are adjusted for inflation, are high. The other is that
higher worker productivity has raised the Fed's speed limit for
economic growth. At least for now, the higher real rates and the
higher speed limit mean that the demand for capital to invest and
to feed a growing economy will keep rates higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology investment is driving this,'' said James E.
Glassman, senior U.S. economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explaining the higher real interest rates. ``And the opening up of
global opportunities,'' he added, alluding to the chances for new
investment in China if Beijing is able to enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman said real long-term rates are now around 4 percent, the
rate on the 30-year Treasury bond indexed to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He is not worried, though, about the higher real interest rates,
maintaining that they are positive. ``The future looks better and
people want to invest,'' he said. ``Higher real rates are a
barometer for the outlook for the future.'' He noted that the
current level of real rates is about where they were during the
railroad boom in the mid-1800s and at the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is forecasting only a small decline in the rate of
economic growth next year, to 3 percent, from an estimated
3.8 &UR;  &LR; percent this year. Inflation is expected to remain about 2
percent. And long-term Treasury yields, it expects, will change
relatively little, perhaps falling below 6 percent by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said the rise in workers'
productivity in the 1990s had pushed the Fed's growth speed limit
up to a range of 3.5 percent to 4 percent. Fed officials have
acknowledged that the limit is higher, but not how much. So
analysts can only estimate how much it has been raised from what
was thought to be a ceiling of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman judges the speed limit to be slightly slower, around 3
percent to 3.5 percent. But any increase is important because it
raises the pace at which the Fed thinks the economy can grow
without generating worrisome inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The faster growth allowed with the higher speed limit means
there will be more credit demand to fuel this extra growth before
the Fed puts on the brakes, all of which suggests that interest
rates will have more trouble falling even if inflation remains low.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman said that inflation expectations were also making it
hard for interest rates to come down. Based on surveys of inflation
expectations and on the Treasury bonds indexed to inflation, he
said, consumers expect inflation to stay at the 2 percent level for
some time. Investors still have ``the 1970s inflation bug,'' he
said, noting that it takes just a few hints of stronger growth to
make people worry again.
</P>
<P>
   So a slowdown is the answer, right now, for lower interest
rates. And that means the stock market will probably determine
whether interest rates go lower or not.
</P>
<P>
   If stock prices keep rising, consumers are likely to continue
spending, as they feel wealthier every day. And that spending would
presumably prevent the economy from slowing enough to satisfy the
Federal Reserve. That could force a series of Fed rate increases
that could lead to a bigger slowdown, especially if the stock
market crumbled in the face of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, interest rates could fall.

 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A decade ago, it would have been hard to imagine
that at the end of the century the world economy would mix
unparalleled American ascendancy with such pervasive global
anxiety, or that free-marketeers would be celebrating the triumph
of market capitalism while so many around the globe questioned the
cost of its victory.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as 1989 came to a close it looked like the end of
this century and most of the next would belong to Japan and its
neighbors. Instead, the 1990s proved to be Japan's lost decade and
a buoyant Asia's rude awakening about the laws of economic gravity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Berlin wall had just fallen, and the wrenching
economic and political adjustments to freer markets that would
follow were just beginning. In retrospect, the predictions about
the contours of those adjustments missed the mark: Nations like
Poland made the shift much faster than expected, but the early
enthusiasm about the speed of Russia's move to a market economy
proved wildly optimistic. Instead, 10 years later, the West's
billions of aid dollars intended to bolster capitalism in its own
image seem to have been largely wasted, though it is unclear that a
different strategy would have worked any better.
</P>
<P>
   And who a decade ago could have anticipated the stresses of
globalization? How it would tear up the insides of the Nissan
worker who told a Japanese newspaper recently that for most of his
life he had naively believed that ``lifetime employment meant you
had a job for life''? Or how a small-town American investor whose
closest encounter with Thailand before 1997 had been seeing the
film ``The King and I'' could find her life roiled by a previously
unknown relationship between the health of her pension fund and the
inability of Thailand's finance ministry to monitor its banks'
lending portfolios?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, who would have imagined that in the last weeks of the
fading millennium, with American unemployment at record lows and
prosperity at record highs, the brewing anxieties of a decade of
global change could spill out into a wild scene on the streets of
Seattle? Or that seemingly everyone with a grievance about
capitalism's worst excesses would seize the opportunity to vent
anger at the World Trade Organization, a group most Americans were
only vaguely familiar with before the first week of December?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this has evoked much humility in the
millennial forecasting business. In the past few months, it seems
as if prognosticators worldwide have been turning out
impressive-looking charts plotting the life expectancy of the
American expansion, or the speed of the Asian recovery, or the
future of the euro. (Each such forecaster might find useful a copy
of the Congressional Budget Office's 1996 projections for what the
budget deficit would look like today, which only missed by about
$305 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the 1990s, at home and abroad, is that global
politics and global economic fortunes are not only inseparable, but
each makes the other almost impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Global economic tensions, however, are easier to scope out than
global economic outcomes. And tensions abound, all set to play out
over the next few years. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle was just the start. Over the next five years, the
backlash against globalization will worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the protesters who helped derail the world trade talks in
late November and early December could not agree among themselves
whether to order a latte or a cappuccino. And it is highly unlikely
that the extremists in Seattle, those who think the trade
organization's officials thunder around in black helicopters, will
move to the forefront of the debate. But the mainstream groups that
made themselves heard _ the labor unions and the environmentalists,
the Ralph Nader followers and those fearful of a loss of national
sovereignty _ are starting to articulate their worries far more
effectively than ever before. And they have a lot of allies around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any place one lands these days _ Tokyo or Bombay or
Brussels _ the complaint is the same: the United States is trying
to rig the global trading system to benefit its own, and its own
want to own the world. Of course, the Clinton administration wants
the Internet to be tariff-free because the biggest beneficiaries
will be Microsoft and America Online and the American merchants who
are kings of the Web. Of course, there is nothing new in such
complaints: Europe has been fretting about American multinationals
since the 1960s. But America's emergence as the world's
unchallenged military and economic power, and its role as the
largest exporter of popular culture, have ignited a new level of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we get from the developing world is, `What's in
this for us?''' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative,
said as she nursed the wounds of Seattle. ``They want to reopen
many of the market liberalizations of the past decade, and get more
time or a better deal. We hear it every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the political impetus to use trade to solve the
world's other ills seems likely to accelerate. Already the same
international community that insisted in 1998 the world would end
if Russia were not bailed out is pressing to cut off the IMF's
lending to Moscow to protest Russian tactics in Chechnya. Such
choices _ between our moral and political imperatives and our
economic sensibilities _ are getting harder every year, around the
world. And the drive to link core labor standards and environmental
standards to trade agreements will heighten the tension, pitting
industrial democracies against developing nations that feel certain
the system is being rigged to make it harder for them to get on the
road to prosperity by raising exports.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe none of this will ultimately affect global trade, which
has risen fifteenfold since 1950. But it could well make
international economics the new battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ The digital divide around the world will get a lot worse
before it gets any better.
</P>
<P>
   The past five years have seen a sharp three-way split among the
players in the global economy. The United States leads the way in
the overconnected sweepstakes: Its penetration of personal
computers, cell phones and Internet access is at or near the top of
the charts, fueling the new economy, if one exists. Europe follows
closely, with Japan belatedly kicking into e-gear.
</P>
<P>
   But many countries in the world are still struggling with
getting hard-wired phones into houses. They have pockets of
high-technology skills, but no infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World
Bank, with the uncomfortable reminder that half the world's six
billion people today live on less than $2 a day. Building digital
networks is not likely to be their first priority.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, this is an enormous economic opportunity; as
e-commerce spreads it can insert the poorest nations into the
global economy at a faster pace than ever before. But it seems just
as likely that the new economy will speed the concentration of
wealth in the hands of the richest nations, leaving others farther
behind. And even within the wealthiest nations, the access of
minorities and the poor to computers and the Internet is lagging
greatly, suggesting that the global divide may become increasingly
visible at home, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Japan is coming back, and China is speeding its transition to
a market economy. But scratch beneath the surface and you discover
nasty, unresolved battles that will continue for years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and China are the big bets of the next five years, and the
riskiest.
</P>
<P>
   No question there is good news at last from Japan. Foreign
investors are finally snapping up Japanese assets and taking the
lead (and the blame) in paring down bloated companies and getting
rid of excess workers. Consumers are gradually spending again. The
world's second-largest economy may soon start acting like it wants
to hold on to that standing.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, just as the news gets better, the political will
begins to falter. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, facing re-election,
is suddenly pulling back from the toughest economic reforms.
``Basically, I do support restructuring,'' he told the Far Eastern
Economic Review recently, ``but not the kind of drastic
restructuring common in the U.S. and Europe.'' Translation: No more
layoffs on my watch. Still, Japanese cognoscenti whisper
reassuringly that the prime minister should be ignored: Japan Inc.
is now taking its marching orders from the global marketplace, even
though politicians cannot admit that the old Japanese model is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   That is hard to believe. The next 5 or 10 years will be a
constant battle between market reformers and government
interventionists. If the market reformers win, it will be largely
because the government has run out of cash to keep priming the
pump. But the rest of the world is watching, because if Japan can
resist American-style capitalism, there is hope they can, too.
</P>
<P>
   China is an even more complex case. Its agreement to make vast
openings in its market in return for entry into the World Trade
Organization is the start of a battle, not the end of one. It will
pit entrenched industries that want to fight the opening against
government officials, led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who contend
that only competition will whip China's most inefficient industries
into shape. But it will also pit the government against itself. Zhu
is betting that the Communist party can open the economy without
losing control over the political system. After all, Singapore did.
But Singapore is a very, very small place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawrence H. Summers, the U.S. treasury secretary, told the
Trilateral Commission early in the year that the fate of the world
economy depended on the fate of the American economy, that the fate
of the American economy depended on the fate of the stock market
and that the fate of the American stock market depended on a small
handful of stocks that are trading at remarkable premiums.
</P>
<P>
   He was just being flip, right?
</P>
<P>
   Summers said soon after his comments were reported that he had
been speaking off the record; that his view, as conveyed by people
at the meeting, was greatly oversimplified, and that, as treasury
secretary, he did not speculate about markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Summers' view was oversimplified, he is clearly worried
that some market segments have outpaced the strong U.S. economic
fundamentals, like low unemployment, high productivity and
continued growth, that he is always talking about. But listen to
him carefully, and it seems as if the new big risk to the global
economy may actually be close to home.

<P>
   When well-known executives were asked to sum up the most
important characteristics of the last 100 years in an epitaph for
the 20th century, they invariably talked about the powerful impact
of technology in all its myriad forms: the airplane, television,
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this century, science did not matter to the average
person,'' said Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of
Fannie Mae, the world's largest nonbank financial services company.
``In this century, science is changing our lives fundamentally.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as these business leaders, who hailed from
entertainment and financial services and industry, praised the huge
advances in technology over the last 100 years, they expressed
concern about how technology could be used and the double-edged
nature of change.
</P>
<P>
   The dark side of the passing century was hinted at by the comic
creator Stan Lee's rendition of Mongorr, a despot eager to
infiltrate our world to take advantage of the new technology. But,
in as epic terms as any battle waged between superheroes, Robert
Rubin, the former treasury secretary, also talked about the stark
contrasts of the last 100 years: the huge advances made and the
devastation wrought by the ability of people to hurt one another.
``Human nature has remained a constant,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the executives were also quick to note the substantial
divide that exists between those who have benefited from the
prosperity of the last 100 years and those who have not. ``The
haves and have-nots are getting further apart,'' said Lawrence
Bossidy, the chairman of Honeywell, the industrial giant created by
the recent merger of Honeywell, the maker of electronic controls,
and AlliedSignal, a diversified manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of Stan Lee Media, a publicly held company based
in Encino, Calif., Lee &UR;  &LR; is participating directly in the revolution
being created by the Internet. ``I've been in comics, radio,
television, animation, movies and now the Internet,'' said Lee, who
is one of the people responsible for such memorable superheroes as
Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and plans to bring a new
generation of different superheroes and villains to the Internet in
short animated episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Television and the Internet, in particular, have achieved
enormous global reach, Lee says. People who once lived in isolation
are exposed as never before to what is going on in the rest of the
world. ``There are no hicks anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee is genuinely worried about how this technology is used.
Like Mongorr, one of Lee's new characters, there are those who may
use the Internet to harness hatred. ``I'm hoping that the closer we
come together, the more that will fade away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bossidy &UR;  &LR; of Honeywell thinks about the 20th century, he
ticks off the numerous advances in electronics: the cathode ray
tube in televisions, the microchip and the various iterations of
computers that allow work to be done rapidly, leading to huge
improvements in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The advances in medicine _ the cure of diseases like scarlet
fever and new treatments for heart disease and cancer _ are also
striking, Bossidy said. ``People feel better. They don't just live
longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the role of the corporation has also undergone significant
change, he argued, as companies have become much more efficient.
``Corporations used to be run exclusively by dictators,'' said
Bossidy, who spent more than three decades at General Electric
before joining AlliedSignal, where he became chief executive in
1991. ``Now you have to lead and be prepared to serve,'' he said,
and employees have the freedom to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, governments and other organizations will rely on a
corporate model to improve how they operate, according to Bossidy.
He also believes that companies will be asked more and more to
address social issues like education, not in privatizing them but
in marshaling resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Bossidy was wary of trying to guess what other innovations
the next century might bring. Just as few foresaw the Internet,
``most of the changes in the 21st century will not be predicted,''
he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, &UR;  &LR; who is as well known on Wall Street as he is in
Washington, takes an evenhanded approach in assessing the century.
Once a top official at Goldman Sachs, he is now the chairman of the
executive committee of the board for Citigroup, the nation's
largest financial services company. ``It has been a period of
tremendous advance,'' Rubin said, noting how much of the global
population has benefited from technology. But he is quick to point
out the last century's episodes of war and violence as well as the
use of technology for mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization has also remarkably changed how we live, he noted.
``I think we are far more interdependent today than we were 100
years ago,'' economically, environmentally and geopolitically,
Rubin said. He, too, is concerned about the gulf between those who
are enjoying this century's tremendous prosperity and those who are
not but understand what they are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, will be to see how the tension between
sovereignty and the growing global interdependence is handled, and
he believes the United States must decide what role it should play.
``There is a tremendous struggle between those who believe that the
U.S. should play a major leadership role and those who believe in
some fashion that we should turn inward and turn our back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Komansky, the chairman and chief executive of Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., takes a strikingly more optimistic view. ``Be
bullish,'' he argued, not about financial markets but in viewing
the strides made in the past 100 years. Despite world wars, the
Great Depression and other economic turbulence, there have been
significant improvements in the standard of living, medicine and
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on the doorstep of a truly global lifestyle
that will benefit every person in every part of the world,''
Komansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of instant communication _ the ability to make a
telephone call anywhere in the world or tune into CNN to see
minute-by-minute broadcasts of war _ has created a world that is
linked almost in real time, Komansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization, he argued, has transformed businesses like
Merrill Lynch, which two decades ago was primarily a domestic firm.
Today, more than a third of its business is conducted outside the
United States, and Merrill employs 65,000 people in 44 countries.
Managing the huge variety of people from different ethnic
backgrounds becomes more of a challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the phenomenon of globalization is in its very early
days,'' Komansky predicted. But he said he was confident that
civilization would continue to make great progress. ``The future is
much brighter than the past,'' he said.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Raines, the head of Fannie Mae, the country's largest provider
of home-mortgage financing, is keenly aware of how much more
accessible capital _ in the form of mortgages, credit cards and
loans _ is today than it was before a variety of government
programs were created in the aftermath of the Great Depression to
help homeowners, farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``the government was involved in pushing capital out into
the economy and making it much more available to the individual,''
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   While the private sector has taken over much of that role _ and
Fannie Mae is now a publicly held company _ the continuing spread
of capital has helped create ``a huge wealth effect'' in the United
States, according to Raines.
</P>
<P>
   But Raines, the first black chief executive of one of the
nation's largest 100 corporations, also spoke of the ``century-long
effort'' to promote equality and ``integrate black America into
society.'' Corporate America has also taken part in that effort, he
said, and he pointed to the advancement of several black executives
within the last few years. ``Ten years ago, you couldn't think
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raines also talked about those who have been left behind in what
is known as the wealth gap. ``The democratization of wealth has not
been complete,'' he said, and he voiced concern that the nation
could lose its commitment to that goal during the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, &UR;  &LR; the chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney
Co., was reluctant to pontificate, but he, too, emphasized the
transforming power of technology. The 20th century ``has been a
triumph for human expression,'' he said. Communication has been
transformed, he said, from what was once largely face to face to
something that is now both instant and universal for people around
the globe. No matter how effective books and other printed forms of
expression were in creating change, the widespread adoption of
television and the Internet has fundamentally changed how we
express ourselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the next century may see advances that make such
communication even more efficient and ubiquitous, it cannot make
communication faster, Eisner noted. ``You can't go faster than
instant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who suggested that philosophers and psychiatrists were
more adept at thinking about the implications of this change, shied
away from predicting where this instant human expression, allowing
anyone to say anything to nearly anyone else, would lead. Either
global democracy or totalitarianism could result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart, the entrepreneur whose sense of style led to the
creation of her own media and merchandising empire, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia, worries that we are already witnessing the
drawbacks of the new speed at which we conduct our lives. While she
applauded the advances of the 20th century in technology, science
and medicine, ``advancement in the study of the humanities, in art
and in cultural endeavors, seems to have been less progressive,
especially in the second half of this century,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the widespread adoption of the telephone, faxes,
e-mail messages and computers has been the inability to think
creatively, Ms. Stewart said. Answering e-mail has taken the place
of writing a great novel. Her own life has been consumed by the
Internet, she said, and technology has allowed her to do any number
of jobs at once. ``It's insane,'' she laughed, but she said she was
also saddened by the widespread implications of this speed.
</P>
<P>
   She is also concerned about the social impact of the technology,
which she described as taking away physical contact, from seeing
someone directly or talking to them on the telephone. ``It is much
more introverted living,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What she hopes is that the next century will provide more time
for people to reflect. As people get used to the technology, they
may learn to dominate it. And she hopes that we remain sensitive to
the challenge of making technology accessible to all, although she
is confident that will happen. ``Computers are going to be cheap,''
she said. ``Everyone is going to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman and chief executive of America Online, one of
the best-known providers of access to the Web, Stephen Case enjoys
a key vantage point on the development of the Internet. The
proliferation of telephones and cars, the television, the computer
and the Internet created an increasingly mobile society, Case said.
Businesses were opened up, and people could be on the move without
losing all ties to family and friends. ``Suddenly, anything was
possible,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Case, has been the American century.
``It was a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' he argued, as
technology, coupled with the spread of democracy and the relative
prosperity and security of this period, allowed people to explore
new areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was a real driver because it created not just whole
new industries, but it has also reshaped our lives,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the challenge faced by society is in
making sure everyone has access. ``It is not about dropping
computers'' into places where people have difficulty taking
advantage of the technology, he said, but about developing an
integrated approach to making sure they have the tools and
wherewithal to use the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Case believes, however, that the Internet journey is only
beginning and that there is much to learn yet about how it will
affect this country and the world. ``I do think the next century is
going to be the Internet century,'' he said, and the next decade or
two will be defined by the changes wrought by the new medium. The
Internet has the ability to transform all aspects of what we do to
gather information, shop, communicate or be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very empowering,'' he said.

TECHNOLOGY COULD SOON HAND TV CONTROL TO THE VIEWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The year is 2025. You're watching the World Series
on television. The son of Derek Jeter is at bat, and Darryl
Strawberry's heir is in the on-deck circle. You're holding a
remote-control device. Click. You call up Jeter's batting record.
Click. You move the camera into the New York Yankee dugout. Click.
You enter a chat room to talk about the game. Click. You move the
camera behind the pitcher's mound to get her perspective.
(Remember, it's 2025). Click. You want to buy a Yankee hat or order
a set of tickets for a future game or make a bet on the current
game.
</P>
<P>
   Click. Click. Click.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years from now it's hard to think that any of
these things will not be available,'' said David Neuman, president
of the Digital Entertainment Network, which creates programming on
the World Wide Web for 12- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, you want to watch the Academy Awards. Julia Roberts
and Leonardo Di Caprio have just won Oscars for roles as
grandparents retiring to Arizona. Tuning in will be, as Jeff Berg,
chairman of International Creative Management, said, a
multi-dimensional experience. Viewers will be able to call up
scenes from the Oscar-winning film, decide whether they want to
look at the glittering audience or visit backstage, engage in an
online discussion of the awards show itself and even ask the Oscar
winners a question or two over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is going through a transformation,'' Berg said, in
an obvious understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, chairman of the ABC group and president of Walt
Disney, put it more bluntly. ``The world in which the television
business exists today won't resemble anything like that world in 15
or 20 years,'' he said. ``People will want entertainment and
information customized to their own needs, their own personal
tastes. Right now you have a computer on a desktop and a television
set against a wall. In the future, people will use them
interchangeably; it will be the same piece of equipment. It's a
combination that's extremely powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Iger and other executives in the worlds of television
and entertainment are not entirely certain about the details of the
convergence of television, computers and broadband cable systems,
all agree that the experience of watching television will prove
extraordinarily different in 26 years from today's viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look ahead, what people are considering to be
television will not be today's television anymore,'' said Jim
Moloshok, president of Warner Brothers On-Line, the company's Web
site. ``Television will be a funnel to the outside world by the
consumer, and the consumer will be using it for multiple uses. And
broadcasting will be only one use.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward the next millennium, Moloshok mused: ``I'll have
a unit in my family room where I'll be able to watch a show or go
to the Web or download a movie from Blockbuster. I'll be able to
watch a television and see a commercial and relate directly to it
by making a purchase online. I'll be able to watch a football game
and maybe pay a little extra to get extra angles on the players or
deeper access to the content. If I missed an episode of a
television show, I may have to pay 15 cents or a dollar and get the
episode I missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is television in the future will survive by
giving consumers more control,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, there will be even more choices than there are
today. As a result of the explosion of cable, networks like NBC,
CBS, ABC and Fox will probably create offshoots aimed at specific
audiences _ the sports crowd, soap opera buffs, teen-agers, people
focused on Wall Street or women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago people came home and said, `What's on
television?''' said Don Ohlmeyer, former president of NBC, West
Coast. ``Today they come home and say, `What do I want to watch on
television?' And in the future it'll be like going to a computer.
The choices will be almost inexhaustible. Essentially, the job of
the programmer is being taken over by the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   At another level, though, technological breakthroughs are
accelerating changes in television so quickly that network
executives are left almost breathless _ or in denial _ about the
medium as they face the millennium. Certainly there is concern
among television executives that the major networks that pioneered
the growth of television will splinter along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most innovative digital breakthrough is the personal
video recorder, or PVR, as it is often known, an electronic device
that looks similar to a videocassette recorder but can give viewers
extraordinary power over their entertainment choices. To its
acolytes, these recorders, which now sell for about $500 and up,
spell nothing short of the end of television as it exists today.
</P>
<P>
   The system offers a viewer, essentially, almost total control
over when he or she watches a favorite show. A click of the
controller allows viewers to select what they want to watch now, or
later. Live TV is almost like watching a tape. If a viewer is
watching ``E.R.,'' and the phone rings, one can pause to answer it
and then return to pick up the show where it stopped. The machines
enable viewers to skip commercials, allowing them potentially to
catch up with the interrupted broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, viewers can easily use the machine, with a flick of a
button, to select specific programs or themes to be recorded _
football games, Tom Cruise films, the latest episode of ``Law and
Order,'' the entire syndicated ``I Love Lucy'' series. These are
offered on the schedule that the viewer wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this context, as a viewer, I will no longer care that I'm
not home on Thursday night to watch `Friends,''' said Ken Ziffren,
a top entertainment lawyer dealing with the Internet. ``I can watch
it when I choose _ say on Sunday night. The fact is, you're
creating your own schedule, at your own time. And you don't care
whether it's NBC or CBS or ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   The systems, made by rivals TiVo Inc. and Replay Networks _ two
California companies that both started in August 1997 and began
shipping in April this year _ blend a personal computer and a video
recorder. Using a computer's hard disk, the machines are able to
store 14 to 30 hours of television programs and record a live show
while a recorded show is being watched, which is basically what
they are doing when a show is paused and picked up a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of other network executives, Sandy Grushow,
chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group, said: ``There's
little question that the broadcast business will be challenged more
dramatically in the next 10 years than in the last 50. The economic
models upon which the networks were built in the 1940s are being
challenged like never before, most profoundly by digital
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all moving inexorably,'' he said, ``toward greater viewer
control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Proliferation of channels, diminishing numbers of viewers on
network television and, of course, new technologies have led to
audience fragmentation. Grushow said that companies like TiVo and
Replay had the potential of ``wreaking havoc'' on the traditional
relationship between television networks and sponsors. Inevitably,
Grushow said, advertisers and networks will be almost compelled to
develop a new and different set of relationships to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the technological changes, though, dominant
entertainment industry figures warned that gadgetry could go only
so far. In the end, they said, creativity would outweigh
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there will be an infinite set of
choices for what you want to see,'' said Michael D. Eisner,
chairman of Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co. ``There will be some kind of
confluence between the computer and the television set. But
television is only as good as what the programs are. Good programs
will drive the technology. You're only as good as your writers,
directors, actors and producers. Good storytelling hasn't changed
in a thousand years. The advance in technology will not advance a
bad story.''

 &HT;    Cabbage Patch Kids still a hot pick
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The frantic hordes are gone, the white-hot media
spotlight is focused elsewhere. But, like a balding pop star
playing Vegas, Cabbage Patch Kids are still making a very nice
living.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pokemon, before Tickle Me Elmo, before Mighty Morphin'
Power Rangers, there were Cabbage Patch Kids, the
so-ugly-they're-cute plush dolls that originated in Cleveland, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Cabbage Patch Kids triggered a national mania, the
first of what has become a holiday tradition of stampeding to buy
the hot toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabbage Patch Kids fever,'' said Julia Jensen of Mattel, ``was
the granddaddy of the toy frenzies.''
</P>
<P>
   That frenzy is the one by which all others are measured. Toy
store tussles were commonplace as parents desperately tried to grab
Cabbage Patch Kids to put under the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   The madness of people seeking the dolls became the stuff of
legends _ and a ``Newsweek'' cover story. A Kansas City, Mo.,
postman flew to London to buy a doll for his daughter. A Milwaukee
radio DJ convinced two dozen people to stand in Milwaukee County
Stadium, American Express cards raised to the sky, expecting
airborne delivery of 2,000 Cabbage Patch Kids.
</P>
<P>
   The dolls that struck such a universal chord were the offspring
of Xavier Roberts, an artist who traveled from his mountain home to
regional craft fairs selling hand-stitched dolls. The dolls weren't
(and still aren't) referred to as being sold, but ``adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   When demand for the kids increased, Roberts opened BabyLand
General Hospital in Cleveland. The remodeled house on a quiet side
street is staffed with ``nurses'' and ``doctors'' who care for the
hundreds of Cabbage Patch Kids up for adoption. Hand-stitched
infants lay in cribs, while posed toddlers sit in a classroom or
``scamper'' over playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A licensing agreement with Coleco brought to market copies of
the original Cabbage Patch Kids. Computer manufacturing allowed for
each of the dolls to be just a little different. Each left the
factory with a name and birth date. The doll's adoption certificate
allowed the owners to register them. The uniqueness was part of the
allure. Whatever the attraction, 3 million dolls weren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbage Patch fever brought the world to Cleveland, a town that
even now has just two traffic lights. People who couldn't find a
Cabbage Patch Kid in their cities called BabyLand General.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just calls back-to-back as fast as I could answer
them,'' recalled Becky Campbell, a nurse at BabyLand General.
</P>
<P>
   Some out-of-towners called local residents, offering to pay them
to buy a Cabbage Patch Kid at BabyLand General and ship it. Some
out-of-towners came to Cleveland themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most came looking for the mass-produced version and many left
with a hand-made original, said Robin Davis, doctor at BabyLand
General.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbage Patch Kids were the No. 1 toy three years running.
Annual sales topped $300 million. But just as Elvis gave way to the
Beatles, other toys became what commentators soon were calling
``the next Cabbage Patch Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Elvis continues to sell millions of records, Cabbage
Patch Kids continue to sell in similar numbers. Since their
introduction, more than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids have been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbie goes on forever, and Cabbage Patch Kids may well go on
forever,'' said Wayne Wilste of Cleveland, who has adopted more
than 260 Cabbage Patch Kids.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbage Patch Kids ``is a very important product line for us,''
said Jensen of Mattel, which has been making the dolls and
accessories since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were an estimated $63 million in 1998, according to the
NPD Group, a marketing firm that tracks the $15 billion toy
industry. BabyLand General still gets 300,000 visitors a year, many
of whom make the trip to adopt a hand-stitched kid for a fee of
$185 to $375.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbage Patch Kids have remained popular because they have all
the elements of a good toy, said Julie Creighton, director of the
Duracell Kid's Choice Toy Survey and Parenting magazine Toy Hall of
Fame Awards. The dolls are soft, cuddly and durable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under all of that frenzy, there were a whole lot of little
kids hugging the little things,'' Creighton said.
</P>
<P>
   An interactive Cabbage Patch Kid that links with computers using
wireless technology will be introduced in February, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cabbage Patch Kids have always been interactive, Creighton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the trick of Cabbage Patch Kids. They come alive
because the children bring them to life.''

 &HT;    Gore suggests biweekly debates with Bradley as alternative to TV
ads
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore challenged rival Bill
Bradley on Sunday to abandon expensive television advertising and
instead wage their campaign for president in a series of twice
weekly debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sprung his challenge during a joint appearance with Bradley
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Bradley immediately dismissed the
challenge as a stunt, refusing to shake Gore's outstretched hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds to me like you are having trouble raising money,''
Bradley snapped. ``This is a ridiculous proposal. ... For 10 months
that I was running for president you ignored me. You pretended I
didn't exist. Suddenly, I started to do better, and you want to
debate every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated his challenge to reporters after the event, and
said he would extend a similar one to the Republican nominee if he
wins the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed the suggestion that his campaign was facing money
problems, and campaign aides denied that his proposal was designed
to conserve money.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's exchange inside the beltway was Bradley and Gore's
third face-to-face encounter of the campaign, and the first to take
place without the tempering influence of a live audience or voters
posing questions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in their demeanor was dramatic. The two former
Senate colleagues, calling each other ``Bill'' and ``Al,''
interrupted one another frequently and displayed an aggressiveness
that has erupted only briefly in their previous encounters.
</P>
<P>
   They disagreed sharply over which of them possessed the vision
to lead the country into the next century, and clashed repeatedly
over health care policy, education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought repeatedly to sow doubts about Bradley's commitment
to protect Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly,
by asserting that Bradley had only recently vowed not to raise the
eligibility age for Medicare as a way to extend viability of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Bradley's plan to enroll Medicaid recipients in the
same insurance program available to government workers as a ``$150
per month voucher'' that wouldn't purchase health insurance in the
real world, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore portrayed himself as the only candidate with a
``revolutionary'' education platform, and accused Bradley of having
only a handful of ``nibble around the edges'' proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would spend $115 billion to decrease class sizes, offer
bonuses for teachers and invest in new school construction. Bradley
would spend money to double the size of Head Start, increase day
care options and invest in community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they opposed publicly financed vouchers for poor
children to use in private schools. But Bradley, who voted for
pilot voucher programs when he was a senator, said policy makers
would have to look closely at vouchers if it was shown that they
improved the quality of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the two men debated the dilemma faced by poor,
urban parents in Washington who have no choice but to send their
children to bad schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a national commitment,'' Gore said. ``That
means getting 2 million new teachers over the next 10 years. That
means rigorous peer review of current teachers ... It means closing
down failing schools. It means reducing class size.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cited his plan to entice more teachers into urban areas
with loan forgiveness programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing that the national government
could do is to make sure there's a good teacher in every
classroom,'' Bradley said. ``The difference is Al proposes an
education program ... (that) comes from Washington ... as opposed
to helping people where they live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended himself far more aggressively than he had done
in previous encounters with Gore. He accused Gore of
misrepresenting his health care plan, or not ``telling the whole
story.'' But he apologized for a campaign flier distributed in New
Hampshire that accused Gore of ``uncontrollable lying,'' saying the
release was ``unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called Medicaid a program that looked good to Washington
insiders, but one that was failing to reach 40 percent of the
nation's poor. He claimed his program would reach 30 million of the
nation's 44 million uninsured, while Gore's graduated approach
would reach only 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether you're willing to deal with a big
problem ... in a way that ensures middle-class Americans some
help,'' Bradley said. ``Al does nothing for middle-class
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men dodged questions about how they would implement their
programs if budget surpluses disappeared. In a national crisis,
Gore said, ``all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will guarantee that in a Gore presidency, you will have the
leadership to solve whatever problem confronts Social Security and
Medicare without raising the retirement age,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to let Medicare or Social Security go
bankrupt,'' Bradley asserted.
</P>
<P>
   NBC host Tim Russert grilled Gore about his claim, issued on the
day of President Clinton's impeachment, that history would record
Clinton as one of the nation's greatest presidents. When Russert
asked if Gore would include Clinton with Presidents Washington and
Lincoln, Gore answered, ``Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that his accomplishments are going to be regarded
by the history books as far more significant than his personal
mistakes,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name the ``greatest'' presidents, Bradley
pointedly excluded Clinton and instead named Presidents Lincoln,
Washington, Franklin Roosevelt and Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to accept Russert's characterization of the 1996
campaign finance scandals as ``overly aggressive, perhaps
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded only that Democrats had succumbed to ``pushing the
limits.'' Bradley called the scandal an embarrassment. But he also
conceded that his 1990 Senate campaign, which generated $12
million, raised ``too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered that you can have too much money in a political
campaign,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Russert also pressed Bradley to defend his 1991 vote against
using force in the Persian Gulf to expel Saddam Hussein from
Kuwait, given that the use of force in Kuwait ultimately drove
Saddam out. Bradley said he would not take the vote back.

IN CHINA, VISIONS OF INTERNET RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When negotiators from China and the United States
clinked their champagne glasses here last month to celebrate a
trade agreement between the two countries, nobody exulted more than
China's Internet entrepreneurs. The deal, which opens the door to
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, will also allow
foreign companies to own stakes of up to 50 percent in Chinese
Internet companies by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Even as China reaches outside itself to become a full-fledged
member of the club of trading nations, the outside world is
reaching deeper into China through the Internet. While the market
access promised by the trade deal could still be hindered by
cumbersome regulations, China's cyberspace is officially open.
</P>
<P>
   That breakthrough, experts say, will accelerate a digital gold
rush that began in New York last July, when a Hong Kong company
with an auspicious name issued shares on the Nasdaq. The offering,
by China.com, raised $84 million and put a $1.5 billion value on
the company, which is an Internet content provider and a portal.
</P>
<P>
   While China.com's stock has since had the bungee-jumping ride
typical in high technology, it remains a potent symbol of how
entrepreneurs here can make a fortune by putting together two
alluring concepts: the world's most populous country and the
world's most exciting new medium.
</P>
<P>
   Last year represented more than a coming-out party for a single
Chinese cyberventure. With nearly 7 million users across the
country, the Internet in China crossed the threshold in 1999 from a
heady concept to a market with genuine opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit a critical mass of users by the end of 1999,'' said
Wang Yan, the general manager of Sina.com, an Internet provider
that runs the most popular Web site in China. ``The coming year
will mark the launch of e-commerce in China.'' Sina.com executives
attribute their site's popularity to its good graphics and the fact
that it is a home-grown service, not a Hong Kong import, like
China.com, which also provides Web consulting services and
advertising services.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, few of the major Chinese Internet
companies are profitable. Even so, foreign investors have poured
tens of millions of dollars into companies like China.com, Sina.com
and Sohu.com, another major Chinese player.
</P>
<P>
   The investors prefer to focus on the growth potential. BDA China
Ltd., an Internet consulting company based here, estimates that the
number of online users in China will jump to 33.6 million in 2003
from 12 million in 2000, a compound annual growth rate of 57
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce, which generated a paltry $8 million in
revenue here in 1998, could generate $3.8 billion by 2003,
according to International Data Corp., an American market-research
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these grand numbers are based on the prospect of a mass
market,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner in BDA China. ``The question
is: How long is your time horizon?'' For example, most Chinese now
pay cash-on-delivery for goods, and full-fledged e-commerce will
probably have to wait for more credit-card users _ about 50 million
cards are outstanding. Still, the growth in card use is reasonably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question for the future of the Internet is the role
played by the Chinese government. Beijing's top communications
official stunned investors last September when he unexpectedly
reaffirmed a longstanding ban on foreign investment in Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. companies, including Intel, Dell Computer and Dow
Jones &AMP; Co., had already financed Chinese start-ups, and are now
uncertain about the status of their investments. Most own stakes of
less than 50 percent, so theoretically they should be allowed to
retain their investments. But Wu Jichuan, the information industry
minister, has made ominous noises about Internet companies that are
more than 50 percent foreign-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the trade agreement between the United States and
China that was signed in November, ownership restrictions are
supposed to be lifted gradually. By 2002, foreign companies will be
allowed to own up to 50 percent of Internet content companies. By
2006, they will be allowed to own up to 49 percent of Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts here suggest that Beijing's real intent is not so
much to keep foreign companies out as to regulate those that get
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they block foreign investment, how are they going to
license the necessary technology for secured transactions to do
e-commerce?'' Clark of BDA China asked. ``If they stunt the
Internet, where is the growth going to come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Zemin, the president of China, has said he favors growth
in the Internet but has not specifically addressed those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond foreign money, some analysts question whether the Chinese
government will tolerate the flood of foreign information _ some of
it culturally and politically sensitive _ that would become
available with unbridled growth of the Internet. At the moment,
Beijing is pursuing potentially conflicting goals: nurturing a
commercial, nonpolitical Internet while trying to curb its tendency
toward anarchic growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the authorities warned Internet providers not to
provide links to foreign news outlets, and they continue to block a
handful of specific foreign Web sites, including those of The New
York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people can sign on to them by dialing into servers
outside the Chinese mainland. Normally, access to the Internet in
China is provided by links to one of the two state-owned telephone
companies, China Telecom and China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about China erecting a wall around the
Internet, the emergence of the Net as a tool that could be used by
the Chinese people for domestic political purposes is perhaps a
greater threat to Beijing than foreign news articles. Last summer,
members of a spiritual movement, Falun Gong, circulated updates
about their group electronically, despite a sweeping crackdown and
the arrest of hundreds of Falun Gong leaders by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exponential ability of Party A to speak with Party B,
which is so exciting to people in Silicon Valley, is a major threat
to the government,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the current crop of Internet entrepreneurs
studiously avoids politics, while trying to help their country
enter the digital mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Since the lucrative initial public offering of China.com, major
U.S. investment banks have been swarming over China's most
promising start-ups. Sina.com and Sohu.com are both planning to
sell shares, perhaps as soon as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Zhang, the 35-year-old founder and chief executive of
Sohu.com, who holds a doctorate in physics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has become the most celebrated of China's
Internet pioneers by creating a service that appeals exclusively to
mainland Chinese users. Yet even he professes admiration for Peter
Yip, the chief executive of China.com, for having locked up the
most valuable domain name in 1997 and for being the first to go
public.
</P>
<P>
   Determined not to fall behind its rivals in other areas, Sohu
recently started an e-commerce business that allows more than 100
merchants to sell books, compact discs and computer software over
the Internet. Electronic commerce, an even less developed business
in China than advertising-supported services, generated $42 million
last year, International Data estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In every debate about the Internet here, the conversation
inevitably drifts back to the numbers: Fewer than 2 percent of
China's 1.3 billion people own personal computers. Goldman Sachs
estimates that 0.2 percent of China's people now have access to the
Internet. With growth prospects like that, the world's last
communist empire could create more than its share of 21st-century
tycoons.

 &HT;    Atlanta airport soon to surpass O'Hare in traffic
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was
the king of the crowded concourses. A fixture in the business
world's lexicon was, ``Sorry I'm running late, but I'm stuck at
O'Hare.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the past decade, Atlanta's Hartsfield started to fit that
picture. Last year, it surpassed Chicago by handling the most
passengers a year. Now, if Federal Aviation Administration
projections hold, it will be No. 1 in another category: the most
planes landing and taking off in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says it expects Hartsfield will surpass Chicago O'Hare
with about 910,000 landings and takeoffs this year _ or about
10,000 more than O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet we won't miss (that projection) by more than 100 or so,
because our folks are pretty good at that,'' said Stanley Zylowski,
air traffic manager for the FAA's Southeastern Region.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Atlanta beating out Chicago _ perennially the
leader in passengers and operations _ would have set off
civic-pride boasts. Airports like the title ``busiest'' because it
is a marketing tool to attract more airlines.
</P>
<P>
   If an airport has the most passengers, international carriers
are more likely to come knocking at the door, said Hartsfield
spokesman Miguel Southwell, because that airport will have the most
connections to other cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But being top dog has its downside, too: Travelers have to deal
with crowded gates, long lines at ticket counters and delays from
backed-up runways.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Chicago this time: Atlanta, you be the world's
loudest, most congested airport for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means more airplanes in the air, more noise. I'm sure the
folks in the suburbs will appreciate that,'' said O'Hare
spokeswoman Monique Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Southwell said he wasn't ``ready to declare victory'' until he
sees firmer figures on both passengers and operations. The current
figures on passenger and operations volume from Airports Council
International, which keeps track of more than 700 airport
worldwide, only run through July.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of fanfare over leadership in departures/arrivals comes
at a time airlines are having a tough time dealing with delays and
crowded planes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, which accounts for 75 percent of Hartsfield's
passengers, has recently improved its rate of bumping passengers.
Hartsfield is averaging delays of six to eight minutes per flight.
Officials are pushing to get a fifth runway built by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has contributed most of the operations increase at
Hartsfield, accounting for about 1,300 of the airport's daily rate
of 2,500 departing/arriving flights.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman John Kennedy said Delta has added new cities,
increased flights to major cities and added overseas schedules
since 1994, when it flew about 1,100 flights a day into and from
Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chicago falling behind Atlanta produced some excuses from
the airport there.
</P>
<P>
   Operations fell off at O'Hare, because of labor problems earlier
this year at one of its major tenants, American Airlines, Bond
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we have some suburbanites who drive right past O'Hare to
get to Midway because of 20 percent lower fares (on regional
airlines),'' Bond added.

FILM'S DIGITAL POTENTIAL HAS HOLLYWOOD ON EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The executive offices, with a half-dozen
paper-strewn desks in two rooms of a third-floor walk-up, are just
across the street from the basement nerve center where more than
two dozen people hunch over laptops and chatter to one another in
the dull glow of the computer screens. In other words, the ragged
bifurcated headquarters of iFilm looks pretty much like a cliched
rendering of an Internet start-up company, which is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also, in its way, a movie studio of the future.
Throughout the entertainment industry, from the major studios to
Internet start-up companies, people are trying to figure out how
the rapidly emerging digital technology will affect the movies that
people see and the ways that they see them. What iFilm is doing _
distributing digital films through the Internet to anyone with a
computer while also providing a forum for filmmakers and industry
executives to find each other _ is a good example of how this
technology is mutating the power structures that have governed
Hollywood since the advent of the talkies in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a movie studio is changing as we watch,'' said
Rodger Raderman, one of iFilm's founders and its co-chairman.
``What is a studio? If you think of it as a place where movies are
developed, produced, marketed and distributed, then we are very
close to having a technology where one person can do that all by
himself. Each person can be his own studio.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood, an industry that claims to have its finger on the
pulse of mass audience tastes, it is a perplexing time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie business is moving into an interesting, perhaps
perilous and largely unknown period when the economics of
filmmaking and the very foundation of the power structures that
have governed the business for almost a century are more fluid than
at any time in its history. The pace of change and the revolution
in technology are outstripping entertainment executives' ability to
comprehend and control their business. Unease is the mood of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites devoted to producing digital films or, like iFilm,
providing a forum for digital films produced by others have been
proliferating in recent months as wave after wave of innovative
software and hardware have begun to ease what many see as the
inevitable transition between an old film-based technology and a
new digital movie world. The common wisdom among industry analysts
is that it will take three to five years for a sufficient number of
American households to acquire either digital television sets or
broadband capabilities for their computers, making it easy and
profitable for companies to pipe films to them on the Internet.
Sometime after that, they say, in maybe another two to three years,
the technology will be in place to allow people to call up movies
on demand _ simply ordering up whatever they want, when they want
it _ obviating the need for scheduled programming or video stores.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to Hollywood then? Will people still go out to
the movies?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Raderman said, iFilm is not out to eat Hollywood's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are not the enemy,'' stressed Skip Paul, a
longtime Universal Pictures executive who founded Sega GameWorks,
the arcade company, with Steven Spielberg and was named iFilm's
other co-chairman last month.
</P>
<P>
   What iFilm wants to do, Raderman said, is ``enable'' filmmakers
and entertainment executives to meet each other in a kind of
high-technology forum where digital films can be shown through
their Web sites, where filmmakers can trade information about their
craft and where Hollywood agents and producers can gossip with one
another on a protected site and shop around for fresh ideas and new
talent. The ``communal experience'' of the movie theater will
remain important to consumers, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the future: some youngster in Indiana making a movie on
his hand-held digital camcorder, editing it on his laptop and
shipping it to someplace like iFilm, where it can be piped into
every living room in America in a blink? Will filmmaking finally
become, as Orson Welles once described it, the best toy train set a
kid ever had?
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is evolving so fast, and we want to be in the
catbird's seat when broadband becomes a reality,'' said Spielberg,
whose DreamWorks SKG studio is joining Imagine Entertainment to
create Pop.com, a Web site that will present short, original
digital films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strides that the technology has made in the last year,
really in just the last six months or so, has led me to believe
that this is really the birth of a new medium, a shift from
information to entertainment on the Internet, which will create
some great opportunities for creative people to do new kinds of
work,'' said Ron Howard, the director who co-founded Imagine, one
of Hollywood's most prolific movie and television production
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is nervous about the coming years because three things
are happening simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   First, movie technology, from the way films are made to the way
they will be shown, is riding an incredible high-technology wave
driven by the marriage of new digital movie-making gizmos and the
Internet, from digital cameras to digital editing software to
digital projectors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional movies have become more and more
expensive to produce. Driven by huge salaries for the top talent,
escalating production costs and more expensive marketing demands,
movie studios are struggling to find new formulas to make movies _
at a profit _ that will satisfy an increasingly fickle and
unpredictable audience. Because all the major studios are owned by
larger corporations, which increasingly see them as mere divisions
within a larger money-making machine, these dwindling profits have
led to growing cost-cutting demands from corporate patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the demographic bulge _ the so-called boomer
echo generation, even larger than the boomers who gave birth to
them _ that in the next decade will come into their adolescence and
early adulthood, their prime movie-going years. So much money to be
made. Can anybody figure out what these movigoers will want to see
_ and how they are going to want to see it?
</P>
<P>
   If the future is, as many believe, somehow brewing out there in
the world of digital technology and broadband distribution, then
its larval state must be here, in the basement nerve center of
places like iFilm. Raderman recently huddled over a screen,
watching a display of new iFilm software that makes viewing films
on a computer screen more pleasurable (it blacks out all of the
screen but the window showing the film, like a letterbox format).
</P>
<P>
   Basically, there are three technical issues that are being
resolved at this very moment by iFilm and other cybercompanies,
Raderman said. Movies have been available on the Internet for
years, but they have been an unsatisfying experience for most
viewers; available only in partial screen windows, taking forever
to download on most currently used modems, often herky-jerky when
played on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough has been compression software, which
allows the computer to read the image as it is playing and refresh
only those parts that are changing _ say, lips and facial
expressions if a person is talking into a camera against a static
background. Much time is saved, and the image moves more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The second technical issue is so-called streaming video.
Previously, to play a film on a home computer, viewers had to
download the whole film and then play it back. With streaming
video, now available on most home computers, the movie begins to
play when it is only partly downloaded; the remainder of the film
downloads in the background while the first portion plays, thus
reducing waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Raderman said, there is the issue of the ``size of the
pipeline'' _ that is, how the digital images are transmitted into
the computer or television set, whether by modem or cable or
satellite. There are almost constant improvements to the capacity
of the line, he said, and in getting more information through
existing lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that this becomes a viable company when 20
percent'' of the people have the technology for watching movies on
the Internet, said Lucas McDonough, iFilm's other founder and its
president. ``That's coming soon. These things are going to be
resolved simply because there is so much money to be made in
resolving them.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John Harbison began working on his third opera,
``The Great Gatsby,'' he faced a particular musical challenge that
has stymied many opera composers before him.
</P>
<P>
   The iconic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, on which the opera is
based, is set in the Jazz Age, the early 1920s. So the narrative is
filled with popular songs, dance music and show tunes from the
period. Jay Gatsby is always giving parties at his fancy house on
the Long Island shore, and his house resounds with music: jazz
bands and pop vocalists, dance combos playing fox trots and tangos.
Sometimes real tunes turn up significantly in Fitzgerald's prose,
like ``Ain't We Got Fun'' and ``The Sheik of Araby.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Harbison to do? Incorporate pop standards into his
opera? His own music would very likely have been blotted out by the
familiar tunes, and the tunes might have jarringly interrupted the
musical-dramatic flow.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being intimidated by the challenge, Harbison welcomed
it. The technique of evoking vernacular music has a long heritage
in opera, and Harbison conceived ``The Great Gatsby'' as an
extension of the tradition. The work receives its world premiere
Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera, with James Levine
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences are often startled when a living composer evokes
vernacular music, as William Bolcom does, for example, in ``A View
From the Bridge,'' which recently received its premiere at the
Lyric Opera of Chicago. The familiar music can seem incongruous
with what is perceived as operatic style. But older operas are
filled with evocations of vernacular music, though today's
audiences often miss this because the evoked styles are from
another era.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi's operas are rich with vernacular music; for example,
``Rigoletto.'' After an ominous orchestra prologue, the scene opens
at the Duke's palace, where an offstage band, exactingly evoked in
the orchestra, plays dance music for a bawdy party. The trick, as
Verdi realized, was to blend the vernacular idioms into a
contemporary musical language.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi did not provide his impressions of dance bands from
16th-century Mantua, the opera's setting, but music that his
audience in the 1850s would have recognized from any village square
in Italy. And before long the dance music builds subtly but
steadily into a full-fledged, complex choral ensemble, the kind of
music an audience of the day would have encountered only in a Verdi
opera.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes opera composers must invent vernacular music to suit
their purposes. Verdi obviously knew nothing about the music of
ancient Egypt when he composed ``Aida.'' So he fashioned a
19th-century Italian composer's impression of it, quite
convincingly, Harbison said. ``It works for me,'' he said recently
during a break in rehearsals for his opera at the Met. ``If it's
not Egyptian, it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Tchaikovsky used many real and made-up Russian songs and folk
tunes in his operas. Wagner's ``Meistersinger'' is a veritable
compendium of German folk songs, hymns and dances. Even a weighty
work like ``Tristan und Isolde'' has Wagner's versions of sailors'
songs, shepherds' plaints and hunting calls. Berg's ``Wozzeck,''
despite its expressionistic atonal language, evokes soldiers'
songs, children's ditties and even some maudlin barroom piano
music.
</P>
<P>
   As an opera composer, Mozart is practically Mr. Vernacular. In
her 1983 book, ``Rhythmic Gesture in Mozart,'' the scholar Wye
Jamison Allanbrook demonstrates that virtually every aria and
ensemble in ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' and ``Don Giovanni'' is based on
some 17th- or 18th-century dance form that Mozart's audiences would
have found familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They might not have exactly identified, say, a musette as a
musette. But they would have recognized the style and intuitively
understood its implications, much as Harbison's listeners may not
identify one of his rumbas as such but will get the point.
</P>
<P>
   His solution to the problem of evoking music from the 1920s in
his 1990s opera was the only one possible. Though he wrote his own
libretto, he asked Murray Horwitz to write '20s-style song lyrics
for which Harbison composed music. The songs and dances are spiked
with contemporary harmonic touches and blended into the continuous
musical flow of the score, which has a consistent compositional
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you cannot evoke 1920s music without having a feel for
it. Harbison, who turns 61 on Monday, does. From the age of 8, he
listened faithfully to the radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan
Opera, and his father, a history professor at Princeton University
and an amateur musician, periodically took him to Met performances.
At the same time, though, he was excited by jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high school he formed a Dixieland band called, to his
continuing embarrassment, the Harbison Heptet. He played piano. At
14 he applied to the musicians union and, after swearing under oath
that he had never been a member of the Communist Party, was
admitted. In high school he played in jazz bands and wrote
arrangements of pop standards.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison's formal training as a composer came later, at Harvard,
where he studied with Walter Piston, and in graduate school at
Princeton, where he worked with Roger Sessions and Milton Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   But pop and jazz styles are still second nature to him. There
are 17 original vernacular pieces in ``Gatsby,'' including tangos,
charlestons and jazzy songs. Yet a close examination of the
piano-vocal score reveals the skill with which Harbison wove the
vernacular styles into the fabric of the entire score, even its
most intense and thorny moments.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what works on the page may not work on the stage.
Whether ``The Great Gatsby'' succeeds will hinge on questions that
can be answered only in performance. But in this specific, and
central, matter of using vernacular idioms in a contemporary
fashion, Harbison's know-how is a model that could benefit any
opera composer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, in an early scene, Tom Buchanan, the husband of the
heroine, Daisy, takes her cousin Nick Carraway, a jaded young
stockbroker, to meet his mistress, Myrtle, at the garage run by
Myrtle's unaware husband. There Tom turns on the radio to a jazzy
song. A jaunty oompah-oompah fox-trot rhythm carries the music
along, the tune is sunny and singable, and the words are just
right, not too fancy:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I kind of flying
</P>
<P>
   In a sky kind of blue?
</P>
<P>
   It's not 'cause my head's in the clouds, dear.
</P>
<P>
   It's just 'cause I'm thinking of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the chords are juiced with little ``off'' notes here and
there, and a sustained inner voice noodles around, slightly
blurring the clarity of the key. The harmonic richness is very
subtle. But even the most untrained ear will subliminally sense
that this supposed fox trot is kind of edgy.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison is trying to evoke the sound of earlier Dixieland, when
the rhythm section used a banjo and a tuba. Later, when these
instruments were replaced by the guitar and string bass, the music
became more genteel.
</P>
<P>
   Even when vernacular songs and dances are not explicitly evoked,
the music of ``Gatsby'' is charged with the energy and swing
rhythms of the '20s. In the opening scene, when Daisy is lounging
about her house with her friend Jordan, and Nick shows up, the
music is easygoing on the surface, with conversational vocal lines
and jazzy rhythmic riffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the chords are pungent, the rhythmic flow asymmetrical. The
music alerts you to the pretense of Daisy's cheerfulness. She knows
her husband is cheating. Jordan is protective of Daisy and guarded
about Nick, and the interchange between them is uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is a tragic, bitter story, and the opera
reaches for those emotions in extended passages that explode with
dissonant-saturated, atonal intensity. Musically they do not seem
incongruous, for the composer has prepared the listener's ear with
the buried intensity of the vernacular music.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison said he was ``going to enjoy taking people sometimes to
places harmonically which are as challenging as moments in `Moses
und Aron.''' You can understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenbergian angst is not what most people would associate with
Harbison. He calls himself a ``chromatic tonalist,'' meaning a
composer who writes music essentially grounded to tonal centers but
harmonically free-roaming and wayward and, in his case, jolted now
and then with the sounds of the cutting-edge musical styles.
</P>
<P>
   Though Harbison had notable tenures as composer in residence
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Pittsburgh Symphony, he
has lived most of his adult life in the Boston area, teaching at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said it does not
bother him that he had been dubbed a ``New England composer,''
which he defined as reserved, conscious of craft and comfortable
with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he may fit his own definition, Harbison, who won the 1987
Pulitzer Prize in music for a sacred cantata, ``The Flight Into
Egypt,'' likes to discombobulate listeners periodically by going
against his nature _ as when he wrote a piece called ``Three City
Blocks'' for wind ensemble, which was given its premiere in 1992 by
the U.S. Air Force Band at a big-band convention in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Some people told him they didn't know he could write ``such a
dirty piece, with all that junk in it,'' he said, which he took as
a splendid compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatsby'' may not be dirty, but it is often gritty, squalling
with the earthy energy of '20s dance music and jazz. Harbison said
he knew that using vernacular music, even in his up-to-date
adaptations, was risky. The subtlety of his technique may not reach
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   But given the stylistic diversity of music today, an inevitable
reflection of the stylistic battles that have characterized the
20th century, it is important for composers to be true to their own
sensibilities. Harbison is dismayed, he said, when he encounters
young composers whose concert works bear no stylistic connection to
the music they listen to for fun or the music they loved when they
were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   The great opera composers had no such disjunction. Mozart loved
to dance, loved dance music of all kinds and loved a snappy
alehouse tune. All of those loves come through in his operas, no
matter how sophisticated the score. He enjoyed a good show and was
never happier than when working in the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   He and John Harbison would have a lot to talk about.

   It has been a century of success for American business. General
Motors grew to be the world's largest car company, Coca-Cola became
ubiquitous around the globe, with McDonald's not far behind, and
Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse may be known to far more people than any
president ever has been. Microsoft, although not yet 25, is already
the world's most valuable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still plenty of missteps over the past 100 years,
even by the most successful companies. Some failed to pursue new
opportunities and were left to stare jealously as upstarts
surpassed them. Sometimes changes looked good to experts, but
outraged customers. Company founders underestimated the value of
what they had created and sold out before the real wealth arrived.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, in chronological order, are 12 of the biggest
business blunders of the past 100 years. It would not be a stretch
to bet that similar mistakes will be made in the next century as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Takes Bonds
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Carnegie agreed to sell his Carnegie Steel in 1901
to the steel trust being assembled by J.P. Morgan _ the U.S. Steel
Corp. _ he was convinced that the shares being sold to investors in
the new company were ridiculously overvalued and sure to fall in
price. So Carnegie demanded, and got, his $250 million payment in 5
percent bonds, thus assuring him a more than ample income for the
rest of his life. But he was supplanted by John D. Rockefeller as
the nation's wealthiest person. Had he taken the stock instead, he
almost certainly would have maintained his status.
</P>
<P>
   Sears Sells Out
</P>
<P>
   Richard Warren Sears, one of two founders of Sears, Roebuck and
Co., took on Julius Rosenwald as a partner after Alvah C. Roebuck
left in 1895. But Sears and Rosenwald quarreled over how to run the
company. Among other things, Rosenwald insisted that Sears stop
selling something called a ``Heidelberg Belt,'' an electrified
device that was said to cure a variety of ailments, including
impotence, for only $12.
</P>
<P>
   After Rosenwald insisted on cutting expenditures in the face of
a recession, Sears quit in 1908. For five years, he held onto his
stock, but in 1913 he sold. As a result, his heirs _ Sears died
just one year later _ were left to watch the company's phenomenal
growth from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's Pulls Back
</P>
<P>
   As World War II neared its end in 1945, the conventional
economic forecast for the United States was gloomy. Perhaps all
those soon-to-be-unemployed soldiers would plunge the country back
into depression; certainly a recession would arrive as the
government drastically reduced its spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell Avery, the president of Montgomery Ward, the
Chicago-based retailer, believed the forecast and husbanded cash
for the inevitable downturn. The chain's crosstown rival, Sears,
meanwhile, bucked the conventional wisdom and borrowed money to
build in the expanding suburbs. Sears' bet proved right. World War
II had produced a lot of savings and pent-up demand, and the
doomsday forecast was wrong. Ward's would never recover from its
error.
</P>
<P>
   A Journal Drops Stocks
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of World War II, the two largest business newspapers
in the United States _ The Journal of Commerce and The Wall Street
Journal _ were neck-and-neck in circulation and influence. Then The
Journal of Commerce decided in 1951 to drop stock tables, which it
felt were of relatively little interest and costly to produce, and
to concentrate on narrow business areas. The Wall Street Journal
took off from there, aided in part by a growing public interest in
the stock market, and it now has a circulation of 1.75 million.
Today's Journal of Commerce circulation? About 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Railroads' Narrow Track
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the century, the railroads were the
undisputed masters of national transportation. But since they
thought of themselves as railroads rather than transportation
companies, they never tried to expand into either trucking or
airlines at a time when their capital could have given them the
edge. In mid-century, many of the rails went through bankruptcy
reorganization, and it was decades before they began to make good
money through intermodal service _ the shipping of goods by a
combination of rail and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's $60 Million Loss
</P>
<P>
   Few culture clashes in the world of business have been greater
than the one set up when Ross Perot, the Texas-based founder of
Electronic Data Systems, was induced in 1970 to come to the rescue
of Francis I. duPont &AMP; Co., a Wall Street firm with a great past
and a struggling present.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the opportunity to save the company while building the
business of the EDS unit that provided record-keeping services for
brokerage firms, Perot yielded to the entreaties, which included
pressure from Nixon administration officials worried about the
effect a Wall Street bankruptcy would have on public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw appalled him. Perot could not believe how badly Wall
Street ran its operations; Wall Street executives were equally
appalled by the interloper they considered a hick from Texas. Perot
was left holding the bag when duPont's successor firm, duPont
Walston, collapsed in 1974. He lost at least $60 million in the
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   A Bonded Failure
</P>
<P>
   John R. Bunting, the chief executive of the First Pennsylvania
Corp., the owner of Philadelphia's biggest _ and the nation's
oldest _ bank, put more than $1 billion of the bank's money into
Treasury bonds in 1976, and thus proved that you can go broke
lending to a borrower with perfect credit.
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered losses on real estate loans, Bunting turned to
Treasuries yielding 8 percent. But interest rates rose to
previously unthinkable levels, sending the value of the bonds down
and causing huge losses as the bank paid more interest to
depositors than it was earning on the bonds. Eventually, it had to
be bailed out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The
bank survived, but its shareholders suffered. Eventually, it was
acquired by another bank.

<P>
   Schlitz Is Penny Wise
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Schlitz was the nation's No. 2 beer company,
behind Anheuser-Busch. Trying to improve profits, the company
changed its brewing process to cut production time to four days
from 12 and cut costs with a variety of additives.
</P>
<P>
   When that did not scare off customers, it made one more change,
adding a new ingredient known as Chill-garde to prolong the beer's
shelf life. Unfortunately, that interacted with a foam stabilizer
the company had added earlier, making the beer look milky. And that
led to a huge recall in 1976 that destroyed the brand's image.
Schlitz became a minor player.
</P>
<P>
   Amax Spurns a Suitor
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the oil boom, Chevron looked around for
somewhere to spend its windfall profits and settled on Amax, a
metals company whose share price had risen on talk that all natural
resources would be in short supply. Amax fought off the 1981 bid,
calling it too low, and Chevron backed off. Shareholders who could
have enjoyed the gains from the sale instead watched Amax's share
price collapse as natural resource values plunged in the 1980s.
Eventually, Amax merged into Cyprus-Amax and spun off its
gold-mining operations to shareholders, who got far less than they
could have had in a marriage with Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   IBM FailS to Think
</P>
<P>
   When IBM entered the personal computer arena in 1981, it
imme set the standard for what had been a fragmented market.
That led to monopoly profits for the company that controlled the
standard _ but that was not IBM. It was Microsoft, the upstart that
developed and owned the computer's operating system. The failure of
IBM _ which was known for the THINK signs posted throughout its
plants _ to secure any ownership interest in Microsoft or its
operating system may have been the most costly mistake ever made by
a major American company.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe for Disaster
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was the most popular soft drink in the world by a wide
margin in the mid 1980s when the company decided to conduct taste
tests. Those showed that most people liked a sweeter taste, one
more like that of Pepsi-Cola, the company's prime competitor. So in
1985 the company scratched the old formula and, with much fanfare,
introduced a new one. So confident was Roberto C. Goizueta, the
chairman of Coca-Cola, of the test results that he called the
decision ``one of the easiest we have ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, most of Coke's fervently loyal customers did not agree.
Only three months later, the company yielded to consumer outrage
and brought back the old formula. The new one was supposed to stay
around, but it eventually vanished. Coke went on to prosper again,
but the New Coke humiliation remains vivid to those who endured it.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Misdials
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's attempt to become a major player in the computer business
with its $7.4 billion takeover of NCR in 1991 wins the award as
worst big merger of the century. NCR faltered under AT&AMP;T's control
as expected synergies proved evanescent. Five years _ and billion
of dollars in losses _ after the takeover was completed, AT&AMP;T
washed its hands of NCR by spinning it off to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T did not merit the dishonor without competition. Other
really bad deals include Xerox's 1969 purchase of Scientific Data
Systems (a $1 billion investment that ultimately proved worthless);
Mobil's 1974 takeover of Montgomery Ward (which lost money until
the company was finally sold to a leveraged buyout firm in 1988,
nine years before it filed for bankruptcy); Sony's 1989 acquisition
of Columbia Pictures (which Sony still owns, a few billion in
losses later), and Quaker Oats' 1994 purchase of Snapple for $1.7
billion (which the cereal company sold for $300 million in 1997).

U.S. AUTO EXECUTIVES EXPECT INTERNET CAR PURCHASES TO RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk)

   JACKSON, Mich. _ When a customer calls Extreme Dodge here, the
dealership's caller identification system instantly brings up on a
sales representative's computer screen the customer's sales and
service record, along with a photo of the customer and her vehicle.
For new buyers, sales or finance managers are no longer required to
approve each deal, so a sales representative can negotiate a price
and arrange a car loan and insurance in just 45 minutes, in
contrast to several hours at many dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, much remains the same here as at dealerships across
the country. Most customers come in and test-drive the cars before
buying one. The prices, although close to factory invoice, are
still subject to some negotiation. The dealer, Wesley Lutz, is
active in the community and tries to sell cars to his friends. And
the dealership is sometimes short of popular sport utility vehicles
and clogged with unpopular cars, as factories hundreds of miles
away keep cranking out whatever their assembly lines are designed
to produce, with limited ability to respond swiftly to shifts in
market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme Dodge is cited by some auto dealers as an example of the
industry's future: a computer-using, family-owned business with a
lean staff that has earned DaimlerChrysler's top rating of five
stars for customer satisfaction. But whether Extreme Dodge really
represents the future, or simply a modern version of a century-old
way of doing business, is hotly debated within the auto industry.
As executives try to envision what automobiles and the auto
industry will look like in 2010, the buying process absorbs much of
their attention because of rapid changes that are already beginning
to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives, particularly at General Motors Corp.
and to some extent at Ford Motor Co., say that many customers no
longer have time to visit dealerships or even take test-drives.
They contend that in the next few years, millions of Americans will
start ordering new cars on the Internet, with a dealer simply
showing up at the buyer's home or office to drop off the new
vehicle and fill out the paperwork _ and even the paperwork will
eventually disappear, too. A decade from now, these executives
predict, customers will choose their vehicles on the Internet,
specifying options and paint color, submit an electronic order
straight to the factory and take delivery in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions are increasingly popular in Detroit, even
though the percentage of Internet purchases now is very small.
``While today it's less than 1 percent, in 10 years it'll rise to
40 percent, 50 percent It's going up geometrically,'' said Mark
Hogan, GM's group vice president for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most prominent industry analysts share this view.
``Consumers will get their information from the Internet, not a
salesperson. The salesperson will be just an order taker,'' said J.
David Power, founder of J.D. Power and Associates consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Torrance, Calif., where the big Japanese automakers have
their North American sales headquarters, a very different vision of
the future is taking shape, a future that looks a lot like Extreme
Dodge looks today. These executives say that while customers may
increasingly check invoice prices and features on the Internet,
they will always want to test-drive cars before buying them, and
many customers will want to know the dealer or salesman who sells
them the car.
</P>
<P>
   James Press, executive vice president for North American sales
of Toyota Motor Corp., said that the best way to see what a
dealership would look like in 2010 is to visit an up-to-date
dealership today. ``In many ways, it won't be a lot different. The
more things change, the more they'll stay the same,'' he said.
``We'll still have people. You'll have relationships. You'll have a
place to test-drive a car and a place to have it serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler executives tend to agree with the managers at
their Japanese competitors rather than with their crosstown rivals
in Detroit. They question the feasibility of building huge numbers
of cars one at a time, much less delivering them quickly, and they
wonder whether customers will be willing to wait once they decide
on a model.
</P>
<P>
   The typical customer remains emotional, even impetuous, about
car purchases, despite the cost involved, said James Holden, the
president of DaimlerChrysler's former Chrysler operations. ``Once
they see it, touch it, feel it, they want it right then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has created elaborate Web sites for its
divisions, but these sites are mainly to provide information and
steer customers to their nearest dealership to make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   While there is an industry consensus that customers will rely
more on the Internet in the years ahead to gather information about
automobiles, nobody knows for sure what those vehicles will look
like. Most auto engineers do predict, however, that ever more
vehicles will look like combinations of minivans, sport utility
vehicles and cars, and will be assembled like cars rather than
pickup trucks to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis, GM's head of global vehicle engineering, said that
today's bulky four-wheel-drive systems, which are designed to let
motorists extract themselves from swamps or deep snow, are likely
to be replaced on many vehicles with lighter, less expensive
all-wheel-drive systems. All-wheel-drive systems, which typically
do not have so-called transfer cases with very low gears, are just
as effective as four-wheel drives for accelerating on slippery
roads, although neither helps for braking.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have called for increased use of hybrid
engines that rely partly on electricity and partly on gasoline or
methanol. Indeed, Honda and Toyota plan to introduce small cars
with such systems next year. But in a report in November, the
Energy Information Administration predicted that 14.3 million
automobiles would be sold in 2010, but only 560,000, or 4 percent,
would be hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells, an even cleaner technology that involves combining
hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, will power only 2,000 or so
automobiles sold in 2010, said David Chien, the agency's
transportation forecasting team leader. ``They'll start making a
dent around 2015,'' he said, adding that automakers were leery of
damaging any new technology's reputation by offering it before it
had been perfected. ``They really don't want to put something out
early and blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   As hybrid engines and eventually fuel cells do come onto the
market, customers are likely to want to test them before buying.
Indeed, while Power predicts that many customers will be willing to
buy cars over the Internet someday, his company's research shows
that 76 percent of new car buyers had test-driven automobiles at
the dealership where they eventually bought them, down
insignificantly from 79 percent in 1996. Many other buyers
test-drive a model at one dealership before buying it at another.
</P>
<P>
   Such research heartens dealers like Lutz, the owner of Extreme
Dodge here in central Michigan, 80 miles west of Detroit. By
relying heavily on computers, he has cut his sales staff by more
than half in the last three years, lowering his costs so he can
compete more aggressively with other dealers on price.
</P>
<P>
   But he also contends that, while millions of Americans may now
be willing to buy shirts, books and toys over the Internet, they
will remain leery of buying $20,000 cars or $30,000 sport utility
vehicles that way. He and other dealers here continue to join the
boards of community groups and lend used cars free to school
athletic teams for out-of-town trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reciprocate,'' Lutz said, ``and buy cars from us.''

AFTER A HARD YEAR, LATIN AMERICA LOOKS FOR BETTER TIMES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ On the theory that things cannot get
much worse, Latin America is looking to the start of the new decade
with anticipation. The last year has been a difficult one, more
onerous even than the crisis that followed the Mexican meltdown
starting in December 1994: It began with a currency collapse in
Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with the numbers
now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's large
economies struggling to emerge from recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a really lousy year, especially for South
America,'' said Ricardo Hausmann, chief economist of the
Inter-American Development Bank, the lending agency based in
Washington. ``We have seen traumatic declines in growth rates for
all of Latin America, the result of a collapse both of
international capital flows and commodity prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the exception of oil, prices paid for the primary
products that remain the backbone of the continent's exports,
notably copper and coffee, dropped to near-record lows in 1999
before recovering slightly at the end of the year. And even with
the price of oil climbing _ from less than $7 a barrel for
Venezuelan crude in February to more than $23 currently _ the
Venezuelan and Ecuadorean economies are expected to have contracted
by more than 5 percent, a markedly worse performance than in
hard-hit countries not dependent on oil, like Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia. Consequently, Latin American governments have faced an
increased need to turn to external financing to cover yawning
current-account deficits, at the same time that direct investors
and lenders have been pulling back from the region.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Inter-American Development Bank, capital flows
into Latin America have fallen to $57 billion in 1999, slightly
more than half the record $107 billion in 1997. Most of the money
that is arriving has gone to the region's two giants: Brazil, which
expects to close the year with $25 billion in direct investment,
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the catastrophe initially foreseen during the Brazilian
crisis in January has not occurred, overall capital flows have been
for lesser amounts, more irregular, more costly and for shorter
terms,'' said Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, secretary general of the
Economic Commission for Latin America, a U.N. organization based in
Santiago, Chile, and known in Spanish as Cepal. ``The situation is
clearly not yet normalized.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been bright spots in this generally dismal picture.
During 1999, Mexico grew at about a 4 percent clip, slightly less
than 1998's rate but a standout by regional standards, and the
Dominican Republic and countries of Central America also registered
positive numbers. Not by coincidence, all those economies are more
closely linked to the United States _ through the North American
Free Trade Agreement in Mexico's case and a thriving maquila, or
assembly, sector in the others _ than their South American
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico was the star performer this year and is likely to
repeat that role next year, but it has to be considered a special
case,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, director of the Center for the
World Economy at the Getulio Vargas Foundation here, Brazil's
leading economic research center. ``They have corrected some of the
serious problems from 1995, and they have also benefited from
navigating in the wake of the incredible expansion of the American
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs are emerging that the worst may be past for South America.
Most forecasts for the coming year are predicting combined growth
of at least 3 percent, led by increased demand for Latin American
commodities and manufactured goods in Europe and East Asia.
Inflation has generally been contained, despite pressure on
exchange rates, which in the case of Brazil, Chile and Colombia
have been made more flexible, and interest rates are dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic about 2000 for Latin America, though it is
important to stress that what we are going to be seeing is a
recovery, not a full-blown expansion,'' said Walter Molano,
director of research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. ``The
fall has been broken, portfolio inflows should pick up very
strongly again next year, and we may see a real expansion begin by
2001.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, much depends on Brazil, which has endured two
consecutive years of stagnation. Just as Germany is the locomotive
for the European Union, Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the
world, is the motor for South America, especially for its neighbors
and partners in Mercosur, the customs union that includes
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia and
Chile as associate members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If market sentiment toward Latin American countries improves
and Brazil's competitiveness gains are preserved,'' a report of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded,
``strengthening exports, declining interest rates and a payoff from
structural reforms undertaken over the past year will underpin a
return to positive growth next year and provide impetus for rising
expansion in 2001.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For all that to come to fruition, though, regional commerce
needs to pick up again. After expanding markedly throughout the
first half of the decade, thanks to the emergence of Mercosur and
the Andean Pact, trade within South America dipped about 30 percent
in 1999, according to Cepal's calculations, as countries sought to
contain their imports.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, given the Clinton administration's inability to
gain sufficient support in Congress to liberalize trade and the
fact that an election year is starting in the United States, the
2005 deadline for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas
that would stretch from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego seems an
increasingly difficult objective. As a result, Latin America's
search for alternatives outside the hemisphere seems to be
accelerating, and is expected to intensify as a result of the
recent failure in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for instance, has just signed a free trade agreement
with the European Union, which has also opened similar talks with
Mercosur. ``Countries are all of a sudden realizing they need to
compete on a global, as opposed to regional, scale,'' Molano said.
``This is actually healthy because it is what they should have been
doing all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The political situation throughout the region remains
imponderable. After a decade of belt-tightening, voters are
demanding results for their sacrifices, and to express their
growing impatience and dissatisfaction have elected people like
Hugo Chavez, the former paratrooper and coup leader who is now
president of Venezuela, or voted heavily for more traditional
leftists like Tabare Vazquez of Uruguay or Ricardo Lagos of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is not an aberration'' but the harbinger of ``a
revisionist movement such as we saw earlier in Eastern Europe,''
warned Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and
Labor program at the University of Miami. ``Neoliberal reform takes
no prisoners, and a lot of these governments have failed to provide
a safety net or focus on the tax and regulatory policies necessary
to make free market development work and target allocations to
those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   The region needs more capitalism or opening of markets, he
maintains. For that reason, he and other specialists emphasize,
Latin American governments need to move ahead on the so-called
second generation structural changes that they may be tempted to
postpone in the face of political doubts: in tax rates and
collections, regulatory policies and accountability in
revenue-sharing with states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of recovery within the region is going to continue
to depend on new types of institutional reform,'' Langoni, a former
president of the Brazilian central bank, said. Indeed, he argues,
one reason Brazil has proved so resilient in bouncing back from
January's 40 percent currency devaluation, compared to the past, is
that ``the opening of the economy, with the lowering of tariff
rates and the elimination of indexation measures, has helped
greatly in absorbing the impact of these exchange-rate crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to a larger extent than in advanced industrial regions,
Latin America may not be fully the master of its own fate. As the
fallout from crises in East Asia and Eastern Europe in recent years
has shown, all that would be needed to erase many of the gains
expected in 2000 is the appearance of new problems in, say,
Indonesia and renewed skittishness among investors.

   &UR; WHY SANTAS ARE STRIKING OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than four holiday Santas have been relieved of their
duties at a downtown San Francisco mall, spies tell Personals. One
Santa was late, one was drunk, one was stealing and one was mean.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, here's a mistletoe tip from the Stanford University
Medical Center: ``New Analysis Reveals Human Mouth Carries More
Germs Than Expected.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the center's press release, researchers using old
and new methods to scrape plaque from a mouth ``found evidence of
37 unique bacteria that microbiologists had never before recorded.
Some were closely related to bacteria that scientists are familiar
with, but others were very different.'' So, it's not only ``more
germs,'' it's yuckier germs.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Seasonal offering on the menu of a Powell Street coffee
shop: egg nog latte. Meanwhile, the alchemist  &UR; Mr. Mystic  &LR; is
trying to turn merriment into money by selling Mr. Mystic Y2K
Edible Confetti (``If chaos breaks out, keep it as a food
supply''), which looks something like Trix breakfast cereal. More
information at mrmystic.com, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And if you act now, you can ``Eat Your Way Through Y2K'' with
Golden West's newly published recipes for the millennium, which
utilize stored food. Mass Hysteria Macaroni and Tuna Salad, for
example, includes Thousand Island dressing, a can of diced mixed
vegetables, dried onion and cooked macaroni shells. (Oh, and  &UR; Ann
Byington  &LR; learned at a class at Ramekins in Sonoma that a heating
pad can be used to maintain the temperature of melted chocolate.)
</P>

   &UR;  &LR; - &UR; Tom Sweeney &LR; , doorman at the Sir Francis Drake, was stuck in
an elevator in a downtown Monterey hotel when an operator
instructed the passengers that help was on the way, ``and whatever
you do, don't go anywhere.''

   - Transportation gazette: &UR; David Greenlee &LR;  says the Sporty's
Pilot Shop catalog is selling tiny pin-on wings that identify
wearers as members of the Mile High Club. And BART says the recent
reader sighting of cars on a rig in Iowa must have been mistaken;
on the other hand, says spokesman  &UR; Mike Healy &LR; , the cars could have
been there on ``the tail track for the BART-Reno extension.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Another in a series of occasional peeks backstage at the
Personals plant. A letter from a kindly source:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I wrote you about the young man who called over the
loudspeaker, `Where are the cards for the Jews?' Well, first of
all, it wasn't Nordstrom; it was Toys R Us. Secondly, it wasn't
Walnut Creek, it was Concord. Also, aside (from) the fact that I
misspelled Nordstrom, everything else is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. A recent correction in the Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle: ``A
photo accompanying an `in the spotlight' item in Monday's editions
of the Augusta Chronicle incorrectly identified  &UR; Sean &LR; 
 &UR; Connery  &LR; as  &UR; Dennis Rodman &LR; . The Chronicle regrets the error.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. And here's a journalist's trick: TV reporters who go on
movie junkets, where they each get five minutes to interview a
star, resort to writing their names on the bottom of their shoes
and then crossing their legs during the interview. This allows the
star to say such profound things as, ``I'm glad you asked me that,
Bob.'' According to the New York Post, though, that fun-loving  &UR; Mel
Gibson  &LR; `delights in calling the interviewer anything but what is
written on the shoe leather.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have bought into the romantic Jeremy Irons-Kenneth
Branagh England. It's phony. It's fake. Merchant-Ivory? Bollocks.
Notting Hill, all those mannerisms and flawless turns of phrase,
people don't really talk like that in England. ... British films
are manufacturing fairy tales and Americans are going for it like
they are buying picture postcards.''

are manufacturing fairy tales and Americans are going for it like
they are buying picture postcards.''

HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS CAN EXPECT CHANGE, AND A SHOCK OR TWO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans who have complaints about the health care system may
soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many health care professionals
expect the medical system in the United States to be overhauled so
remarkably during the next two decades that many patients will not
be able to recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   While such a notion may excite some consumers _ who hasn't
fantasized about the death of health maintenance organizations? _
others will no doubt be riled by new procedures that actually
provide less medical care and coverage than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that is sure to happen is a lot of change across
the whole health care industry,'' said Dr. David B. Skinner, the
chief executive of New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``A better
quality system has started, but it is going to take several decades
to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should brace themselves for a few shocks. Many patient
advocates and Democratic representatives in Congress would like a
government-sponsored health care system, similar to many of those
in Europe. But some health providers _ notably the pharmaceutical
companies _ snarl at the mention of more government involvement,
given the likelihood of a federally mandated reduction in drug
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance of last resort is the government,'' said Joseph
Zammit-Lucia, the chief executive of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy
in New York, which advises drug companies. ``But you never know
what insurance you may be able to buy in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if health care in the United States remains in private
hands, change will be dramatic. One of the biggest changes during
the next 10 to 20 years is expected to be the increasing role of
the patient in choosing his or her treatment. Instead of relying
only on their doctors' advice, consumers will also use medical
information from the Internet and prescription-drug ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, health care is professional-driven,'' Zammit-Lucia
said. ``But with the Internet and consumer ad campaigns, I will
know about as much about my illness as the doctor does. I'll use
him as a professional adviser, similar to how I use a financial
planner now.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients will also get their medications in new ways. Health
experts are confident that drugs will routinely be bought through
the Internet, including treatments for serious conditions.
Pharmacists, long the prime instructors of how medications should
be taken, will dole out more advice in cyberspace, especially as
consumers become brand loyal to their health care Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Medications are also likely to change. Scientists predict that
hospital-bound treatments like chemotherapy may eventually be
administered as pills that can be taken at home. Patients will also
have more choices about how they take their medications, such as
through injection, patch, nasal spray or inhaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's realistic to believe that cancer will become a chronic
illness,'' said Dr. Scot Remick, head of clinical trials at the
University Hospitals of Cleveland. ``We're not curing all cancers
yet, but patients will be able to live longer with a good quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly enormous amount of medical knowledge will also
change patients' visits to their doctors. Using models of a
person's gene structure, scientists will soon be able to tell which
infants can be expected to develop certain illnesses _ including
some cancers and diabetes _ and what medicines have little risk of
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that breakthroughs in genomic technology will allow
consumers to know what diseases they are likely to get and what
measures to take to prevent them. Yet patient advocates worry that
the insurers may use genomic information to deny or limit coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a brave new world, it is frighteningly realistic to imagine
an insurance industry that knows more than it should about the
lifestyle and family history of every American,'' said Diane
Archer, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer
advocacy group in New York. ``Through health profiling, an insurer
can refuse affordable coverage to everyone with a perceived health
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles M. Cutler, chief medical officer of the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade group representing managed
care companies, said that insurers would use genetic information
not to deny coverage but to provide better care. He noted that some
illnesses can be diagnosed now during pregnancy, but insurers have
still provided coverage to these infants.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the last of a consumer's worries. During the next
20 years, Americans will have to deal with increasingly large and
powerful health care organizations. Almost all of them will demand
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation that has swept the drug industry _ with Pfizer
and American Home Products battling now to acquire Warner-Lambert,
and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals of Britain buying the Swedish drug giant
Astra last year _ will continue until there are a handful of
companies, each with 10 percent of the global market, double their
current share. Only five companies currently have more than a 4
percent share of the worldwide pharmaceutical market, according to
IMS Health, an industry consultant. Cambridge Pharma forecasts
that, as a result of more costly technology, drug prices will
increase to 30 percent of medical expenditures in the United States
during the next 20 years from 10 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are going to have to pay for routine drugs out of
their own pockets'' as insurers scramble to control costs,
predicted Zammit-Lucia, citing generic painkillers as an example.
``What will happen is that insurance will only pay for what is not
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, HMOs will not live long into the next century,
but many health care experts are not sure what type of insurance
will take their place. Everyone agrees that traditional indemnity
plans are history, even though consumers are demanding an
unrestricted choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with managed care is that it became so intrusive
in the relationship between patient and doctor,'' said Dr. Thomas
R. Reardon, president of the American Medical Association. ``The
HMOs were spending more money than they were saving. We have to
find a method to provide appropriate care. But that may not mean
all the care the patient wants.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing on which health care experts agree is that the
insurers of the next two decades will be substantially larger than
any of the entities that have preceded them. Several doctors
predicted that HMOs would eventually be replaced by large hospital
systems, with local clinics and hospices, that contract with
employers to provide medical insurance and treatment.

 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after the Wright Brothers ushered in the era of
powered flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903, Harold Donaldson
Eberlein, a prolific Philadelphia writer and futurist, published
predictions of the impact of air travel on American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in American Homes and Gardens magazine in September
1912, Eberlein foresaw a proliferation of roof gardens atop large
hotels to provide a pleasing view from on high. (``What a pleasant
place over which to aviate must Babylon have been with its hanging
gardens!'' he wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   And since the hotel roof was destined to become as important as
the ground floor, he added, travelers could expect to find ``clerks
and bellboys posted on the top floor ready to attend to the
immediate wants of tourists who have just arrived by aeroplane.''
Aerial taxicabs ``will circle like vultures over the hotel,'' he
added, ``waiting for a doorman to signal one of them to alight and
pick up a departing guest.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberlein's failure to prove as prescient as Jules Verne does not
necessarily mean that the aerial garages and aerial taxis he
envisioned were off the wall. But it does underscore the warning by
John W. Reps, professor emeritus in the department of city and
regional planning at Cornell University, that the Eberlein article
``suggests the difficulty of predicting the impact of technological
innovations.'' (Reps put the article on the Internet, along with
two introductory paragraphs that included this warning.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet a number of technological and hotel companies are wrestling
with designing the hotel of the future and so far, at least, do not
seem to be straying very far afield. In fact, even in the era of
the Internet, which seemingly came from nowhere and has expanded
with the speed of light, most of the hotel innovations proposed for
the future are still largely incremental. The only eyebrow-raising
proposal _ that Hilton Hotels Corp. was planning to build a luxury
resort somewhere in space _ came in a September wire-service report
that was picked up widely in the press and on radio and television,
but it was quickly, forcefully denied.
</P>
<P>
   At the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant
Management at the University of Houston, faculty members and
students are less preoccupied with space hotels than with adequate
space and other comforts in the hotel of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two biggest concerns we're looking into improving are
guest security and comfort through technology,'' said Alan Stutts,
dean of the hotel and restaurant management college. ``We've
determined that if you can create an environment that's comfortable
and efficient, you can lengthen guests' stay by a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving those goals primarily means eliminating or reducing
sleep distractions and stress, each of which is being studied in a
living lab _ the campus' 86-room University Hilton Hotel. Among
possible changes under review are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alarm clocks that awaken guests by increasing the amount of
light in the room, rather than by a buzzer, bell or radio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Room-entry technology that replaces room keys or cards by
reading thumbprints or fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beds with air mattresses that can be adjusted by a hand-held
compressor, or beds with springs that can be easily adjusted for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treadmills and other exercise equipment in the privacy of
one's room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduction of irritating room noise by using the sound of
water, for which volume and tone can be adjusted to anything from a
trickle to a torrent.
</P>
<P>
   _ And, for guests in a windowless, or viewless, room of the
future, the option of choosing an ocean or mountain or other
``window'' view generated by a computer. ``You could create any
window you wDean Stutts said, ``including a winter landscape
or a rain forest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A worldwide survey for Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts, a
unit of  &UR; Bass &LR;  PLC, released last year did not turn up demands for
anything futuristic, only for more high-technology features in
rooms, hotels in safe neighborhoods, enhanced safety and security
features in hotels, more nonsmoking rooms and a wider choice of
in-hotel restaurants serving more healthful food.
</P>
<P>
   None of those should be hard to deliver, since each already
exists to some degree, although not all in the same hotel rooms and
not always in the United States. Dozens of upscale hotels
throughout the Asia Pacific Rim, for instance, are equipped with
many high-tech features, including systems that allow guests to
watch television and surf the Internet on the television
simultaneously, and to hook their laptops to high-speed direct
Internet access in their rooms without the need for a local
Internet service provider. So it is only a question of time until
those features are available in United States hotels _ especially
when many of the Asia Pacific Rim hotels, including Sheraton on the
Park, Sydney, as well as Inter-Continentals in Singapore, Taipei,
Taiwan, and Tokyo are allied with U.S. hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months guests at many Choice Hotels have been able to
leave their laptops at home and still have access to the Internet,
e-mail, entertainment and the latest financial news.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not modular building designs are the future of hotel
construction, Holiday Inn Express has been experimenting with
modular designs that fit various sites and allow walls to be moved
within the building, depending on size and shape of the land.
</P>
<P>
   As for hotels in space, the September story may have been
premature for Hilton, but the topic has not gone unaddressed. The
World Tourism Organization, whose membership includes 138 nations
and territories, predicted in 1998 that low-orbit space trips might
be only a few years away and that space vacations would be
commonplace by 2020. If so, tomorrow's space vacationers presumably
will be no more inclined to spend their entire vacation in a space
vehicle than today's vacationers are willing to spend theirs
cramped up in a circling airplane, and so hotels will need to be
part of the big plan.

 &HT;    MODERATES GAIN IN RUSSIAN VOTE
 &HT;    Editors: Please update actual results when available as
warranted
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW Voting across 11 time zones, Russians gave pro-reform
parties unexpectedly strong support in parliamentary elections
Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Moderate political forces appeared to garner roughly half votes,
marking a victory for the Kremlin and its widely popular Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed Unity party, forged by the Kremlin only three
months ago and stocked with young, fresh-faced candidates, will
finish a strong second behind the Communists, the country's biggest
party, exit polls and early results showed.
</P>
<P>
   The race, widely viewed as a dress rehearsal for next year's
presidential campaign to replace Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
offered good news for Putin, 47, who has emerged as the uncontested
frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Communists proved they remain the tenacious
opponents to reform by registering a higher proportion of vote than
the party earned in the last parliamentary balloting in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At stake were all the seats in the 450-member Duma, the lower
house of parliament. The late fall elections were eclipsed by the
internally popular war against rebellious Chechnya and tainted by a
bitter, mudslinging campaign that pitted Kremlin loyalists against
their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Polls for the the NTV television network showed the
Communists still the largest party with 28 percent. But four
moderate and liberal parties between them claimed 54 percent of the
vote. Unity was running in second place with 24 percent of the
vote. An allied pro-reform party, the Union of Right Forces, ran
surprisingly strong with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With 7 percent of the actual vote counted, Unity led with 28.6
percent, followed by the Communist Party with 24.9 percent, about
the same as their 22.3 finish in 1995. Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
ultra-nationalist bloc had 8.2 percent. The Union of Right Forces
garnered 7.2 percent, followed by the centrist Fatherland-All
Russia with 6.5 percent and the social democrats of Yabloko with
5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 26 parties and some 2,300 candidates competed in the
Duma election. Half of the seats will be filled by the vote for
party lists, with groups getting more than 5 percent of votes
winning places. The other half will be filled through individual
races in electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
   Final results from the balloting are not expected until late
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the results reflected increased sophistication
among voters, who distinguished between pro-reform political
parties and the unpopular Yeltsin, whose second term as president
expires next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The results also reflect an apparent desire among Russians to
see a continuation of democratic and economic reforms despite the
painful decade of transition since the Soviet Union was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told the people: 'We are young guys, that we ourselves
committed a lot of mistakes. But we can and we want to pull the
country up from the dirt,''' Yevgenia Albaats, an independent
journalist and political analyst, said of the strong results for
the Union of Right Forces. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
and former Yeltsin advisor and reformer Boris Nemtsov founded the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Another new party, Fatherland-All Russia, appeared to be running
weaker than expected, with about 11 percent of the vote, according
to exit polling.
</P>
<P>
   The successful centrist bloc is led by former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, both prominent
opponents of the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
   Before Putin appeared on the political scene, Primakov, 70, was
the leading contender to replace Yeltsin, according to polls.
Luzhkov, also believed to have presidential aspirations, won
reelection Sunday as Moscow mayor with 70 percent of the vote, but
he consistently polls badly in nationwide surveys of potential
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB spy and Russia's security chief, was
handpicked from obscurity in August by Yeltsin to become prime
minister. Yeltsin also named Putin as his leading candidate to
succeed him as president. Putin has since soared in surveys,
leading the popular war against Islamic guerillas in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has become the most popular Russian politician since
Yeltsin's early zenith as the pro-democracy leader as the Soviet
Union collapsed in 1991. Yeltsin's approval ratings plummeted years
ago as reforms stalled and the country's economy collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin is not a member of Unity and his name was not on the
ballot Sunday, he endorsed the new party, which clearly benefited
from his allure. In the closing week of the campaign, Putin also
made positive comments about the Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of old governments consisting of morons only
capable of reading from notes and relying on aides,'' said
Alexander Dezegilenko, 38, a marketing specialist from Moscow who
supports Putin and who voted for the Union of Right Forces. ``We
need new faces, more democratic minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communist Party was expected to retain the largest bloc
of seats in the Duma; currently they hold 157 seats. By aligning
themselves with nationalists and others, the Communists have been
able to thwart Kremlin-backed market reforms before parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are virtually the only nationally organized party
in Russia's young democracy, having inherited the party structure
from the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   How the moderate and reform parties in the new Duma might align
themselves is uncertain. While they share common policy interests,
they also may have competing candidates vying for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia needs the kind of Duma which will get down to business,
make laws rather than politicize,'' said Yeltsin, 68, after he cast
his vote at a Moscow polling station.
</P>
<P>
   By escalating the conflict in Chechnya, Putin and the Kremlin
altered the character of the campaign, overshadowing their rivals'
criticism of Russia corruption-riddled system with the themes of
war and restoring national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was the tough-talking leader directing the military
campaign, while Unity Party leader Sergei Shoigu, who is Minister
for Emergency Situations, was dispatched with Chechnya to oversee
handle the refugee crisis caused by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they have dominated news coverage in recent weeks
and muted criticism of the government. Meanwhile, media outlets
owned by tycoons who support the Kremlin gave favorable coverage to
Putin and Unity, while attacking Primakov and Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only two parties - the party of traitors and the
party of patriots. Nothing else mattered,'' complained Valery
Siakin, a former Moscow mayor during the 1980s and a candidate for
Duma for the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout exceeded 57 percent among the more than 100 million
registered voters, a fairly good showing in a country where many
people are disenchanted with post-Soviet democratic reforms and
widespread official corruption.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After weathering a year of debt defaults, a currency
crash, an absentee president and governments that change with the
seasons, Russians have one piece of good news: The economy has not
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the August 1998 crash of the stock market
and the ruble, and the appointment of a government heavy with
ardent Communists, many analysts feared a return to fixed prices,
shortages of consumer goods and a ceaseless printing of rubles that
would have once more ignited hyperinflation. ``It was all lined up
for catastrophe, and it just didn't happen,'' said James Fenkner,
equities strategist for the Moscow brokerage firm Troika Dialog.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the three different prime ministers and their
respective cabinets this year have held to the tight monetary
policy of their predecessors and so have kept inflation under
control and the currency relatively stable. But the governments
that rotated through Moscow have also continued a tradition of
inaction, more unwilling than unable to overhaul onerous tax and
customs systems or to rein in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Investors express some hope that next June's presidential
elections may bring gradual improvement. But few are confident
enough to invest here. ``People hope things will happen'' after the
elections, said Stephen O'Sullivan, co-director of research at the
United Financial Group. ``But if in the past Russia's problems
weren't appreciated, now it's only the problems that are
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been periodic rallies, the Russian stock
market has failed to attract serious interest this year. Daily
volumes were less than $1 million at the start of the year, but
since the spring they have climbed to $15 million to $20 million,
largely on the strength of rising oil prices. That is still,
however, a fraction of the market volume before the August 1998
crash. And while the country's RTS stock index had more than
doubled by July, to 148.14, from the start of the year, it has
since slipped more than 30 points from that level and is far below
its October 1997 peak of 571.66.
</P>
<P>
   While still low compared with other emerging markets, foreign
direct investment picked up in 1999. Economists estimate that
Russia could attract $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year, up from
$2.2 billion last year. Several big foreign companies have gone
ahead with sizable projects here. Caterpillar, Gillette, Philip
Morris and BMW, for example, have built new factories.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision to expand rather than leave is driven in large
part by Russia's currency devaluation. When the ruble's value
plunged against the dollar after the August 1998 crisis,
dollar-denominated imports became too expensive for most Russians.
Some foreign companies concluded that the best way to thrive in
Russia was to begin manufacturing here. The devaluation revived
Russian factories, too, from macaroni plants to car parts makers,
as they rushed to fill the gap left by the dearth of imports.
Domestic production is estimated to be up 10.5 percent in 1999 over
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be hard to rekindle the optimism investors had
for Russia through most of the decade. This year, they have come to
understand how far the government and Russian business are from the
notions of fair play and rule of law needed for an attractive,
prosperous market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions about the investment climate in Russia have no
meaning,'' Vadim Arsenyev, a columnist, wrote recently in the
business daily Kommersant. ``The investment climate in Russia isn't
good or bad because there isn't one. That's because we're still
very far from democracy, a market and respect for shareholder
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, for example, defaulted on $40 billion of
domestic debt last year and is essentially in default now on most
of its foreign debt, except for eurobonds. The government has asked
the London Club of commercial creditors to write off 40 percent of
the more than $30 billion it owes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's largest banks have gone bankrupt, defaulting on
loans to Western creditors and confiscating the deposits of their
domestic clients. ``Russians clearly can't handle debt,'' Fenkner
said. ``The attitude here is, `Take the money and run.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have been alarmed by a series of bankruptcy
and corporate governance disputes and the government's apparent
inability to resolve them. BP Amoco has essentially lost its
half-billion-dollar investment in the oil concern Sidanko, whose
assets have been peeled away in bankruptcy procedures that many
analysts suggest were rigged to help a rival Russian oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The country's second-biggest oil company, Yukos, has proceeded
with share swaps that vastly dilute the value of shares in its
subsidiaries. A court in St. Petersburg repealed the privatization
of the Lomonosov porcelain factory on a technicality, thereby
annulling the 51 percent stake held in it by executives of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. and the U.S.-Russian Investment Fund.
Together, those developments led to the resignation of Dmitri V.
Vasiliev, chairman of the Federal Securities Commission, who was
regarded by foreigners as the lone government official backing
protection of shareholders' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal this sends is that foreign investment isn't safe in
Russia,'' O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal has further tarred Russia's already questionable
reputation. In the spring, it was disclosed that Russia's Central
Bank invested money through murky offshore companies with close
ties to Russian business and as such, hid reserves from the
International Monetary Fund. Then in August, the United States said
it was investigating possible Russian money laundering through the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the parliamentary elections held Sunday and the June
presidential vote have kindled some optimism among investors. ``You
see now the rise of a centrist political class that will do well in
the parliamentary race and win presidential elections,'' said Jeff
Costello, a director at the investment bank Brunswick Warburg.
``That's good because it means that the legislature and the
president, both broadly pro-market, will be able to work together,
as opposed to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect some money to flow in soon after the
presidential vote, but unlike in 1996, vast sums are not expected.
Moreover, many investors will look for signs of progress on such
issues as tax reform and corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euphoria's not there,'' Fenkner said. ``The question is
what type of market and democracy will Russia have, and that's much
harder to see.''

RISE OF INTERNET CHANGES ROLE OF PERSONAL COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999 it became fashionable to predict the end of the PC era.
</P>
<P>
   At the vast Comdex personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in
November, the buzz seemed to be about everything but the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There was hype about Web pads _ handy, wireless slates for
surfing the Web, in effect portable computers with screen but
without keyboard. And there was more hype about devices other than
computers that provide Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is high priest of
the PC, took time out from his presentation to showcase what he
called a Web companion, a computer that eschews the Windows
operating system in gaining access to the Web. It looks much like
the ``network appliance'' that Gates once reviled when it was first
proposed by his company's rivals, Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The most hoopla of all surrounded a coming generation of
cellular phones that are part phone and part computer and will
allow mobile users to surf the Web and do everything from shopping
to making restaurant reservations from wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the PCs on display, whose makers seemed focused
on repackaging their machines in different-colored boxes, appeared
drab and uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   It has begun to seem that like the mainframe computer, the
venerable PC may be on the verge of being supplanted _ by more
powerful technologies promising quick and easy access to the
Internet through devices that are highly portable, less costly and
readily adopted by non-PC users.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hot Silicon Valley companies like Phone.com, the
telephone Web browser company based in Redwood City, Calif., are
reporting gleefully that beginning next year, almost half the
cellular phones sold will come equipped with the ability to surf
the Web. Moreover, they predict that at the current growth rate,
the number of Web browsers in phones will exceed the number in PCs
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that personal mobile communication is going
to happen,'' said Greg Galanos, a software strategist at Motorola.
``The fact that you're chained to the desk to do electronic mail
makes no sense at all today.''
</P>
<P>
   If using the Internet rather than spreadsheets and word
processors is driving the growth of the personal computer industry,
then mobile access to the Internet is likely to dominate in short
order. Who could possibly argue that surfing the Web while trapped
sitting in a chair at a desk is natural or inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   The one flaw in this argument is that PC sales are not
shrinking. PC industry growth has been in double-digit figures for
six years, and it is expected to strengthen this year to 20.6
percent, near the 21.3 percent increase posted for 1994-95,
according to Dataquest, the market research firm based in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote address this year at Comdex, Gates boasted that
industry analysts have underestimated industry growth for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year after year, people look at the personal computer and
think: `Wow! It must have reached its peak,''' he said. ``There
hasn't been a year that analysts haven't said: `Well, this is
really it. Boy, the growth has been so fantastic over the last
year. This has got to be where it cuts off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' view is shared by Steven Jobs, a rival who became a
nominal ally after Microsoft invested in Apple Computer in 1997.
Jobs has argued forcefully in the last two years that there is no
reason to assume that innovation _ and thus growth _ is dead in the
PC world.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point, Apple's new iBook portable personal
computer became the top-selling portable in November. The machine
has a built-in antenna and permits a user to easily insert a card,
costing about $100, to provide high-speed wireless connections.
</P>
<P>
   Continued growth is a strong argument in favor of the PC, but
the same argument was made by defenders of the mainframe computer
in the late 1980s, shortly before that industry began its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with defending the PC in this debate is that the
rise of the Internet has changed the role of the PC. Rather than an
end in itself, the PC is now merely one of a variety of Internet
entry points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of the Internet has shifted the focus of the
industry from `personal computing' to the Internet and
e-business,'' said Irving Wladasky-Berger, general manager of IBM
Corp.'s Internet division. ``The glamour is all in the Internet and
e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the attack on the PC industry may soon be joined on
the videogame front. In an editorial last month titled ``A Billion
Connected PCs? Guess Again,'' the editors of Microprocessor Report,
an influential semiconductor industry newsletter, took issue with
Intel Corp.'s view that PCs will continue to dominate ``personal
computing'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that two big Japanese consumer electronics
companies, Sony and Nintendo, have both placed billion-dollar-plus
bets on semiconductor factories to build a new generation of chips
that may be more powerful than the fastest Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is readying its PlayStation 2, while Nintendo is developing
a new system, code-named Dolphin. Using the new chips, both of
these machines will probably be part videogame player, part
Internet appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which would you rather have in your living room: a Windows 98
PC or a Sony PlayStation 2?'' the Microprocessor Report editorial
asks. ``For most people, the PlayStation 2 is a better choice.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, computers are almost certain to become like
electric motors. Once upon a time, it was envisioned that one
electric motor, equipped with pulleys and cables, would run
appliances all through the house. Instead, there are now electric
motors in every appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With computing, ``I think it's more of a morphing,'' Galanos of
Motorola said. ``The fine line between the PC industry and the
consumer electronics industry will increasingly vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is ending, the PC era has been a remarkable two decades.
From its roots in a hobbyist subculture populated by a handful of
long-haired engineers who hungered for their own machines, the
personal computer exploded to create powerful industrial
monopolies. But Moore's Law _ that the number of transistors on a
microchip will double every year and a half _ ensures that no
computing era will last forever, not even that of the PC.

OF CROOKS AND CONS, SCANDALS AND SCHEMES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, a Swedish sociologist named Malin Akerstrom,
in her book ``Crooks and Squares,'' examined the remarkable
similarities between the personality traits of career criminals and
those of successful entrepreneurs. Her findings prompted another
prominent scholar to reflect that such criminals ``have learned the
lessons of capitalism too well.''
</P>
<P>
   The past century is certainly rich in scandals that bear out
that conclusion. Indeed, some of the century's greatest scoundrels
_ Charles Ponzi, Ivar Krueger, Robert Vesco _ were originally
assumed by their victims to be brilliant capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the century's scandals led to social reforms, while
others simply revealed new fault lines in the economic landscape.
Some involved colorful characters worthy of a story by Damon Runyon
or Tom Wolfe, and others were dull, faceless tales of stupidly bad
behavior. But taken together, they offer the dot-com generation a
timely reminder of what can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some of the most significant scandals of the
century:
</P>
<P>
   A Smell From the Jungle
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare novelist who can claim to have almost
single-handedly altered business history. One writer with a valid
claim to that distinction is Upton Sinclair, who based his 1906
novel ``The Jungle'' on his investigations into unsanitary
conditions in the meat-packing industry. The disgusting disclosures
prodded Congress to adopt laws requiring federal inspection of
meat-packing houses, and led _ despite intense business opposition
_ to a broader government role in ensuring the safety of consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The Original Ponzi Scheme
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, a dapper Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi
established the Old Colony Foreign Exchange Company, with offices
in Boston and New York. He promised investors a suspiciously high
return, 50 percent or more, on foreign postal coupons, which he
claimed could be purchased abroad at a discount and resold in
America at a premium. Prosecutors soon found he simply used the
money taken in from latecomers to pay the promised dividends to
earlier investors. For decades, con artists had called this
technique the ``Peter-to-Paul'' swindle; from Ponzi's time on, it
would be known as a ``Ponzi scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish Match King
</P>
<P>
   Some of the smartest investment bankers in America were taken in
by the elegant Ivar Krueger, a Swedish entrepreneur whose supposed
wealth was fed by a monopoly on the kitchen-match business in
various European countries. In fact, he was running an elaborate
fraud involving dubious accounting and forged assets. Facing
exposure at last, Krueger shot himself in his Paris apartment in
March 1932, and his empire collapsed on his creditors and
investors. It was one of the first great international swindles of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   How the Mighty Fall
</P>
<P>
   Few business leaders commanded more respect in 1930 than Richard
Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange and brother of a
partner in the House of Morgan. By 1935, he embodied Wall Street's
implacable resistance to the New Deal's market regulations. But in
March 1938, he pleaded guilty to charges that he had stolen money,
both from his own customers and from a stock exchange fund set up
to benefit the widows and orphans of members. As he served his time
in a federal prison in Ossining, N.Y., Wall Street's resistance to
the reform efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission began
to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   A Big Price-Fixing Scandal
</P>
<P>
   In early 1960, a dozen manufacturers, including General Electric
and Westinghouse, were indicted on federal charges that they had
conspired for years to fix prices and rig government bidding for
several types of electrical equipment. The elaborate conspiracy,
which one writer said lacked only sinister music to qualify as a
full-fledged spy movie, cost the government and other industrial
customers millions of dollars. The charges and subsequent guilty
pleas shocked American consumers and led the courts to impose some
of the stiffest antitrust penalties that American business had
faced up until that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornfeld Connection
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, a gifted American salesman named Bernie
Cornfeld built a foreign mutual fund empire known as Investors
Overseas Services, based outside Geneva and held together by
dubious sales practices throughout the world and the questionable
use of fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   When IOS began to falter in 1970, its board dismissed Cornfeld
and brought in an entrepreneur, Robert Vesco, perhaps the only man
who could make Cornfeld seem sober and prudent. Accused by
prosecutors of completing the looting of the company, Vesco fled in
1972 to various Caribbean havens, but was later jailed in Cuba on
unrelated fraud charges. Although the crimes occurred abroad, the
twin scandals smudged the reputation of the American mutual fund
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Programmed for Crime
</P>
<P>
   The computer was already starting to reshape American business
in the second half of the century; with the Equity Funding scandal,
it began to reshape American swindles. This once high-flying mutual
fund and insurance conglomerate used phony computer records to make
it appear that business was booming. In fact, the company was a
fraud that collapsed in April 1973 after a controversial analyst
named Raymond L. Dirks learned of the scheme and alerted his
clients to it. Regulators accused Dirks of trading on inside
information, but the U.S. Supreme Court exonerated him on the
ground that he had not been seeking personal profit.
</P>
<P>
   A Bust in the Oil Patch
</P>
<P>
   After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, few Americans could imagine
that energy prices would ever tumble. So nobody raised an eyebrow
when, in early 1976, some new high-living managers began to
transform the tiny suburban Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City into
an aggressive oil and gas lender. Behind a boom-town facade, they
routinely made new inflated loans to bail out earlier inflated
loans _ a Ponzi-like shuffle that ended with the bank's collapse in
July 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Two major banks, the Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Company and Seattle First National Bank, had purchased some
of the bank's dubious loans and were nearly destroyed as a result.
Penn Square depositors whose accounts exceeded federal insurance
limits lost millions, shaking public confidence in federal banking
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `The Greed Decade' on Trial
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, they still call it ``Boesky Day'' _ Nov. 14,
1986, when federal prosecutors disclosed that Ivan F. Boesky, a
trader who had speculated handsomely on the takeover deals of the
decade, would plead guilty to insider-trading violations and
testify about the misdeeds of others. The most famous defendant he
named was Michael R. Milken, whose transformation of the brokerage
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert into a bottomless war chest for
corporate raiders had ignited a national debate over junk bonds and
hostile takeovers. In 1990, with Drexel itself in bankruptcy,
Milken pleaded guilty to a handful of securities law violations,
for which he served two years in prison and paid a record fine of
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall of Lincoln Savings
</P>
<P>
   It cost American taxpayers $3.4 billion to bail out Lincoln
Savings and Loan in 1989. Lincoln, which was run by Charles H.
Keating Jr., was one of hundreds of savings institutions to fail in
the late 1980s as misguided federal legislation, inadequate
regulatory supervision and old-fashioned fraud and greed combined
to undermine an entire industry. Keating, who came to symbolize
what Americans ruefully called the ``S.&AMP;L. crisis,'' pleaded guilty
in April _ after years of legal wrangling _ to four counts of fraud
in connection with Lincoln's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Down Barings
</P>
<P>
   It seemed impossible that one young corrupt trader, Nicholas W.
Leeson, could single-handedly destroy Barings Bank, the oldest
investment bank in Britain. But in 1995 that is what happened.
While working for the bank as an options trader in Singapore,
Leeson embarked on a secret trading spree that left the bank facing
fatal losses of roughly $1.3 billion. Leeson spent more than three
years in a Singapore prison before being released in July, at age
32, suffering from colon cancer. His crime awakened older bankers
and regulators to the risks posed by the esoteric financial
products that were traded by their young computer-savvy employees _
but that knowledge came too late to save the 233-year-old British
bank, which was taken over by a Dutch financial group.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq Censure
</P>
<P>
   It began quietly, with an academic study in 1994 that questioned
why traders on the Nasdaq market always seemed to sell every share
of stock for at least 25 cents more than they had paid for it. Why
not 12.5 cents? Guided by the study, class-action lawyers promptly
sued the nation's top brokerage firms, accusing them of illegally
conspiring to fix the prices of Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits produced a historic $1 billion settlement and led
regulators to censure Nasdaq's parent, the National Association of
Securities Dealers, in 1996 for inadequately regulating the
marketplace. As a result, Nasdaq prices became fairer and more
visible to public investors _ but Nasdaq itself is still scrambling
to adjust to the leaner profits and tougher competition that
followed.

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the decade of the '90s was the greatest ever for stock
prices, it was one of the poorer for commodity prices. But as the
decade ends, there are signs of life in commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities is
on its way to showing a gain of around 7 percent for 1999. That may
sound less than impressive to investors used to significantly
heftier increases in the stock market _ and it will still mean the
index ends the decade below where it began _ but it would be the
first positive year for the futures index since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The rise reflects expectations that world economic growth will
pick up next year as Asia and Latin America rebound from the global
financial crisis that began in July 1997, Japan bounces back from a
decade in the doldrums, and Europe's pause ends. Already, in
addition to crude oil and gasoline, the year's big gainers include
pork bellies, lumber, copper, cattle and platinum. Among the losers
are cocoa, soybeans, wheat, cotton and gold.
</P>
<P>
   But since much of the 1999 rally was powered by rising crude oil
prices after major oil exporting nations cut their production, some
analysts expect the upward pressure on commodity prices to slow or
give out next year, even as world economies grow. If oil prices
rise again, the increase will be much less than this year, analysts
argue. And some expect oil prices to be lower than they are now by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commodity prices, in general, do not appear to be rising,''
William E. Byers, the director of futures research at Bear, Stearns
&AMP; Co., noted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the decline in commodity prices led by oil,
helped keep consumer prices in check. But this year the surge in
oil was largely responsible for pushing the Consumer Price Index up
2.6 percent in the 12 months through November. In 2000, however,
any effect is expected to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if oil prices finish next year at $30 a barrel, a 20
percent increase, that would be far below the 121.9 increase so far
in 1999, to $26.74 a barrel. And if the relationship between oil
price increases and retail gasoline price rises remains constant,
that would mean pump prices would rise about 6 percent next year
compared with the 1999 jump of 36.1 percent. The resulting impact
on the Consumer Price Index would be much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, modestly rising commodity prices would not be
expected to have a significant impact on Federal Reserve policy,
particularly if the increase is largely attributable to oil. Wages,
compensation and the unemployment rate will have much more
influence as the central bank makes interest rate decisions. This
is because Federal Reserve policy makers can be expected to focus
on the core consumer inflation rate, which excludes food and
energy.
</P>
<P>
   A convenient way to look at the future for commodities is to
divide them into three groups: crude oil, industrial commodities
that are critical to production and construction, and agricultural
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil is the key. It has been the main contributor to the
rise in major commodity indexes this year as the price of a barrel
has jumped from $12.05 to a peak of $27.07 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many analysts had suggested that the surge was
ending, with some experts predicting that the price would fall by
the end of next year to about $20 a barrel. If that were the case,
then there would be downward pressure on broad commodity indexes at
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But now some analysts, including Michael Rothman, senior energy
analyst at Merrill Lynch, expect crude oil prices to move closer to
$30 a barrel this winter. They cite declining crude oil
inventories; the apparent willingness of major oil-exporting
countries to extend their production cuts beyond the one-year
agreement that ends in March, and a new tolerance for higher prices
among producers.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman is now forecasting that the price of oil will average as
much as $22 a barrel next year, which is about $3.00 above this
year's average of $19.05. But by the end of the year he still
predicts the price will have declined below current levels, which
means any impact on consumer prices would be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial commodities, which include copper, steel, zinc, tin,
aluminum, plywood and rubber, have also been rising this year. But
their increases are much more modest than the jump in crude oil,
which is also an industrial commodity. The cash copper price is up
22.7 percent, to 84 cents a pound; nickel is up 80.9 percent, to
$8,017 a metric ton, steel scrap is up 76.6 percent, to $124.50 a
ton, and rubber is up 2.7 percent, to 38.50 cents a pound. The
Journal of Commerce index of 17 industrial commodities, including
crude oil, is up 5.2 percent. Any inflationary pressure would be
much less than from oil because these commodities are such a small
portion of the factors that determine consumer prices. Still, there
are signs that the recent increases are now coming through in the
producer price of many goods before they reach the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
   While one can see supply and demand affecting both oil and
industrial commodity prices, agricultural prices are basically
hostage to supply, Byers of Bear, Stearns said. And that means many
of these commodities run through up-and-down cycles that have more
to do with the weather than anything else. In addition, producers
often force major swings in prices, which is what happened among
hog farmers in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, a hog farmer could get $46 for every 100
pounds of meat. But a year later, an oversupply of pigs generated
by rising demand for pork and a bumper supply sent prices down to
levels not seen since 1971: 100 pounds of hog was going for $17.
</P>
<P>
   But the cutback in production that followed, with some farmers
shooting their hogs in the pen rather than taking them to market,
has pushed the price back up. A hundred pounds of hog now goes for
around $36.50. Still, food price increases have been slowing in
recent years, rising 2.8 percent in 1995, 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.6
percent in 1997 and 2.2 percent in 1998. For the last 12 months
through November food prices are up 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices, in other words, appear to remain under
control, notwithstanding the 1999 surge in oil prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Europe enters the new year and the new millennium on a mission
of staggering scale: an expansion of the European Union by 13
countries and some 170 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since Communism collapsed, the European Union has
made huge progress toward becoming a truly single market. Almost
all trade barriers among its 15 member nations have been abolished.
Citizens of any member country can live and work in any other. At
the start of this year, 11 of the 15 countries adopted the euro as
a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   But integration has not been easy. France and Germany feuded
endlessly during negotiations over the euro, which still has not
been adopted by Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece. The new
currency slumped relentlessly vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, declining
from $1.18 after its introduction on Jan. 4 to just above parity
with the dollar by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the transparency of the euro, as well as the
elimination of the trade barriers, price competition within Europe
has become brutal. And hostile corporate takeovers, until recently
almost unthinkable outside Britain, have become common in France,
Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The path ahead could be even more grueling now as the union
juggles issues of expanding membership.
</P>
<P>
   Six countries _ Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Cyprus,
Slovenia and Estonia _ are already in membership negotiations with
the European Union, and some could be admitted as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Six other wildly diverse countries are about to start
negotiations, a process likely to last at least a decade. These
countries are: the central European nations of Slovakia, Bulgaria
and Romania; the tiny Baltic nations of Latvia and Lithuania; and
the island nation of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest breakthrough was Turkey, which the European
Union invited earlier this month to become a candidate for
membership. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, while acknowledging that
difficulties lay ahead, said, ``The acceptance of our candidacy on
equal terms is a great success for Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The country has been a part of the NATO military alliance for
years but was repeatedly shunned by the European Union because of
its territorial feud with Greece and its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, with 63 million people, still faces a long path.
Membership negotiations will not begin until it resolves its
disputes with Greece, and to become a member, it must also abandon
the death penalty, even as a Turkish court is seeking to impose it
on the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the project that would
expand the union beyond its current members; besides Britain,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece and Sweden, they are Austria,
Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. If all 13 countries under discussion become
members, the European Union would constitute the world's biggest
and most diversified free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's common market would encompass nearly 500 million people
and extend to the borders of Russia. It would unite Europe's
wealthiest nations with some of its poorest. It would bring jolting
new competition to farmers in both Western and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And even if some nations do not make the cut _ and it would be
years before any adopted the euro _ the idea of ``Europe'' is
likely to be stretched in strange ways.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, with 40 million people and a long history with the West,
is likely to be one of the first countries to become a new member.
</P>
<P>
   Other front-runners include Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation that
was part of the Soviet Union, and Slovenia, a prosperous Adriatic
enclave that managed to break away from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the deciding issues are whether a country has
adopted the institutions and laws to support both democracy and an
open market economy.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the aspiring members will have to adopt a panoply
of detailed laws governing trade, social issues and democratic
institutions. That is often easier for smaller countries, which
explains why a comparatively obscure nation like Slovenia, with 2
million people, may well be among the first new members.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's requirements, broken down into 32
``chapters,'' include laws protecting investors and creditors;
environmental regulations; timetables for closing Soviet-era
nuclear plants; and the reduction of agricultural subsidies. To be
eligible many countries must still establish the courts and
regulatory agencies needed to enforce the rule of law in a credible
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear financial impact from all this. Countries on
the fast track generally pay lower interest rates when they sell
bonds on the international market because foreign investors
perceive those countries as safer. Indeed, bond investors are
already speculating on which countries will be allowed to adopt the
euro as their currency.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of Europe's single market has also sped the transition
of more statist and Stalinist regimes toward market economics.
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria have all elected Western-style
politicians in the last several years, and all have pushed heavily
to impose the changes required for admission to the union.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the European Commission in October concluded that
Bulgaria had made big strides toward opening its markets, including
those in telecommunications and media, as well as in setting up an
effective civil service and court system. Romania and Slovakia,
pariahs just three years ago, are now winning praise as well.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the acceleration of market-oriented changes has
increased political tension. Poland has been one of Central
Europe's major success stories. By sticking firmly to a course of
privatization and expanded trade with Western Europe, Poland was
barely grazed by last year's economic collapse in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet anxiety about the European Union is rising sharply, mainly
among Poland's farmers, coal miners and shipyard workers who stand
to lose from reduced government subsidies and heightened
competition. Recent surveys indicate that support for membership in
the European Union has slipped to about 55 percent of the Polish
population today from 80 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many Poles also fear that Germans will buy their land as soon as
they get the chance. In negotiations with the European Union
earlier this year, the Polish government demanded that foreign land
purchases be restricted for 18 years after the nation joined the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety flows in both directions. Germany, which borders
Poland and the Czech Republic and has high unemployment, is pushing
for long ``transition periods'' before Central European workers
receive full rights to work in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from its past approach, the European Union is now
pursuing ``flexible'' targets for admitting nations, allowing
countries to join when they are ready, rather than in big waves.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe that expansion is all but inevitable. More
than two-thirds of exports from Poland and Hungary already go to
the European Union, as do more than half the exports from most
other formerly Communist ``candidate'' countries.
</P>
<P>
   And although the embrace of market economics is generally weaker
the farther east one travels, all the candidate countries seem to
be shifting toward such policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides profit from enlargement,'' said Andreas Polkowski,
an economic analyst at the Hamburg Institute for Economic Research.
``Under the pressure of globalization, these countries have to
change regardless of whether they enter the European Union. Those
that want to become members have merely accelerated the process.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arctic air will continue to pour southward across the Middle
West on Monday in the wake of a sharp cold front stretching from
the Great Lakes to the western Gulf Coast states. Patches of snow
or ice are possible as far south as northwest Louisiana and
northeast Texas, although broken areas of chilly rain will be
interspersed across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an area of low pressure will develop along the
southern end of the cold front southeast of Brownsville, Texas,
setting the stage for precipitation to intensity later Monday
across northeast Texas, Louisiana and southwest Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will become heavy at times, particularly along the
Louisiana seaboard, where moist Gulf air is rapidly lifted by a
jet-stream disturbance trailing the cold front. Rainfalls in excess
of 2 inches are possible by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bands of moderate to locally heavy snow showers will stream off
the southern coast of Lake Superior and the eastern coast of Lake
Michigan as arctic air is moistened in transit over relatively
tepid waters. Increasing winds and visibility lowering toward
one-quarter of a mile could produce near-blizzard conditions across
Michigan's upper peninsula, particularly the Keweenaw Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will thicken over the northern Middle Atlantic States as
milder air arriving from the southwest is forced to rise over
unyielding chilly air bolstered by a surface high-pressure system
over Maine. Some drizzle or freezing drizzle is possible in the
central and northern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Daylong Rain
</P>
<P>
   Winter is Florida's dry season, but steady rains on Saturday
washed away daily rainfall records at Melbourne and Orlando, where
1.68 and 1.26 inches were measured, respectively. Rain was
triggered by a disturbance in the subtropical jet stream. This
channel of fast-flowing air near 40,000 feet originates over low
latitudes and is thus a conveyor of moisture. It was the last of
the major weather features to be discovered. Indeed, during World
War II, American aircraft flying toward Japan were sometimes
brought to a standstill by winds as fast as 200 mph in the core of
the subtropical jet.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The upward march of the stock market indexes has
become so inexorable in recent years that most strategists no
longer weigh whether the market will rise next year. Instead, they
speculate on just how much higher it will go.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, this might be cause for alarm since consensus views
on stock prices have, in the past, been a harbinger of a major move
in the opposite direction. But, with the Dow Jones industrial
average up more than 22 percent so far this year and the Nasdaq
index up a blistering 71 percent, these are no ordinary stock
market times. Indeed, just as countless investors have fared quite
well disregarding traditional measures of valuing a stock based on
earnings or cash flow, the fact that many bears seem to have left
may not signal anything meaningful either.
</P>
<P>
   What market strategists are discussing now is the array of
concerns that the stock indexes will shrug off in 2000 as they make
their northward climb. The bears may have been burned as the Nasdaq
sprinted ahead on the strength of hot technology stocks, but the
famed wall of worry still stands.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are the wild cards, events strategists point to
as possibly upsetting the market. But while some believe that
stocks may undergo some turmoil in the first half of the year,
maybe even a decline of 10 percent, most strategists are remarkably
upbeat about where the major indexes will be at the end of the new
century's first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions that lead to significant bear markets are
continually accelerating inflation and interest rates, pressure on
profit margins and possibly a profit recession,'' said Christine A.
Callies, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``And we think the odds are very low of that until sometime
in 2002 at the earliest. Really, all we need to start a new bull
market that continues for many months is lower interest rates. But
we don't see that either, so we think the market is going to
churn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callies predicts the agitation will be more up than down,
however, because she expects both the economy and corporate profits
to be strong in 2000. And as profit momentum rotates through
different areas of the market, she expects that a broader group of
stocks may respond positively.
</P>
<P>
   Another point of agreement among analysts is that next year,
even more than the last, all investors' eyes will be on the Federal
Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. That is because the
Fed has been in a rate-raising mood lately, and investors will be
on the lookout for any marked change in this stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the most difficult year for the
Federal Reserve, which will determine the course of the market,''
said Alan W. Kral, vice president at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP;
Jacobsen, a money management firm in New York. ``We've had a
rip-roaring strong equity market built on the back of one of the
strongest real economic moves in decades, but there are a number of
warning signs out there that, if the Fed chooses to address, could
result in some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, the economy comes in as hot in the first
quarter as it has in recent months, the Fed might raise rates again
in February, and more drastically, to try to cool things down.
Similarly, if any of the closely watched economic data revives
inflation fears, rates could ratchet up even without a move by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Making this coming year even trickier for the Fed is the fact
that any move it feels compelled to make will be politically
charged since it is an election year. Moreover, Greenspan's term as
chairman will be up this summer, so if he wants to be renominated,
he must please his boss as well as do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Promises by leading presidential candidates in the months ahead
of the election could also disturb the market. James E. Moltz, vice
chairman of International Strategy and Investment, an investment
research firm in New York, said: ``There are battle lines being
drawn on the fiscal front which are very important because we have
an economy that is admittedly stretched. If we get into a situation
where candidates promise significant expenditures or tax cuts, you
run the risk of aggravating inflation not in the year 2000 but
further ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management in Minneapolis, unlike most strategists, predicts that
the economy will slow in 2000 because of the Fed's recent
tightening. As a result, he forecasts that interest rates will fall
in mid-year and that the market will respond with gains as it did
in 1995. That year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index had a
total return of 37.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're looking at those returns, but the
character will be similar,'' he said. ``Inflation fears will
dissipate, and the economy will slow faster than people expect.
Bond yields will drop to around 5 percent, and stocks will go to
higher highs on lower rates.'' Paulsen says both stocks and bonds
will have returns of 10 to 15 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But do not count on value stocks rebounding, Paulsen advised. If
the economy decelerates and growth becomes harder to find, there
will be an even bigger move away from value stocks, cyclical
companies and small-capitalization concerns. Investors will focus
instead on the same favored growth stocks, expanding perhaps to
include electric utilities, which will benefit from lower interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   A common question is what 2000 will bring for investors in
technology stocks. With the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
up 71 percent so far this year, a repeat performance seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   L. Keith Mullins, head of emerging growth research at Salomon
Smith Barney, forecasts a painful shakeout in some of the smaller
technology stocks in the first quarter of the year. And, unlike the
sharp decline in Internet stocks last spring, which did not spread
to other market sectors, the coming drop, he said, will hurt the
major market indexes. When biotechnology stocks tanked in 1992, he
pointed out, they dragged unrelated issues down, too, although not
so much as the highfliers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the losses will hurt, he said, the shakeout will
ultimately be healthy for the overall market, which will rebound.
``A lot of people own these stocks but have no idea what they
own,'' Mullins said. The shakeout would help because it would
probably broaden the types of stocks participating in the upswing
that he expects would follow.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other headlines in the new year that could have
significant impact, said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment
officer, asset allocation, at the Trust Co. of the West. ``We will
see an enormous flood of takeovers in financial services, friendly
and hostile,'' he said. ``Wireless will emerge as an important,
even dominant, force in data transmission, and drug companies will
be a whipping boy for politicians in an election year, and the
stocks will reflect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moltz of International Strategy summed up the investment scene
this way: ``Someone who is a traditionalist has got to approach the
market, with these stretched valuations, with a certain amount of
care. But the classic things that would cripple a market _ the Fed
overdoing it or the economy really rolling over _ to date are not
there. So you approach it with a measure of caution but recognize
that the life in the existing trends is still pretty healthy.''

TALKING THE FUTURE WITH MARY MEEKER AND JEFF CAMP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just think what the language would be like without the Internet.
Until five or six years ago, ``Amazon'' was a very long, very big
river. ``Yahoo'' was a favorite expression of delight _ or, to
students of Jonathan Swift, a brutish creature. A ``web'' was for
spiders. ``Space'' was _ well, it was space. ``Dot-com,'' ``B2B,''
``e-commerce,'' ``e-mail.'' Whaaa?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the economy, and its Net effects.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, only 90,000 Americans, mostly academics, were
wired. Today, 80 million people in this country, and nearly 200
million worldwide, are online. Within two years, those numbers
could double.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail sales have risen from nothing to about $20
billion. Business-to-business transactions _ that B2B thing _ have
grown to $109 billion. By 2003, Forrester Research estimates,
online retail sales will grow to $144 billion, and B2B business
e-commerce will jump to $1.3 trillion. (That's just in the United
States, folks.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the stock market. Without the Internet, the
initial public offering market would be pretty dead. Without the
Internet, a slew of day traders might be otherwise engaged. Without
the Internet, the Nasdaq composite index almost certainly would not
be up more than 70 percent this year, and price/earnings ratios
would make a lot more sense.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with about six weeks left in the century, Mary
Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, and Jeff Camp, who follows Internet data services for the
firm, sat down to talk about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: There have been more than 200 Internet initial public
offerings this year. Is that pace sustainable in the coming 12
months?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: As long as the economic environment remains robust,
and as long as new categories of companies keep coming on, it
certainly seems as though it should. I think many people would
welcome a slowdown because each crop of companies is riskier than
the last one. That said, the aggregate opportunity is quite high
for high-risk/high-reward companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sorts of companies will we see? And how have the
waves gone so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: Increasingly, there will be new infrastructure plays.
Broadband is becoming increasingly real. Providing services to
build that business will be another big opportunity. Wireless is
another one. And many things are needed to provide for a better
user experience across the board. But the B2B theme, general
business re-engineering, will continue to be a big theme.
</P>
<P>
   It is also our view that sometime in the next year a traditional
company will throw out its traditional business model and become
more Internet-like, where it focuses on the long term and gets away
with it. To date, no one has had the guts to do it or has done it
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, we have had an infrastructure wave, including
companies like UUnet, PSI and Netccom; &UR;  &LR; a software wave, with
companies like Netscape and Spyglass; &UR;  &LR; a content wave, with
companies like Lycos, Yahoo and Excite, and retail and e-commerce,
like CDB Now and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each year a new crop of companies in a new category have
captured peoples' imaginations and created real businesses and real
wealth. Right now we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the
business-to-business area. Two years from now people may be focused
on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any reason to think that business-to-business
companies will generate profits faster than retailers like
Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   A: B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to profitability
compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if only because
Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses at these
companies will also probably not reach the level of e-commerce
companies. Right now it is too early to tell which companies are
going to be the big winners on an ongoing basis. One of the reasons
it is tough to predict is that many of these new companies are
looking at the history of the Internet and asking what lessons can
be learned from what has happened in the past. They have their eyes
much more wide open and are adapting a lot more quickly than
companies in the business-to-commerce area.
</P>
<P>
   I would feel comfortable saying that a year from now we will
have a lot more clarity about winners and losers. Often, the
biggest threat is not a market threat or a competitive threat, but
management error. That is something you can't predict.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which Internet infrastructure companies look promising?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: Four companies are worth highlighting: Exodus, which is
dominant in the high end of the United States Web hosting market;
InterNAP, which provides Internet connectivity services that
greatly increase performance and speed of company Web sites;
Akamai, a pioneer in the market for intelligent content
distribution services; and Verio, the largest Web hosting company
to small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were constructing an Internet portfolio you could not
trade at all for the next five years, which stocks would have to be
included?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: America Online, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nearly all of these companies, and a good chunk of their
managers, have never lived through a recession. What sort of impact
would a downturn have on Internet companies?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: If you think B2B, businesses are getting online for cogent
economic reasons: It reduces procurement costs; it increases
productivity; inventory management and so forth. It is unlikely
that a recession would derail that overall trend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: It could accelerate it.
</P>
<P>
   Camp: It may impact what consumers do, but my guess is that the
much larger part of the Internet, which is business-related, is
going to be moving along that trend for the reasons I just
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a decent argument that parts of the Internet are
going to be recession-proof. If you are a business going online,
you need a Web site, you need Internet access and all the different
tools and components that go into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite its rapid growth, the move to the Internet is still
in its infancy. Where are we, and how much of a lead does the
United States have on the rest of the industrialized world?
</P>
<P>
   A: It seems as if the Internet is everywhere, but it is really
concentrated in the hands of a group of very large companies.
Ninety percent of large businesses have a Web site or are doing
something on the Web. Ten percent of small businesses do. When you
consider that small businesses represent half the gross domestic
product in this country and represent 99 percent of all businesses,
a large part of the market is not engaged yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: In terms of development, Europe is probably where
the United States was in 1995 or 1996. There are a few reasons for
this.
</P>
<P>
   First, personal computer penetration isn't as high as it is in
the United States. Second, telecommunications availability is more
restrictive, and costs are higher. And regional boundaries _
language and other things _ are part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Internet growth is accelerating in those markets.
Financial service companies are more aggressive about online
banking than they have been here. And wireless Internet
connectivity is going to happen faster in Europe than here. That is
a big opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, more than half the usage by European
consumers appears to be targeted at American sites. For example, we
believe Yahoo is probably the leading Web site in France, Britain
and Germany. From a content perspective, the Yahoo and America
Online of Europe may be Yahoo and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as though experience is a great comparative
advantage. Is that the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who wring their hands whenever Amazon's or eBay's or
Schwab's site crashes should remember that those companies are
making mistakes many companies only wish they could make, because
they are servicing so much volume. They get smarter and smarter and
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Something on the order of 50 percent of all e-commerce knowledge
resides in the brains of Amazon.com employees or Amazon
programmers. They know the patterns when an average American or
foreigner goes online. That knowledge has helped these companies
become so big and to understand how to move into new markets in a
very competitive and aggressive way.
</P>
<P>
   I would not want to compete with Microsoft or Netscape or Yahoo,
or go toe-to-toe with Amazon.com or eBay. The leading companies of
today will not be failures because of start-ups. If they fail, it
will be because they made a tactical error or one of the other
leaders morphs into their business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of Microsoft, what do you think is going to happen
with the antitrust case? Will the company be broken up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the best thing to happen here is that they settle the
case and go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The focus I have had is on whether an adverse ruling will
fundamentally change the company's business model. But the things
that will fundamentally change Microsoft's business model are
already in place.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the bad news is that they will not have the kind of
market share on the Internet that they had on the personal computer
platform. The good news is that the Internet, whatever it is, is
much bigger, and they are in a position where they potentially
could have smaller market shares in many markets, so that might not
be such a bad thing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The trend that is driving so much change in retailing at the
dawn of the new century is as obvious to spot as a Mack truck
bearing down on your rear bumper.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, the Internet. If you believe the hype, the
Internet _ which will generate an estimated $20 billion in United
States sales this year and is expected to grow by 200 percent to
300 percent a year _ promises nothing short of a revolution that
will change how Americans shop forever.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is not the biggest challenge on the retail highway.
</P>
<P>
   The changes remaking retailing come not only in the medium
shoppers use to make their purchases, but in what they expect their
dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than they did even five years
ago. In the end, it is less the Internet that is transforming
traditional retailing as this century closes, than one giant
discounter: Wal-Mart Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer _ famous for wringing
every excess penny out of product cost _ is expected to report
nearly $143 billion in domestic revenue for fiscal 1999, which will
end Jan. 31. That is roughly 7 percent of the U.S. retail market,
according to Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, and
seven times all Internet sales combined for this year, as estimated
by Forrester Research, the Boston digital consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail sales will reach $184 billion in 2004, Forrester
predicts, edging closer but still not catching Wal-Mart, which by
that year should have $243 billion in revenue domestically,
according to Feiner. He even predicts that Wal-Mart, which sells
everything from fresh lettuce to power tools, will produce $1
trillion in revenue worldwide by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is, of course, emblematic of a new kind of retailer.
Not long ago, consumers on a tight budget expected to sacrifice
quality for cost, generally finding mediocre goods in drab environs
at the discount chains. But then the discounters remade themselves
by offering fashion, brands and great merchandising, all at prices
lower than those that rivals, either department stores or
independents, could match.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the real revolution: Kmart offers Martha Stewart
200-thread-count sheets in colors like pewter and eggshell; Target,
a unit of Dayton Hudson, has au courant fashion like embroidered
jeans and little beaded black purses, and Ikea will customize maple
kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers of all income levels have quickly become addicted to
the new equation of quality and value, and they are handing over
market share to chains that provide both _ a trend that is likely
to continue. Not only are stock analysts predicting that Wal-Mart
will experience staggering growth, but chains like Target, Home
Depot, Costco and Kohl's are all expected to expand rapidly, eating
up ever-larger chunks of the $2 trillion Americans spend on retail
annually.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that today's winning merchants will continue
to dominate the land masses; it is expected they will use their
formidable buying power and brand names to conquer cyberspace as
well. Only a year ago, the e-retailers that ran nothing but virtual
stores _ like Amazon and Etoys _ were crowing about how their
land-based cousins were dinosaurs bound for extinction. Since then,
mass merchants _ discounters and specialty stores like Gap Inc. _
have shown the draw of a household name in cyberspace and in some
cases catapulted in front of their virtual brethren in Web sales.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who once predicted that all the online shoppers would
flock to the first Web entry into any category of merchandise, like
books, now accept that a retailer's tortoise-like thoroughness in
the race into cyberspace is not necessarily a bad thing if the
company has the financing to outlast early rivals. Wal-Mart, for
instance, will not even have introduced its new Web site by this
Christmas, but no one is counting it out as an e-retailer in the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart will challenge Amazon for worldwide e-retailing
dominance by the year 2005,'' Burt Flickinger, managing director of
Reach Marketing, in Westport, Conn., predicted. ``Ultimately, the
land-based retailers of size will be able to inflict real pain on
their Internet competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that some Web-born businesses will not
blossom and that the Internet, no matter who is succeeding there,
will not have its effects on bricks-and-mortar retailers. It will
force them to be better, to entertain, to attract business or to
offer a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stores are going to have to be consumers' editors; they have
to make big statements on `this is the fashion,''' Richard Baum, an
analyst at CS First Boston, said. ``If you go into the store, you
will have to know what they think you should be wearing.'' Already,
retailers like American Eagle Outfitters and Ann Taylor excel in
such opinionated retail.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend that will intensify as the Internet grows stronger
is shopping as family entertainment. Malls across America are
putting in entertainment features like Hard Rock Cafes and
20-screen cinemas as fast as they can. But that is just the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will use shopping as an escape from the technology that
will consume their lives,'' said Laurence C. Siegel, chairman and
chief executive of the Mills Corp., a Virginia-based mall developer
that is expanding rapidly. Siegel is placing big bets on gated
attractions to rival the cultural and entertainment venues of the
great cities _ Mills, for instance, is exploring partnerships that
would let it build concert halls and museums. He sees a future of
malls that offer Broadway shows and Have community gardens on their
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   While those are pretty grand visions, Siegel has one even more
radical. ``Everyone in my business perceives the Internet as a
rival,'' he said. ``In five years, the two will be married. The
experience of being on the Internet is going to land in the
shopping center.'' He goes on to predict a world of Internet
retailers that have actual stores on the concourse that sell actual
goods (very pre-Internet). He even forecast the currently
unimaginable: ``EBay and Amazon are going to have presences in the
mall.''

 &HT;    Trying to stamp out polio in India
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Salim stood out from the queue in front of
the tea stall like a sparrow caught in a field of peacocks.
</P>
<P>
   The women of his neighborhood, draped in parrot-green and
saffron saris, had crowded their children up the muddy lanes and
into the main road of the Nehru Place slum. But Salim's wife had to
work Sunday morning; so he had pulled on his Fair Isle sweater and
respectable dun-colored trousers and herded his son and two
daughters into line with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it was essential to come, he explained, because people
had come to his hut twice to tell him so. Once last week, and again
Sunday morning, strangers had rapped on the wooden lintel of his
doorway and urged him to bring his children to the booth by the tea
stall for the drops that would protect them from disease.
</P>
<P>
   And so Salim, who like many Indians uses only one name, brought
them. Babua, 3, Nisha, 5, and Nicut, almost 6, stepped forward one
by one, opening their mouths for two drops of oral polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Three down, 134,999,997 to go.
</P>
<P>
   All over India on Sunday, the scene was repeated. At hundreds of
thousands of booths about 2 million volunteers dripped polio
vaccine into children's mouths, recorded their names and their
fathers' names, and dabbed their little fingers with violet dye to
mark them as immunized.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Tuesday, the same volunteers will fan out across the
country, carrying vaccine from house to house in search of children
5 and younger who do not bear the telltale purple stain. By Tuesday
evening, they hope to have immunized almost 135 million children.
When they are done, it will be the third time in three months that
India has staged such a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nehru Place tea stall Sunday morning, Dr. Jeffrey Koplan,
director of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, watched the first steps of the mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an incredible organizational effort,'' he said. ``It's a
Normandy invasion-sized operation, taking place a couple of times a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive though it was, the weekend immunization campaign in
India was only one front in a global battle. International health
authorities intend to end the transmission of polio by the end of
next year. If they are successful, it will be only the second time
that mankind has eradicated a disease from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Polio is a disease that most Americans have forgotten how to
fear. Effective vaccines were developed in the United States in
1955 and 1961; since then, fewer than a dozen cases each year have
occurred in the country, mostly due to immunizations gone wrong.
The last case of wild polio in the Americas was recorded in 1991 in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But in some parts of the world, polio flourishes. The virus
still circulates freely in south Asia and central Africa. As many
as 20 million people are believed to be living with polio's
irreversible paralysis; at least 35,000 new cases occur each year.
As long as the virus is present in some parts of the globe, health
authorities say, it threatens the whole world. In 1992 and 1993,
Indian polio cases caused infections in Germany, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, Malaysia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   To combat polio, an unusual coalition has developed: the World
Health Organization, the CDC, the U.S. Agency for International
Development, UNICEF and the international service organization
Rotary International _ with some financial backing from Ted
Turner's U.N. Foundation and the William and Melinda Gates
Foundation. Working together, the groups have carved out a strategy
that involves several approaches: increasing the percentage of
children who receive routine immunizations; improving the data
collection that allows experts to track the disease; and boosting
vaccine protection in countries' populations by staging the mass
events, called National Immunization Days, that aim to reach every
child in a country from infancy to age 5.
</P>
<P>
   None of those goals is easy to achieve. The countries where
polio remains endemic are among the world's poorest. They lack at
least some of the underpinnings of good public health, from basic
medical services and reliable population counts to consistent
communications and safe drinking water. Many are engaged in civil
wars and border conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   India accounts for more than half of the world's remaining polio
cases. Its challenges are huge: In some areas, poverty is extreme
and sanitation negligible. Its population is about 1 billion, and
each year, 25 million newborn children, vulnerable to polio and a
host of other diseases, are added.
</P>
<P>
   But India's response has been aggressive. Most of the countries
where polio is still endemic stage two national immunization
campaigns yearly _ one month apart, so that children will get a
double dose of vaccine. (Four doses are considered full
protection.)
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish such an ambitious program, the country recruited
help from the major players in polio eradication. Working with the
government health service, the WHO has set up an intensive system
of data collection, the National Polio Surveillance Project, in
every administrative district of the country. The CDC has sent
almost a dozen staff members, most all of whom lived or trained in
Atlanta, to India on multiterm assignments. This fall, it also sent
a nine-member STOP (for ``Stop Transmission of Polio'') team, which
spent three months working individually in towns in the two
hardest-hit Indian states. (That team included Atlanta volunteers
from the CDC and a pediatrician from the Republic of Georgia in the
former Soviet Union.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a CDC group led by Koplan visited India to watch the
collaboration in action, a visit that culminated in Sunday's
National Immunization Day.
</P>
<P>
   If they needed evidence that polio still poses a problem, team
members didn't have to look far. A few hundred yards from where
Salim stood with his children, Rama, 26, pushed the hand levers
that propelled the battered three-wheeled cart he rides in. His
legs, wasted to the size of a toddler's, were curled and propped on
the crossbar; he had had polio at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a shop where he sells cigarettes and tea,'' said Dr.
Penkaj Bhatnagar, surveillance medical officer for the district,
translating Rama's words. ``He understands that the drops they are
giving today are to prevent polio. He will tell people to bring
their children for the drops so they will not become like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The booths that dotted the brick alleys of the Nehru Place slum,
and 4,000 other locations in Delhi _ a city of 10 million people _
were staffed by two or three government employees, drafted for
overtime duty by summons delivered to them Friday. Supporting them
were an army of volunteers. Sunday morning, almost 3,000 Rotarians
had fanned out across the city to deliver vaccine to the booths,
carrying the vaccine droppers in over-the-shoulder coolers fitted
with four icepacks each. Others had walked through neighborhoods in
advance, slinging banners over lightpoles and knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Covering 135 million children in one day is a mammoth task,
which is why the government has accepted the help of other
agencies,'' said Raman Bhatia, a national organizer for Rotary's
Polio Plus campaign. ``It is a massive operation.''
</P>
<P>
   So many of India's poor are illiterate that advertising
Immunization Day proved a major challenge. At the edge of the
Qu'tab Minar, a 12th-century fort built by Muslim conquerors from
the rubble of temples they had destroyed, a ``mikee'' _ a
three-wheeled auto-rickshaw hired by a government official and
fitted with a loudspeaker system _ steered through the streets
swathed in an advertising banner, belching diesel smoke and
broadcasting recorded messages in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   In Ghaziabad, 15 miles from Delhi in the state of Uttar Pradesh,
similar messages brought 70-year-old Dile Singh and his
grandchildren into an immunization tent draped with pink and green
banners of demure goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, there was one vehicle with a loudspeaker,'' said
Dr. Prasad Wainganker, the area's surveillance officer, translating
for the old man. ``The (children's) father is working, so he
brought them.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages that brought Dile Singh and Salim to the
immunization booths are part of a ``social mobilization'' campaign,
in public health parlance. In an effort that requires enormous
attention to detail _ the Delhi government began planning Sunday's
initiative in May _ social mobilization takes precise tailoring.
Messages in Hindi will not reach migrants who speak Bengali; male
canvassers may not approach Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
   In one neighborhood Sunday, the technique was not working.
Despite appeals broadcast from the minaret of the local mosque, few
of the residents of stacked-up slum housing on the banks of the
Yamuna River sought immunizations. At a booth near a water tank,
only 25 children had received drops by 11 a.m. In a quarter-mile
walk down hill to the river, following a rivulet of filthy water
and human and animal waste, CDC staff found only one child who
showed the identifying purple swipe of dye.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the hill, Saira, in her 20s, stood over a muddy
cloth that held six fly-covered river fish she was offering for
sale. Of the four toddlers around her _ Sulim, Roxana, Punam and
Rani _ none had been immunized.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says she has work to do,'' Bhatnagar explained. ``And she
knows that if she does not go, they will come to her house tomorrow
to give drops to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Her response alarmed Dr. Jon Andrus, a CDC employee who has been
in Delhi for 6 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids are being missed,'' he said. ``It will be
critical tomorrow that teams of vaccinators come in and really
sweep this place. This is a very high-risk area; if they miss this
and get 100 percent of the rest of Delhi, this will remain a
reservoir of polio, and it could spread the infection back into the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had worried in advance that Sunday's immunizations
would draw light crowds because it fell during Ramadan, when
observant Muslims don't eat or drink during daylight. But in Vijay
Nagar, a Muslim settlement of white-washed, blue-decorated mud huts
in Ghaziabad, more than 100 children who collected around the CDC
observers proudly waved their purple fingertips as proof they had
taken the drops. The crowd of kids grew so thick that Koplan, to
draw them off, started an
</P>
<P>
   impromptu game of cricket with the village's preteen boys.
</P>
<P>
   In the bus afterward, rumbling back to town through the haze of
Delhi's air pollution, he compared the tour to his experience in
smallpox eradication, which first drew him to the CDC and south
Asia 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, that would have been a way of improving
surveillance,'' he said. ``Because by screwing around like that, I
would have attracted a couple of hundred kids, and they know
everything that's going on in a village.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiping out smallpox holds lessons for eradicating polio, he
added: The great public health triumph of this century is informing
what should be one of the significant achievements of the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smallpox showed that countries that have nothing _ that have
very few successes to show the world _ can engage in a worldwide,
one-of-a-kind undertaking,'' he said. ``That is the major thing for
a country like this. When they say, `We can't do it,' you can say,
`You did do it. And you'll do it again.'''

   NEW YORK _ Murray Horwitz has been a clown and worked for the
New York state Assembly (not at the same time). He has written
newscasts for WINS radio, acted on ``Kojak,'' staged performances
at the White House, toured as Sholom Aleichem, directed the opera
program at the National Endowment for the Arts, brought ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' to Broadway, and for the last 10 years run cultural
programming for National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   So when the composer John Harbison was looking for an
enterprising lyricist to give an authentic 1920s flavor to pop
songs in his new opera, ``The Great Gatsby,'' which receives its
world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, he turned
to the eclectic Horwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly not something I was cut out to do,'' said
Harbison, who otherwise wrote all the music and words for
``Gatsby,'' which he adapted from the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of four months in 1995, in a process he likened to
``making antiques,'' Horwitz, who can bring to mind Kevin Kline on
lithium, fashioned lyrics to five of Harbison's songs reminiscent
of the period, performed live by a band vocalist or played over the
radio during the opera. With an eye to a potential CD of ``Gatsby
Songs,'' Horwitz, 50, later wrote words for eight more numbers that
are heard in the opera as instrumentals only.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gig,'' said Horwitz on a recent visit to the Met for
rehearsals. More seriously, he said he had found the work ``as hard
as anything I've ever had to do and more fun than anything I've
ever had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One song, ``Cool,'' wafts from the radio as the mysterious Jay
Gatsby and his lost love, Daisy Buchanan, meet in her house with
Daisy's unfaithful husband, Tom, and Daisy's cousin Nick and the
flirtatious Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the summery ocean breeze,
</P>
<P>
   Cool _
</P>
<P>
   Like the earliest morning dew.
</P>
<P>
   When my heart with fiery flame is burning,
</P>
<P>
   Then I run to quench my desire with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at Gatsby's mansion, a band pounds out another of the
songs, a party anthem:
</P>
<P>
   ``One foot in,
</P>
<P>
   One foot out,
</P>
<P>
   Do that old ``Carolina Shout.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing out-of-date about
</P>
<P>
   A happy old Saturday night to-do.''
</P>
<P>
   The music melts into a fox trot that draws Nick and Jordan to
the dance floor:
</P>
<P>
   ``Night's gleaming _
</P>
<P>
   The lights beaming _
</P>
<P>
   And I'm dreaming of you.''
</P>
<P>
   (There is one song that Horwitz has no claim on: a tango that
Harbison set to a poem by Fitzgerald.)
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz, who reads music and can pick out melodies on a piano,
said, ``The music sang to me.'' He had long studied the tricks of
Cole Porter and other masters _ ``Lorenz Hart may have been the
best of them, of us, dare I say it,'' Horwitz said _ sometimes
writing dummy lyrics to intuit the rhymes, while taking care not to
parody the genre.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a circuitous road that led him to Gatsby and the Met. A
native of Dayton, Ohio, where his father, a doctor, attended
Orville Wright on his deathbed in 1948, Horwitz attended Kenyon
College in Gambier, Ohio, where, years later, he teamed up with an
older fellow alumnus, the comedian Jonathan Winters, in a local
cabaret act, beginning a long-term friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny guy,'' Winters said recently. ``I get a kick out
of him. I still do. He's fast.'' And Winters added, ``He's fairly
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz did not run away to join the circus; it was part of
college. For his drama thesis, he spent five weeks at the clown
school of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus. He left to
finish college but then returned to spend two years as a clown:
Ringling Bros.' first with a B.A., or so he was told. The other
clowns called him Shakespeare. The circus was a priceless tutor,
Horwitz said. ``I learned to get in, get your laughs and get out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the circus after two years, Horwitz came to New York
where he found work at the all-news radio station WINS, packing the
world into 22-minute summaries.
</P>
<P>
   In record time, too, he picked out a life's companion. Meeting a
mezzo-soprano, Lisa Miller, who was also from Dayton and was
studying voice in Manhattan with the singer Jennie Tourel, he took
her out on a Friday night and by the following Wednesday they were
making wedding plans. Twenty-five years later they have two sons
and a daughter, ages 13 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he put together a traveling one-man show, ``An Evening
of Sholom Aleichem,'' and studied Yiddish with the poet and teacher
Wolf Younin. ``My religious education ended with my bris,'' he
confessed, referring to the Jewish rite of circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   Long interested in politics _ he manned the lonely Democratic
tents at county fairs in Ohio _ he took a job in 1973 as deputy
spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn.
``Stanley tried to make a mensch out of me,'' Horwitz said. ``He
taught me how to talk, how to dress, how to act. I had a rough
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, after leaving Albany, Horwitz, a lifelong
jazz fan, had put together a musical tribute to one of his idols,
Fats Waller. The show, ``Ain't Misbehavin','' made it to Broadway
not once but twice, in the original hit 1978 production and a
successful 1988 revival. Horwitz collaborated on lyrics for some of
the songs Waller never finished, a task that won him song-writing
awards from ASCAP and later drew Harbison's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said Murray will always have a job, because he always
comes up with ideas,'' said Richard Maltby Jr., the co-writer and
director of ``Ain't Misbehavin'.'' ``He's a tremendous
enthusiast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Horwitz stepped up his pace. He staged the
90th-birthday celebration for Carnegie Hall in 1981 and continued
to act on television, in film and theater.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, during the Reagan administration, he was named acting
director of the opera and musical theater program of the National
Endowment for the Arts, a post he held until 1989, when he became
director of jazz, classical music and entertainment programming for
National Public Radio. He was soon promoted to vice president for
cultural reporting, a job he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's astounding,'' said Kevin Klose, NPR's president. ``I
don't know anybody who knows more about American culture past and
present. Jazz, classical, funk, rock. You name it, he knows it. He
also knows comedy and drama, film, tape, stage, radio. He's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Horwitz has, if anything, branched out, staging
celebrations at the White House for NPR's 20th anniversary in 1995
and the 1997 ``President's Summit for America's Future.'' He also
narrated young people's jazz concerts with Wynton Marsalis at Town
Hall and in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   This month he was interviewed on NPR for a Hanukkah documentary,
``Mostly Meshugah!,'' on another of his idols, Mickey Katz, the
musical comedian, klezmer virtuoso and father of the actor Joel
Grey. And next month he will be honored with induction as a
Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the government of France for
musical exchanges with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Horwitz set store by an even greater distinction. ``On my
tombstone you can carve, `He was once a straight man for Jonathan
Winters,''' he said.

`AND THE SEA IS NEVER FULL': SHY, BUT HISTORY IS TUGGING HIS
SLEEVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first volume of his memoirs, ``All Rivers Run to the
Sea,'' the novelist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel described
the first four decades of his life, from his birth in 1928 up to
his marriage in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He sums up that first volume in the sequel to it, ``And the Sea
Is Never Full'': ``My peaceful childhood, my turbulent adolescence,
the uncertainties of my formative years. Full stops and shaky
beginnings. Wanderings, wrong turns, changes of direction. Years
marked by messianic dreams and challenges, ecstasy and mourning,
separations and reunions.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he emerged from this journey a world-renowned figure, an
icon of suffering and survival and a champion of the oppressed, who
would eventually win the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In his new volume he turns outward. ``Until now I have attempted
to narrate mostly that which I see within myself; from here on I am
also obligated to turn my attention to those who have been judging
me,'' he writes. ``The introvert will yield to the extrovert.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book is patchwork, a grab bag of speeches he gave,
the great and the near-great he met, causes he could not refuse to
get involved in, conferences he helped to organize, ideological
battles he fought and infrequent bursts of eloquence about the
ineffability of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Except for these last, the prose is too often the language of
agendas and travelogue. ``I'' elides too often into ``we'' (and not
necessarily because the author is including his wife, Marian, who
translated this book from the French). Mstislav Rostropovitch is
identified redundantly as ``the world-famous Russian-born
cellist,'' as if his world fame couldn't speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   With its tolerance for words like ``prioritize'' and ``impact''
(as a verb), the writing here (at least as it's translated) makes
you feel as if you were slogging through an acre of marshmallows
piled 6 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there Wiesel arrests your attention on specific
subjects: his abortive friendship with Francois Mitterrand, who he
feels misled him over his relations with Vichy France; his
political struggles over the building of the Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington; his challenge to President Ronald Reagan not
to memorialize the German military cemetery at Bitburg; the
experience of winning the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Of his return to Birkenau in 1979 for the first time since 1945
he writes hauntingly: ``The silence of Birkenau is a silence unlike
any other. It contains the screams, the strangled prayers of
thousands of human beings condemned to vanish into the darkness of
nameless, endless ashes. Human silence at the core of inhumanity.
Deadly silence at the core of death. Eternal silence under a
moribund sky.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is most fascinating about this volume is the tension
between his professed humility and his wonder at all he has
achieved without the apparent exercise of his will. He has no taste
for politics, he keeps repeating. He is merely a yeshiva boy from
Sighet, Romania, who wants nothing out of life but to study and
write. He is shy and interior. He hates to speak in public. He
suffers from terrible stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet history keeps tugging at his sleeve and calling him to
Israel in times of war, to the Soviet Union to speak on behalf of
oppressed Jews, to Washington to form committees, to New Haven,
Conn., to teach at Yale, to the 92nd Street Y in New York to
deliver his annual lectures on religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   He calls on Presidents Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Gorbachev and
Walesa. They in turn call on him. (When Reagan telephoned him at
home, in his confusion he blurted out, ``Mr. President, how did you
find my phone number?'' at which the president burst out laughing.)
</P>
<P>
   Some good came out of these summonses from on high. Wiesel used
his prestige as a Nobel laureate to free Russian Jews and to
pressure Gorbachev on the treatment of Andrei Sakharov, the
scientist and dissident. He has kept alive the memory of those who
perished in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   He argues quite rightly that if the life of a single child is
saved by his efforts, then all his exertions are justified. As you
read ``And the Sea Is Never Full,'' you become persuaded that
something about his combination of seeming innocence and moral
honesty has the power to move if not mountains then those who have
the most power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a fair amount of nonsense emerges as well. What strikes one
as particularly fatuous is that it took Wiesel's gathering a
multitude of Nobel laureates to identify ``human rights, priority
for education, scientific cooperation, encouragement for research
in molecular biology, disarmament'' and ``aid to developing
countries'' as the leading problems facing the world, when a single
schoolchild could have come to a conclusion just as profound.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand this may not be quite as silly as Wiesel's
remark at the conclusion of his conference on ``The Anatomy of Hate
and Conflict Resolution'' _ ``I don't know whether as a result of
our debates hate diminished throughout the world'' _ as if just
possibly it had.
</P>
<P>
   Reading these passages, you become persuaded that Wiesel is not
entirely innocent of political skills and that his motives for
entering the public arena are not all connected to self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate clue to his attitude lies in the subtitle,
``Memoirs, 1969-.'' This suggests that the story he tells here
doesn't end in 1998, the last date referred to in the book, or in
1999 with the book's publication, or even in 2099. Instead his
story is implied to be never-ending, possibly because he sees
himself as having transcended the limitations of time.

WOMEN AND IMMIGRANTS DOMINATE THE POOL OF `LABOR IN RESERVE'

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years into a booming economy, America is ``depleting its
pool of available workers'' _ a warning often heard from Alan
Greenspan. But beyond the pool of known recruits lies another mass
of untapped labor that can supply an expanding work force _ and
sustain a robust economy _ into the new decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and potential
immigrants. The women are not so noticeable in the statistics; many
hold jobs and are counted as employed. But nearly half the women
working in the United States today do so only part time, and
millions are gradually stepping up to full-time schedules _ making
themselves available eight hours a day instead of five, or five
days a week instead of three, or working through July and August
instead of dropping out during their children's school vacation.
Nearly a million women a year since 1994 have upgraded their status
to full-time from part-time work.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants in question are not so much the uncounted people
here illegally, but the men and women still in Canada or Mexico who
move across the border when jobs beckon. ``You have a construction
contract and the work doubles,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor
economist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``One of
your workers makes a call back home, to his village in Mexico or
Guatemala, and within a week a cousin shows up, or a cousin and the
cousin's friend.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of people abroad are quickly available for jobs
in the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
says that slipping into America and then working illegally for a
year or two is not all that hard. And suddenly a straitjacket that
threatened to strangle a robust economy is not so binding after
all. The work force has grown lately by 200,000 jobs a month, but
rather than being depleted the pool of people available to fill
still more jobs may be growing, or at least holding its own. Few
issues in economics are more important than pinning down the size
of this pool. A wrong answer could prompt the Federal Reserve to
cut off the economic expansion, which started in 1991, gained steam
four years ago and in February will become the longest in American
history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor market gets tight, and these people flow in from
across the borders, which helps to explain why wages are not rising
that much at the low end,'' said Daniel Hamermesh, a labor
economist at the University of Texas at Austin. ``The women,
quantitatively, are not a big matter. But they represent a
different segment of the population. These are skilled people in
many cases,'' and going full time leads to less wage pressure in
the middle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and others at the Fed hold in their
public pronouncements to a traditional view on the labor supply _
one that suggests that the economic expansion must soon be slowed
for lack of available workers. When Greenspan refers, in his
speeches and congressional testimony, to a ``depleting pool,'' he
means two groups: those who are unemployed and seeking work and
those who are not seeking work but would accept it if jobs they
liked came their way. That pool has shrunk to 9.6 million lately
from 11.2 million two years ago, Greenspan notes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The significance of this calculation is clear. When workers are
in short supply, employers tend to raise compensation to get enough
people, and then raise prices to cover the higher labor costs.
Neither trend has shown up yet. The inflation rate, a big concern
at the Fed, is particularly mild. Even so, the Fed's response to a
shrinking labor pool has been to raise interest rates, thus slowing
the economy and reducing the demand for new workers. The Fed made
that point with its last interest-rate increase, in mid-November.
``The pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn
down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be
contained,'' the Fed said, in justifying the increase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, already many illegal immigrants working in
America or available for work. The Census Bureau puts the number at
5 million or so. The Labor Department _ along with Greenspan _
includes this calculation in its estimates of how many people are
working or available for work. The Census Bureau's estimate
undoubtedly falls short of the actual number of illegal immigrants,
but the shortfall is not considered big enough at the Fed or the
Labor Department to make a difference.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The INS, though, counts many more heads. ``What that 5 million
does not include is the significant number of people on our
northern and southern borders who come to the United States and
work for a year, and return home and then come back,'' said Robert
Bach, the INS' executive associate commissioner for policy and
planning. Crossing the border is not easy, he said, ``but there are
certainly ample ways to enter the United States without documents
or with fraudulent documents or by abusing documents, such as a
tourist's visa.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The results are evident even in the official statistics _ the
foreign-born hold nearly 12 percent of all jobs, up from about 10
percent in 1995 _ and certainly their numbers are growing in a
number of American cities.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider Atlanta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Ky., or Indianapolis,
where Hispanic immigrants are now well represented in construction
work, holding jobs as electricians, plumbers and carpenters. Or
visit Malden Mills, a textile maker in Lawrence, Mass., whose
best-known brand is Polartec. The company is adding 230 workers by
March at wages of about $11 an hour. Most of the existing 2,000
employees are Hispanic immigrants, mainly from the Dominican
Republic, already settled in Lawrence, whose population is heavily
Hispanic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we are facing a situation where we might
not have as many people already in the Lawrence area as we might
need,'' said Jeff Bowman, the company's marketing director.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some new applicants are relatives of Malden's Hispanic
employees, or immigrants recommended by parish priests. Indeed,
immigrants settling in America over the past two decades have
created informal networks that facilitate the arrival of new people
who, once in the country, have a relative or a friend who gives
them lodging and helps them find work. ``It is how you get to jobs
in Oregon or Minneapolis or New England that makes these networks
pivotal,'' Shaiken said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Malden Mills insists on proof that an immigrant is here legally,
but even so has had some problems. An applicant must present a
Social Security card and a photo ID, both easily purchased on the
street. And catching any falsehood can take the INS at least a
year, often longer, because the Social Security Administration
reviews Social Security numbers for accuracy only once a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen Immigration go one or two years before we are
notified,'' said Alan Kraunelis, the company's director of
industrial relations. ``A lot of times by then, the employee has a
lawyer and is trying to get a green card. In some cases you can
keep the worker on and in others you cannot. You say this guy is a
very good worker, he has excellent attendance, we have trained him
in a skill, and for the most part, unless the worker has a problem
back in his homeland, Immigration is pretty reasonable.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Or consider Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees, representing 300,000 low-wage workers in the
United States. ``Nationally, 20,000 are probably undocumented
workers,'' said Bruce Raynor, Unite's secretary-treasurer. In
Chicago, the proportion is higher, probably one-third, among the
1,500 laundry workers represented by the union, he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the union, in its latest contract, tries to protect them. In
addition to specifying wages of $7 to $9 an hour, the contract
obligates the employers to bar immigration agents from their plants
without search warrants. Just going to court for a warrant alerts
undocumented workers, who then can disappear, returning home for a
while or reappearing, with fresh documents, at another job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of what is happening as a floating labor pool that
kind of floats back and forth across the border,'' said Jeffrey
Passell, a demographer at the Urban Institute in Washington.
``Right now, there is some indication that this floating pool that
tends to go back and forth is actually here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Others are also contributing to the pool of potential workers,
postponing the pool's depletion. Older people, for example, are
working more years, either postponing retirement or coming back to
part-time jobs. Supermarkets and telephone call centers, set up by
so many companies to handle orders and customer queries, are
recruiting more high school and college students and arranging
schedules around their schooling. Blacks are taking jobs in greater
numbers, and their unemployment rate has fallen sharply. And the
number of people holding two or more jobs has risen by 800,000
since 1994, to 8.1 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But apart from immigrants, no group has made a greater
contribution than women. The shift from welfare to work plays a
role. Many new workers are unmarried mothers with at least one
child younger than 3 years old. The percentage of these women now
in the labor force _ holding jobs or seeking them _ rose to 65.8
percent last year from only 54.3 percent in 1995.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And across the job spectrum _ from high-skilled work to
low-skilled _ the percentage of women shifting to full-time work
from part-time rose to 56.4 percent last year from 52.8 percent in
1994. These women are adding millions of hours without changing the
number of people employed or the nation's unemployment rate, now
4.1 percent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chance to increase family income draws some of the women. So
does the aging of the work force; the oldest baby boomers have more
time now that their children are young adults. And companies like
Manpower, the huge temporary help agency, nudge women into working
more hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manpower supplies 25,000 people a day, on average, most of them
women, as operators at corporate call centers. The percentage of
those women working full time rather than part time is rising,
mainly for two reasons, says Jeffrey Joerres, Manpower's chief
executive. Some are drawn into longer hours by flexible scheduling,
which allows them to work while their children are in school or in
the evening when a husband is home. But higher pay is also a lure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the inflection point is,'' Joerres said,
``but $1 an hour can make a very big difference at this pay level,
and pay for call-center operators has gone up by $1 an hour since
the beginning of the year, to $10 an hour.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean wage pressures have arrived, as Greenspan fears? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, judging by the very mild movement in the
Consumer Price Index. Wages might be rising for call-center
operators and others, but not by enough to force prices up. The
pool of untapped labor is still sufficiently untapped.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY MAY GET A LITTLE SMALLER SO IT CAN GET BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The next generation of airplanes will be bigger,
faster, higher-flying and more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But some will also be smaller and might fly at about the same
altitude and speed and with the same comfort as airplanes have for
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation, which enters its second century in 2003, is still far
from a mature industry, and for the next decade it seems likely to
move in two directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is gigantism, a trend that has persisted through 40
years of the jet age, prompted by a belief in economies of scale.
Analysts say, however, that it is nearly played out; the only new
design still on the drawing board is the Airbus A3XX, which will
have about 650 seats on two levels in one configuration and 550
seats, with beds and exercise rooms, in another.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the ubiquitous Boeing 747, which began flying in
1969 and has from 400 to 550 seats, no longer dominates the skies.
The big markets, like the New York-to-London route, that
traditionally support the big planes have been hit with competition
from smaller planes, like 757's and 767's, flying less heavily
traveled routes, say, Pittsburgh to Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   That is the other trend, the movement toward efficient smaller
planes for smaller markets, and it might be hitting domestic routes
as well; trips that once supported a flight or two a day by a
full-sized jetliner that had 130 seats or so are now served by
three or four flights of ``regional jets'' that carry 50 or 70
passengers. The strategy behind the big planes was to sell a few
seats at top dollar and give away the rest at anything above cost
since an empty seat gives an airline no revenue at all. But some
analysts think more airlines will begin making a profit by leaving
those seats on the ground and flying a smaller plane with
passengers who pay higher fares, ignoring the other travelers, whom
airline experts sometimes refer to, slightly condescendingly, as
``backpackers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, less is more,'' said George W. Hamlin, senior vice
president of Global Aviation Associates, a consulting firm here,
and an advocate of smaller planes. On a typical medium-haul
domestic flight, he said, half the revenue comes from about 20
percent of the passengers, and an airline that could fly only that
group would do very well indeed. Already, some new ``regional
jets'' fly long hauls like Chicago to Baltimore; Cincinnati to
Bangor, Me.;, or Washington to Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   At WP Securities, Wolfgang Demisch, a longtime expert on the
economics of aircraft manufacturing, said that with regional jets,
``one of the neat things when you have small airplanes that fly
direct is you get increased passenger convenience, and you can
probably get improved pricing for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer,'' he said, ``gets to save time and frequently
can do in one jump what might otherwise take two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it ``the evolution away from mainframe flying, toward
almost personal service-type flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing rejects the idea that bigger is more costly. Doubling the
number of seats does not come close to doubling costs, said Joseph
W. Ozimek, Boeing's director for commercial airplane product
marketing. ``If you fill the airplane the day you bought it, you've
bought the wrong airplane,'' he said. Besides, he said, thousands
of airplanes would saturate the air traffic control system;
eventually, planes will have to get bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's approach is to build new big jets that are slightly
less than gigantic; it hopes, for example, that the stretch version
of its 777 that it is building will be the market's replacement for
old 747's.
</P>
<P>
   Big or small, some planes will have a lot more creature
comforts. A variety of experts say that JetBlue Airways, a new line
that will start operations early in 2000 from Kennedy International
Airport in New York, may set the pace. Beginning with Airbus'
162-seat A320s, its planes will have 24-channel live satellite
television at each seat. The planes will have a seat pitch, or
space between seats, of 32 inches, an inch or two more than the
average, and a width of 18.5 inches, an inch more than average. The
overhead bins are 80 inches wide instead of 60, recognizing the
penchant of business travelers for carrying their bags on board.
The airline, which aims to serve markets that the big carriers have
not served well, says bin space is about one-quarter greater than
on a 737.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stresses that the 777 has slightly wider seats and aisles
than its older planes. Seat pitch is an airline decision, not a
decision of Airbus or Boeing, but some analysts see signs that the
airlines are beginning to compete on that basis, reversing the
trend of minimizing costs, and comforts, too, that began with
deregulation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to build new and better planes presumes continued
health for the industry. For the time being, traffic is galloping
ahead, at 643 million passengers in this country last year
(although many of them are counted twice as they change planes) and
is expected to reach one billion by 2010; as a whole, the industry
is profitable. But the government has not been good, historically,
at predicting wars and fuel price increases, the two factors that
can cut traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, in contrast to certain past decades, the future
looks rather boring, a lot like the present. The idea of new
supersonic transport planes is dead, at least for the next 5 to 10
years; airlines took options on 70 Concordes in the 1960s but
eventually canceled all but 13 of them, and no one sees a market to
build more in the near future. The plane is now a quarter-century
old. Newer models may fly only marginally faster, say, 85 percent
of the speed of sound instead of 80.
</P>
<P>
   There are no futuristic designs, Buck Rogers' giant flying-wings
plane (with no fuselage), on the drawing boards either. For the
foreseeable future, passenger planes will have long, cylindrical
fuselages sitting atop a single pair of wings, most with engines
under the wings, a few with engines attached to the rear of the
fuselage, the layouts that were established by the Boeing 720 and
707, which first flew in the early 1950s, and the 727, which
entered service in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no radical planes in the near future,'' said David
Napier, the research director at the Aerospace Industries
Association. ``They're stretching planes, they're making slightly
different models,'' he said of the airframe builders, ``but they're
not extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, only one plane now in design is not a derivative of
something already flying, and that is Airbus' A3XX. (In the
airplane construction business, the ``X'' designates a model whose
design is not yet complete.) Airbus has said the plane will cost
$11 billion to $12 billion to develop. Earlier this month, the
board of the Airbus consortium reiterated that it anticipated that
the plane would enter service in 2005 but it postponed several
crucial decisions, including where the plane will be built. Boeing
officials say Airbus is reducing its estimates for the size of the
market for the jumbo airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Jenkins, an aviation consultant, said, ``the planes that
we're going to be using for the next 30 years have already been
designed, and most of them have been ordered.'' ``We basically know
what the planes will look like out to 2030; they won't look any
different from the ones we have now.''

 EVOLVING INTO A SERVICE RENTED OFF THE NET  
(ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 1999 was the year everyone started saying that Internet-based
software would replace conventional programs, 2000 will surely be
the year the transition begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs of a major upheaval as the power and
accessibility of the Internet are harnessed to create software that
costs less, does more and is easier to use than today's programs.
Companies increasingly are managing some portion of their employee
communications and customer transactions over the Internet. In
homes, a 24-hour Internet connection is becoming common, and
consumers who might once have bought a calendar program now trust
their agenda to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As this trend takes hold over the next decade, shrink-wrapped
boxes of software on CD-ROMs or floppy disks will disappear, and
with them will go a business model based on selling a product.
Rather, software companies will make their money selling a service,
much like utilities sell electricity. Other software will be
invisible, embedded in a host of appliances that bear no
resemblance to a computer, much the way today's automobiles are
rich in processing power and software that the driver never sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet creates an opportunity to change the way people
manage information technology,'' said Gary Bloom, executive vice
president of the Oracle Corp., the world's second-largest
independent software company. ``I believe nobody will be `buying'
software that they load on their machines. You will buy software as
a service, just the way you buy telephone service today. That is
something you could never do before Internet architecture came
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest software company, Microsoft Corp., is
finding itself under siege on this front, just as it maneuvers to
resolve the government's long-running antitrust case against it.
Linux, a free operating system created by a Finnish graduate
student, has emerged as a viable alternative to Microsoft's
Windows. And Sun Microsystems has begun offering a productivity
suite, StarOffice, free for the downloading, that is very similar
to Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Further, dozens of ``application service providers,'' or ASPs,
have sprung up to offer software over the Internet as a
subscription service, no downloading or installation required.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and representatives of the government are currently in
their first round of settlement talks under Richard A. Posner, the
Federal appeals court judge who was selected as a mediator by the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of federal district court.
Jackson found last month that the company had used its monopoly
power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers _
a finding that put considerable pressure on Microsoft to settle
within the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts generally believe that given the fast pace of
Internet time, any outcome will be either ineffectual or
irrelevant, because the market itself may eat at Microsoft's
dominance if the Internet software model takes hold with Microsoft
on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say the move to Internet-based software is
happening far more rapidly than the industry's last major
transition. That was the move, about 10 years ago, to client-server
architectures, in which tasks once performed by giant mainframes or
refrigerator-sized minicomputers were split between desktop
computers and servers distributed throughout an organization.
</P>
<P>
   That system proved unwieldy for many users, but it was a boon to
producers of business and accounting programs, so-called enterprise
resource planning, or ERP, software. Those makers include SAP,
Oracle and Peoplesoft, and of course Microsoft, whose Windows and
Windows NT programs are dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Tectonic technology shifts create openings for new leadership
companies, which is one reason investors have been rushing to back
companies, like Inktomi, &UR;  &LR;  that provide the software to creates the
Internet infrastructure for these programs. These companies are not
shy about proclaiming their role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that the Inktomi architecture will be
the standard architecture of the Internet, and this architecture is
going to be the architecture of the enterprise as well,'' said
David Peterschmidt, Inktomi's president and chief executive. ``It
is not going to be the enterprise companies coming through the fire
wall to define the Internet. The Internet architecture is going to
go back through the fire wall to define the enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In one vision of the new era, the client _ the portion of the
software that resides on the user's desktop computer _ shrinks to
nothing more than a Web browser, which does not require anything so
powerful as a PC to operate. It can get by with a vestigial
operating system that the user never need see. Oracle has already
reworked its core database program and all its applications to work
this way, and many software start-ups are designing their products
in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle has also begun selling software this way, through its
Business Online unit. The Robert Mondavi Winery, for example,
manages its human resources using software running on servers at
Oracle, and Bloom said many small businesses were now opting to use
programs once intended for large corporations. ``A lot of the
start-up companies are starting out with enterprise-class apps from
the git-go,'' he said. ``If you plan on becoming a $5 billion
company, why start out with Quickbooks?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Intuit, producer of Quickbooks, an accounting program
for small businesses, is also experimenting with renting software
services over the Web, although so far only with TurboTax, its
personal tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   Renting software rather than buying it will fundamentally change
the relationship between vendors and users, said Roger McNamee, a
partner in Integral Capital. ``The ASP model is about sharing risk
between vendor and customer,'' he said. The classic $30 million
client-server application put all the risk on the buyer, and buyers
were loathe to change, even if a program ran poorly because the
money was already spent. The return on investment for the buyer was
often negative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ASP model changes all that. ``The customer puts it in,''
McNamee said. ``If it works, they continue to pay for it. The
companies that are being optimized for this are the new start-ups,
like MarketSoft and Allegis.'' MarketSoft specializes in managing
sales leads, while Allegis' software is aimed at managing
relationships with partners.
</P>
<P>
   Even a traditional software company now finds itself in the
relationship business. Adobe Systems sells big graphics and
publishing applications, like Photoshop and Illustrator, that run
on a desktop and do not really lend themselves to electronic
distribution at current bandwidth levels. But Adobe also sees the
Web playing a greater role in its business. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: PLAYING A CULTURAL SERENADE TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Mighty America gives Cuba a lesson in can-do
efficiency? Think again. The Milwaukee Symphony's weekend
adventures on this embargoed island became a drama with several
happy endings, but the opening acts were tortured indeed. If things
went wrong, don't blame Havana, whose officials were like
benevolent spectators to a chain reaction of self-induced mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The good news should come first: a morning concert on Friday for
radiant and clamoring children and an evening event for equally
rapt adults and young musicians, both at the newly restored
800-seat Teatro Amadeo Roldan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps concerts should be judged not simply on how well the
participants play but on how musicians and audiences are joined.
The expressions on listeners' faces at both concerts told a story
of intense pleasure. The whispering was almost welcome, for these
were people excitedly exchanging observations on the orchestration
of Bernstein's ``West Side Story'' Suite, or the octave technique
of Eduardus Halim in Liszt's E-flat Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   The trip had been brewing for two years, inspired by a softening
of cultural barriers between two countries and preceded by the
visit of a youth orchestra from New England the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of providing top symphonic entertainment to the Cuban
people was always present, but board members accompanying their
charges made no pretense of the Milwaukee's major mission: to
provide an international splash of publicity for a reputable
American orchestra with a relatively low profile.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony had long been scheduled for a concert at the Kravis
Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach, Fla., and so
Cuba became a scheduled 45-minute jump by air charter. Red tape was
penetrated, voluminous visas were assembled, and bravely on
Thursday the planes set off, one of them at least.
</P>
<P>
   The other, carrying the orchestra's larger instruments, sat
quiescent in Miami, a victim of malfunction. Hours later a
replacement plane, laboriously reloaded, took off for Havana, but
it lacked the revised paperwork and bore tail numbers unknown to
Cuban air-traffic control, which denied the newcomer air space and
strongly suggested it return to where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Properly documented but with its contents still not cleared by
customs, Milwaukee's musical cargo arrived toward midnight and
spent the night within the spartan confines of the Jose Marti
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   This proved something of a problem for the evening's scheduled
open rehearsal. Musicians, already dazed by a two-hour-plus flight
delay and relaxed by the wondrously green tequila drinks passed out
at a welcoming lunch (by that time, dinner), showed up onstage
without enough instruments but at least capable of some
self-described ``meet and greet'' with assembled Havanans.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 on Friday morning, the youth concert's scheduled
starting time, the instruments were approaching, but had not
arrived. It was agreed that rather than examining double basses,
bass drums and mallet percussion instruments at the airport, a
customs officer would ride shotgun and tick off items as they came
off a truck into the stage entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The panoramic view was fascinating: children streaming in by the
front entrance; large musical devices being manhandled in the same
direction around the corner. No one seemed to mind the
hour-and-15-minute delay, punctuality being perhaps more a North
American than a Caribbean imperative.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to do during the wait. If Havana itself is
battered, its children are up to date. Shining and well-groomed in
their red pinafores, yellow skirts and gleaming white blouses, they
seemed genuinely thrilled by the 500 individual letters from
Milwaukee schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Happily armed with the orchestra's elaborate program books, they
besieged backbench violists and bassists, who may have been signing
autographs for the first time in their lives. Across the street
from the theater, one violinist stood and played, ringed by eager
8-year-olds in red.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, his colleagues, some gastrically devastated by an unwise
trip to a restaurant across the street from the wonderful old Hotel
Nacional, summoned their faculties, accompanied the splendid
narrator Hector Quintero in Prokofiev's ``Pedro y el Lobo''
(``Peter and the Wolf'' to you), and ripped handsomely through the
Bernstein, whose Latin influences were not lost on these listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward the National Cuba Youth Symphony sat onstage and
briefly played. Its director, Anarelys Garriga Sosa, said the
players, ages 8 to 14, were drawn from schools around the country.
Many of their music teachers had come from Soviet-bloc countries or
were trained in them. The economic tribulations in Cuba since the
breakup of the Soviet Union have been well documented but extend
also to a lack of school instruments in working order.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Diana Haskell, the Milwaukee's acting
principal clarinetist, reported that her brief session with two
colleagues from the National Orchestra of Cuba showed musicians
well trained and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play with a wonderful, soulful style and their
instruments may be better than mine,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The National Orchestra, about 60 full-time musicians, is fed by
lesser municipal orchestras and plays about 25 times a year, said
two young players, Carelys Carreras Camporredondo, 23, and her
teacher, Antonio Dorta Lazo, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its breathtaking dilapidation, Havana is a city of
enormous charm. Parks, beautifully vegetated, are everywhere. Some
restoration is taking place. Streets are as clean as can be
expected given the peeling paint, broken windows and shedding
plaster. Old mansions _ many are like palaces _ retain a crumbling
grandeur. Cars a half-century old cruise the streets, giving the
sense of a time warp. Uniformed police are seen everywhere and
assuredly many more are unseen.
</P>
<P>
   With a sweet patience, people in battalions crowd bus stops
waiting for the next ``camel,'' an elongated split-level vehicle
carried on a flatbed truck and said to accommodate 250.
</P>
<P>
   This is a deeply troubled country, but there is an evident pride
in Cuba's independent stance and a wistful friendliness toward the
United States that does not exclude anger over the dispute
surrounding Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee whose
presence in the United States is being debated after he survived an
ocean journey to Florida that took the lives of his mother and 10
others.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar is the currency of choice, preferably fives and 10s.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's concert was touching, the program beginning with
Liszt and ending again with ``West Side Story.'' Horn players
quelled their overactive stomachs and roared out the great horn
passages of Strauss' ``Don Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Three encores included Gershwin's ``Cuban Overture.'' The
Milwaukee's strings showed a European soulfulness and a
corresponding European mushiness in ensemble. In American
repertory, however, the orchestra turned very American, with a
confident bite given to Bernstein's constant meter changes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to attribute the fuzzy moments to collective exhaustion
is hard to decide, but the orchestra seemed well led by its
conductor, Andreas Delfs, 40, a sound musician with precise
conductorial control.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukeans are home by now, basking I am sure in their
city's approval and the heavy attention of international television
crews. They must also be totally exhausted. Their tour seems to
have been planned with the thought of everything going right. It
didn't. Rarely in music will so much good and bad have been so
tightly packed into two and a half days.

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has many fathers, but few deserve the label more
than Robert W. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, as a director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research
Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office, Taylor
came up with the idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet.
After authorizing money for research to develop a nationwide
computer network, Taylor wrote a white paper in 1968, a year before
the network was created, with another ARPA research director,
J.C.R. Licklider. The paper, ``The Computer as a Communications
Device,'' was one of the first clear statements about the potential
of a computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Even before coming to ARPA, Taylor saw the computer's potential
as an interactive device. As a research manager at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, he arranged financing for
Douglas C. Engelbart, a young researcher who used the money at what
was then called the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI
International, to invent the computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   At ARPA, Taylor's office continued financing Engelbart's Augment
research group, which pioneered many of the most important ideas in
today's computer industry. It was Taylor who financed Engelbart's
legendary demonstration of advanced computer technologies _
including the mouse, windows, hypertext, networking and
teleconferencing _ at the 1968 Joint Fall Computer Conference in
San Francisco. The demonstration left many of the nation's best
computer scientists, then living in a world of punch cards and
paper tape, in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's contributions did not end there. After leaving ARPA and
spending a year at the University of Utah, he was hired to direct
the newly formed computer systems laboratory at Xerox's brand-new
Palo Alto Research Center. From that laboratory and several others
at PARC came the personal computer, computer networking, desktop
publishing, laser printers, the graphical user interface and modern
word processing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who never profited personally from the commercial
Internet boom, is now retired at 67 and lives in Woodside, Calif.
In a recent interview, he reviewed these pivotal events in the
computer industry and looked to what the future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What led to your ideas about computer networking?
</P>
<P>
   A: I discovered computers in the 1950s, and the whole business
of punching holes in cards turned me off. I really wasn't
interested in computers from the beginning as an arithmetic engine.
What struck me about them really came home when I read J.C.R.
Licklider's 1960 ``Man-Computer Symbiosis'' paper. I said, ``Yeah!
Now we're talking!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you come across that article?
</P>
<P>
   A: It appeared in an IEEE Transactions journal that I subscribed
to. I was working as a systems engineer at the Martin Company at
the time. That's when the power of interactive computing dawned on
me. I had other reasons to pay attention to Licklider. I did my
thesis on psycho-acoustics and Licklider was world famous in that
field, before he started to play around with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you meet Licklider?
</P>
<P>
   A: NASA had approached me to become a program manager in 1961 to
look after research areas including flight displays and manned
flight-control systems. I told them they needed an area called
simulation technology because we were going to have to make huge
investments in simulation, and they liked that idea. In late 1962,
Licklider moved to ARPA and started this computer research program.
I was at NASA and he was at the Pentagon. I had been supporting
Doug Engelbart's work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This led to the mouse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. You know, it's quite funny _ several years ago NASA
began looking for spinoffs that their research had led to in the
civilian economy and they never realized that the mouse was
developed under a NASA contract. But Licklider, shortly after he
took over at ARPA, organized an informal committee of people in the
government who were supporting computer research. He invited me to
come over and join the committee. I walked into his office and
right away he started talking to me about my thesis. It blew me
completely away. How would he know anything about my thesis? I was
a no-name nobody graduate student. He wowed me from Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you set out to do at ARPA?
</P>
<P>
   A: I began to think that if I was going to do this for a while,
I wanted to find some particular program to measure my performance
by. I wanted to put a nail on the wall or whatever the proper
metaphor is. I wanted to make a difference. We had in my office
three terminals to three different programs that ARPA was
supporting. One was to the Systems Development Corp. in Santa
Monica. There was another terminal to the Genie Project at UC
Berkeley. The third terminal was to the CTSS project that later
became the Multics project at MIT. We hadn't had these terminals
very long. But I had already seen a very interesting thing. As
these three time-sharing projects came alive and they collected
users around their respective campuses, the only users they had
were local users because there was no network to speak of. All
communications were local except to ARPA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you discover?
</P>
<P>
   A: The thing that really struck me about this evolution was how
these three systems caused communities to get built. People who
didn't know one another previously would now find themselves using
the same system. Because the systems allowed you to share files,
you could find that so-and-so was interested in such-and-such and
he had some data about it. You could contact him by e-mail and, lo
and behold, you would have a whole new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were these first communities built around mailing lists?
</P>
<P>
   :
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you had a directory, so you knew how to send them
e-mail, but you might only know two or three people, and you would
meet 20 or 30 through the computer. It wasn't a static medium. It
was a dynamic medium. And that gave it a lot of power.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was all about community?
</P>
<P>
   L
</P>
<P>
   A: There was one other trigger that turned me to the ARPAnet.
For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of
user commands. So if I was talking online with someone at SDC and I
wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley or MIT about this, I
had to get up from the SDC terminal, go over and log into the other
terminal and get in touch with them. I said, oh, man, it's obvious
what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be
one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go where you have
interactive computing. That idea is the ARPAnet.

UNDATED: the ARPAnet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When did you get the idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: I decided to do that in late 1965. In February of 1966, I was
officially the head of the Information Processing Techniques
Office. So I went to see Charlie Herzfeld, who was the head of
ARPA, and laid the idea on him. The first funding came that month.
He liked the idea immediately, and he took a million dollars out of
the ballistic missile defense budget and put it into my budget
right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the idea an immediate success?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had to go around and talk to our contractors to see if I
could get their cooperation _ and some of them were enthusiastic,
and some of them saw it as an infringement on their computing
facilities. They said, ``I don't want to share my ((computing))
cycles with some guy across the country. I don't have enough cycles
as it is. Now you're going to build something that allows people to
come in and use my machine?'' That took a while to bring people
together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you see right away that this would have an impact broader
than just a small group of military-funded researchers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah, sure. It was obvious to some of us that interactive
computing was here to stay. And by the late '60s, the personal
computer was obvious as well. By the time I went to Xerox in 1970,
I tried to get the guys to build the Alto ((one of the first
experimental personal computers)) and they built it two years
later, but that's a whole other story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there one shared vision?
</P>
<P>
   A: The model that some people were pushing in those days for how
this was going to spread was that there were going to be gigantic
computer utilities. This was the power utility model. I never
bought that. By the late '60s, Moore's Law was pretty obvious. It
was just a matter of time before you could afford to put a computer
on everyone's desk. That was what I came to Xerox to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you arrive at Xerox?
</P>
<P>
   A: I left ARPA in late 1969 after I knew that the ARPAnet was up
and running, and I went to Utah for what turned out to be only a
year. When I was in Utah, I got a call from George Pake, a
physicist who was setting up Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. I
had the impression that he just wanted to pick my brain. There was
no discussion of a job. He told me that Xerox was going to have a
research lab here in Palo Alto and part of it was going to be
devoted to computer research. The research group was going to
develop technologies that would be used at SDS, a computer company
that Xerox had recently purchased. I said, ``Oh, that's too bad.''
He said, ``What do you mean?'' ``Well, you won't be able to get
anyone who's any good to come work here because there's absolutely
no respect for SDS among the best computer folks.'' They were
floored. They said, ``What do you think we ought to do?'' I
replied, ``You ought to computerize the office; everything that
happens in the office can be put on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the personal computer has been the foundation for the
Internet, where will the next major burst of innovation come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Broadband networks. If you take real-time video and audio and
you couple them, and you imagine some kind of a chair that's
connected to this system that you sit in and fly around wherever
you want to go ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will we use these new technologies?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll also be able to wear _ maybe not in my lifetime but
certainly reasonably soon _ an unobtrusive device that will record
in full color and sound everything that you see or point your head
at, or, depending on how many of them you have, everything that's
around you. And share it. Every waking and sleeping moment in your
life will be recorded. And you will be able to store and retrieve
it and do what you will with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will that change the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know, but it will. There are obviously implications
for privacy that will have to be worked through. I'm actually more
concerned about nearer-term issues. I want the Internet to become a
right, not a privilege. I think we need a driver's license to allow
you to use the Internet, much like you drive on the road today. If
you misbehave on the road, you get your license taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a sense of what the future will look like from a
computer network point of view?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't help much about the future, I'm afraid. I was a bad
predictor of the future 30 years ago. I was sure that from the
early 1970s, all the pieces were there at Xerox and at ARPA to put
the Internet in the state by the early '80s that it is in today. It
was all there. It was physically there. But it didn't happen for
years.

KEY FORCES FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS: CREATIVITY AND A LOCAL TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRED ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five years now, a klatch of management scholars and
forward-looking executives have met at the Sloan School of
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to ponder a
question: What will be tomorrow's model for business success?
</P>
<P>
   Their collective answer goes well beyond the usual suspects, the
likes of Dell Computer, Amazon.com, Qualcomm or Priceline _ all
commonly hailed as prototypes for the age of the Internet. Instead,
this business academy with its dazzling virtuosity in technology
seems at pains to reassert that technology is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success takes a balance of forces; technology is not always
necessary and is almost never sufficient,'' said Michael S. Scott
Morton, professor of management. Dr. Scott Morton has been
co-director of MIT's initiative on Inventing the Organizations of
the 21st Century, a research project involving a score of scholars
and engaging dozens of companies in its deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in corporate strategy, Scott Morton maintains there
is less than meets the eye in the Internet land rush. He sees more
activity than results from the celebrated Web start-ups. In the
long run, he expects ``the bigger and longer-lasting impacts'' will
come from established companies that successfully reinvent
themselves in imaginative ways, using technology to enlarge their
fundamental business vision and to support an inspired work force.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this leaves a great variety of possibilities, and
the roughly 200 executives and scholars who met in mid-November for
a valedictory summing-up of the five-year inquiry heard a good many
of them. Tomorrow's model company might be gigantic, or it might be
tiny _ either possibility was seen as entirely consistent with the
power of the Internet. Tomorrow's company might be in continuous
flux, its operations put together and pulled apart like a Lego toy.
The model enterprise might be acutely sensitive to its physical and
human environment, or it might be lean and terribly mean, asking no
loyalty and offering none.
</P>
<P>
   But within the forest of possibilities, there seemed a consensus
on several broad principles:
</P>
<P>
   _ Highly decentralized systems will be far more important than
they are today. Not a soul took issue with that. A great many
companies have concluded that if they are to move quickly and
adroitly, as many decisions as possible should be made by those
closest to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Activities _ not organization charts _ will become the key
building blocks in business. As outsourcing and alliances become
even more common, basic functions like recruiting or training or
sales promotion may be turned over to outside specialists. So
product design, an activity, will remain essential, but not
necessarily an in-house design department.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies, large or small, will be both global and local. To
compete effectively, global giants will require the local touch.
And with the borderless Internet, even small businesses will reach
customers around the world _ and face global competition, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT covey's most celebrated member is Peter M. Senge, who
wrote ``The Fifth Discipline'' a decade ago and touched off a
corporate quest to create the ``learning organization.'' Speaking
by video hookup from Paris, Senge said he now expected
``environmental sustainability'' to become a cornerstone of
corporate strategy. ``Waste is an artifact of the industrial age,''
he declared. ``Nature actually has no waste _ none.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Senge's models for tomorrow is Xerox, which designs new
copiers for remanufacture, having discovered it can save money in
building new copiers by reprocessing parts from old ones. Another
is Interface Inc. of Atlanta, the nation's largest maker of
commercial carpeting, which has made a signature commitment to
``sustainability'' through recycling and waste reduction. (Its Web
site at www.interfaceinc.com is as lofty and luminous as a New Age
greeting card: ``More than just a carpet company, we represent
peace of mind.'')
</P>
<P>
   The idea, one Interface executive wrote, is ``to deliver better
service and increased value, not more stuff.'' Its Terratex,
Solenium and Deja Vu fabrics and flooring are made from recycled
materials. Its ReEntry program reuses or recycles customers' old
carpeting. ``We guarantee your old carpet won't end up in a
landfill, period.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking for companies with foresight and imagination, Scott
Morton singled out Schneider National of Green Bay, Wis., the
nation's largest full-load trucking company and a pioneer in using
Qualcomm satellite technology to direct its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider has transformed itself from a routine over-the-road
hauler to a sophisticated carrier that provides an essential
service in today's manufacturing economy. It provides ``just in
time'' parts delivery, guaranteed, come hell or high water, for
customers on the nationwide scale of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider has also expanded its conception of its business.
Through subsidiaries, the company will design, install and run
logistics systems for other companies, including owning and
operating dedicated fleets. It buys and finances trucks for others,
and it matches loads to available trucks for more than 1,000
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Morton credits the creativity and courage of Donald J.
Schneider, president and chief executive. Schneider, true to
character, credits the company's 17,000 ``talented associates.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas W. Malone, a professor of information systems and Scott
Morton's co-director, veered from the more traditional models of
his two colleagues and expressed a vision that is drenched in the
power of the Internet. But he was less taken with the current
fervor over e-commerce than with what he saw as a more profound
change, a coming golden age for ``microenterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   As the communication costs fall to next to nothing,
``essentially everyone'' can be well enough informed to make good
decisions, he said. That power will be a boon to the highly
motivated, the creative, the innovative. He expects a vast Internet
marketplace in business services to take shape, enabling the
smallest businesses to rent the talents and capabilities to compete
with the largest companies. Large portions of the business economy
will consist of very small enterprises, as few as one to 10
talented people, and that sector will take on the radically
decentralized character of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's prototype enterprise is TopsyTail, a tiny Dallas-based
company founded a decade ago to produce a plastic hair-styling
tool. Relying on a score of vendors, from design firms to injection
molders through fulfillment houses, TopsyTail has produced more
than $100 million in sales at retail with only three employees (a
chief financial officer, a marketing director and a general
assistant). Its latest product is a collapsible foam-lined cowboy
hat to prevent ``hat hair and hot heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Its founder, Tomima Edmark, who once sold large systems for IBM,
says she turned to extreme outsourcing by hunch and by necessity.
She champions the technique as an inexpensive, fleet-footed way to
bring out a product. ``I always felt it would work,'' she said in
an interview, ``I needed to ramp up quickly, and I didn't have much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edmark assembled her network of TopsyTail vendors the
old-fashioned way _by phone, personal contact and trial and error.
But her newest venture is more purely Internet: a Web store to sell
brands of women's underwear online, starting in February.
Outsourced as usual, the site is being built by a New Jersey
Webmaster.

ELECTRONIC RETAILING TO A TRULY MASS MARKET IS EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Internet prognosticators sounded overzealous when
they suggested that an interconnected network of computers would
recast every facet of society.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most futuristic and Utopian predictions may never
play out, of course. But the Net does seem to be bringing
irrevocable change to one part of life: buying stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, online retailing has been the province of more affluent,
better-educated people who are the likeliest to have computers. But
demographic and technological trends seem likely to make electronic
retailing _ e-tailing _ a truly mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially recently, we've seen an abundance of high-end
luxury sites,'' said Ann Winblad, a founding partner of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, a venture capital firm. ``That'll change,
certainly in the next five years, as we'll see a lot more people
with lower incomes on the Web than today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winblad said that companies would continue to tinker with
the so-called free PC and free Internet access business models _
marketing techniques in which consumers are given simple PCs or
no-frills Internet access at low or even no cost, in exchange for
being captive to advertisers or to a specific set of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dismal track record of such approaches, she
predicted that marketers would persevere until they established a
technological link to the masses. ``It makes sense for these
companies,'' she said, ``because they can own the customer for a
lifetime of needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on e-commerce will be profound, Ms. Winblad and
others said, because until now most marketing and business
assumptions have been based on an online population that has been
relatively affluent and ethnically homogenous. With a more diverse
socioeconomic mix, analysts said, users could expect a much wider
range of Internet services and products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Paul Saffo, the director of the Institute for the
Future, a forecasting firm, expects the Internet to yield a range
of new products. ``Just as television produced new products, like
TV Guide, TV dinners and Ginsu knives,'' he said, ``we'll be buying
new stuff that never existed before because there's been no good
way to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web's ability to concentrate geographically dispersed
markets, he said, is one clue to the type of products Internet
retailing will support. ``We'll have products for audiences that
have been so widely distributed in the past that there wouldn't be
a store for them,'' Saffo said, offering the example of snakeproof
boots as a product that would have an easier time finding a market
online.
</P>
<P>
   The same market-driven forces that will push the Internet to a
broader cross section of users will also deliver what Web users
have long ached for: faster connections. Venture capitalists,
Internet executives and analysts agree that so-called broadband
connections _ high-speed Internet access through cable modems or
telephone digital subscriber lines _ will bring new possibilities
to e-commerce in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband's arrival will be sped by the ever-increasing flow of
venture capital money, as companies that have seen huge returns on
their recent investments look for ways to reinvest in start-up
companies that focus on network technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some start-ups will be racing with established companies like
the  &UR;  &LR; AT&AMP;T Corp. and Qwest Communications International to build
digital links capable of carrying more data, while others will be
competing with the likes of Akamai Technologies &UR;  &LR; to move that data
more efficiently across the network.
</P>
<P>
   With faster connections, ``I think we'll see a real change in
the way consumers approach the Internet,'' said Matt Hyde, vice
president of online sales at Recreational Equipment Inc., which
sells outdoor gear. ``Since the Internet will always be on at home,
it ends up being used like an appliance. People will use it for
tasks as they come up through the day and evening.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Hyde said, people will be much more inclined to buy
commodity items like paper towels or bed linens as the need arises,
``because it'll be so incredibly convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   From an Internet retailer's perspective, high-speed access
``will close the gap between the physical and virtual when it comes
to touch and feel,'' Hyde said, ``because with broadband, retailers
can do a lot more with helping people see products and understand
what they're about.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Web sites will be able to overcome bandwidth and
speed constraints, and display products from every conceivable
angle, analysts said. Sites might also include interactive features
like voice recognition or personalized shopping assistants without
worrying about data traffic slowing to a crawl. But pessimists warn
that with so many more people flocking to the Web and using such
bandwidth-sapping technologies, network speed may not increase soon
enough to prevent data traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   For some forecasters, the biggest e-tailing change will not come
from cable modems or superfast phone lines _ in fact, it will not
involve a PC at all. Wireless technology, analysts say, will take
the Internet outside the home and office and into a raft of new
devices that may, or may not, be related to today's cellular
phones, Palm Pilots and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, predicted that mobile
e-commerce ``will give people the ability to shop in the personal
time they have between doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will shop like they snack,'' Walker said. ``If you've
got 10 minutes, you'll look for a shirt, or you'll shop during a TV
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a behavioral change would require a revamping of e-commerce
sites, Walker said. Just as grocery stores were forced to create
express lanes for shoppers with time constraints, e-commerce sites
would need to create more features to let shoppers select and pay
for goods within 60 seconds. ``Retailers will have to adapt to the
time consumers say they have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That assumes, of course, that consumers are doing business with
retailers in the first place. John Hagel, who leads the e-commerce
practice at McKinsey &AMP; Co., the management consultants, said that
consumers in the coming decade would increasingly do business with
what he called ``customer relationship businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   These businesses, he said, would be formed to serve as advocates
on behalf of buyers in their negotiations with sellers _ a sort of
union for consumers. These groups would not only provide buyers
with a wealth of information about what to purchase and at what
price, Hagel said, but they might also gather large numbers of
buyers together to effectively coerce sellers to cut their prices.
In the latter respect, these organizations would resemble two
current ``group buying'' sites _ Mercata and Accompany _ but with
much greater power in the marketplace, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of e-commerce is to unbundle and re-structure
businesses,'' Hagel said. ``This is a prime example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nat Goldhaber, chief executive of Cybergold, a company that pays
consumers to respond to online advertisements, looks for
bricks-and-mortar shopping malls to ``go into very serious decline
and begin to disappear over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That hypothesis is drawn, he said, from the idea that consumers
will have ``a much more intimate relationship with manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dell Computer Corp. is the obvious example of this trend,
Goldhaber said, but he and many others in the industry expect more
manufacturers to follow suit. Meanwhile, traditional retail
shopping, he predicted, will lose its social function ``as people
use the Internet for the purpose of social interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of a radical in this regard,'' he said. ``But no
matter how dramatic you think the Internet will change the world,
you're underestimating it.''

VOTE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHOWS DEEP RIFT IN KUWAITI SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ In the galleries of Kuwait's Parliament late last
month, scores of women in bright orange T-shirts cheered every vote
in favor of a historic proposition that would have made this tiny
Persian Gulf country the first among its close neighbors to grant
full political rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next gallery over, an even larger group of men
wearing traditional dishdasha robes cheered even louder every time
a member of the all-male Parliament announced that he was voting
no.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry reflected the depth of a division that has left
Kuwait a split society, and the outcome of the ballot left little
doubt about which side retains the political upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the plan dealt a sharp rebuff to Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who had cast his lot with modernists
last spring by issuing a decree that forced Parliament to address
the issue head-on.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would have allowed women to vote and run for office by
the next scheduled parliamentary elections, in 2003. But Parliament
unceremoniously rejected both the measure and a substitute,
embittering those who had hoped that Kuwait, still the only Persian
Gulf country with an elected Parliament, would set a broader
example of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought everything would be OK, and then the men had their
revenge,'' said Ghadia Ahmedi, a 21-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Ali al-Baghli, a former oil minister, condemned what he called
``the fanatic mentality'' of Islamist and tribalist members of
Parliament whose views have held sway. ``I wish to convey to my
colleagues that all Western women do not work in strip clubs and
bars,'' Baghli wrote in a sarcastic newspaper commentary,
responding to dark warnings that allowing women to enter politics
would invite their moral downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between reformists and conservatives on the issue of
women's rights have become increasingly open across the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, where women are still not permitted to drive,
Prince Walid bin Talal, the billionaire financier, was quoted
recently as calling for an end to that law _ even though such a
change was ruled out last May by his uncle, Prince Nayef bin Abdel
Aziz, the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United Arab Emirates, Sheika Fatima, the wife of the
president, Sheik Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, was quoted recently as
saying that women should be allowed to become cabinet ministers.
That step has not been taken in any Persian Gulf country and would
be a particular departure in the Emirates, with its deeply
conservative traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, more than anywhere else in the region, some women
already play prominent roles in professional life, working side by
side with men as lawyers, diplomats and financiers. Many shun head
coverings, and some younger women dress in a provocative Western
style that would be seen as scandalous or even illegal in most
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   But among Kuwait's 350,000 or so women, a less visible majority
still hews toward more traditional values, symbolized by covering
their hair, bodies and sometimes even faces in keeping with
conservative interpretations of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   While modernists like Baghli have been outspoken in condemning
the defeat of women's rights measures, other prominent Kuwaitis
defend the Nov. 30 vote as a true gauge of public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you have expected me to feel if a candidate called
to tell me, `I need to speak with your wife and daughter,''' said
Saadoun al-Otaibi, a lawmaker who voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   His comments reflected a deep aversion among many Kuwaitis to
allowing women to mix with men to whom they are not related, even
at campaign rallies or polling booths.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by Sheik Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and
prime minister, has vowed to introduce the measure again as early
as next year, and one prominent supporter, Muhammad al-Saqer, has
said he has no doubt that Kuwaiti women will be able to exercise
political rights in the 2003 elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For now, as a kind of consolation prize, the government said
that it would extend limited ministerial duties for the first time
to a woman, Sheika Rasha al-Sabah, a member of the royal family,
who is undersecretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same women who crowded into the galleries have vowed
to become more aggressive. Until now, the most radical protest by
Kuwaiti women was in 1996, when about 500 stopped working for an
hour. But some women, including Kawthar al-Jowan, a prominent
member of a women's trade association, now say they are considering
different tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated plan lost by just two votes, 32-30, with two
abstentions, but the closeness may have been misleading, and
Kuwait-based diplomats and analysts say they do not expect any
renewed drive for the measure until late next year. Even then, some
say, approval would be no sure bet. Among Kuwait's 50 elected
members of Parliament, they note, only 15 voted in favor of the
provision, while 32 voted against.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was close only because of a provision built into
Kuwait's Constitution that allowed a bloc of 15 government
ministers appointed by the royal family to join in voting in favor
of the emir's plan.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many Kuwaitis have reacted with raised eyebrows
to a recent complaint by the State Department spokesman, James P.
Rubin, that the defeat of the measure represented a ``regrettable
setback'' to democratic development.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis reflected ``a low opinion of Kuwaitis,'' said
Abdulhamid al-Bilali, of the Kuwaiti daily Al Qabas, noting that it
was the popularly elected members of Parliament rather than the
emir and his government who opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to smooth the way for the measure, the emir, 73, had
first disbanded Kuwait's existing Parliament and ordered new
elections that were held in July. Liberal candidates made strong
gains, convincing many here that the government would win the votes
needed to pass the women's rights measure.
</P>
<P>
   Those calculations underestimated the strength of traditionalist
sentiment in Kuwait and the depth of resentment among members of
Parliament who felt betrayed by the emir's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who turned against the measure were many
conservatives who usually support the government, while those who
abstained in protest at the government's tactics included Ahmed
al-Saadoun, a former speaker who had been seen as a supporter of
women's rights.

HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET TRANSFORM THE ECONOMY, BIT BY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, Bill Gates of Microsoft &UR;  &LR; wrote an impassioned memo to
his lieutenants stirring them to confront the challenge of ``The
Internet Tidal Wave.'' That wave hit corporate America as a whole
in 1999, when companies large and small recognized that the impact
of the Internet would not be confined merely to Silicon Valley or
to the proliferating dot-com start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business now knows that it faces the opportunity and
threat of being transformed by the Internet, and this was the year
that happened,'' said Daniel Yergin, a business consultant and
author.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also become a powerful symbol of society's
expectations about the future _ a future of fast-moving, disruptive
technology that is shifting the terrain not only in business, but
also in politics and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that it is probably too early to jhether an Internet revolution is truly under way. Historians say
the Internet should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in
communications, a successor to the telegraph and the telephone,
more a technological step than a leap forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether labeled a revolution or an evolution, the
Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to become greater
and greater. When people speak of the ``Internet economy,'' they do
not really mean that Internet businesses themselves suddenly loom
so large in the nation's $9 trillion economy. They are talking of a
technology and a pattern of business behavior that feels like the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is seen as a technology of borderless free markets.
It is a global network with open technology standards, not owned or
controlled by a single company or nation. And it is magic on Wall
Street these days, driving the shares of many Internet companies to
astronomical heights.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is such a low-cost communications technology, the
Internet holds the promise of drastically reducing transactions
costs. This opens the door to what Michael Porter of Harvard's
business school has called ``atomistic competition,'' as market
forces and entrepreneurial ways are driven further down toward the
individual level. Organizational bureaucracies of every kind _
corporate, government and union _ suddenly look vulnerable to the
Internet's decentralizing powers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the power of nation states, already eroding, seems at risk.
Yergin, the co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of ``The Commanding
Heights,'' a history of the rise of the global marketplace,
observed: ``Nothing so symbolizes globalization as the Internet, a
technology with the power to leap across the geographic borders of
nation-states and across time zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction tends to be a humbling, hit-or-miss endeavor even for
the gifted or lucky. In the late 1960s, for example, Sir Arthur C.
Clarke, the science fiction writer, predicted that by 2000 a vast
electronic ``global library'' would be developed _ and the Internet
and the World Wide Web could arguably qualify as one. Then again,
Sir Arthur also predicted that the planets would be colonized by
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But technologists, economists and futurists say that some
questions are worth asking when thinking about how the Internet
economy might evolve over the next few years. What was the mixture
of technology and policy decisions that created today's Internet?
What key technology and policy issues are likely to affect the
Internet over the next few years? And, finally, since the future is
usually the past with a twist, what can be learned from earlier
technology-driven transitions?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been embraced by libertarian free-marketers as
the embodiment of their values, but, to be sure, it began with
government financing. Yet liberals who point to the Internet to
support a pro-government stance _ at least in any conventional
sense _ are ignoring certain facts. The early money for the
Internet _ as well as for pioneering research in computer graphics
and speech recognition software _ came from an elite, the
Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency. Its money came from
the military's largess, and ARPA's leaders spent it pretty much as
they pleased with little accountability. From the mid-1960s to the
mid-1970s, the agency's leaders displayed an uncanny knack for
backing long-term winners in technology.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the Internet was developed gradually in the
distinctive milieu of the nation's research centers by scientists
who believed in the free sharing of information and in open
technology standards. The next major policy pronouncement about the
Internet did not come until 1997, when the Clinton administration
released its ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce.'' Written
by Ira C. Magaziner, a senior White House adviser, the report
called for a market-driven Internet. ``Business models must evolve
rapidly to keep pace with the breakneck speed of change in the
technology,'' the report said. ``Government attempts to regulate
are likely to be outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pattern of policy to date: shrewd government seeding of
research followed by benign neglect. But as the Internet
increasingly becomes a main thoroughfare of commerce, a host of new
policy issues loom _ how to deal with taxation, privacy, security
and international trade in a global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given us the greatest rate of return on a
public infrastructure investment ever,'' said Robert Litan,
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``And it
has flourished because we have not yet taxed or regulated it to
death _ though those are live issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, the Internet is almost an economy unto itself _
a network, yes, but also a complex and interacting set of
technologies. Today's Internet is a result of a torrid pace of
improvement in recent years in computer networks, processing power,
data storage, software, display technology and user interfaces like
the Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer firepower of computers, experts say, is certain to
race ahead to startling effect over the next few years. Data
storage technology, for example, is advancing at a particularly
rapid rate. By 2003, personal computers may well come with terabyte
hard drives, which are roughly 100 times the capacity on new PC's
today, featuring about 10 gigabytes on average. A terabyte drive
would be able to hold every conversation that even the chattiest
person has had in a lifetime. Think of a supercomputer on every
desktop, in terms of giving individuals the ability to mine
personal or business information.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of academic and scientific research, computing
will increasingly be used for simulation and analysis. The real
payoff from the Human Genome Project, for example, will come not
from identifying the complete DNA sequence, but from understanding
how these complex proteins work. Such knowledge, medical experts
say, will be the basis for everything from developing personally
tailored drugs to discovering new ways to treat disease. The main
tool for stalking that breakthrough knowledge is computational
biology _ microbiological simulations run on powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The real technical challenge to the Internet economy will not
come from any shortcoming in raw computing power, but from the
difficulty of building up the global network to meet demand. The
next-generation vision of the Internet is of a high-speed global
network to which billions of devices are connected, from TV set-top
boxes and hand-held computers to refrigerators and washing machines
that would be able to do everything from optimizing fuel use to
requesting a repair call automatically online.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of global nervous system of commerce and
communication will require far more than adding computers and
laying more wire. The Internet, after all, was originally designed
as a computerized ``party line'' for a small community of
researchers _ who knew and trusted each other _ to send e-mail. And
network complexity can increase exponentially _ that is, a network
with 200 million users is far more than twice as complex as one
with 100 million because each user, each computer and each line of
code can interact with others in the network in unpredictable ways,
just as in a biological organism.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential advisory group of leading computer scientists
concluded earlier this year that new research, fresh approaches and
more government money were needed to cope with the problem.
``Scaling the Internet to handle the expected growth over time is a
major challenge,'' said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of
the Internet division at IBM and a member of the group. ``And the
current infrastructure can't scale up.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's report to the White House warned that there would be
``catastrophic failures'' in the computer networks that
increasingly support the nation's defense and economy, unless those
networks were retooled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wladawsky-Berger predicts that the technical challenge
can be overcome, provided the government and industry make the
needed research investments. ``It should not be a showstopper,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, given the track record of success in computing, the
visceral optimism of the technologists seems justified. ``Sure
there are some tough problems, but it'll work,'' said Rick Rashid,
head of research at Microsoft. ``We can do it. We always have. In
information technology, that is the way it's always worked.''
</P>
<P>
   That information technology is delivering a problem-solving
payoff has been an article of faith in the corporate world for
years, far more so than among economists. Business investment in
computer hardware and software is running at $380 billion a year,
up steadily from the annual rate of $110 billion five years ago.
And corporate America is expected to keep increasing such
spending.. By the end of 2001, Macroeconomic Advisers, a research
firm in St. Louis, projects that business investment in computer
hardware and software will be running at a yearly rate of $513
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect the nation's extraordinary growth to continue
next year, though at a somewhat slower pace. The consensus among
the 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey is
that the economy will expand 3.9 percent this year, with inflation
at 1.4 percent. For 2000, the consensus is growth of 3.2 percent
and inflation of 1.7 percent. In February, the economy should set
the record for the longest expansion, surpassing the 106-month
record set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact information technology has had on the economy's
uncommon run of growth, productivity gains and low inflation is a
subject of heated debate within the economics profession. It is
probably too early to tell, but Litan of Brookings, who is leading
a yearlong study on the issue, sponsored by the Internet Policy
Institute, said, ``My instinct is whatever we find the economic
impact to be, it will be a lot greater five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of being at the start of a business and economic
transformation, of course, has fueled the Internet start-up fever.
It seems a speculative bubble, but such periods of investment mania
foster a rapid pace of business experimentation. Thomas Eisenmann,
an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, notes that
from 1900 to 1925 there were more than 3,300 automobile start-ups
in America turning out cars of many types _ some sporting three
wheels, some six; one model featuring a shiplike tiller for
steering; others trying electricity or steam as power sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see the same kind of winnowing in e-commerce,''
Eisenmann said. ``Some will succeed, but most will fail. We'll
repeat the past again, only faster.''
</P>
<P>
   For established companies, the Internet challenge is to adapt to
an accelerated technological shift. That was precisely the quandary
Gates was sketching out in his 1995 memo: Microsoft was threatened
by the rise of Internet software; yet if it scrambled, he wrote,
the company could benefit from the Internet. The speed of
Microsoft's response is regarded as an exceptional case of a big
company's moving nimbly to change course, but the tactics it used
became the subject of the government's sweeping antitrust suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's openness, low-cost use and speed are its
distinctive features. The telegraph, historians note, had many of
the same qualities _ it was an electronic network that transformed
many business practices and was a new medium of informal
communication for many. Yet the telegraph was expensive in contrast
to the Internet. Sending a message was a household budgeting
decision; firing off an e-mail message today is not. ``The Internet
is the telegraph for the rest of us,'' noted Paul Saffo, a director
of the Institute for the Future.
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which the Internet is spreading across the globe,
pushing both the tools and values of high technology onto people,
could prompt a backlash. Peter Schwartz, a leading futurist and
business consultant, is a technology optimist. Along with Peter
Leyden and Joel Hyatt, he wrote, ``The Long Boom: A Vision for the
Coming Age of Prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schwartz, while predicting that the pace of technological
change will not slow, adds that the willingness of people to accept
new technology could reverse sharply if companies and governments
do not make the right policy choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet economy carries the potential for creating ``a deep
divide between those who have the skills to prosper and those who
don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why education policy is so important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The social tolerance for technology, Schwartz added, could also
cool. The advance of nuclear power in the United States, he said,
came to a standstill because the public fears after the Three Mile
Island accident were not allayed. The recent resistance to
genetically altered foods and the protests in Seattle over the
World Trade Organization's global influence on environmental and
labor protections, he said, are warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inadequate appreciation of either the losers in this new
economy or of the people with legitimate concerns could be real
problems,'' Schwartz said. ``If you don't address those groups
early on, it will come back to bite you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the pressures on the oil industry as the century turns,
the one most likely to transform it over the next two decades,
industry experts say, will be the fervent campaign to improve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go 20 years forward, the oil industry at the turn of the
21st century will look like a very antiquated business because the
types and use of petroleum products will change dramatically,''
said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a senior adviser to the Brattle Group,
an economic consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a lot of capital that is going to be made
obsolete almost immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much as it has for the last 100 years, however, oil will
dominate the fuel industry as the 21st century begins. Even for the
next decade or so the effects of recent underlying trends are
likely to be incremental rather than seismic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing surprising out there over the medium term,''
said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation in New York. ``The trends that have been
driving and will continue to drive the industry are already in
place: consolidation, cost consciousness and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   From a public policy perspective, however, ``environmental
issues will be paramount,'' he said. And in the longer term,
conforming with stricter environmental guidelines will transform
the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Structural changes are already occurring. Driven by the need to
cut costs, 1999 brought the consolidation of four huge companies
into two even bigger ones: Amoco's merger with British Petroleum
and the combination of Exxon and Mobil. A consolidation wave in the
oil services business has been less heralded, but in many respects
has been even more sweeping. Among the combinations are
Halliburton's takeover of Dresser Industries, Baker Hughes'
purchase of Western Atlas, and EVI's purchase of Weatherford
Enterra.
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of the future will be on view next year when Toyota
and Honda roll out so-called hybrid automobiles _ cars that combine
batteries and electric motors with gasoline or diesel engines.
These clean, peppy models can go twice as far as a conventional car
on a gallon of gasoline, although analysts say drivers may not rush
to buy any new technology until they are sure it works well.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the drawing boards are vehicles powered by a fuel cell
and batteries instead of an engine and batteries. Fuel cells
combine hydrogen and oxygen to form electric current and water,
with high efficiency and no pollution. Even if oil prices do not
rise, movement toward the fuel cell cars is virtually inevitable,
the experts said, although this technology is still being developed
and is not expected to take hold until sometime in the second
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. energy policy today is an environmental policy: cleaner
fuels and substitution away from conventional oil moving slowly,
inevitably toward alternative fuels,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they roll out more and more gas-guzzling,
high-profit-margin sport utility vehicles, automobile manufacturers
have apparently heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk to anyone in the auto industry who doesn't think
that fuel cells are the likely fuel-propulsion mechanism in the
future,'' said Paul R. Portney, president of Resources of the
Future in Washington. ``Whether it is powered by methanol, hydrogen
or something else is up in the air, but 20 years from now fuel
cells will begin to propel more and more cars. In the interim, you
will see hybrid cars.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the internal combustion engine will continue
to rule. And while it is possible that an oil shortage may develop
this winter, experts said that oil would remain plentiful over the
longer term.
</P>
<P>
   The doubling in oil prices over the last year has been painful
to the pocketbook, but experts point out that it was unrealistic to
assume that oil, which cost $13 a barrel or less in 1998, would
stay at those lower levels for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get large chunks of new supply over the next
five years,'' Verleger said, ``particularly if OPEC keeps prices
up. It will primarily come out of the sea, like the Caspian oil
field.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, the cartel that controlled oil prices and had a profound
influence on the world economy in the 1970s, lost most of its teeth
in the 1980s and well into the 1990s. Alternative sources of supply
and a global economy that is less dependent on petroleum have
curbed its power.
</P>
<P>
   But this year OPEC managed to regain some of its old dominance
by adopting _ and adhering _ to a set of strict production quotas
during a time of rising demand. The cartel's re-emergence as a
major force, however, is likely to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil prices will remain volatile because no ruling group is in
charge,'' said M.A. Adelman, professor emeritus of economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``Conditions are a lot more
competitive than they used to be, and the price is a lot lower.
That will continue for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is coming largely from sources of new supply that
have been made possible by technological improvements over the last
decade. Exploration in some previously unreachable places is now
economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, three technological advances have been
particularly important: 3-D seismic exploration techniques, which
allow ships trawling over the ocean to locate reserves more
precisely; the development of deep-water platforms that allow for
exploration at much greater depths, and directional drilling, which
slants drill bits out like legs on a mosquito as far as 5 or 10
miles, greatly expanding the territory that can be explored from a
single ocean-based platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``These technologies, which are being fine-tuned to make them
more versatile in various parts of the world, allow for much faster
exploration and delivery,'' said James L. Smith, a professor of
economics at the Cox School of Business of Southern Methodist
University.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Smith said that new wells in the North Sea could
be in production within 18 months to two years from first
discovery. Not so long ago, that same process would have taken as
much as seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although OPEC nations sit on vast proven reserves of oil, the
rise in recoverable reserves elsewhere has all but silenced the
voices that a quarter-century ago were saying that the world would
soon run out of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance we will run out of oil in the next 20
years,'' Portney, from Resources of the Future, said. ``We will
stop using oil long before we run out of it. A century from now,
when we don't use oil for very much, there will be a ton of it
around.''

FLYERS' COACH NEILSON USES HIS GOOD NATURE AGAINST CANCER
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The chemotherapy begins Monday. A doctor will cut
the skin high on Roger Neilson's chest and insert a small plastic
device. The attached pump will deliver timed doses of two drugs
into his bloodstream. The process will last four days and will be
done in three cycles over two months.
</P>
<P>
   After that comes the bone marrow transplant that will force
Neilson to stop coaching the Philadelphia Flyers for at least six
weeks in late winter. Neilson could become weak and uncomfortable
while battling a bone cancer called multiple myeloma. He might lose
his unruly mop of curly hair, a distinguishing characteristic. He
and the Flyers' general manager, Bob Clarke, have joked about
Neilson's wearing different wigs to every game, like his rotation
of loud neckties. Neilson elicits chuckles when he says his
recovery plan is well-timed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor Brodsky and I both agree that the most important thing
is winning the Stanley Cup,'' Neilson said, with a wry smile, ``and
so I think he's got it worked out that we'll be ready for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   When he turned serious, Neilson said: ``It is my faith that
keeps me going. Any tough situations, I always turn them over to
the Lord. This happens to be His plan for my life right now, so I'm
just going to work as hard as I can through it. It's more up to Him
than it is up to me. I don't worry about it. That's the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson's illness has sent a worried shiver through the National
Hockey League this holiday season. At age 65, coaching his seventh
team, Neilson is the NHL's favorite bachelor uncle, a little
eccentric but a mensch, one of the elders of his craft with 23
seasons in the league. In a business where some people easily make
enemies, Neilson has few. In an environment known for both casual
and serious cursing, Neilson never uses profanity. He rarely drinks
alcohol. He never smokes. He mails more than 1,000 Christmas cards
each year and gets at least that many back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sends out 500 gifts,'' said Eric Lindros, the captain of
the Flyers. ``He's a whirlwind. He hasn't slowed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson suffered flu-like symptoms during training camp, and
when they continued into November, he was first diagnosed with
pneumonia. But he could not regain 12 pounds he had lost, and more
tests were done.
</P>
<P>
   He does not look that ill and he certainly does not look old. He
is lean and fit from workouts that include riding a bicycle to the
practice rink, even on cold days. As he moves about arena corridors
before and after games, people hug Neilson and pat him on the back
and say ``good luck'' and ``God bless you.'' He hunches his
shoulders, bows his head and thanks them. Before Saturday night's
game against Tampa Bay, Neilson's office visitor was John Cullen,
the Lightning assistant coach who is a cancer survivor. ``He talked
about what it was like for him and what I can expect,'' Neilson
said. ``It was really good for me and nice of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in last Thursday night's game against Phoenix, when a
whistle stopped play, the video screen on the scoreboard showed
Neilson's craggy face. The officials skated away from the face-off
circle so that players had time to rap their sticks on the ice and
boards while the fans stood to applaud. Neilson waved, exhaled with
puffed cheeks and licked his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very sympathetic to someone who has cancer,''
Neilson said. ``It's one of those diseases that everybody hopes
they don't get. We've had people phoning and sending things in from
all over the country. It's been really amazing. I have had so many
phone calls that I can't possibly return them. It's so very nice to
know you've got friends and that support.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson's disease is an aggressive one; the five-year survival
rate for multiple myeloma patients treated with chemotherapy is 29
percent. Last week, Neilson's doctor, Isadore Brodsky, head of
hematology and oncology at Hahnemann University Hospital, said his
prognosis for Neilson was excellent because the disease was
identified at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would easily put Roger's life expectancy as beyond five
years,'' Brodsky said. ``Maybe even 10 to 15. He's going to be
around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood around Neilson is uncertain, however, a mix of
optimism, pessimism and a celebration that Neilson does not seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is getting more publicity than it deserves,''
he said. He might be right. Many anonymous people suffer more from
worse things, but sports figures serve as surrogates and symbolic
relatives. Just as fans project disproportionate love and anger and
envy toward them, so too do they express sympathy. The concern is
more personal for the hundreds in the business who know Neilson
from his major and minor-league jobs in St. Louis, Chicago, New
York, Dallas, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton, Buffalo, Florida and _
before all that _ Peterborough, Ontario, one of those hockey
cradles, where he coached juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger didn't have a family,'' Lindros said. ``Every team he
goes to, every player in the room, that's his family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lindros said that even players who disagreed with Neilson's
coaching philosophy never resented him personally. Lindros might
know _ he is also an admirer of Mark Messier, whose rebellion
against Neilson's style led to Neilson's dismissal from the Rangers
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson softened the announcement to the players on Dec. 10 by
preceding it with a Monty Python video. ``We know there are tougher
days coming for Roger,'' Flyers forward Keith Jones said. Mark
Recchi, another forward, said Neilson ``is probably the one who is
the most optimistic and positive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before Neilson announced his illness, his team
squandered a lead. Harry Neale, his old boss in Vancouver, ribbed
Neilson about it. The day after the announcement, Neale saw Neilson
again and began to offer sympathy. ``I was horrified when I heard
and I told him I'd pray for him,'' said Neale, now a television
commentator. ``He looked at me and saw the tears in my eyes and he
told me three funny stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Many anecdotes are making the rounds: of Neilson the marathon
runner, Neilson the bungee jumper and Neilson the world traveler,
and of how Neilson sometimes locks himself out of his office and
sometimes sleeps there. People tell of how he occasionally forgets
to pay utility bills and never holds grudges or lashes out behind
people's backs, and of how he pioneered the use of videotape for
scouting two decades ago, and of how, before that, he forced
officials in junior hockey to change the rule about penalty shots.
He would replace his goalie, they recalled, with a defenseman, who
would simply leave the net and challenge the shooter up ice, often
successfully. And there was that time with Vancouver when Neilson
led his players in a protest against the officials by waving white
towels of surrender on the ends of their hockey sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nichols of Dallas, who worked for Neilson when he coached
the minor league Dallas Blackhawks, has been a close friend for
more than 20 years. She spoke of how Neilson has often let sons and
grandsons of friends board at his house and has mentored them and
provided them with jobs in his coaching clinics and hockey schools
in Canada and Israel. She recalled how Neilson delivered newspapers
in Toronto while teaching high school when he was in his 30's.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Neilson's legendary absentmindedness _ he sometimes
gets lost when driving even familiar routes _ Nichols said: ``It's
not an act. It's not premeditated. It's truly him. He's a quirky,
Magoo kind of guy. He's such a spaceman. That's why everybody loves
him.'' Nichols said she will come to Philadelphia to help nurse
Neilson back to health after his surgery and that they both will
use the playoffs, which begin in April, as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to have a goal to get through anything like
this, the Stanley Cup will do,'' she said. ``He's goal oriented. He
has incredible faith, a built-in coping system. I'm going to be
Roger's coach. He's not going to like that. But we've had a long
history of taking care of each other. I'll do my time so I can get
my Stanley Cup necklace.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the recent outpouring of support for Neilson,
Nichols said: ``It's a big love-in. Welcome to it.'' &QL;

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his nearly half-century as an economist, Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has watched the nature of
the American economy change fundamentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quintessential manifestations of America's industrial
might earlier this century _ large steel mills, auto assembly
plants, petrochemical complexes and skyscrapers _ have been
replaced by a gross domestic product that has been downsized as
ideas have replaced physical bulk and effort as creators of
value,'' Greenspan said in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, economic value is best symbolized by exceedingly
complex, miniaturized integrated circuits and the ideas, the
software, that utilize them,'' he said. ``Most of what we currently
perceive as value and wealth is intellectual and impalpable.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the continued importance of basic industry to the economy,
Greenspan may have overstated his case a bit. But there is little
doubt that sweeping technology-driven shifts are under way in the
structure and operation of the economy and that they are forcing
Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve to rethink
their approach to monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Fed policy makers face problems at the
beginning of the new decade that generations of their predecessors
would have welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Having forced inflation down to quite manageable levels, they
have the luxury of debating whether it is better to allow prices to
rise slightly each year, or whether they should aim for absolute
price stability.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment hovering near 30-year lows, they have been
forced to re-examine the assumption that a strong economy will
inevitably generate inflation if joblessness falls below a certain
level. With traditional forecasting models no longer terribly
reliable, they face considerable uncertainties as they try to
predict the economy's course.
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting evidence that productivity _ the single most
important determinant of the economy's growth potential _ is
benefiting from huge investments in technology and is surging at a
rate that would allow the economy to retain substantial momentum
without igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is certain how long the surge will continue.
Likewise, it is anyone's guess whether the booming stock market is
a reflection of and contributor to the economy's improved long-term
prospects or a bubble that will end in tears.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear whether the length of the current expansion _
barring an unforeseen collapse it will become the longest in the
nation's history in February at eight years and 11 months _ means
that the business cycle has been tamed or simply that the United
States is benefiting from a remarkable string of good luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed faces these challenges from a position of relative
strength. Thanks to his success in taming inflation and his
flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing economy,
Greenspan has tremendous credibility and leeway among investors and
political leaders. With both Democrats and Republicans pledging to
maintain fiscal discipline, monetary policy is becoming even more
important in managing the economy. The Fed's independence from the
government of the day and its focus on inflation-fighting have
become the standard for central banks around the world, which
constantly look to Greenspan for their cues.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks, led by the Fed, ``now find themselves in a
position of power and responsibility unrivaled in their history,''
said Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England. ``A
commitment to price stability is now seen as the key to achieving
broader economic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan still has his critics. Farmers, beset by commodity
prices that are low or falling, contend there is little
justification for higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers say Greenspan does not seem to understand how
little power they have to raise prices or to appreciate fully how
technology and global competition are driving them to become more
efficient. And many liberal economists contend Greenspan seems to
have forgotten that the Fed's mandate includes a commitment to
achieving full employment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Greenspan is likely to face some
particularly difficult choices. If the economy continues to defy
predictions that it will slow to a sustainable pace, he may feel
forced to follow this year's three quarter-point rate increases
with additional tightening. Fed policy makers meet Tuesday but are
not expected to raise rates then, given their current neutral
policy stance. That puts further action off until 2000, an election
year, which could create tremendous political pressure on the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who will turn 74 in March, has proved willing and
able to take the heat when necessary, and so far he has given no
indication that he is tired of the job, which he has held more than
12 years. President Clinton seems almost certain to nominate him to
a fourth term next year, providing continuity in monetary policy
whatever the outcome of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, policy makers in Washington are already speculating
about a post-Greenspan Fed. Assuming Greenspan serves only one more
term, the next president would get to choose his successor, a
selection that could carry tremendous economic and political
significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to think in terms of Greenspan's legacy. Still,
his constant re-examination of assumptions about how the economy
works and his focus on technology as a transforming force have
already changed the approach to their jobs of officials at the Fed
and at other central banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if central banks are to retain their central
position in economic policy making, they must face up to the
intellectual and technological challenges that lie ahead,'' King
recently told a gathering of central bankers, including Greenspan.
``Unless they do so, popularity will turn to disillusion.''

WIRELESS INDUSTRY LOOKS BEYOND PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last decade, cellular telephones have evolved from
oddity to indulgence to everyday accessory. Eighty million
Americans now use them. That is not so shabby a track record, but
many communications experts now want to move on. They want you to
stop talking about wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, discuss the future of wireless technology with leading
communications executives and the words ``phone'' and ``telephone''
may not be used at all. That is because they see the future of
wireless technology as having little to do with talking and
everything to do with putting the Internet into pockets and purses
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, people's need to talk on the phone will continue to
provide the financial lifeblood of the wireless industry. Some
wireless executives even see the promises of technological wizardry
as overblown. Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint PCS, one
of the nation's biggest wireless phone carriers, predicts that
old-fashioned voice transmission will remain the biggest part of
the business, with as many as half the nation's phone calls being
made without wires by the middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in just a few years, the mere wireless phone may
very well seem as dated as a rotary dial. The conventional wisdom _
the orthodoxy even _ in the communications business is that in its
place will be a new generation of mobile wireless devices that
function not only as telephones but also as Internet terminals,
radios that can be customized for personal tastes, and perhaps even
customized television.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a smart phone, a personal digital assistant or merely a
wireless device. New wireless technologies to be deployed over the
next few years promise to pump the flow of digital information to
hand-held wireless units from trickles to torrents. By 2002,
wireless subscribers could have access to as much as a million bits
of digital information each second _ just about enough for a
television-quality videophone and about 20 times the 56K connection
speed supported by today's fastest home modems.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to unplug the wired world of computers and phone
jacks to allow people to communicate and gain access to information
when they want, where they want, how they want. In much the same
way that computers that link to the Internet have been credited
with releasing people from some constraints of time and space, the
next generation of wireless technology may release the Internet
from computers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will be able to focus on getting the individual his or
her own information, no matter how they would like to receive it,''
said Phillip T. Redman, an analyst for the Yankee Group, a
technology consulting firm based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless offers the ability to extend a user's communications,
their entertainment system, their commercial transactions to an
anytime, anywhere paradigm,'' Redman said. ``You no longer are
going to be tethered to a computer at home or at work or have to
plan your shopping around when you're going to be at the mall. All
of these will be targeted to you whenever or wherever you want to
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   This may all sound a bit familiar, of course. The hype about
wireless data services has continued almost unabated for years. But
the technology to support futuristic wireless services is beginning
to be put into place, so those services now seem set to move beyond
e-mail on a phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless industry has been promoting this year being the
year of wireless data for the last five or six years now,'' said
Scott Goldman, chief executive of the Wireless Application Protocol
Forum, an industry group that has developed systems to deliver
Internet services to hand-held devices. ``Now, if you poll wireless
experts you will find people in concert saying, `Yes, 2000 is the
year.'''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for optimism is that the big companies that make
wireless systems _ like Ericsson, Nokia, Lucent Technologies and
Northern Telecom &UR;  &LR; _ have begun to foster expectations about the
data capacities of their products. They have seen start-ups like
Neopoint produce revolutionary phones that can link to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information will be localized, will be personalized and
will be timely,'' said Haroon I. Alvi, director for business
development of Nokia's wireless handset operation,
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine you're a soccer parent,'' he said, ``and you spend two
to three hours a day taking your kids around town to school, sports
events and other sorts of family events. As that soccer parent, you
want to know about road conditions, traffic and weather conditions
in the vicinity where you're located and at that instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you're going to get into your car and take your kids to
a soccer match, you may want to look at your phone to see if the
venue has been changed. There might be an alert saying, `We've
changed the location because the field was waterlogged.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even e-commerce, the much-vaunted selling of goods over the
Internet, could be revolutionized by the next wave of wireless
technology, through phones or personal digital assistants, known as
PDAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just important that I can purchase a product through
my phone or my PDA,'' Redman said. ``But my phone or PDA knows
where I am, and I can get a deal because there's a special going on
near me as I'm driving and I'm alerted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the noise around wireless data services, however, voice
telephone service will continue to be the fundamental economic
driver of the big wireless carriers' business. That is largely
because data services may well be priced along the ``all you can
eat'' model of Internet service providers, but phone calls are
still likely to be priced minute by minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a technology business, and so people get focused
often on the wrong thing,'' Sukawaty of Sprint PCS said. ``Data is
coming, no doubt about it, but the bigger revenue for wireless is
that probably 50 percent of the voice traffic is going to go on
wireless networks in the next three to five years. Given that it
was at 6 or 7 percent two years ago, that's incredible.''

   For several years, the big quest in biotechnology has been to
determine the complete sequence of human DNA, the genetic code of
life. Now, however, that task is nearing completion, and the
biotechnology industry is facing an even tougher job _ deciphering
that code so that new drugs and diagnostic tests can be developed.
</P>
<P>
   The coming post-sequencing era will bring huge changes to the
industry. The causes and mechanisms of various diseases that now
defy treatment will become known so that drugs can be developed
much more precisely. Drug discovery will rely as much on software
and databases of genetic information as it will on test tubes and
white mice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important change could be a shift from the
``one drug fits all'' approach to treatments tailored to individual
patients based on their genetic profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the genome being completed, I think we're literally going
to move from statistical-based medicine, where we're thinking about
entire populations, to personalized medicine,'' said Kenneth
Conway, president of Millennium Predictive Medicine, a
majority-owned subsidiary of Millennium Pharmaceuticals in
Cambridge, Mass. ``I think we're going to look back 10 years from
now and think of medicine as being in the dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the predictions made by biotechnology
executives in the past proved overly optimistic. Still, as the
biotechnology industry nears its 25th birthday in 2001 _ dating
from the formation of Genentech in 1976 _ it has finally started to
bring to market the promised treasure-trove of drugs. Biotechnology
companies now have about 300 drugs in advanced stages in clinical
trials, according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest approaches now, for instance, is monoclonal
antibodies, which are proteins that can zero in on a
disease-causing agent and neutralize it. These were first developed
in the 1970s, but only in the last few years have companies
succeeded in making effective drugs from them, such as Reopro from
Centocor, which fights blood clotting, and Herceptin from
Genentech, for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, many other antibodies are expected to
reach the market, including one from Genentech for asthma and
allergies. Imclone Systems is working on one for head and neck
cancers. IDEC Pharmaceuticals and Coulter Pharmaceutical are each
hoping to sell the first antibodies linked to radioactive isotopes,
which would allow radiation to be directed specifically to tumors,
with less harm to healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs besides antibodies, of course, will continue to be
developed. One that is expected to be approved soon is Visudyne
from QLT Phototherapeutics, which would be the first drug for
age-related macular degeneration, a deterioration of the retina
that is the leading cause of near blindness in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest opportunities and challenges are expected to
come from genomics, the study of the human genetic code. The Human
Genome Project, sponsored by the federal government, is expected to
finish the ``rough draft'' of the genome by spring and to be
completed in 2003. Private efforts by such companies as Celera
Genomics and Incyte Pharmaceuticals are also racing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The full sequence consists of about 3 billion chemical bases,
amid which are 100,000 or more genes that code for the production
of particular proteins, which actually carry out functions in the
body. But unless scientists can determine the functions of the
genes and proteins and how they work together, the sequence alone
is just an enormous overload of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the gene sequence in many ways tells you where to
start looking, but not much more,'' said James Gower, president and
chief executive of Rigel Inc., a South San Francisco start-up
involved in what many consider the new thing _ functional genomics,
which figures out the functions of genes.
</P>
<P>
   A related discipline that could see growth in the next few years
is so-called proteomics, which is the study of proteins. And, since
the human mind alone cannot keep track of billions of bases and
thousands of genes, companies are springing up in the new field of
bio-informatics, the melding of computer science and life science.
</P>
<P>
   As the mechanisms of the body are better discovered,
biotechnology companies will be better able to develop drugs based
on knowledge of how the body functions than by trying random
chemicals to see what works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole drug-discovery business is now a biology-based
business and not a chemistry-based business,'' said Richard van den
Broek, biotechnology analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, an investment
bank. ``It's been a chemical business for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress should be made on diseases for which there is little
understanding or treatment, including neurological diseases like
Alzheimer's and autoimmune diseases like lupus.
</P>
<P>
   William Haseltine, chairman and chief executive of Human Genome
Sciences Inc. in Rockville, Md., said genes and growth factors are
already starting to be used to grow new blood vessels and, in the
more distant future, it will be possible to grow entire new organs.
</P>
<P>
   One approach to trying to determine gene function is to learn
which genes are turned on in different types of cells, such as
those turned on in cancer cells compared with normal cells. This
has opened up opportunities for companies selling tiny chips that
can quickly analyze thousands of genes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, companies are now racing to figure out genetic
differences among people. Differences of a single base _ known as a
single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP (pronounced ``snip'') _ can
determine eye color or make the difference between health and
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Such information could lead to personalized and preventive
medicine. People found to be susceptible to a disease might take a
regimen of pills or change their diet to prevent it. And medicines
will be tailored to each individual, a discipline called
pharmacogenomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snips will make a quantum leap toward patient-specific
medicine,'' said G. Steven Burrill, chief executive of Burrill &AMP;
Co., a San Francisco merchant bank that specializes in
biotechnology.

<P>
   A precursor is Herceptin, the Genentech drug for breast cancer.
It works in only 25 percent to 30 percent of cases, those in which
the breast tumors produce unusually large amounts of a protein
known as Her2. Patients are tested beforehand to see if they
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium plans to introduce a genetic test next year that will
predict whether melanoma, a skin cancer, will spread through the
body. Patients whose tumors will not spread might be spared
chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Personalized medicine will change the economics of the business,
with fewer blockbuster drugs. ``There will be a lot of
fragmentation in the market,'' said Jeffrey Casdin, chief executive
of Casdin Capital Partners, a biotech investment fund. He said,
however, that since personalized drugs would be more effective and
would have fewer side effects than mass market drugs, they would
fetch higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic profiling of patients raises privacy issues. Should, for
instance, a person's susceptibility to a disease be used by
insurance companies to raise premiums or by employers in hiring
decisions?
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of the ethical and political issues likely to
confront the biotechnology industry in the next decade. A huge
backlash has already developed against bioengineered crops. There
are controversies over cloning and the use of stem cells _ the
progenitors of all other cells in the body _ that can come from
aborted fetuses or from embryos made in fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another issue could be a budding backlash against rising
drug prices, which are commanding an ever growing percentage of
total health care spending. Some drugs offered by biotechnology
companes can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year, though
companies argue that drugs can save money overall by reducing the
need for operations and hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the biotechnology industry enters the new century
in modest shape. A severe shortage of financing that plagued the
industry a year ago has abated somewhat, but the industry seems to
be stratifying into haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   An index maintained by Burrill &AMP; Co. of stocks of the biggest
biotechnology companies, like Amgen and Biogen, the ones with
profits and products, has risen more than 120 percent this year.
Burrill found that midsize companies, many with products on the
horizon, rose more than 70 percent, but stocks of the smallest
companies, many in early stages of development, rose, by
comparison, only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies are still having trouble raising venture
capital or going public. With a biotechnology company typically
taking 10 years to show a profit, Internet companies seem like more
attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   A long-predicted consolidation _ through mergers and, in some
cases, bankruptcies _ seemed to begin in earnest in 1999, and that
is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still dealing with an industry that has too much
capacity,'' said Peter Drake, managing director of Prudential
Vector Healthcare Group. There are an estimated 300 publicly traded
biotechnology companies and about 1,000 private ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the acquisitions of biotech companies in 1999 were made
by big drug companies. Johnson &AMP; Johnson bought Centocor; Merck
bought Sibia Neurosciences, and Warner-Lambert acquired Agouron
Pharmaceuticals. The drug companies need new products to continue
growth and replace products with expiring patents. And tapping into
the technology of biotechnology companies looks like one good way
to get them.

ASIA WATCHERS NOW LOOKING AT ECONOMIES OF U.S. AND JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Southeast Asia's battered economies have bounced
back this year, and the most serious concern in the year 2000,
economists say, will not be the region's enduring banking mess but
the possibility that things could unexpectedly turn ugly in the
United States or Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for exports _ together with high personal savings, low
interest rates and government deficit spending _ have restored
stable economic growth to the region. To be sure, many of the
politically painful prescriptions of the International Monetary
Fund and other foreign diagnosticians have been rejected, leaving
the region's financial system nearly paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the region's growth continues, economists say, depends
largely on whether Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
System, can continue to steer the American economy in for a soft
landing and whether the Japanese government can preserve its own
flickering economic recovery. The answer to both questions, most
economists predict, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to tell a negative story,'' said David
Fernandez, an economist at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   This happy ending to Asia's financial crisis may confound those
expecting a clear-cut victory of free markets over crony
capitalism, but, it appears, good things can happen to bad
economies, if they are small, developing and populated by savers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tale being told in hindsight: A tsunami of foreign
loans and investment set the stage for the 1997-98 financial
crisis, swamping a region that had yet to develop the legal and
regulatory framework needed to ensure that the money was spent
wisely. The wave of funds lifted the region's manufacturing
capacity to excess, spilled over into speculative real estate bets
and left companies swimming in debt.
</P>
<P>
   When anxious investors pulled the plug in Thailand in mid-1997,
local currencies plunged, and all those overseas loans became too
expensive for companies or even countries to pay. The IMF came to
the rescue and, seeing a Latin America-style situation of
overheated economies and out-of-control debt, told the victims to
raise interest rates and rein in spending.
</P>
<P>
   What the IMF appears to have overlooked was that, unlike Latin
Americans, Asians are big savers. So are their governments.
Surpluses are common. With austerity, currencies stopped falling,
but as interest rates spiraled upward, so did deposit rates and
loan payments. Savers saved, debtors defaulted, and banks went
under even faster than before.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing course, governments began pushing interest rates down
and spending themselves into deficits. With scant demand for loans,
banks invested their depositors' money in stocks, fueling a rally
that helped take pressure off debtors by raising the value of their
assets. Meanwhile, heavy demand for Asian exports, especially
electronics, kept money flowing in.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results: current account surpluses, rising credit
ratings, and economies that are expected to grow 5 percent on
average in 2000, and 5 percent to 6 percent in 2001. ``It's a
natural bounce,'' said William Belchere, head of fixed-income
research at Merrill Lynch. Even Indonesia is emerging from
recession, though only just, with a new government lending the kind
of stability that could lure back foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   With exports playing such an important role, however, much
depends on what happens outside the region. ``If there's a
recession in the U.S., all bets are off for Southeast Asia,'' Manu
Bhaskaran, economist with SG Securities, told the World Economic
Forum here in October.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Japan's feeble recovery depends too heavily on
government spending, posing another threat to Asian exports. ``At
some point, sooner rather than later, the Japanese government will
have to rein in expenditure,'' Kenneth Pinkes, chief credit officer
at Moody's Investors Service, told the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Exports are only a stopgap, however. Ultimately, economists say,
Southeast Asia will need to rely on its own consumers to drive
growth. While households have survived the crisis in much better
shape than companies, and private spending appears to be reviving,
consumers will be reluctant to spend more until they are more
confident that their lot has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way, investors and economists say, is the mire
of bad debts preventing Asia's banks from lending to growing
companies. While the crisis rendered many debtors unable to pay,
the biggest obstacles now, economists say, are ``strategic'' loan
defaults. Borrowers have the money but withhold payment to squeeze
a deal from their bankers. Weak bankruptcy laws and old-boy
networks shelter big, politically powerful debtors.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, 45 percent of all loans by Thai banks are still
nonperforming. Although the number is falling, the central bank is
concerned that banks are reducing their bad-loan portfolios largely
by agreeing to defer payments and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, government efforts to revive the banking sector
have foundered over a political corruption scandal involving
efforts to refinance one ailing commercial bank. In the meantime,
not only are billions of dollars in interbank claims frozen, so is
at least $38 billion in assets the government needs to sell to pay
for its bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and foreign investors complain they have seen little
constructive change at all in Malaysia's financial system, which
fended off the IMF and pressure for change by locking in its
exchange rate and putting controls on the withdrawal of capital,
then riding along with the region's recovery. The economy is
growing, but investors are still leery of a country that seems
determined not to join the increasingly free-flowing global market
for capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing enough reform,'' said J. Mark Mobius,
president of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund. ``We'd like to see
investors, particularly foreign investors, treated more fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some economists contend that such complaints are typical of
foreign investors eager to snatch up assets on the cheap, as well
as of free-market absolutists who want to see wholesale change in
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, restructuring means seeing lots of bodies
in the streets, and that's just not part of the social contract in
these places,'' said Fernandez at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   It is not fair to say that Asia is not changing, such economists
say. The crisis set into motion an inexorable process of change
that has already brought the end of a 34-year-old regime in
Indonesia and a new constitution in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the advent of the information age will make it
imperative that Asia catch up to address the increasing power of
the small, mobile investor. In Asia, for example, the crisis taught
the dangers of overly relying on banks for dispensing credit and
highlighted the need for a dynamic market for corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Developing one will require overhauling tax structures and
encouraging the growth of derivatives, economists say, not to
mention increasing transparency in corporate dealings. So far, Asia
has been able to finance its recovery domestically, but foreign
investors warn that in the Internet age, even domestic capital can
emigrate at the push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Economists predict that greed will quickly wear down foreign
investors' truculence. The region still offers the best possible
returns, they say, change or no change. Overseas capital will be
back, they say, and Southeast Asia's tiger economies will burn, not
as brightly as before the crisis, but brightly nonetheless.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If families continue to sit down together for dinner in the 21st
century, they should be able to enjoy their meals with fewer
interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of unsolicited phone calls from sales people and
stockbrokers pitching everything from stock tips to credit card
insurance should ebb as financial services companies develop more
sophisticated ways of selling their products and services, industry
executives and consultants say. They see the dreaded ``cold call''
being replaced with the new industry buzzword, the ``cross sell''
of services to people who are already customers of another business
of a company.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the historic changes made by Congress this year
in laws that separated commercial banks, investment banks and
insurance companies, a wave of consolidation is expected among
financial services companies, creating more conglomerates like
Citigroup, the first company in the United States to combine an
insurer with a commercial bank, an investment bank and a securities
brokerage firm, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If history and the experiences in other countries are a guide,
the structural changes that will follow will be of great
significance,'' said Jerome Kenney, an executive vice president who
plots corporate strategy for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Our own internal
forecast is, if you go out five years, there will be very few
independent securities firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the biggest firms on Wall Street, like Merrill, Goldman
Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., will be able to
avoid being gobbled up by commercial banks and insurance companies,
industry analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   Most small and midsize brokerage firms, especially
Internet-based trading firms that are competing on price, will be
acquired or will fail, said James Punishill, an online financial
services analyst at Forrester Research in Boston. Electronic
trading with low commissions will remain commonplace, as it has
become in the last several years, but it will not be profitable
enough to sustain a big business, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new conglomerates that will form are expected to compete
with Citigroup will look more like what Europeans call
``universal'' banks, companies such as Deutsche Bank of Germany or
UBS of Switzerland, for example. They will provide the full
spectrum of financial products and services under one roof, or in
the case of Citigroup, under one red umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But once companies pay huge sums to acquire the heft needed to
remain competitive in a global market, they will face the challenge
of making those acquisitions pay off by selling more products and
more types of products to their growing lists of customers, and
they will do so in a market that is being redefined by the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the track record of cross-selling financial services is
spotty, at best, and the growth of the Internet adds to the
challenge, as new competitors spring up all over the World Wide
Web, offering bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some are well-disguised units of traditional players, like
Wingspanbank.com, an online bank created by the Bank One Corp. Bank
One's management has taken pains to hide the connection, hoping to
lure customers with higher rates on certificates of deposit without
cannibalizing the bank's existing business. That strategy is not a
proven winner yet, but online banking is just starting to catch on
and analysts expect its use to increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread acceptance of the Internet as a medium for
researching and shopping for financial services has complicated
efforts to cross-sell. Consumers no longer need to rely on banks
and brokers for information about financial services and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have succeeded at cross-selling different
types of insurance by offering package deals, like selling auto
insurance at attractive rates to customers who also buy a
homeowner's policy. Citigroup and Merrill also claim to have had
success in selling home loans to customers of their brokerage
units. But, overall, there is no convincing evidence that people
want to keep all their assets in one place or to buy a wide variety
of financial products from a single source.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these big deals will fail ultimately because they're
not generating the top-line growth,'' said Peter Davis, a financial
services consultant with Cambridge Group in Manhattan. ``They have
to start cross-selling, and that cross-selling has to occur around
an understanding of their customers. Cold calls and statement
stuffers won't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   For examples, Davis pointed to the comparative records of banks
that are the products of one or more mergers and those that are
not. Both types of banks, he said, sell about 2.1 products, like
certificates of deposit, per customer. ``There really is no
difference in performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a merged organization cuts out overlapping costs, the only
way to make a merger pay off is to increase revenue. So inevitably
conglomerates will seek to do so by trying to get their customers
to buy more from them or invest more with them.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that consumers have easy access to lots of
information _ some would say, too much _ about purveyors of
financial services, their prices and offerings. In the future, they
will be more likely to shop around, mostly online, and will be less
susceptible to unsolicited sales pitches of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is already adapting to the new times. Merrill Lynch;
Salomon Smith Barney; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and other big
brokerage firms are turning their sales forces away from stock
promotion and toward money management. Most firms are concentrating
their sales efforts on omnibus accounts that charge an annual fee
based on an account's assets, instead of on the number of
transactions executed.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the rise of the fee-based brokerage account will
allow the brokers to focus their attention on finding new clients
and providing them with advice about how to meet their financial
goals. The switch should also make the earnings of brokerage firms
more predictable and make their stocks' more attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional broker, we think, is a thing of the past,''
said Ruediger Adolf, senior vice president at the American Express
Co. ``The way you can add value, in our belief, is through
understanding the goals of an individual customer in a holistic way
and developing strategies of how they can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express and other financial services companies have
accepted that a significant number of investors, not just young
people with relatively few assets, want to handle at least some of
their financial dealings themselves. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley
and others have introduced online trading services, with
commissions as low as $29.95, to appeal to those people.
</P>
<P>
   That is the same basic price that Charles Schwab &UR;  &LR; charges, but
considerably higher than ETrade's low rate of $9.95. American
Express undercut them all when it recently started offering free
stock trades to customers with big account balances.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see those moves as an acknowledgment that the execution
of stock trades, once a core offering on Wall Street, is fast
becoming a commodity. In essence, brokerage firms are saying, ``Let
us manage your money for a fee, and we'll throw in the stock and
bond trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research predicts that after the price war that is
raging among dozens of online brokerage firms, about 75 percent of
them will either be acquired or fail within five years. Now that
the most aggressive traders have migrated to the Internet, online
brokerage firms are all expected to suffer a significant decline in
growth, although overall growth of online financial services will
accelerate, Forrester predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says the execution of simple stock trades is just one of
many financial services that can be carried out electronically and
yield only slim profits; others are basic term life insurance and
the brokering of standard home mortgages. Consequently, he said,
the livelihoods of thousands of people who now sell those services
are threatened by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most existing players in personal financial services won't be
successful online,'' Davis said, citing their expensive networks of
offices and salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms have taken to the Internet largely as a
defensive measure. They found they were losing too much of their
customers' money to firms that offered electronic trading, such as
Charles Schwab, Etrade and Fidelity Investments. John L. Steffens,
a Merrill Lynch vice chairman, told Merrill brokers recently that
customers had moved $9 billion to eight leading online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing becomes choice,'' Kenney, of Merrill, said.
``What had heretofore been a bundled product until Schwab came
along is going to be unbundled and offered in multiple forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said that wealthy people would continue to demand the
personal attention of an adviser, or team of advisers, but they
would expect many transactions, such as the paying of monthly
bills, to be handled automatically. In exchange for a fee that
amounts to a slim percentage of the assets they keep at the firm,
they will expect sound advice and guidance delivered
electronically, over the telephone and, occasionally, in person, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers will purchase one or more of the firm's services
a la carte, paying only for research on certain industries or
advice on how to allocate their assets. But firms will offer the
best value to people who keep at least $100,000 in a fee-based
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the cutoff everybody is using, and they're not raising
the amount,'' Kenney said. ``Five years from now, it's still going
to be $100,000. For a middle-class income plus some assets, there's
going to be an extraordinary amount of services available from the
best firms for a reasonable amount.''

PATENTS CONSIDERED VITAL TO THRIVE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How important will intellectual property be in the new economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Excruciatingly important,'' said Glover Ferguson, co-director
of the electronic commerce program at Anderson Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the victory that the online bookseller
Amazon.com scored earlier this month when it obtained a preliminary
injunction against Barnesandnoble.com. The injunction prevents
Barnes &AMP; Noble from using the one-click system patented by Amazon
that enables repeat online customers to place orders without having
to re-enter mailing and credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to put some real boulders in the way of the
Barnes &AMP; Noble check-out line system,'' said Kevin Rivette,
co-author of ``Rembrandts in the Attic,'' a new book from the
Harvard Business Press that proselytizes on the power of patents.
``The lawsuit also has put everyone else on the Net on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hanchuk, a partner at the New York law firm of Morgan &AMP;
Finnegan, concurred, saying the ruling ``clearly highlights the
importance of intellectual property in all technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual property, in Rivette's view, is what is going to
separate many winners and losers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's easy to put up a Web site, when it's easy to get
financial backing, this is where some of the shake-out is going to
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention so far has been paid to the new wave of so-called
business-method patents on the Internet. But Mark Lemley, a
professor of law at the University of Texas, points out that the
scope of what can be patented is growing every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a patent on a method for holding a golf putter,''
Lemley said. ``There's a patent on allocating assets in a divorce
settlement. This is a great expansion of patentable subject matter
beyond what has traditionally been the technological arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivette, who is chief executive of Aurigin Systems, a
patent-strategy consulting company, predicted that ``one of the
biggest things that will occur in the next three to five years is
the proliferation of well-funded patent `factories.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rivette said he had heard of about half a dozen such enterprises
modeled along the lines of Walker Digital, the controversial _ and
extremely successful _ patent-incubation venture that gave birth to
Priceline.com. The Priceline.com business is based on a patented
method for letting prospective customers propose a price for a
product or service, with the online order being filled if the
seller is willing to sell at that price. The patent is one of 30
received by Walker Digital, which has another 300 patent
applications pending.
</P>
<P>
   Like Walker Digital, which kept a very low profile until it
started Priceline.com, these ventures are stealthily amassing
patent empires that will become apparent only when they are ready
to start businesses, Rivette said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivette predicts that the high mortality rate of Internet
businesses will create new opportunities for patent expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be just like what happened in the biotech community in
the 1980s,'' he said. ``There's going to be opportunity to buy
property rights and turn around and sell them to market leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hanchuk, the patent lawyer, expects this sorting-out period
to be tumultuous. As patent portfolios fatten and as e-commerce
continues its explosive growth, he said, ``we will inevitably see a
significant increase in patent litigation involving e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   And the suits may not come only from competitors. Companies that
fail to protect their innovations may face lawsuits from
shareholders, warns Charles Eldering, president of Telecom Partners
Ltd., a company based in New Britain, Pa., that develops strategic
patent portfolios for telecommunications and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rivette and others predict that within a few years many
companies will have the equivalent of a vice president for
intellectual property _ not a lawyer who shepherds applications
through the patent office, but rather an MBA who thinks
strategically about intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see a chief patent strategist or the equivalent in most
corporations in the next three years,'' Rivette said.
``Intellectual property touches too much of the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet already has become home to a number of online
intellectual property bazaars _ sites where companies can swap
technology through licensing deals or sell off trademarks, patents
or copyrights that the owner does not need but that another company
might find valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Among these new sites are www.yet2.com, which uses technology
developed by Rivette's Aurigin Systems;  &UR;  &LR; www.pl-x.com, which
specializes in technologies developed by universities, and
IPnetwork.com, which is weighted toward trademarks and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will bring in lots of new players,'' said Christine Hearst
Schwarzman, the president of IPnetwork. ``I have hundreds and
hundreds of companies from places in the world that are chronically
underrepresented areas of the licensing world.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will patents themselves look like in the future?
Ferguson of Anderson Consulting predicts that _ instead of
consisting of text and drawings as they have for more than two
centuries _ patents are likely to become mixed-media affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting into things that are darn difficult to explain
in prose,'' Ferguson said. ``Imagine the most graphical interface
possible,'' he said, referring to computer screens on which users
interact with images instead of issuing verbal commands. ``It's
almost impossible to describe it in text. But as soon as you see
the thing, you say, `Oh, I get it.' There may be a gap in the way
we have chosen to memorialize inventions.''

INTERNET MAY PRECIPITATE TEMPEST FOR TRADITIONAL BRANDS AND
ADVERTISING

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shakespeare's exclamation ``O, brave new world'' is an
appropriate way to begin an examination of what advertising will be
like when years no longer begin with 19. It is even more
appropriate that those words are from ``The Tempest'' because the
changes facing Madison Avenue in the next decade will be nothing if
not tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason is, of course, the sudden emergence of
interactive communications as a significant way to sell goods and
services. The Internet is a transforming technology; between it and
the frenetic pace of the digital revolution, advertising will never
be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet becomes part of the fabric of our existence,
the ad dollars are going to follow the consumers,'' said Kevin
O'Connor, chief executive at DoubleClick in New York, the
interactive advertising network. ``And consumers will be on the
Internet for everything: communications, transactions, getting
one-to-one broadcasts of interactive TV, reading classified
advertising, even voting online.''
</P>
<P>
   His forecast was echoed by Kyle Shannon, chief creative officer
at Agency.com in New York, an interactive shop whose clients
include Bank of America, Compaq Computer, Sprint and Texaco. ``The
Internet won't be just a place you go when you get on the
computer,'' Shannon said. ``It will become like a dial tone, part
of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fundamental shifts that will take place as a result,
Shannon listed: ``immediacy, people will want it right now, 24
hours a day; ubiquity, they will want it wherever they are;
transparency, they will be able to find out anything, and
relevancy, they will want it to relate directly to them, not to a
mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going to change the nature of relationships
between marketers and customers, online and off-line,'' he said.
``You're going to have the opportunity of true one-to-one
marketing; advertising that's segmented, accountable, increasingly
sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Patrick Keane, senior analyst and director for
online advertising strategies at Jupiter Communications in New
York, the consulting company, predicted a day when ``advertisers
will be able to buy consumers by targeted profiles, saying, `I want
Cadillac-driving golfers who like to knit.''' The consumer, in
turn, will be able to click on the ad and buy, say, an expensive
golf sweater or a kit to knit golf club covers.
</P>
<P>
   To make that happen, advertisers will require ``a persistent
Internet connection in the home that's on all the time, like your
electricity,'' Keane said, ``as opposed to what we have now, when
people find it a pain to fire up the PC and dial into the modem.''
But that should not be a problem, he added, as interactive
technology continues to advance. In fact, Jupiter predicts that
online ad spending will nearly quadruple to $11.5 billion for the
year 2003 from $3.2 billion this year and $4.7 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   What will this mean for advertising?
</P>
<P>
   ``What advertising accomplished in the 20th century was to
create equity for brands,'' said G.M. O'Connell, chairman and chief
executive at Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Norwalk, Conn., an
interactive agency that works for marketers including American
Express, Citigroup and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 21st century, what companies do on the Internet _ how
they communicate, do business, serve customers _ will drive more
equity into brands, but in a completely different way,'' he added.
``Advertising on the Internet is not going to work the way
advertising on TV works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV advertising lets you get close to a brand by laughing,
crying, feeling emotion,'' O'Connell said. ``Internet advertising
lets you get close to a brand by understanding how it serves you:
helping you plan a vacation, make dinner, get the kids off to
school on time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch TV; we read print; we use the Internet,'' he added.
``So if advertising isn't useful, it won't work for the consumer _
or the advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   That, clearly, will have profound implications. ``The Internet
will inevitably, in the long term, slow the growth of ad spending
in all traditional media,'' said Chris Charron, research director
at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``But as interactive TV
takes hold, the distinction between interactive advertising and
traditional broadcast TV advertising will be obliterated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive TV will, in a sense, be the savior of broadcast
advertising,'' he added, ``because now a lot of money goes into
broadcast with no real ability to generate or gauge response. In
the future, we'll combine the advantages of broadcast advertising,
the richness, the entertainment values, with the opportunities for
direct selling, direct commerce, you get with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The agencies that grow, Charron said, will be those ``that
provide solutions for advertisers across different media, that
collect data across different media, that take a much more
integrated view of marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fastest-growing category for most types of
traditional media like television, radio, print and outdoor is ad
spending by the dot-coms and other online marketers. According to
Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks ad spending, dot-com
spending in off-line media soared to $546.2 million in 1998 from
$278.7 million in 1997. The Myers Report, a media newsletter,
estimated the 1999 total will be at least $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There are no estimates for 2000 or beyond, but in one field at
least spending will be higher next year. Dot-coms are buying
commercial time on Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan. 30, 2000, for an
estimated average of $2.1 million to $2.2 million for each
30-second spot, with some spots selling for as much as $3 million.
That compares with about $1.6 million for a 30-second commercial
during the Super Bowl in 1999, $1.3 million in 1998 and $1.2
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the influx of dot-com dollars, the head of one of the
world's largest agencies agreed with Charron that agencies must
change. ``We will have to transform our organizations,'' said Keith
Reinhard, chairman and chief executive at the DDB Worldwide
Communications Group in New York, the unit of the Omnicom Group
that works for marketers as varied as Anheuser-Busch, Clorox,
McDonald's and Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to understand brands so well that we're not only
building new brands and restoring and refreshing existing brands,''
Reinhard said, ``but creating brands and licensing them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we will be advising clients on every aspect of brand
strategy,'' he added, assuming tasks now performed by consultants.
As the media now considered old and new, like television and
personal computers, come together in what is known as convergence,
agencies will become content providers, Reinhard said, reclaiming a
role they played from the 1930s through the 1950s, first in
national network radio and then in TV's early days.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we're going to be in the content business, I would not
be surprised if a big ad agency merged with a big entertainment
company,'' he added. ``The convergence we should be thinking of is
the convergence of entertainment, information and interactive
one-on-one selling as inter-tainment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Does ``That's Inter-tainment'' have the same ring as ``That's
Entertainment''? It's one more question to be answered as the new
millennium unfolds.

TELEPORTATION, POLYGRAPH IMPLANTS AND OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Ill., Md., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asked for proposals to improve the human condition in the next
century, people were generous with their ideas. Many visions fell
into broad categories like health, nutrition, education and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals, including those of Times editors who could not resist
the challenge, ranged from cures for all ailments and correction of
genetic flaws to eternal youth and immortality. There were
suggestions for a morning-after pill for undisciplined eaters;
cheap, nonpolluting energy; suburban mailboxes with solar-powered
interior lights; self-erasing blackboards; and a universal
operating system for all computers.
</P>
<P>
   And on a shrinking but linguistically diverse planet, more than
one reader suggested devices to provide instant translations.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers will surely applaud the idea of a ``hold time''
detector, a device to inform a telephone caller of the projected
wait until a real human being answers. And what about homes (with
absolutely silent air-conditioners) where uncomplaining robots
would clean, cook, do the laundry and get rid of the trash? And
would the electorate vote for a polygraph chip to be implanted in
all public officials, political candidates, industrial leaders and
others as needed?
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, many people want more time. Some would settle for an
extra day to be squeezed between Sunday and Monday to deal with the
weekend's unfinished chores. But real visionaries, like Dean Kross
of Pittsburgh, go all out for expanding time by slowing the earth's
rotation, thus lengthening each day by an hour or two.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Soloway of Geneva, Ill., foresees a sensor cuff, like a
blood pressure monitor, that will help her diet. Just as she is
doing well on tofu and cottage cheese, in comes an invitation to
dinner. On goes her cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine: I've been rehearsing an order of spaghetti with just
a bit of olive oil, but my mouth is beginning to form `ravioli with
three cheeses,''' she writes. ``At that moment, the cuff, which is
already measuring my guilt-induced blood pressure, is also gauging
the rising output of my salivary glands. Both mounting measures
cause the sensor in the cuff to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have choices here. Barbaric: a slight shock similar to the
invisible fence some poor doggies contend with. Inspirational: a
voice _ I'll choose Bette Midler's _ singing out: `You can do it,
girl. Resist!' Visual: On the tiny built-in video display, up pop
`Before' and `After' photos linked to my pending food selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for my device to really work, it must produce immediate
rewards. Since we're being asked to be truly creative, here's my
wish: Just as soon as I nix the ravioli and cheese dish and opt
instead for the lighter version, my clothing size slides down one
number. At the same time, on the spot, one facial wrinkle
disappears. Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the workplace, Gil Gordon, of Monmouth Junction,
N.J., said he would like to sneak into the bedrooms of the 1,000
top chief executives one night and implant a ``get a life'' chip
into their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chip would cause them to walk around their offices at 6
every night and ask people at their desks, `Why are you still
here?''' Gordon writes. ```Why couldn't you get your work done
earlier and be out of here by now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have slipped into a work culture where long hours are
rewarded _ often independent of any assessment of incremental value
added. It's time to stop rewarding desk time and face time and
start rewarding improved effectiveness and smarter work habits,
and, in the process, help today's overworked employees start to
regain some time for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pennacchia of Manhattan asks: ``How about the universal
chip card? It's one card that, through a chip or some advanced
technology, serves as a driver's license, credit card, bank card,
employee ID, gym membership, phone card, debit card, key card,
etc., and eliminates the waste, bulk and confusion of having so
many cards.''
</P>
<P>
   For those tired of losing umbrellas, Marc Wallace of Manhattan
proposes a force field, like an invisible bubble, that will repel
precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   And Bonnie Hilton of Chicago would dearly like to read an actual
book _ not something on a computer screen _ while (1) lying down
and (2) without having to hold it. In fact, while doing any sort of
desk work or reading, she would like to rest her neck on a plush
pillow in bed or on the beach without the effort of gripping the
materials. ``Your neck and back get total rest while you are
getting your work done,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of the strains of travel even in the age of supersonic
flight, many people wished for speedier trips _ teleportation, say.
``I cannot wait until the day that I simply step into a chamber and
am conveniently whisked from that location to any location on earth
that is predetermined and encoded into the machine prior to
departure,'' writes Tachi Taylor of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of such a technology will have tremendous impact
on the future of our world; it would render all forms of
conventional transportation obsolete, not to mention conventional
civic structures, such as freeways and airports. It could result in
significant reductions in pollution, congestion and accidental
death from auto and plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, cannot wait until that day when I never have to
get on a bus, plane, ferry, subway or taxi ever again. What a
wonderful world such an innovation would create!''
</P>
<P>
   But what's the use of such high-speed travel if the baggage is
still stuck in the low-tech era?
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent airline traveler, Julius Westheimer of Baltimore
has no doubt what he wants _ substantial improvement of baggage
claim.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``Despite all the technological advances of this
century _ autos, radios, jet travel, television, men on the moon,
camera on Mars, computers, etc. _ one thing has not changed in over
50 years: the way we mill around like cattle (often tired, hungry
and impatient after a long flight), endlessly awaiting our luggage
and then clumsily grabbing and lifting it as it crawls around the
carousel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an engineer, but there must be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the earthbound, Andy Kaplan of Lawrenceville, N.J., proposes
cars with electronic navigators, all of them networked by
satellite. ``Passengers only have to type in a destination, and the
driving computer will operate the car,'' he writes. ``Because of
the navigational network, every car will know where every other car
is headed. This will reduce or entirely eliminate accidents and
will allow for increased speeds of travel. This hands-free and
nonpersonal driving will eliminate road rage as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the bravest of all the futurists is Dorothy Dworkin of
Lido Beach, N.Y., who says she is submitting her major suggestion
``at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon.'' Finishing up a list
of proposals like banning cell phones in public places, closing
chat rooms, confining e-mail to business and confiscating the
television sets of parents who permit young children to exceed a
watching limit of an hour a day, she says:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on our way to becoming a nation of `e-strangers,'
unable to communicate with one another in a face-to-face manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our own benefit, and the benefit of mankind, I propose a
moratorium on the design of further electronic devices. We need the
time to assess where we are headed and where we want to go as a
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to be a codger, and it might as well be me.''

<P>
   Phonograph records, flypaper, typewriters, windup watches,
carbon paper. They are products that most people of a certain age
grew up with but that have largely vanished, usually with little
notice, from everyday life. Something presumably better has taken
their place.
</P>
<P>
   But while they are forgotten by many, they are not gone.
</P>
<P>
   At least not entirely. These venerable products, though long
past their heyday, live on in tiny niches of the giant U.S.
economy. Indeed, unlike, say, rotary telephones, which linger in
numbers large enough to command special treatment by answering
machines but are no longer placed in service, they are still
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on the eve of the 21st century there are Americans who go
to work each morning to make typewriters _ not, of course, the type
your father used in college but the genuine article nonetheless.
Some of these machines _ descendants of the first practical
typewriters marketed in 1874 by E. Remington &AMP; Sons, a gunsmith in
Ilion, N.Y. _ find their way to technophobes or slaves to habit,
others to consumers who find them irreplaceable for certain tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dominate a shrinking market,'' said Jim Joseph, a spokesman
for Lexmark International, a spinoff in Lexington, Ky., from the
International Business Machines Corp. that is the nation's last
remaining typewriter manufacturer. But while its typewriter
business is so small that it does not even rate a mention in the
annual report, an undisclosed number of customers fork over $695
for its Wheelwriter 1000 for home and classroom use, or $1,845 for
its top-of-the-line Wheelwriter 7000.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, according to Joseph, typewriters were in persistent
demand for addressing envelopes, but the word processor and
computer have now largely usurped this function, leaving multipart
forms _ themselves under technological siege _ one of the few
remaining efficient applications.
</P>
<P>
   But typewriter traditionalists do not need gobs of money as long
as they are content with a foreign make, like the $189.95 portable
made by Olivetti S.p.A., prominently on display just inside
Hammacher Schlemmer's store on East 57th Street in New York and
advertised in its catalog. This one, made in Italy, is billed as an
``updated classic'' boasting automatic paragraph indentation and
other refinements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who wouldn't convert'' to computerized
ways to write, said Simone Williams, a sales clerk.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman, Sabrina Balthazar, said Hammacher sells
dozens of Olivettis each day through its three stores and by
catalog and Web site, &UR;  &LR;  enough demand to justify stocking them
year-round rather than just at Christmas. While some of this year's
sales appear to be related to Year 2000 fears of crashing word
processors, she added, ``We have no plans to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's flypaper,  &UR;  &LR; created by a German baker in 1861 who
grew tired of shooing insects attacking his strudel, and &UR;  &LR; 
sometimes &UR;  &LR; still &UR;  &LR; found on America's patios.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still a common item,'' said Dale Garbutt, a salesman at
Barson Hardware, also in Midtown Manhattan, explaining that today's
electronic bug-zappers are not fully up to the task. ``You'd never
catch a mosquito'' with them, he said, while the traditional,
though unsightly, stuff that results in a lingering death is said
to work on all kinds of winged pests.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Morrello, office manager at the Walco-Linck Co., a
Rockland County, N.Y., packager of flypaper mostly from Korea, said
it still seemed to be popular with people who run horse farms and
waterfront restaurants and that on occasion someone will inquire
about shipping an order to relatives in South America.
</P>
<P>
   As for mechanical watches, they are actually in the midst of a
comeback, even though the Timex Corp., the nation's No. 1 watch
producer, closed its last factory making them, in Waterbury, Conn.,
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau, a
leading retailer of luxury watches, &UR;  &LR;  said sales of mechanical
watches began to pick up in the mid-'80s, largely coinciding with
stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
   The revival also comes in the face of the dispiriting fact that
with few if any exceptions, the cheapest of modern quartz watches
will keep better time than the most expensive of windups.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers clearly have more than exactitude in mind when buying
mechanical watches, however; most are imported from Geneva and
other French-speaking parts of Switzerland and are quite expensive,
with prices starting at several hundred dollars. One David Yurman
mechanical design _ featuring a stainless steel and sterling silver
pave diamond case with diamond bezel and sapphire cabochon crown,
silver dial and diamond markers _ retails for $14,000 at Tourneau.
</P>
<P>
   Another presumed casualty of the age is carbon paper, which
turns out to be as persistent in the market as it is in smearing
clothing or hands. A few thousand tons are still produced for
purposes ranging from business forms _ it is especially valued in
cold climates where its carbonless successor can fail _ to dress
patterns to impressions of teeth, for use in in dental offices.
Frye Tech of Boca Raton, Fla., has absorbed competitors and is now
the biggest maker.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most unlikely of the survivors, perhaps, is the vinyl
phonograph record, which, despite the fact that it requires a
similarly superseded mechanism to play, remains in demand,
especially among disc jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies make them pretty much to sell to the D.J.'s,'' said
Michael Davis, manager of Academy Records &AMP; CD's off lower Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan. ``They like to play vinyl because they
manipulate the turntable'' to pinpoint certain passages. D.J.'s and
others also use the old-fashioned record _ only 33 r.p.m.'s are
thought to be still manufactured _ to create new musical blends,
like acid jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, contended Blake Lindberg, an Academy salesman,
audiophiles often prefer vinyl, still made by companies like Blue
Note Records and Analog Productions, to its audiotape and CD
successors for sheer quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot warmer sound,'' he said. ``It's so much fuller. I
can hear a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, sales of vinyl records peaked more than 20 years ago, at
344 million units in 1977, and will total only an estimated 2.8
million this year, according to the Record Industry Association of
America. Records now account for only one-half of 1 percent of the
market for new music, and a whole generation has grown up having
never even seen one.
</P>
<P>
   This means they will probably have no clue when the quizmaster
asks that standby trivia question from Mom's generation:
</P>
<P>
   How many grooves are there on a record?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: two (one on each side).

BARAK HOPES SYRIA WILL AGREE ON CORE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday
that Israel would seek an initial ``core agreement'' with Syria
when the two sides start intensive talks near Washington on Jan. 3,
fleshing out the details of a full peace treaty later.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting to his government on the resumption of talks with
Syria in Washington last week, Barak said the two sides had
discussed the future ``product'' of their negotiations. An
understanding was reached to work toward a preliminary agreement on
the major points in dispute as a prelude to a final treaty, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the Cabinet that ``there's no point in a brief
document, and no logic in completing hundreds of pages of a full
peace treaty'' in the talks that begin next month, his office said.
``We should strive for a core agreement that will summarize the
main issues,'' it quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview on Saturday night, he suggested that
it should not take months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to walk between a thin, meaningless
one-page document of principles, for which it's not worth risking a
crisis, and a full, detailed peace treaty, which is a document
hundreds of pages long and which can take months to write,'' Barak
told Channel 2 television.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams of Israeli and Syrian negotiators are expected to
meet simultaneously to discuss borders, security arrangements,
water rights, establishment of normal relations and the situation
in southern Lebanon. Guerrillas there, backed by Iran and Syria,
are fighting to oust Israeli troops holding what Israel considers a
buffer zone to prevent cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the Cabinet ministers that he had made no prior
commitment to meet a Syrian demand for a full Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights to lines held before the strategic area was
captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   But in his televised remarks, Barak indicated that he was
building on understandings reached in previous negotiations and
contacts, which Syria asserts included the promise of a full
withdrawal. Israel denies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My government has no prior commitment to the Syrians,'' Barak
said. ``On the other hand, we are not erasing the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited talks with the Syrians at the 1991 Middle East peace
conference in Madrid, negotiations conducted by Prime Ministers
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres from 1993 to 1996, and secret
contacts pursued by Barak's immediate predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations ahead will be tough, and their outcome is far
from certain, Barak warned the Cabinet. ``I have no doubt that just
as the Syrians were bitter rivals in battle, so the thought that
the negotiations will be like margarine is an exaggerated
expectation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns voiced by Palestinian officials that he
might slow down the talks with them as he negotiates with Syria,
Barak told the Cabinet that he had made clear in Washington that he
would ``conduct straightforward negotiations without manipulation
between the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   On television Barak promised, ``We have no intention of playing
one track off the other, of trying to maneuver the Syrian track
against the Palestinian and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Palestinian concerns were heightened when Barak canceled a
meeting Sunday in Jericho with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader. Barak accused the Palestinians of disclosing in advance
what was to have been a secret meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian officials and analysts have expressed fears
that the prime minister will prove unable to withstand domestic
political pressures against making territorial concessions on two
fronts at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that resistance from rightist Jewish nationalists to
a troop withdrawal and removal of Israeli settlements from the
Golan Heights could harden Barak's position on a pullout from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians want to declare a
state.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin moved slowly in talks with the Syrians as he negotiated
controversial accords with the Palestinians and reached a peace
treaty with Jordan. Peres broke off talks with the Syria in
February 1996 after a series of Palestinian suicide bomb attacks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in contrast, asserts that he is ready to pursue parallel
talks with the Syrians and Palestinians with equal vigor. What is
at stake, he says, is no less than an end to a 100-year war and a
breakthrough to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace with our neighbors,'' he told the ministers, ``is the
realization of Zionism.''

Dec. 20 and thereafter. For questions about stories, contact the

<P>
   GREEK-THEATER-BID (Los Angeles) -- In its years of operation,
the Greek Theatre has netted millions of dollars, while the city of
Los Angeles has received nothing because it paid for virtually all
the repairs and maintenance, the Daily News has learned. The
operator, Nederlander Corp.'s reward from City Council: a five-year
extension without going to bid. The deal was approved Dec. 8. That,
despite other firms offering up to $1 million more. By Beth
Barrett. (Will move on the ``n'' California and ``a'' national news
wires.)
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD-SHAMBRA (Los Angeles) -- The former Belmont Learning
Center project manager, Don Shambra, ``failed the children'' by
lording over an uncontrolled, unmonitored and largely unchallenged
fiefdom that rewarded his friends, according to a new Los Angeles
Unified audit. Tuesday's audit by LAUSD chief investigator Don
Mullinax alleges Shambra bears the responsibility for the
scandal-plagued high school and financial mismanagement. ``How did
I fail the children? I wanted to build a school that the
politicians are trying to stop and I'm failing the children?'' he
said. By Beth Barrett. (Will move on the ``n'' California and ``a''
national news wires.)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-PREPARE (Los Angeles) -- If Y2K causes Wall Street meltdowns
and martial law, a San Fernando Valley man named George will be
among the best prepared. But if nothing happens, he will be stuck
with 48 boxes of oatmeal, several 55-gallon drums of water, five
pounds of peanut butter, 12 cans of Spam, six bags of cough drops,
26 rolls of paper towels, a gas-powered generator, 500 pounds of
uncooked pasta, emergency survival bars, batteries, candles and
aspirin. Although George might be the extreme, emergency services
officials and Y2K experts urge people to gather enough provisions
to last about three days, just in case utilities go out. Even if
there is no societal catastrophe from the Year 2000 bug, they'll be
ready for the next crisis. By Phillip W. Browne. (Will move on the

   MOVIES-BOX-OFFICE (Los Angeles) -- ``Stuart Little'' scored at
the nation's multiplexes as the family-oriented comedy led a
moderate weekend with an estimated $15.4 million at 2,878 theaters
during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday. Sony's
opening weekend of ``Stuart,'' based on the classic children's book
about a talking mouse who finds a home with a human family,
performed above expectations in the difficult-to-predict market for
children and their parents. By Dave McNary. (Will move on the ``n''

KEN CLAWSON, 63, NIXON AIDE DURING WATERGATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Mich., Va., Md.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Clawson, one of President Nixon's staunch defenders as
director of White House communications during the Watergate era,
died on Friday at a hospital in New Orleans. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Clawson suffered a heart attack, his wife, Carol, said. He had
been in poor health since a stroke in 1975, the year after he left
the White House, and had lived in New Orleans in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A former newspaper reporter, Clawson joined the White House in
February 1972 as deputy director of communications for the
executive branch. He became White House communications director on
Jan. 30, 1974, as the Watergate scandals were consuming the Nixon
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just one of Richard Nixon's spear carriers,'' he said in a
February 1974 interview, ``and proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clawson could be partisan and pugnacious, especially in dealing
with journalists. In 1973, he told three reporters at a dinner in
San Clemente, Calif., that he would get them in trouble with their
editors if they wrote inaccurate stories. Be careful, he warned
them: ``I only take on the fights that I'm sure I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had a more cheerful side. Several afternoons a week, he
convened small gatherings of government officials and reporters,
not all of them deemed friendly to the administration. Drinks were
accompanied by napkins labeled ``Cocktails with Clawson,'' and the
sessions quickly took on that title.
</P>
<P>
   Clawson's name was associated with the notorious ``Canuck
letter'' that was sent to The Manchester Union-Leader in New
Hampshire early in 1972 and claimed that Democratic Sen. Edmund
Muskie of Maine had spoken disparagingly of French-Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Americans of French-Canadian ancestry are a big voting bloc in
New Hampshire, and a furious Muskie denounced the letter in a
tirade outside the newspaper building. Many political analysts
thought the temper display helped to derail his quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was of doubtful origin. A Washington Post reporter
later wrote that Clawson had bragged to her about being its author,
but Clawson subsequently denied writing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Clawson was born to a working-class family in Monroe, Mich.,
on Aug. 16, 1936. He attended the University of Michigan, became
advertising manager for his hometown newspaper, then became labor
reporter for The Toledo Blade in Ohio in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   His labor reporting won him a Nieman Fellowship to study at
Harvard in 1966, then a job on The Washington Post, where he
covered the Justice Department before joining the White House. He
left the White House in November 1974, three months after Nixon
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Clawson is survived by his wife, who is director of corporate
communications for Entergy, a global energy corporation based in
New Orleans; his mother, Lilaf Clawson of Monroe; a sister, Ann
Smith of Jackson, Mich.; two sons, Ken David II of Berryville, Va.,
and Geoffrey of McLean, Va.; a daughter, Karen Kelchak of
Cumberland, Md., and six grandchildren.

MANNING'S TURNAROUND AGAINST REDSKINS SYMBOLIZES COLTS THIS
SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It had been a rough Sunday afternoon for
quarterback Peyton Manning. He was taking some good shots to the
body, and one to the knees, from a suddenly perky Washington
Redskins defense. The man who tosses footballs as if his brain has
radar was uncharacteristically overthrowing his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Then came one of those drives when Manning, the quarterback for
Indianapolis, showed why he could likely play in the next 10 Pro
Bowls. He gathered his composure and his aching body and led the
Colts on a seven-play, 80-yard drive that would be the beginning of
the end for the Redskins. On that drive Manning's first pass was a
dart to his favorite receiver, Marvin Harrison, for 28 yards. His
last was a 1-yard touchdown to tight end Ken Dilger that floated
between three bewildered defenders, making the score 17-13 early in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the Colts' next drive, Manning threw an
11-yard strike to running back Edgerrin James. The Colts later
scored and led by 11. Indianapolis' defense, led by the former
Giants defensive end Chad Bratzke, then took over the game and
stopped a late comeback by the Redskins to ensure the Colts' 24-21
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is, that while it is possible to frustrate Manning,
to slow him, to bludgeon him, no one has found a way to stop him
completely.
</P>
<P>
   If you put Manning's blood under a microscope, those little DNA
strands would probably be in the shape of a football. When a player
is blessed with such natural instincts, he is practically
impossible to lock up for an entire game. The Redskins tried.
Defensive coordinator Mike Nolan reached deep into his bag of
tricks and pulled out Bill Belichick, or at least what Belichick
has done this season with the Jets to hamper Manning.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins used a variety of blitzes to hurry Manning's throws
and mixed up their secondary coverages so that Manning rarely knew
which Redskins player was doing what at the pre-snap read. What no
defensive guru can account for, however, is that desire to win that
Manning has.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it: The reason the Colts captured the A FC
East was Manning. It is no coincidence that this season was the one
in which Manning developed into a premier player and Indianapolis
went from division cellar-dweller to champion. The Colts have won
10 straight games and their nine-game improvement thus far from
last year ties a league record held by the 1929 Giants and the 1963
Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's been a fast turnaround,'' said Manning, who
completed 23 of 37 passes for 298 yards and one interception.
``It's definitely come faster than we expected. We knew we'd be a
better football team this year, but we didn't know we'd be this
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are 12-2 and piling up records the way a New Year's
Eve party host stocks up champagne. The Colts won their first
division title since the strike-shortened 1987 season, and their 12
victories are one shy of the team-record 13 set in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis' division crown is all the more impressive because
it won by far the toughest division in football rather easily after
most prognosticators said the Colts would finish last.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke was with the Giants when they won the NFC East in 1997
but said this one was sweeter because ``no one, I mean no one,
thought we would do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And to be honest, very few people in this locker room ever
imagined this would happen,'' said Bratzke, who is having a Pro
Bowl season with 12 sacks. ``I can't blame people if they picked us
last. But that tells you how much heart this team has.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed late in the game against Washington. After the Colts
took a 24-13 lead with just over five minutes left, the Redskins
started a comeback. Running back Brian Mitchell scored from 6 yards
out and Washington converted the 2-point attempt when quarterback
Brad Johnson (16 of 30 for 237 yards) found wide receiver Michael
Westbrook in the right corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (8-6), which still can win the NFC East, was making
its late-game run without its leading rusher, Stephen Davis, who
seriously injured his ankle late in the second quarter and did not
play the second half. He had run for 70 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   After their touchdown, the Redskins' James Thrash, a backup wide
receiver, tracked down Brett Conway's wobbly onside kick at
Washington's 46-yard line. But the Redskins were not able to take
advantage. On fourth down and 9 at Washington's 47, Johnson threw
to Westbrook on the left sideline, but the ball sailed far over his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was ours to control towards the end, but we just
didn't come up with plays,'' Redskins defensive end Dan Wilkinson
said. ``I am never going to feel good about losing this game
because I felt we were the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson's pass fell incomplete, the Colts began
celebrating on the field, acting as if they had just earned a trip
to the Super Bowl. But excuse them for being giddy.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had just won their first division title in 12 years.
They are entitled to a little leeway.

PORTUGAL LOWERS ITS FLAG, HANDING MACAU TO CHINA

<P>
   MACAU _ With the solemn lowering of one flag and the triumphant
raising of another, China claimed sovereignty over Macau on Monday,
ending 442 years of Portuguese rule and shaking off the last
vestiges of European colonial involvement in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, at the stroke of midnight, had all the pomp and
ritual of another handover ceremony, in nearby Hong Kong two and a
half years ago. But while the British and Chinese leaders conducted
their exercise there with icy formality, the leaders here Monday
seemed much more at ease.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech moments after the handover, President Jiang Zemin of
China praised the smooth transfer. ``The friendship between the two
peoples and the amicable cooperation between the two countries will
develop from a new starting point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also said the successful return of Macau _ following that
of Hong Kong _ demonstrates that China is ``confident and capable''
of an early reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal greeted Jiang warmly on the
dais and chatted amiably with him just before parting. But he
reminded China that Portugal will remain committed to a Macau,
where, he said, ``democracy and freedom are an irreplaceable
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal negotiated guarantees of relative autonomy for Macau
similar to those that Britain won for Hong Kong. But high-flown
discussions of democracy and the rule of law seem less relevant in
this tiny enclave of 430,000 people, where the main business is
gambling and the biggest local concern is curbing Chinese gangs,
whose violent battles have stained the last days of the Portuguese
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In Macau's casinos, a smaller than usual crowd wagered through
the handover without a pause. A young man playing Chinese dominoes
in the casino at the Hotel Lisboa glanced at a clock on the wall
and prayed aloud for good fortune at midnight. He won the next
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's carefully planned day got off to a chaotic start when
the police broke up a gathering of members of the Falun Gong
spiritual movement in front of the Lisboa. The police detained 40
of the group's members as they did their morning exercises,
dragging some away by force. Falun Gong has been outlawed in
mainland China, where the government has condemned it as an evil
cult.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's authorities had warned the group not to protest here. On
Friday, the police detained several Falun Gong members trying to
enter the territory. Monday, the group assembled in a traffic
circle, hoping to confront Jiang, whose motorcade was scheduled to
pass by later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   China may also have been put off by two of the most notable
guests at the ceremony. Christopher Patten, the last governor of
Hong Kong, was there as a guest of the Portuguese, despite being
reviled by Beijing for his strenuous advocacy of democracy in the
years before the Hong Kong handover. Portugal also invited Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, a top leader of newly independent East Timor.
China maintains relations with Indonesia, which invaded East Timor
in 1975 and jailed Gusmao for his pro-independence activities until
earlier this year.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The transfer of sovereignty capped a day laden with symbolism,
as Portugal gently reasserted its legacy in Macau one last time. At
a Mass on Monday morning in the Macau Cathedral, worshipers
presented as an offering a bound copy of the Basic Law, the
constitution negotiated between Portugal and China, which allows
Macau to keep its own government and laws as a special region of
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the offer given to us by the Chinese,'' said Luis
M.F. Sequeira, a Jesuit priest and one of the celebrants of the
Mass. ``It is a challenge for them to uphold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's formal renunciation of control began Monday
afternoon, as senior officials of the colonial administration
gathered in the courtyard of the Government Palace to lower the
Portuguese flag. The governor, Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira, emerged
from the salmon pink building at 5 p.m. to polite applause from a
crowd, mostly Chinese, on the sidewalk outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor took his place next to an honor guard of
police officers and firefighters in dress uniforms, a marching band
struck up the Portuguese anthem and an officer slowly lowered the
old green and red flag from its place on the peaked roof. The
officer folded the flag and presented it to Vieira, who placed it
over his heart and gazed at a coat of arms above the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then turned and strode through the gate, his
expression stoic as he and his wife climbed into a black Mercedes
limousine and were driven away. When the motorcade had gone, the
crowd pushed past a cordon of police officers and spilled gleefully
into the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go in and take a look,'' said one man to his wife, as
they made for the front steps, where a lone guard stood somewhat
nervously behind the glass doors. After a few giddy moments, the
police cleared out the courtyard and the palace stood empty in the
gathering dusk, soft lights illuminating its white columns.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the rituals, the atmosphere on this handover day was
festive, despite brisk weather and blustery winds that forced the
cancellation of evening fireworks. Christmas bells and Chinese
lanterns swung from lampposts in Largo de Senado, the picturesque
brick square in the historic center of Macau. Local people and
visitors milled about, taking pictures to commemorate the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud because China is becoming bigger and more
powerful,'' said Cheong Iom Wang, who arrived here from Cambodia as
a refugee in 1970. Cheong, 37, said he would not miss the departing
Portuguese. ``They've been here for a long time,'' he said. ``Their
time is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Portuguese seemed determined to savor their last day of
occupancy here. Many people traveled from Portugal on package tours
to witness the handover. They strolled through the streets, their
hats and fur coats a contrast to the more casual Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see the end of a long period in our country's
history,'' said Isabel Roque Cunha, who is from Aveiro, in central
Portugal. Mrs. Roque Cunha, 56, said she had never been to Macau,
though she had vivid images from pictures as a child. ``I expected
it to be more grand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such ambivalence at a Buddhist temple in the old
Chinese quarter of Macau, where people turned up to worship on this
auspicious occasion. The temple, dedicated to the Chinese goddess
A-Ma, is where Portuguese seafarers first made landfall in 1557.
Monday, people hung long lines of firecrackers from a pole next to
the entrance and set them off in a cacophonous celebration.

   MINNA, Nigeria _ The sun was setting behind the Niger Queens'
goalkeeper, casting its blinding rays on the dusty soccer field in
this parched corner of West Africa. Then out of a jumble of flying
legs and arms, she emerged from a cloud of dust, charging ahead
with the ball. Spectators roared.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Amina Bala, officially No. 9 on the Niger Queens and
unofficially the team's star forward. At 15, Amina hopes one day to
join the Nigerian women's soccer team _ ``inshallah,'' she said,
God willing. But she is already a pioneer of sorts: a player in
women's soccer, or female football, as it is known in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will score soon,'' said Amina at halftime, when the match
was goalless. As the crowd watched, some sucked on sugar canes that
a man was selling out of a wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian men have long dominated soccer in Africa, and many of
them rank among the highest-paid players in Europe. Soccer is such
an integral part of life that when Lagos, the commercial capital,
was closed to traffic on election day, boys swarmed the streets,
alleys, highways and bridges, turning the city of eight million
into a giant soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the strong showing by the Nigerian women's team in
last summer's World Cup competition in the United States, where it
reached the quarterfinals, girls have long been discouraged in
Nigeria and elsewhere on the continent from taking part in sports.
Soccer in particular _ a sport associated here not with minivans
and a desirable voting group, but with the barefoot poor _ was an
activity from which daughters were kept away.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings against soccer are strongest here in Nigeria's
predominantly Muslim north. The women's national team, the Super
Falcons, came into existence in 1991 and is made up mostly of women
from the Christian south. It was only in 1997 that Niger state,
here in Nigeria's savanna region, gained its own team _ and lost
its first match to the more experienced Jegede Babes of Lagos,
18-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in the north, it is very difficult for parents to let
their daughters come out and play due to the culture of the area,''
said Dalandi Unmar, the soft-spoken coach of the Niger Queens,
before the match in Minna, the state capital. ``They think football
will expose their daughters to immorality.''
</P>
<P>
   The worries expressed most often, Unmar said, are that the sport
requires their daughters to wear revealing shorts or that playing
might injure them _ specifically that it might make them infertile
by harming their wombs.
</P>
<P>
   The coach scouts schools and soccer fields for talent, mostly
daughters of farmers and civil servants, but his job does not end
there. ``Then we have to visit their homes to plead with the
parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the father of one of his stars abruptly forbade her
to play after she went away for a tournament. ``So I went to his
house,'' the coach said. ``But each time, they said he's not
around. He's not around. But I could see he was around. So we lost
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The raised eyebrows are not limited to Muslim players from the
north, however. Promise Nwagboso, 15, a Christian from the south
who was taking part in the tournament here, said her coach had
found her playing on the streets with boys and asked to see her
parents. Her parents consented, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some people tried to discourage me that I was involved in
a man's sport,'' Promise said. ``But I told them that playing
football will not affect my femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Sa'adatu Kolo, the leader of the Female Football
Development Committee of Niger state, has been visiting schools and
villages to calm parents' fears over women's soccer. Mrs. Kolo
played soccer in the late 1970s thanks to an open-minded coach at
her secondary school, and she said she has been in love with the
sport since then.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kolo has become chaperone and mother figure to the Niger
Queens, the one to summon a player who is lingering after a match
to talk to a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents see me, a Muslim woman and mother, and find it
easier to give their daughters to me,'' she said. ``But sometimes,
even me _ I'm not finding it easy because of my religion and
upbringing. Why should I be asking parents for their daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, especially since the publicity surrounding the Super
Falcons' strong performance in the United States, it has become
easier to persuade parents of soccer's potential material benefits.
About 35 new players have come out for the team in recent months.
But the Niger Queens are still finding it hard to attract corporate
or individual sponsors, Mrs. Kolo said. Men have the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how many women of economic substance do we have?'' she
said. ``And how many of them understand the benefits of female
football?''
</P>
<P>
   One woman of unchallenged economic substance was, in fact,
sponsoring the current tournament here. She is Maryam Babangida,
whose husband, Ibrahim, was the military leader of Nigeria from
1985 to 1993 and was the reputed mastermind behind half of
Nigeria's coups _ nicknamed ``Evil Genius'' by the press. He is a
native son of Minna and a resident here again in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Babangida failed to appear at any of the matches last year
during the first Maryam Babangida female football tournament, and
she was a no-show so far this year _ so it remained unclear why she
had chosen to become a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Did she see the benefits of female football? Did any of her own
daughters play? Or was it to acknowledge, with a wink, her
husband's legendary political footwork, which earned him another
enduring nickname: Maradona, after the Argentine soccer star.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the tournament brought teams from all over
the country as well as complaints familiar to most women athletes
in the world. Women's soccer now has 34 teams in the top two
divisions. But male players earn on average between $50 to $70 a
month, plus bonuses for victories. The young women earned only
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get match bonuses of 5,000 naira to be shared
among 20 of us,'' said Bose Adejumo, 20, who played defense for the
Niger Queens, mentioning a sum of about $50.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, girls like Amina, the star forward, whom townsfolk here
had watched playing soccer with boys on the streets for years,
continued to make bold predictions. Would the Nigerian women's team
win the next World Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Amina said, unabashed that her earlier prediction
about scoring had yet to come true.
</P>
<P>
   The match ended with no goals. But the crowd, especially the
young women, seemed riveted to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray we shall win tonight,'' said Salamutu Ali, 19, standing
on the side. ``This is my team.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Ali, from a Muslim family in the north, denied she
played soccer. She softened after a while, leaning back against a
white car, her left hand resting on the trunk. Yes, she played
soccer and one day _ ``by the grace of God'' _ she would do so for
the Super Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The sun's dying rays illuminated the field. The temperature had
cooled abruptly. The sugar cane salesman's wheelbarrow was nearly
empty. Local boys were kicking around a ball.
</P>
<P>
   A boy kicked the ball in Ms. Ali's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play! Play! Play!'' the boy yelled at her.
</P>
<P>
   She sprang toward the ball and with a kick sent it soaring into
the air.

the country as well as complaints familiar to most women athletes
in the world. Women's soccer now has 34 teams in the top two
divisions. But male players earn on average between $50 to $70 a
month, plus bonuses for victories. The young women earned only
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get match bonuses of 5,000 naira to be shared
among 20 of us,'' said Bose Adejumo, 20, who played defense for the
Niger Queens, mentioning a sum of about $50.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, girls like Amina, the star forward, whom townsfolk here
had watched playing soccer with boys on the streets for years,
continued to make bold predictions. Would the Nigerian women's team
win the next World Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Amina said, unabashed that her earlier prediction
about scoring had yet to come true.
</P>
<P>
   The match ended with no goals. But the crowd, especially the
young women, seemed riveted to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray we shall win tonight,'' said Salamutu Ali, 19, standing
on the side. ``This is my team.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Ali, from a Muslim family in the north, denied she
played soccer. She softened after a while, leaning back against a
white car, her left hand resting on the trunk. Yes, she played
soccer and one day _ ``by the grace of God'' _ she would do so for
the Super Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The sun's dying rays illuminated the field. The temperature had
cooled abruptly. The sugar cane salesman's wheelbarrow was nearly
empty. Local boys were kicking around a ball.
</P>
<P>
   A boy kicked the ball in Ms. Ali's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play! Play! Play!'' the boy yelled at her.
</P>
<P>
   She sprang toward the ball and with a kick sent it soaring into
the air.

U.S. PLANNING NEW SYSTEM FOR `FINGERPRINTING' GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In a long-sought move that will help identify guns used in
crimes when only their shell casings are left at a crime scene, the
Clinton administration said Sunday that it was tripling the
ballistics budget for the development of a unified national
database of shell casings and bullets, and that one major handgun
maker had agreed to start providing the federal government with
information when new guns are test-fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is very exciting and has the potential to do for
gun crime what fingerprints have done for forensics,'' Bruce Reed,
the White House domestic policy adviser, said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, to be run by the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, will work toward creating a virtual
fingerprint for newly manufactured handguns by using a computer
analysis of the unique markings a gun leaves on shell casings when
it is fired, another administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun maker that will cooperate with the government is the
U.S. unit of the Austrian company Glock . Paul Januzzo, Glock's
general counsel, said, ``As long as this is aimed at crime control,
not gun control, we will support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the firearms agency gun fingerprints ``will speed up the
gun tracing process incredibly,'' said Januzzo, a former
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   He added that giving the government the information could also
help the firearms industry in a complex set of lawsuits filed
against it by 28 cities and counties as well as by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, and in parallel negotiations
between lawyers for the cities and the gun companies. Reed joined
those negotiations last week on behalf of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The cities have demanded that the firearms manufacturers develop
a serial number that would be harder to obliterate. ``If you have a
system with gun fingerprints, it is better than serial numbers that
can be tampered with,'' Januzzo said. ``It may also do away with
another demand by the people who want to put us out of business,
registration of all gun owners, because you already have the gun
registered.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system relies on the computer analysis of marks made on
shell casings, including those caused by firing pins and those
pressed on the breach face of the casing during an explosion, as
well as another unique signature left when the casing is ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Glock will begin feeding information on all its newly
manufactured 9 mm handguns into a machine provided by the firearms
agency that was developed by Forensic Technology Inc. of Montreal.
Eventually, Reed said, he hoped that the the firearms bureau would
get test-fire information not just from Glock but also from other
leading manufacturers, including Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt's
Manufacturing Co., which are now monitoring the pilot project in
cooperation with the government and Glock.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has another important effect: it will put an end
to a long-running feud between the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and the FBI, which had developed two competing,
noncompatible technologies to obtain ballistic information on guns,
bullets and shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   The system, to be known as the National Integrated Ballistics
Information Network, was developed by representatives of the two
federal agencies and the Boston Police Department. Police officials
in Boston had found that to obtain complete ballistics information,
they had to spend money to acquire technology from both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   To create the new system, Reed said, the White House will
increase the budget for ballistics work from just under $10 million
a year to more than $30 million, with 230 local and state law
enforcement agencies expected to have access to the new system
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The new ballistics identification system and the program to
enter test-fire information from Glock are part of a quiet effort
by the Clinton administration to develop more effective ways to
combat gun crime despite a political impasse in Congress and
several state legislatures over new gun control bills.

`LE CORSAIRE': A BALLET UPSTAGED BY WORDS AND GIGGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<P>
   There is exciting dancing to be seen Monday night in the
American Ballet Theater production of ``Le Corsaire,'' on PBS. But
the dancing is accompanied _ and almost sunk _ by what may well be
the most witless and tedious running commentary ever to be foisted
on a televised work of art.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``Great Performances: Dance in America'' series, the
show is peppered with jokes at the start and during intermissions
about the supposed incomprehensibility of the ballet's plot. They
are made by a gaggle of talking, giggling heads from American
Ballet Theater and among the audience and employees at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, where the ballet was performed for
this program. The comments are at best unilluminating and at worst
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Le Corsaire'' is so silly, why choose it for one of the
rare slots for concert dance on television? And what is all this in
aid of? Viewers who are not interested in dance probably won't
stick around long anyway. And those who are at all interested may
hang on through the convoluted plot, encouraged by the first-rate
classical ballet set pieces in this 19th-century story ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Konstantin Sergeyev's staging of the Marius Petipa
production retains the famous ``Corsaire'' pas de deux, actually a
pas de trois, and the exquisitely beautiful ``Jardin d'Anime''
scene. As David Richardson, Ballet Theater's associate artistic
director, so refreshingly puts it, it is the dancing that is
important in this ballet spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know whether the idea originated with Matthew
Diamond, a former modern dancer and choreographer who directed the
``Dancemakers'' documentary last year, or with Wendy Wasserstein,
whom the program credits with writing ``special material.'' Whoever
the culprit the babbling makes the necessary suspension of
disbelief almost impossible. It doesn't help that Ballet Theater
largely plays ``Le Corsaire'' for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are nuggets of memorable dancing by performers who
include Angel Corella as the smooth-spinning slave, Ali, and
Gillian Murphy, whose bold, musical classicism stands out in the
Odalisques dance. Julie Kent is a gossamer but slightly bland
Medora, with Ethan Stiefel convincingly swashbuckling as her lover,
the pirate Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin De Luz gives the treacherous pirate Birbanto a welcome
edge. Paloma Herrera is a lyrical Gulnare. Vladimir Malakhov and
Michael Owen are strangely giddy as the slave-seller Lankendem and
the Pasha, in a lead cast completed by Christine Dunham, Oksana
Konobeyeva, Sandra Brown and Carlos Molina.

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Warren Wegele is on the front line of a medical
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After doing a simple blood test recently, doctors at the
University of Cincinnati Medical Center told Wegele, a 65-year-old
former salesman for air-compressor companies, that he had inherited
a tiny alteration in one of his genes. A certain chemical unit out
of the string of 3 billion that make up the mass of DNA in his
cells is different from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The alteration _ found in 5 percent of the population _ would
normally be of no more medical significance to Wegele (pronounced
WEG-lee) than his black hair or burly physique. But it translated
into a potential medical catastrophe for Wegele when he became ill
with congestive heart failure, a disease in which the heart muscle
no longer contracts vigorously. On average, patients with the
condition live five years after they become ill; some live 10 years
or more.
</P>
<P>
   But people with anomalies like Wegele's altered gene, doctors
told him, usually live only one to two years. For these people, the
drugs used to treat the disease may be of little help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept it,'' Wegele said of the bad news doctors gave
him about his gene, which directs heart cells to make a crucial
protein. After all, he argued, as he lay in his hospital bed,
``I've never really gotten ill, and I've always recovered from
everything instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wegele's former vigor was beside the point. Clearly ill, he
had spent weeks in the hospital, growing sicker by the day, waiting
for a heart to become available for a transplant _ the only way,
his doctors said, to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary new genetics that predicted Wegele's dire
circumstances is not about genes that confer generally good health
or health that is generally poor. Instead, it is about a collection
of common single-molecule variations in genetic material that are
normally no more important than having curly or straight hair, or
brown or blue eyes, but might be revealing when people become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe humans have hundreds of thousands of these
genetic variations, and drug companies are avidly searching for
them, convinced that they can use collections of them to identify
patients who will benefit from drugs, patients who will not, and
patients who will suffer troubling side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they say, this research will lead them into an era
of tailor-made medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So far, testing for such genetic variants is being done only at
a few medical centers as part of experimental trials. Experts
predict a gradual increase in such testing as the roster of
variations is compiled and research accelerates. They predict that
the first personalized drug prescriptions will appear in a few
years and many more will roll out over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the advanced genetic testing will probably be used for
refining drugs for the more common diseases like asthma, arthritis,
heart disease, high blood pressure and migraines. Eventually,
experts say, it could be applied to virtually any drug for any
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices could increase, some drug company executives say,
but they add that drugs will be so much more effective that they
will be worth more to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, optimistic predictions of scientists and drug
companies can go awry, and until the revolution in pharmacology
takes place, it is hard to know if the glowing predictions are
accurate. So far, relatively few genetic variants have been found
and only a small number of these have been shown to have medical
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In Wegele's case, there was no good drug to slow his disease.
But that did not mean he had not been helped. Based on their data
from a continuing study that now includes about 500 patients with
congestive heart failure, doctors at the University of Cincinnati
hospital said that the only long-term hope for people with Wegele's
genetic variant was a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test everyone who has congestive heart failure,'' said Dr.
Stephen Liggett, a lung specialist and molecular geneticist at the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, who discovered the
genetic variant and its effects on congestive heart failure.
Liggett said it was his opinion that those who had the genetic
variation, like Wegele, ``should be put on the transplant list
early and they should have more aggressive drug therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, Wegele received a new heart. A week later, Liggett
said, Wegele was well enough to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The Scientists
</P>
<P>
   From Impossible Task to Reasonable Goal
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when he was giving a technical talk to
scientists, Dr. Eric Lander had a eureka moment.
</P>
<P>
   Lander, who is director of the Center for Genome Research at the
Whitehead Institute in Boston, had assumed that it would be
hopeless to even dream of finding the common variants in human
genes. Gene alterations _ single chemical changes _ occur by
accident, at random. Those with an immediate effect on health or
fertility would be retained or eliminated by evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The other alterations would be neutral _ they would ordinarily
make no difference to the person _ and so they would slowly become
common as they were passed from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   With about 100,000 human genes and 6 billion people on earth,
the number of common variations could be enormous. But, Lander
realized, the human race numbered just 10,000 to 100,000 people as
recently as 7,000 generations ago and a population that small would
have only a modest number of common genetic variants, perhaps a few
hundred thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been enough time for the common variants to build
up,'' Lander said. For each gene, there might be two, or three,
common variations at one or two positions in the gene sequence, not
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a finite problem,'' Lander said. ``It is within
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   That insight converted him into one of the pioneers in the
search for genetic variants that can predict individual differences
in responses to illness and responses to drugs, a field known as
pharmacogenetics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time Lander was realizing that each gene might
have just a few variants, Liggett, then a researcher at Duke
University, was starting to see what such variants might mean for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett was intrigued by one particular gene, the beta-2
adrenergic receptor gene. It directs cells to make a protein that
helps relax muscles in the airways of the lungs and contract
muscles in the heart. Drugs for asthma attach themselves to the
protein, setting off a cascade of biochemical events inside the
cells that makes the airways dilate. Drugs for congestive heart
failure also attach themselves to the protein, this time making
heart muscles contract.
</P>
<P>
   In studies with cells grown in the laboratory, Liggett
discovered that the gene that codes for production of the beta-2
adrenergic receptor protein seemed exquisitely tuned by its
structure. A change in just a single chemical along the gene's
length could make the protein work slightly better, or slightly
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to find out if this could occur in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett and his colleagues recruited 100 healthy people and
began deciphering the chemical sequence of each person's beta
adrenergic receptor gene. After 18 months, he got his answer. There
were three different variants of the gene. All three worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Liggett's mind raced. Maybe this was why some
people respond better than others to asthma drugs. Maybe it was why
some people taking asthma drugs quickly became resistant to them
and others did not. Maybe it was also tied to the way patients with
congestive heart failure responded to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told me that what we had found was
unimportant,'' Liggett said. ``They were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigations,
Liggett and his colleagues showed how the genetic variants affected
disease prognosis in congestive heart failure. Reporting on tests
of 259 patients who had come to the University of Cincinnati to be
evaluated for possible heart transplants, the researchers found
that those with one particular beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene
variant did far worse than those with another. A third group was in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Within 100 days after they arrived at the hospital, about 60
percent of the patients with an isoleucine amino acid at position
164 in the protein chain were dead or required a heart transplant.
That is the variant that Wegele has.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with a different amino acid, threonine, at position
164, had a much better outcome. About 95 percent of them were alive
after 100 days without having had a heart transplant, and half were
still alive 900 days after they arrived at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in the gene appear to be important in asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent small study conducted at the University of Tennessee
at Memphis, Dr. Julie Johnson, Dr. John Lima and their colleagues
found that asthma patients who inherited from both parents the
amino acid arginine in position 16 of the beta-2 adrenergic
receptor protein responded best to the popular asthma drug
albuterol. The drug increased by 18 percent the amount of air they
could expel from their lungs. Those who inherited from either
parent the chemical glycine in that position had just a 4.9 percent
increase in the air they expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that some people respond better to
albuterol,'' Liggett said. ``But we've never known why.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge is to tailor drug treatments to help those who
have genetic variants that spell a poor prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Liggett, ``is the key to pharmacogenetics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Companies
</P>
<P>
   First-Time Step in Joint Research
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the rolling countryside near Hopewell, N.J., in a
cluster of brick buildings once owned by Mobil Oil is Bristol-Myers
Squibb's budding center of pharmacogenomics research. There, in
echoing offices still under construction, Dr. Elliott Sigal makes
bold plans to expand his staff and investments in what he believes
will be the future of the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   When executives like Sigal look at the pharmaceutical industry,
they groan. One out of 7,500 compounds that look promising in the
laboratory actually gets to the market. Only three out of 10 that
are marketed make any money for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attrition rate is a plague for the industry,'' Sigal said,
referring to the many drugs that fail.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, said Sigal, who is Bristol-Myers' senior vice
president for early discovery and applied technology, major drug
companies introduce one innovative drug into the market each year _
if they are lucky. For many drugs, he added, only half of the
patients who take them respond.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugs are worse than that. People with conditions like high
blood pressure often try one drug after another before finding a
medication that works for them.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs are rarely used, because they cause side effects in
a small proportion of patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a drug like Glaxo Wellcome's Lamictal, which is
used to treat epilepsy, can cause itching and rashes. It can only
be used by patients whose doctors are willing to start with a small
dose and gradually increase it over several months, watching to see
if a rash develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``When most general practitioners see that a drug needs dose
escalation, they use something else,'' said Dr. Allen Roses, a
neurologist who is vice president worldwide and director of
genetics at Glaxo Wellcome PLC. ``But it's a great drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Roses and others emphasize that if genetic variants could be
used to identify who would respond to a drug and who would have
side effects, the benefits for companies and patients would be
obvious. Companies could sell more drugs, more efficiently, by
marketing them to those who would be helped. And patients would get
drugs that worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   For companies like Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as
well as Pfizer, the path is clear. Last April, they and seven other
large drug companies joined forces with the Wellcome Trust, a
medical research charity, and several leading academic centers, to
compare human DNA segments and find the places where variations
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will use these variations, called single
nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and pronounced ``snips,'' to try
to develop the precisely targeted drugs of the future. Their goal
is to identify 300,000 such landmarks along the human DNA within
two years and make the results public.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 21, the group, called the SNP Consortium, published on
the Internet its first group of SNPs, identifying 2,279 of them and
describing their precise sites on human chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   But more is involved than just finding SNPs. Companies are also
worried about the bottom line: How much will it cost to find these
alterations in genes?
</P>
<P>
   Today, it costs $150 or more to identify each of a person's
SNPs, said Dr. Michael Silber, who directs pharmacogenetics
research at Pfizer. The goal, he said, is to get the price down to
pennies, which he called feasible.

STUDENTS SEARCH FOR SPIRITUAL ANSWERS

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 7 o'clock Sunday night during finals week at Arizona State
Univer sity, and there's standing room only at the All Saints
Catholic Newman Center Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Most weekends, about 1,300 stu dents pile in to the
non-traditional sanctuary for the center's five Masses. During
finals, the Rev. Nathan Castle says, the number swells about 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Do they come to pray for good grades? Some probably do, Castle
jokes. But for those who regularly attend, the Newman Center Mass
offers a connection that goes beyond the liturgy and familiar
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century, at ASU and secular schools
across the Phoenix area, students are exploring things spiritual _
whether through organized religion or less defined means.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on that interest, schools are offering new courses,
and students are taking part in campus groups that let them delve
into spirituality and faith on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Castle says, they're looking for ``a place to ask the
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Morgan, 25, comes to the Newman Center weekly, hoping a
word from Father Nathan's homily _ or the flute and guitar band up
front _ will send her back to her books spiritually refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel more comfortable knowing everybody here is your
age,'' said Morgan, a doctoral chem istry student from Missouri.
``It's nice to know God is alive in the hearts of young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baldenegro, 27, a junior, comes every two or three weeks,
craving the fellowship the Newman Center provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel I get caught up in things I shouldn't get
caught up in,'' the aeronautical engineering major said, ``and
(Mass) brings me back to my roots. It makes me realize what is
important, or what should be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty DeBerg, a University of Northern Iowa professor conducting
a national study of college students' attitudes toward religion,
said young adulthood ``has been traditionally been understood as a
time when people begin to question the values and perspectives in
which they were reared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are they the right age,'' she said, ``but they're
taking classes that expose them to ideas they'd never faced before.
In many ways, they're seeking and putting together their own
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Her three-year project, conducted jointly with professors at
Indiana University and the University of Wyoming, looks at campus
life at four U.S. schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent CNN/USA Today/Gal lup poll, 48 percent of American
young adults 18 to 29 said religion was ``very important'' in their
lives. In the Phoenix area, similar interest shows up at the
college level.
</P>
<P>
   For example, students at Estrella Mountain Community College in
Avondale formally launched a Christian Students Association this
semester _ and it's already the largest student group on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decade, student interest led ASU's religious studies
depart ment, already one of the nation's largest, to expand to 82
classes this year from 51 classes in 1991. One of the newest looks
at religions in the American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by years of requests, Paradise Valley Community College
finally added a class on personal spirituality this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Miller, 25, couldn't wait to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'd been searching,'' said Miller, who thinks
she might like to study anthropology or social work. ``I was kind
of curious to see what other people say about life and God, and
religion in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The course, instructor Jim Rubin says, was ``about asking the
ques tions that 99.9 percent of people never ask themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who grew up without religious instruction, feels discon
nected from ritual and dogma. Taking Rubin's class helped her
validate her own spiritual path, which includes meditation,
enjoying nature and reading about Eastern faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel more comfort able in my non-religiousness,''
she said. ``Because it's a very non-judg mental class, it's easy to
say how you feel or what you believe in, and no one is going to say
you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to 1998's The Ameri can Freshman, an annual survey
from the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, nearly 15
percent of all two- and four-year college freshmen reported being
unaffiliated with any religion. Just 10 years before, about 12
percent made this claim.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to quantify whether today's students are more
or less spiritually minded than those decades ago, ASU Professor
Mark Woodward says some things haven't changed.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to college-age searching, ``most of the religious
themes that are operating today were established in the late
'60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't use the word then, but the notions of New Age reli
gions, alternative religions _ all those paradigms were really
estab lished (then),'' said Woodward, who teaches classes on
religion and popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distrust of establishment and institutions that came about at
that time really never went away.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is different, Woodward says, is where today's students
look for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1960s, it was largely an undifferentiated
search,'' he said. ``Now, there are alternative institu tional
churches and organizations they'll get involved in, from neo-pa
ganism to a host of Buddhist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are mainstays on secular campuses _ Campus Cru sade
for Christ, Fellowship of Chris tian Athletes, Hillel student
centers for Jewish students. Not affiliated with the colleges they
draw from, and often located off-campus, these groups let students
express their faiths without the tie of specific houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   But some, such as the Muslim Students Association at ASU, use
the nearby Islamic Cultural Center for daily prayers. During the
holy month of Ramadan, which Muslims now are celebrating, students
go to the mosque in the evenings for prayer and to break their
daytime fasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Holcomb, 21, a Jewish student at ASU, says it's impossible
to separate his faith from his daily life. The Phoenix native is
active at the Hillel Jewish Student Center, which, besides being
``somewhere to hang out,'' also gives students a place to bond with
those who share their tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a freshman living in the dorms, the only way to
have a Jewish lifestyle was to join Hillel,'' he said. ``There are
so many things customwise. So much of what Judaism does is in a
group. You can't be Jewish alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hillel hosts Friday night Shabbat dinners celebrating
the Sabbath, Holcomb and other students drop in between classes or
late-night study breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is both my temple and my meeting place,'' he said. ``Hillel
has really been the answer book, I suppose, to any questions I
have.''

 CINCINNATI: called feasible.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a man who describes himself as ``leading the way in
caution'' is convinced that SNP analyses will become cheap enough
to be useful. Dr. Paul Spence, the executive director of
biotechnology for Searle, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto,
said that before he committed himself to SNP analyses, he actually
sat down with pen and paper and worked out the economics. Like
Spence, he concluded that cost would not be an obstacle for long.
</P>
<P>
   As for Roses of Glaxo Wellcome, as early as September 1997, he
persuaded his company to begin storing DNA samples from every
patient in most of its drug studies. The idea is that when the SNPs
are found, the company can go back and ask: What patterns of these
molecular markers correlate with what sort of drug responses?
</P>
<P>
   If one pattern is associated with a drug's efficacy and another
with bad side effects, the company would consider marketing the
drug only to those with the pattern that predicts a good response.
</P>
<P>
   To protect patients' privacy, Roses said, their names and
identifying features are not stored with their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome plans to enter the pharmacogenetics market with a
drug that is already on the market, offering patients SNP tests
before they take the drug to see if they are likely to respond.
Then the company plans to move on and use the SNP profiles as part
of drug development.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, drug company executives predict, SNP tests will
be available for several drugs and several diseases. Eventually,
most drugs will be sold with SNP tests, companies say.
</P>
<P>
   Companies expect to use ``SNP chips'' for testing. They are
devices that can be used to scan a sample of DNA for specific
genetic sequences or anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, drug company executives predict, SNP research
will reward them with hundreds of new drugs, including many that
will be unlike any on the market today. With that in mind, Sigal
said, his company has a new business goal. Rather than settling for
the current pattern of one entirely new drug on the market each
year, the company aims to have three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies see this as the way of the future.'' Sigal
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics
</P>
<P>
   Discriminatory Risks in Genetic Testing
</P>
<P>
   Mention genes and diseases to many ethicists and they will see a
dark side to a bright future. Will people be getting information
about their medical conditions that they would rather not know? Can
their privacy be protected?
</P>
<P>
   Few are more acutely aware of these problems than Dr. Francis
Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, the federal effort to map the human genes. From its
inception, the genome project has had ethicists as consultants, and
it has had to answer piercing questions about the consequences of
unveiling what could be intimate genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins is excited by the prospect of pharmacogenetics, he
sees situations in which it could raise privacy problems. Knowing
if someone will respond to a drug, or suffer a side effect, can
tell something about that person's susceptibility to disease.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists recently reported that the SNP pattern
in a cholesterol-metabolizing gene determined who would respond to
the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin. But the people who
respond to pravastatin are also the ones who will have the worst
prognosis if they do not get their cholesterol levels down.
Insurers might use that genetic information to deny or limit
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to separate the reason you did the test from
the response to it,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he added, is to pass effective laws to prevent
genetic discrimination. And, he said, ``We are pretty close to
seeing that come to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Although genetics always gives rise to ethical concerns, the
debate over pharmacogenetics has so far been muted, with even some
longtime critics of genetic testing saying that they think it will
be a blessing to doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for the research,'' said Dr. Michael Kaback, a
geneticist at the University of California in San Diego, who has
often criticized genetic testing. ``I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   His main concern, he said, is that companies will promise too
much too soon, turning the public bitter and cynical. ``Then a
whiplash occurs and you end up curtailing progress,'' Kaback said.
</P>
<P>
   Roses noted that the pharmacogenetics approach might not provide
people with information about disease susceptibility or their
medical future. While a genetic variant may make a difference in
whether a person with asthma, for example, responds to albuterol,
it does not have any bearing on whether that person will get asthma
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic variant is predicting individual physiological
responses to drug molecules, not the biochemical processes that
caused the disease being treated. And when SNP patterns are
analyzed together, as a sort of DNA bar code, they will predict
drug responses without revealing anything about the actual genes on
which the SNPs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Bartha Maria Knoppers, a law professor at the University of
Montreal, who is chairwoman of the international ethics committee
of the Human Genome Organization, an international organization of
scientists who are working on finding the sequence of the human
genome, said she thinks the benefits of the new approach are
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will probably look with some suspicion on claims that
this will ultimately be beneficial, because it is in our cultural
milieu to say `Oh, another marketing ploy,''' Ms. Knoppers said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``I think that, provided we proceed with caution,
that it can be very beneficial. There are drugs that don't work for
many people; there are drugs that are dangerous. I would think that
making drugs more therapeutic and safer surely is an ethical
goal.''

<P>
   VALLEY FORGE, Pa. _ Of all the creatures caught up in suburban
sprawl, few possess a more idyllic sanctuary than the white-tail
deer herd of Valley Forge National Historical Park as they graze
and multiply in safety while shopping malls and home developments
boom on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   And few creatures are more bedeviled by the deer's position of
privilege _ by the 1,000-member herd's annual growth rate of 20
percent as park hunting is absolutely barred _ than the neighboring
homeowners of the Valley Forge Citizens for Deer Control Inc. They
intercept deer daily on roads and backyard patios and bridle in
civic meetings at their doe-eyed ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a Bambi fan, firmly against hunting such
beautiful animals,'' said Jackie Schlichthernlein, a resident in
despair at deer endlessly ravaging the expensive landscaping of her
two-acre home site despite all manner of barriers. ``But my hunter
has just picked off an eight-pointer,'' she continued with a gaze
of pay-back satisfaction at the thought of one less antlered buck
to be seen from her kitchen window, munching flowers and making her
Doberman, Shana, back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``And another hunter I had on the property picked off a
four-pointer,'' Ms. Schlichthernlein exulted, saluting the
bow-and-arrow stalkers who are solicited by the affluent needy in
this region the way Welcome Wagoneers once served pioneer
suburbanites. The bowmen are evidence of the success of a
turn-of-the-century effort by conservationists to revive the
white-tail herds in the Northeast states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a deer population explosion,'' said Dr. Frank B.
Gill, vice president for science of the National Audubon Society,
who warns this is far too much of a good thing. ``The consequences
are substantial: in biology there has been a stripping out of the
understory in the Northeast woods,'' he said, describing severe
losses in basic wood life from ground cover to low-nesting birds.
The deer eat away most greenery up to six feet from the ground,
leaving naturalists warning that the regeneration of the region's
oak and hickory forests is threatened as the deer scarf down
saplings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the warnings, park visitors are awe-struck at the
sight of 30, 40 or more of the white-tails wandering the same
picturesque hillsides that once were sanctuary for George
Washington's beleaguered Continental Army. Fat, sassy and in mating
rut lately, the deer graze the park secure, by law, from the many
specialized hunters who are busy now taking seasonal aim at the
backyard deer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deer are all over that park,'' said Ron Watt, president of
Whitetail Associates, a bow hunters group of 30 volunteers who
spend their weekends killing deer in permitted jurisdictions in
this fast-developing area 18 miles from Philadelphia. ``Deer don't
leave, they adapt, and they're finding some mighty tasty ornamental
shrubs and nutritious plants in nearby yards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has a variety of approaches to the
problem. The deer herd to the south in Gettysburg National Military
Park was thinned when the deer ate into the woodlands considered
vital to that park's depiction of the Civil War story. But at
Valley Forge, the service has deemed precise preservation of the
woods to be unnecessary in the story of General Washington's
encampment in the harsh winter of 1777-78, when trees were razed
for miles around as huts were built and fires stoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer issue at Valley Forge is a matter of perception and
social tolerance,'' said Arthur L. Stewart, the park
superintendent. He insists studies show that the deer wander no
more than a quarter-mile from the 3,600-acre park and that the herd
might not necessarily double in the next five years, as the current
growth rate suggests. The general abundance of white-tail deer now
being perceived from Maine to Virginia, Stewart noted, is due to a
variety of factors, including human development that is consuming
deer habitat and funneling the white-tails into to ever more
prominent oases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to cull the herd, the Congress would tell us to
stop,'' Stewart said, arguing his park's mission statement allows
no leeway for the hunting home owners are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This park is a breeding ground,'' said James M. Morrisson,
president of the local Citizens for Deer Control, blaming the deer
for everything from the disappearance of traditional mountain
laurel to the sudden rarity of the yellow-breasted chat.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors, who have signed up 300 strong in the control
group, offer stories of noisome deer brazenly nibbling everything,
even front-porch pumpkins. They were first noticed as cute
newcomers and charming loners less than a decade ago, residents
say, but have now become group nuisances that collide dangerously
with cars, despoil backyards with droppings and carry Lyme disease.
Statewide, officials estimate 40,000 deer perish as road kill each
year, while about four humans are killed and 600 injured annually
in deer-car collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a travesty,'' said Morrisson staring at a woodland edge
as dozens of park deer serenely stared back then kept eating.
``It's a violation of the park's fundamental purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Continental Army almost starved to death, living on flour
and water,'' he said, moving to a hilltop to find another 20 deer
grazing, burnished and blase in their habitat. ``There were no deer
here back then and they're dishonoring the memory of those troops
by letting all these deer run around.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrisson moved on to where a car of visitors provided mute
rebuttal. They stared in delight upon a field vivid with deer whose
white tails dotted the scene like exclamation points at Morrisson's
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got all this meat on the hoof _ I calculate 60,000
pounds of venison in this park,'' he said, settling into his own
wintry campaign at Valley Forge. ``Just imagine what Washington's
Army could have done with that.''

<P>
   MACAU _ With the solemn lowering of one flag and the triumphant
raising of another, China claimed sovereignty over Macau on Monday,
ending 442 years of Portuguese rule and shaking off the last
vestiges of European colonial involvement in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, at the stroke of midnight, had all the pomp and
ritual of another handover ceremony, in nearby Hong Kong two and a
half years ago. But while the British and Chinese leaders conducted
their exercise there with icy formality, the leaders here Monday
seemed much more at ease.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech moments after the handover, President Jiang Zemin of
China praised the smooth transfer. ``The friendship between the two
peoples and the amicable cooperation between the two countries will
develop from a new starting point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also said the successful return of Macau _ following that
of Hong Kong _ demonstrates that China is ``confident and capable''
of an early reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal greeted Jiang warmly on the
dais and chatted amiably with him just before parting. But he
reminded China that Portugal will remain committed to a Macau,
where, he said, ``democracy and freedom are an irreplaceable
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal negotiated guarantees of relative autonomy for Macau
similar to those that Britain won for Hong Kong. But high-flown
discussions of democracy and the rule of law seem less relevant in
this tiny enclave of 430,000 people, where the main business is
gambling and the biggest local concern is curbing Chinese gangs,
whose violent battles have stained the last days of the Portuguese
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In Macau's casinos, a smaller than usual crowd wagered through
the handover without a pause. A young man playing Chinese dominoes
in the casino at the Hotel Lisboa glanced at a clock on the wall
and prayed aloud for good fortune at midnight. He won the next
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's carefully planned day got off to a chaotic start when
the police broke up a gathering of members of the Falun Gong
spiritual movement in front of the Lisboa. The police detained 40
of the group's members as they did their morning exercises,
dragging some away by force. Falun Gong has been outlawed in
mainland China, where the government has condemned it as an evil
cult.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's authorities had warned the group not to protest here. On
Friday, the police detained several Falun Gong members trying to
enter the territory. Monday, the group assembled in a traffic
circle, hoping to confront Jiang, whose motorcade was scheduled to
pass by later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   China may also have been put off by two of the most notable
guests at the ceremony. Christopher Patten, the last governor of
Hong Kong, was there as a guest of the Portuguese, despite being
reviled by Beijing for his strenuous advocacy of democracy in the
years before the Hong Kong handover. Portugal also invited Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, a top leader of newly independent East Timor.
China maintains relations with Indonesia, which invaded East Timor
in 1975 and jailed Gusmao for his pro-independence activities until
earlier this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The transfer of sovereignty capped a day laden with symbolism,
as Portugal gently reasserted its legacy in Macau one last time. At
a Mass on Monday morning in the Macau Cathedral, worshipers
presented as an offering a bound copy of the Basic Law, the
constitution negotiated between Portugal and China, which allows
Macau to keep its own government and laws as a special region of
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the offer given to us by the Chinese,'' said Luis
M.F. Sequeira, a Jesuit priest and one of the celebrants of the
Mass. ``It is a challenge for them to uphold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's formal renunciation of control began Monday
afternoon, as senior officials of the colonial administration
gathered in the courtyard of the Government Palace to lower the
Portuguese flag. The governor, Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira, emerged
from the salmon pink building at 5 p.m. to polite applause from a
crowd, mostly Chinese, on the sidewalk outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor took his place next to an honor guard of
police officers and firefighters in dress uniforms, a marching band
struck up the Portuguese anthem and an officer slowly lowered the
old green and red flag from its place on the peaked roof. The
officer folded the flag and presented it to Vieira, who placed it
over his heart and gazed at a coat of arms above the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then turned and strode through the gate, his
expression stoic as he and his wife climbed into a black Mercedes
limousine and were driven away. When the motorcade had gone, the
crowd pushed past a cordon of police officers and spilled gleefully
into the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go in and take a look,'' said one man to his wife, as
they made for the front steps, where a lone guard stood somewhat
nervously behind the glass doors. After a few giddy moments, the
police cleared out the courtyard and the palace stood empty in the
gathering dusk, soft lights illuminating its white columns.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the rituals, the atmosphere on this handover day was
festive, despite brisk weather and blustery winds that forced the
cancellation of evening fireworks. Christmas bells and Chinese
lanterns swung from lampposts in Largo de Senado, the picturesque
brick square in the historic center of Macau. Local people and
visitors milled about, taking pictures to commemorate the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud because China is becoming bigger and more
powerful,'' said Cheong Iom Wang, who arrived here from Cambodia as
a refugee in 1970. Cheong, 37, said he would not miss the departing
Portuguese. ``They've been here for a long time,'' he said. ``Their
time is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Portuguese seemed determined to savor their last day of
occupancy here. Many people traveled from Portugal on package tours
to witness the handover. They strolled through the streets, their
hats and fur coats a contrast to the more casual Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see the end of a long period in our country's
history,'' said Isabel Roque Cunha, who is from Aveiro, in central
Portugal. Mrs. Roque Cunha, 56, said she had never been to Macau,
though she had vivid images from pictures as a child. ``I expected
it to be more grand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such ambivalence at a Buddhist temple in the old
Chinese quarter of Macau, where people turned up to worship on this
auspicious occasion. The temple, dedicated to the Chinese goddess
A-Ma, is where Portuguese seafarers first made landfall in 1557.
Monday, people hung long lines of firecrackers from a pole next to
the entrance and set them off in a cacophonous celebration.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The shoving after the whistle started early and
intensified, until there seemed to be an altercation after every
play _ a furious demonstration of the game's high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams were playing to be the chief playoff hosts in
the NFC, with the advantage of home field throughout, while the New
York Giants were trying to prove they deserved at least an
invitation to that party.
</P>
<P>
   In this frenzied atmosphere, before the numbing roar inside the
Trans World Dome, the Giants unraveled as the Rams proved their
mettle.
</P>
<P>
   First, the game got away from the Giants, then the Rams ran
away.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (12-2) proved why it is the NFC's best team Sunday,
disorienting the Giants offense and slicing through an overworked
Giants defense in a precise, unrelenting 31-10 victory that
glaringly displayed the difference between the conference's elite
and those chasing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams played at a different speed than the Giants (7-7),
churning out big plays even when the Giants defense was in proper
position. And the Rams played with poise while the Giants made one
destructive mistake after another _ two interceptions returned for
touchdowns, costly penalties, a missed field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants even literally tripped over each other at the goal
line, ruining a chance for what might have been a pivotal
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Giants did not play with any of composure or
efficiency evident during the two-game winning streak they brought
to Sunday's game. The Giants got so caught up in after-the-whistle
altercations, they scrambled about the field, running just six
first-quarter plays. The Rams, as if by default, took a 10-0
first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got too much into the emotion of the game,'' said Giants
coach Jim Fassel, whose team might still qualify for the playoffs
with victories over Minnesota Sunday and Dallas the week after.
``That hurt us because we didn't play evenly, we got too
up-and-down, too emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants six penalties stunted the team's momentum and though
the Rams started slowly and dropped several early passes,
eventually a tired Giants defense saw the Rams big play makers _
quarterback Kurt Warner and running back Marshall Faulk _ turn the
game into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this,'' said Giants quarterback Kerry Collins.
``You can get out of whack. I think that's what happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins tried to settle his teammates in the huddle in the first
half but the Giants were still unbridled in their play. One
after-the-play fracas actually cost the Rams their touted left
tackle Orlando Pace, but other excesses of a similar kind cost the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, when the Giants appeared to have stopped
the Rams deep in their territory and would have likely taken
possession in good field position, defensive tackle Keith Hamilton
was penalized for roughing the passer, killing any chance the
Giants had to diminish the Rams 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Giants started the second half with an impressive
drive, as a 22-yard pass from Collins to Tiki Barber brought the
Giants to the 2-yard line. But a first down pass failed, as did a
second-down run. On third down, attempting a new play, Giants guard
Ron Stone stepped on Collins' right foot as the quarterback pulled
back from center, and Collins fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The field goal the Giants kicked may have cut the Rams lead to
10-3, but it demoralized the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our momentum right there kind of stopped,'' Barber said. ``A
touchdown was what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Giants were out of the game. They even recovered a
Rams fumble on the next series. But the Rams defense seemed quicker
than the Giants anticipated. They shut down Giants running back Joe
Montgomery, who rushed for just 41 yards on 12 carries, and that
frequently forced the Giants into lengthy second and third-down
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was on one such third-and-11 that the game turned in the Rams
favor for good. Collins, throwing off his back foot, tried to
connect with wide receiver Ike Hilliard who was trying to find a
seam in the Rams secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard made a move during his route that slowed his progress
down the field, something Collins didn't anticipate. The pass was
long and the Rams' Devin Bush intercepted it, returning it 45 yards
for a 17-3 Rams lead.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants' Cary Blanchard missed a 42-yard field goal
attempt early in the fourth quarter, what hope the Giants had left
seemed to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the Rams next possession, Warner threw a
short pass Az-Zahir Hakim, who was cutting across the middle of the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead, who did not play to his usual
level and who seemed slower, as if he were injured, was the first
Giant to miss Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Emmanuel McDaniel then was faked out of his tackle
attempt. The last Giant with a chance, Percy Ellsworth, was blocked
and Hakim had a 65-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the Rams points came when Mike Jones intercepted a
Collins pass and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown. The Giants
added an inconsequential 7-yard touchdown pass from Collins to
Hilliard late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry didn't play real well,'' Fassel said. ``He missed some
passes. It was a lot like the rest of the team. Lots of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, many Giants respectfully acknowledged that the
Rams had out-played them and there was a lesson in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had a playoff game intensity,'' said Hamilton.
``That didn't surprise us. We knew what kind of game it was going
to be. But when you play a good team like this in this kind of
atmosphere, you have to keep yourself together and composed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And clearly, we didn't do that. We made too many bad
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the game's end, there were no more fisticuffs on the field,
just celebration for the Rams, who relished their status as the
conference's winningest team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to Super Bowl goes through St. Louis,'' said Bush.
``There's no way to describe how much that means to this franchise,
which was down not too long ago. We've come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, meanwhile, left the field quietly _ without the
emotion they brought to the Trans World Dome roughly three hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In their locker room, Fassel was also calm. He told the team to
forget about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn from this lesson,'' he said. ``But all our focus is on
Minnesota now. That's who we have to beat right now to keep this
season alive.''

The game was there for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, for a change, the Rockets took it.
</P>
<P>
   A team that couldn't win down the stretch suddenly was making
all the right moves _ well, most of them, anyway _ to pull out a
six-point victory over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The win, the Rockets' first in the post-Charles Barkley era,
ended a streak of five losses, snapping a seemingly endless string
of mental mistakes, missed shots and errors of omission and
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gigantic to have a game that became close and then
finish it out and get the win,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``Still, though, we created situations for them that
they didn't create for themselves by a decision of pressuring up in
the backcourt when we didn't have to (instead of) getting back and
making them go five-on-five.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I like learning situations when you still get the win.
Many times this year the mistakes that we made cost us the game,
and hopefully that's enough. But this was a positive, and I'm very
happy for the guys. They've been working hard; we've been so close,
and to get a tangible reward (is good).''
</P>
<P>
   And things haven't been so good for the Rockets since losing
Barkley to a ruptured quadriceps tendon Dec. 8. Since then, they
rallied from a 25-point deficit at Boston only to falter down the
stretch in a four-point loss. After getting blown out by New
Jersey, the Rockets came home to play New York, and their
fourth-quarter mistakes cost dearly in a 101-90 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Wednesday's game at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing the second game in a back-to-back situation,
having gone through the physical Knicks the night before, the
Rockets went toe-to-toe with the defending NBA champions. But,
again, crucial fourth-quarter mistakes gave the Spurs an 83-77
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely important because just every other time we
had the lead in the fourth quarter, we let it go,'' said point
guard Steve Francis. ``And (against Boston on Saturday) we held on.
We had a couple of mental lapses, so I understand what coach was
mad about. We just have to get better at stuff like that in the
fourth quarter. We have to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a big accomplishment for us to be able to hold
on in that fourth quarter because for some reason that seems to be
our nemesis,'' Rogers said. ``I think we think too much in the
fourth quarter instead of continuing to do the same things (that
got them the lead).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have the fast break, then we're hesitant to run in the
fourth quarter instead of just going and completing plays. Once we
get that fourth quarter out of our minds and just play it like
basketball, we'll be a pretty hard team to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when they execute the offense the way the Rockets did
against Boston on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just basketball,'' Tomjanovich said. ``The offense
makes the defense adjust by rotating a player in and double-teaming
_ and it could be on a post-up like we've seen in the old days with
Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon), it could be out on the floor in an
iso(lation) or it could be a pick-and-roll _ but two guys are on
one man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, if you get into good spacing and you have a guy cutting
to the basket, a big guy, which (Kelvin) Cato was doing last
(Saturday) night, then there are going to be open people. And now
it's just getting the ball to those open people _ knowing where
they are going to be and then getting used to those shots. Those
things take time, and we're doing better at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier, they would double-team and we couldn't get the ball
out of the double. So their gamble, and it's really a gamble to put
two guys on one guy, was working for them. But now we're making
them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich's system, thought by many to be structured and
rigid, Saturday night showed how fluid it can be. While still
reliant on spacing and predicated on offensive players drawing
double teams, the Rockets' system now draws that doubling defense
on the perimeter, where lightning-quick players such as Francis and
Cuttino Mobley use the expanded offensive area to create for
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better if they double farther out on the floor because it
creates another passing angle on the strong side (the side with the
ball),'' Tomjanovich said. ``And it's finally clicking in.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was just a year ago that James Kennedy, scandal
spin controller for the White House, experienced the worst day of a
very bad year.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs were falling on Iraq, the speaker of the House of
Representatives stunned the country by resigning over a sex
scandal, and the House was poised to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of things spinning out of control that was
palpable,'' Kennedy said in an interview late last week. ``We were
looking over the edge into some sort of abyss and it caused the
body politic to step back and catch our breath. It was ultimately a
cathartic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, faint echoes of the Clinton scandals were heard in
Washington, as Monica Lewinsky took the stand in the Maryland
wiretapping trial of her former friend Linda Tripp, and John Huang
testified before Congress on the fund-raising abuses of the 1996
presidential campaign. But in a sign of how things have changed,
the events were mere blips on the media radar as the nation has
turned its attention to investing in Internet stocks, shopping and
the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And after 10 relatively quiet months on the scandal front, the
White House announced this week it was shutting its scandal spin
control shop.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say this represents a victory of hope over history.
The Clinton White House and its pursuers in Congress and the
independent counsel's office have generated a seemingly endless
series of scandals and investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington scandal industry has gone into a slump since
the Senate acquitted President Clinton in February, and the White
House now feels emboldened to reassign Kennedy, its laconic scandal
mouthpiece, to the more peaceable environs of the press office.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily a good omen. Two weeks after Kennedy
accepted the job in the White House counsel's office in January
1998, the Lewinsky matter erupted. But Joe Lockhart, the White
House press secretary, expressed confidence last week that the
president's last year in office would be dominated by debates over
Social Security and foreign policy and not by some new blue-dress
bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   So Kennedy will move from the counsel's office to the White
House press office, where he will address questions on education
and entitlement reform and leave behind the world of subpoenas and
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he was delighted. At the peak of the impeachment
battle, his beeper sounded as many as 100 times a day with queries
from reporters. In the last six months, he said, he has rarely been
paged more than five times a day, and the question is apt to arise
from a relatively mundane issue like campaign finance or Chinese
nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 46, is something of an accidental tourist in the realm
of scandal spin. He grew up in Wallingford, Conn., the son of
Robert T. and Beatrice Kennedy, a television repairman and an
office worker. He was a devotee (but not a relative) of the
Massachusetts Kennedys and remembers seeing President Kennedy in a
motorcade in 1962. Not a Boys' Nation handshake in the Rose Garden,
perhaps, but it helped hook him on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was an aide to Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., for 18
years, without encountering a whiff of serious scandal. So it was a
shock for him to enter the White House last year and immediately be
inundated by questions on his boss' truthfulness and sexual
behavior. Clinton, forced to confront the truth in August 1998,
admitted that his actions were ``indefensible,'' leaving aides
stuttering to explain how they had spent seven months defending
them. Kennedy has a well-rehearsed answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was ever called upon to defend what
happened,'' he said in the interview, over a beer at the Oval Room,
a restaurant near the White House. ``What we did was defend the
presidency and the people's choice in the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's self-effacing manner is a contrast to that of his
predecessor at Spin Central, Lanny Davis, who wrote about the art
of selective packaging of facts in a book called ``Truth to Tell.''
The White House press office has drawn up a list of self-promoters
among current and former White House staff members. Kennedy is not
on it; Davis is solidly in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy says he was handicapped for most of his tenure by being
in the dark about most aspects of the president's actions and his
legal team's strategy in the Lewinsky matter. His superiors in the
counsel's office provided little information _ in part to protect
him from an independent counsel's subpoena _ and he did not have
the authority to question the president directly. For much of 1998,
Kennedy was a spokesman with little to speak about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't know more,'' he said. ``That made it
difficult to build relationships with reporters that were based on
exchanges of information. I understood my role and simply tried to
be as responsive as I could under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that he hoped everyone learned a lesson from the
impeachment debacle and that his old office was closed forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the position never has to be opened again, in this or
any other administration,'' he said. ``I hope part of the lesson of
the past year is that no good comes of the politics of scandal and
investigation. I hope that issues dominate the next campaign. I may
be naive, but I think the public wants that, too.''

MINORITY ENROLLMENT DROPPING AT CITY'S ELITE SCHOOLS, SPARKING
CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With anticipation and some foreboding, Alberto
Monegro rides a bus every morning from the working-class brown
brick apartment hulks of the Bedford Park neighborhood in the Bronx
to the expansive lawns and mansions of Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   There, on an 18-acre neo-Gothic campus that resembles a small
college, he is a junior at the private Fieldston School, one of the
city's elite. It is his third year, yet he still wonders at times
if he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Dominican Republic, Alberto has found few other
Spanish-speaking students at Fieldston. He is floored by the
affluence: the sport utility vehicles that pull up to the long
drive off Manhattan College Parkway, the jewelry worn by some
students, the laptops toted by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' he says, ``disorienting.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto's experience is not unique. His journey _ physical and
emotional _ from his familiar neighborhood to an enclave of power
and wealth is made daily by scores of minority students. And while
it is a triumphant voyage, it is a confounding one, and the number
of those making it is stalling. In fact, despite three decades of
intensive recruitment, and with the city's nonwhite population
continuing to expand, the growth in the minority share of the elite
schools is flattening. Officials at many of the schools say they
are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny time,'' said Randolph Carter, director of
diversity for the National Association of Independent Schools, who
fields calls constantly from schools across the country struggling
with the issue. ``Right now the economy is booming. The schools are
raising more money. They have longer waiting lists. But on the
other side I see a fluctuation in enrollment of children of color.
There is certainly a paucity of teachers of color in the classrooms
and in the administrative office. It is the best of times and
really hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Among schools in New York City, there is a fear they have hit a
recruitment wall. Many schools, including Fieldston, Brearley,
Spence and Friends Seminary, have entered into serious bouts of
soul-searching over their attitudes toward race, ethnicity and
class. Committees, task forces and less formal gatherings have
emerged. Books like ``Why are All the Black Kids Sitting Together
in the Cafeteria?'' (Basic Books, 1997) by Beverly Daniel Tatum, a
psychologist, have become required reading among staff members.
Student forums on the topic abound, and several schools have hired
multicultural affairs coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the American dream or ideal that we base diversity
under has not been fulfilled, yet it still nags at our conscience
enough to keep trying to make it workable,'' said Richard Eldridge,
the director of Friends Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Minority parents and students say that while it is clear that
the schools offer a top education, it is a painfully difficult
decision whether or not to attend these schools.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Sadler, a black parent who lives in Riverdale, said she
was torn about sending her son to middle school at Fieldston,
despite its reputation for progressivism and tolerance. She
recalled her own discomfort as one of only a dozen or so black
students at Barnard College in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want that experience for him,'' Ms. Sadler said. She
added, nonetheless, that sending her son was the right decision,
that he was happy and had done well at Fieldston. Yet she could not
help worrying about a racial tinge when he was disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Many students say the price of admission is sometimes discomfort
on campus. Many minority students say they find themselves in the
spotlight, singled out for class discussions on race, sought out
unnaturally for trophy friendships by white students, and
constantly the subject of speculation over whether they are
qualified or taking the spot of others more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   So minority parents often choose other options, including
parochial schools and a move to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Priscilla M. Winn Barlow, the head of Brearley, said
she was jolted when not one of the five black children accepted for
kindergarten this fall enrolled. Transportation concerns, as well
as the dearth of minority students in the lower grades were cited
as main factors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some black parents of Brearley students were not shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change what's in there before you can bring people
in,'' said Donna Givens, a black parent there. ``What is the
community about now? What kind of bias awareness training do we
have? We need to look at things like that, not just the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Givens said that until Brearley took a number of steps,
including hiring more minority faculty members and reassessing its
curriculum, it would be difficult to attract minority families.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some minority parents and people who have worked in private
schools dismiss the soul-searching at the schools as largely
artificial, saying the institutions are so bound by tradition, so
wary of significant change _ and so focused on keeping their
clientele happy _ that little should be expected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as tuition at top schools soars to just under $20,000 a
year, headmasters say that complaints have grown, primarily from
white, affluent parents, regarding the amount of money devoted to
minority-oriented scholarships, even though the percentage of
tuition revenue spent on financial aid has remained steady,
averaging about 13 percent. Many such parents labor under the
mistaken impression that virtually all minority students are on
full scholarship or were admitted under lower standards, the
headmasters add.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many white parents worry that places at selective
colleges that might go to their children will go instead to
minority competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you need to understand is the history of
private education is one of exclusion, not inclusion,'' said
Augustus Trowbridge, the retired founder of Manhattan Country
School, a well-regarded private school that opened in 1966 on the
Upper East Side with cultural diversity as its underpinning.
``Private education is, for right or wrong, designed to bring
people together who share common philosophies. Private education
has had to catch up with a redefinition of its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Private education, of course, is not alone in this, but
reflective of a broader national pattern, with many whites feeling
their efforts have gone underappreciated and many blacks feeling
patronized.
</P>
<P>
   The road to self-reflection, never smooth at any institution,
has included some awkward missteps at New York's private schools.
Earlier this year, for example, Fieldston seriously considered a
plan to cluster minority students in classes so that none would
face isolation and alienation. The proposal, which was killed,
ended up angering people across the board, some of whom sensed
whiffs of segregation while others suspected an end run around more
aggressive recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   What cannot be denied is that the schools have made much
progress in the last few decades and are, as a group, more
integrated than most of the region's better suburban public schools
and even many city public schools, which now have a high
concentration of minority students, a function of the demographics
of the areas they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the ferment of the civil rights movement, many
schools in the 1960s and early 1970s began recruiting minority
students, primarily those who were black and Hispanic, because they
were considered the most economically and socially disadvantaged,
Trowbridge said. Such recruitment was seen as an act of social
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, minority enrollment at the city's most coveted private
schools was about 11 percent, according to the schools' reports to
the state. Since then, thanks mainly to the rise of recruiting
organizations like Prep for Prep, A Better Chance, the Albert G.
Oliver Program and Early Steps, minority enrollment has increased
to about 21 percent, though the percentage tends to be lower in the
elementary grades and higher in high school.
</P>
<P>
   But the pace of growth has slowed _ in 1990, minority enrollment
was 19 percent _ and its racial makeup has shifted.
Asian-Americans' share of the enrollment has risen steadily while
that of black and Hispanic students has not.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks still represent the largest percentage of minority
students among the city's elite private schools _ 8.6 percent _ but
that may not last. Asians are at 7.5 percent and Hispanic students
at 4.8. At a number of major schools, Asian-Americans and Pacific
Islanders account for the largest proportion of minority students.
(The state does not include a biracial category, though
administrators say its numbers are significant.)
</P>
<P>
   A growing concern is that many black and Hispanic families are
going elsewhere. Even when they can afford the steep tuition, many
opt for specialized public schools or parochial schools, or simply
move to the suburbs, where public schools have a better reputation,
said Frederick C. Calder, executive director of the New York State
Association of Independent Schools, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Justine Stamen, a former private school administrator who began
a program this year called the Teak Fellowship to prepare 22 gifted
minority students for the top public and private high schools, said
none of the families initially expressed interest in the private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lewis, a black student at Brooklyn Technical High School,
one of the four top public specialized high schools in the city
that require passing a standardized test for admission, said he
hardly gave a thought to private schools. He had flipped through
several brochures for them but found Tech, where 38 percent of the
students are black and 18 percent Hispanic, to be equal or
superior. And it was free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a private school would be an option if I hadn't gotten
into a specialized high school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the overriding source of anxiety for minority students
in private schools is just what role they play on campus. Are they
there for white students to learn about differences, or vice versa,
or both? Black parents have the dual fear that their children will
not be accepted by the majority and that if they are, they will
lose any grounding in their own culture and origins.

   Corey Manning, a black freshman at Howard University, said he
had often felt misunderstood at Fieldston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my face and the way I talk and the way I dress, I
am deemed as lazy,'' said Manning, dressed one evening in a
T-shirt, baggy jeans and a black headband. ``Because I am not
jumping around here with a smile, I am an angry black male. Why is
that?''

<P>
   Kamau Romero, a black senior at Horace Mann School in the
Riverdale section of the Bronx, said that overall, he felt happy at
the school, though at times he felt singled out for his race.
</P>
<P>
   During a class discussion of the book ``Black Like Me,'' which
deals with prejudice toward black men, a teacher paused to ask,
``What are some black stereotypes, Kamau?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He put me on the spot in the middle of class,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugo Mahabir, the director of multicultural affairs at
Fieldston, reflected on the difficulties at Fieldston and other
schools, he spoke for many: ``I think there is a degree of honesty
and reflection that feels very authentic. But it's easy to make a
rhetorical commitment to diversity. It's harder to put that in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As for Alberto Monegro, he has made peace of a sort with
Fieldston, which he believes has put him on the path to realizing
his dream of becoming a doctor. While he once would have been
reluctant to recommend the school to a friend, he would do so now,
with a qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would recommend it,'' he said, ``if they can handle it.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
Yikes! The Vikes have become the ``Not Ready for Prime Time
Players.'' And any comparison to the post-'70s ``Saturday Night
Live'' can't be a good thing. After winning five straight,
Minnesota has lost its last two _ both played under the lights for
the national TV audience. This'll be No. 3. It plays right into
Brett Favre's injured hand. NFL: Green Bay at Minnesota, Channel 7,
6 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
Jim Valvano and Pete Newell may have been complete opposites as
college basketball coaches _ one was flamboyant and full of
emotion, the other calm and calculated _ but each got similar
results. To honor them, tournaments in their name continue,
appropriately, on opposite sides of the country. College
basketball: Jimmy V Classic in East Rutherford, N.J.: North
Carolina vs. Indiana, ESPN, 4 p.m. and Florida vs. Rutgers, ESPN, 6
p.m.; Pete Newell Challenge in Oakland: Stanford vs. Mississippi
State, FSN, 6 p.m.; Cal vs. Gonzaga, FSN, 8:30 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go into a couple of important
Pacific Division contests. NHL: Kings at San Jose, FSN, 7:30 p.m.
(Also: FSN has the Kings' home game Sunday against Phoenix at 7:30
p.m.) 
THURSDAY 
There are the nightly hissy fits by enraged ex-lovers on
``Springer,'' and then there's the clay-flinging brawls of
Celebrity Deathmatch. Even in Play-Doh, a Ben Affleck vs. Matt
Damon slapfest provides greater entertainment than a WWF Smackdown
bout. At least sponsors haven't pulled their ads from this series.
``Celebrity Deathmatch'' marathon, MTV, 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
FRIDAY 
'Twas the day before Christmas and all through the league, not a
franchise was stirring, except these two dweebs. NFL: Dallas at New
Orleans, Channel 11, noon. 
SATURDAY 
So what has changed over the past six months since the Spurs ran
over the Lakers on their way to an NBA title? Anyone... anyone? The
Lakers have a new coach, yes. And a new arena, yes. And they have a
new power forward to help Shaq out against Duncan and Robinson...
uh, no. Check under the tree. Did we miss that present? NBA: San
Antonio at Lakers, Channel 4, 6:30 p.m. (NBC also has the New
York-Indiana game at 4 p.m.)  
SUNDAY 
If the best-game-available theory applies to L.A. _ and don't you
think it oughtta? _ we get a pretty good shot at watching at least
one of these titanic battles. NFL: Buffalo at New England or
Jacksonville at Tennessee, Channel 2, 10 a.m.; Green Bay at Tampa
Bay, Channel 11, 1 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a mad, mad, mad, mad kingdom, this nutty old
land of Denmark that has materialized at the Joseph Papp Public
Theater. Even Hamlet, for all his perversity, should know better
than to describe the place as a prison. What it is, obviously, is a
circus, and all its men and women merely clowns.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrei Serban's gaudy, frantic staging of Shakespeare's
``Hamlet,'' which opened Sunday night with Liev Schreiber as the
vacillating prince, the title character isn't the only one to put
an antic disposition on.
</P>
<P>
   Why, even the evil King Claudius can't wipe a maniac's grin off
his face or, finding a discarded pig's mask, resist the temptation
to play games with it. As for the virginal Ophelia, she behaves
like a Kamasutra instructress one minute and a macabre marionette
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the philosophizing gravedigger, who has ``clown''
helpfully spelled out on his costume (lest you misunderstand his
role in the play), doing a cute ventriloquist's act with a skull.
And when the annoying courtier named Osric shows up, he flits
through the air suspended by wires, no doubt because he is
mockingly described as ``a waterfly.'' Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are presented as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but then they always
are.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, despite its flashy exaggerations and aggressively
jokey demeanor, Serban's ``Hamlet'' offers very little that isn't
usually addressed in the teaching of the play in high school
English classes. Though Schreiber manages to strike sparks of
insight in a brave, game-for-anything portrayal, the overall effect
of the production is of a postmodern Cliff Notes, with ideas and
metaphors given a cartoonish physicality that borrows randomly from
assorted cultures and periods.
</P>
<P>
   This broad eclecticism, which also embraces a whole dictionary
of styles of theater, is the specialty of Serban, the Romanian-born
director whose credits range from a legendary ``Cherry Orchard'' at
Lincoln Center in the 1970s to a much debated version of Wagner's
``Ring'' in San Francisco last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Here he seems to be trying to bring to ``Hamlet'' the sort of
carnivalesque whimsy and electricity that his one-time mentor,
Peter Brook, famously brought to ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, in this case, is more a series of illustrations and
annotations than illuminations, and it disastrously places concept
over character. The governing conceit appears to be that ``Hamlet''
is all about levels of deception and illusion (well, duh!), an idea
that reaches its zenith (or nadir) when the ensemble files on stage
carrying posters of productions of ``Hamlets'' past, while
Schreiber's prince addresses the company of visiting players.
</P>
<P>
   The approach isn't much friendlier to actors than that of Julie
Taymor in ``The Lion King''; it's the spectacle, the props and the
outsize gestures that count here. The performances by and large are
smothered in the avalanche of gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal and most merciful exception is Schreiber, an actor
who has already demonstrated a fluid ease with things Shakespearean
in Public Theater productions of ``The Tempest,'' ``Macbeth'' and
``Cymbeline.'' He doesn't begin the evening promisingly, rendering
Hamlet's disgust with the situation at Elsinore in scenes of
vomiting and stomach clutching that give graphic life to
existential nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once this Hamlet decides to feign madness, Schreiber picks
up steam, pulling off some entertainingly grotesque variations on
his character's shock tactics that remind us that the actor's
resume includes two of those scary ``Scream'' movies. By the
tragedy's second half, when Hamlet has found his purpose, Schreiber
finally gives in to standard-issue heroic diction, and you miss the
loon that was.
</P>
<P>
   He also does a splendid job with the ``O, what a rogue and
peasant slave'' soliloquy, which he performs partly in the aisles,
with the house lights up, after Hamlet's first scene with the
visiting players. Without breaking character, Schreiber directly
invites the audience to experience Hamlet's detached but
disorienting sense of life as theater, thick with layers of
artifice.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few moments in which Serban's it's-only-a-play
self-consciousness elicits a feeling of fresh perception, and
Schreiber's confident command of the intricate language brings
vivid clarity to complexity. Throughout, he and Serban are clearly
trying hard to give startling readings to familiar phrases, and a
few of them are inspired: delivering ``words, words, words'' for
example, with an oceanic pause for every comma.
</P>
<P>
   Others are downright embarrassing, as when Hamlet does his
sardonic paean to the piece of work that is a man while pointing to
a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Jeremy Shamos and Jonathan Fried)
frozen in village idiot postures. Even worse is having ``To be or
not to be'' spoken while Hamlet feels the pulse of Ophelia (Lynn
Collins, in a rudderless performance), who has fainted.
</P>
<P>
   Colm Feore, the first-rate Canadian actor who appeared in ``32
Short Films About Glenn Gould,'' has been saddled with an approach
to Claudius that takes its cue from Hamlet's line that ``one may
smile, and smile, and be a villain.'' Sure enough, a hearty smile
seldom leaves Feore's face, yet he manages to turn what might have
been mere shtick into a sharp-edged Brechtian portrait of political
hypocrisy. He is, unfortunately, the only actor other than
Schreiber to claim his role as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else loses out to Serban's directorial whims of iron.
Richard Libertini's Polonius will be remembered less for how he
said anything than for his use of a microcassette recorder to tape
his observations; the earthy Gertrude of Diane Venora (who has
played both Hamlet and Gertrude in previous productions at the
Public) for the Flintstones-style hairdo she sports for the
mousetrap scene; Hamish Linklater's sneering Laertes for treating
his sister Ophelia like an inflatable sex toy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of Hamlet's father, by the way, is embodied by three
(or is it four?) actors in rather silly costumes of armor and
tulle, and the warrior prince Fortinbras shows up as a set of
androgynous twins (Justin Campbell and Wendy Rich Stetson).
</P>
<P>
   John Coyne's set emphasizes giant folding screens, trapdoors and
peepholes through which the characters spy on one another with
binoculars and note pads. Marina Draghici's costumes are the usual
transcultural blend, ranging from the Moroccan to Mussolini-era
Italian. If you know experimental Shakespeare, you've seen it all
before, many times.
</P>
<P>
   There is also exotic cinematic mood music by Elizabeth Swados,
which is used distractingly to underscore and punctuate what the
actors are saying. Hamlet's often-quoted advice to the traveling
players _ simply to ``speak the speech'' _ clearly has no place
here. The guiding principle of this ``Hamlet'' is that of fashion
victims everywhere: When in doubt, pile on another accessory.

TURKEY PUTS NEW STEAM IN OLD WAR ON INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Looking down at the cash he had just
withdrawn from his bank, Mahmut Sakin, a shopkeeper, saw something
he had been dreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised, because we were expecting it,'' Sakin said
as he scowled at the reviled object in his hand. ``But it sure is
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakin was holding a 10-million-lira note, newly issued by the
Turkish government and, with a value of less than $20, a symbol of
this country's inability to tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think about what's happened to our money,'' he
mused. ``This is a huge number, but you can't do much with it. It
isn't even enough to get you through a Sunday stroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks have been living with inflation for years, and have become
accustomed to jokes about how easy it is to make a million in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the prospect of membership in the European Union a
step closer since the European group earlier this month invited
Turkey to join a years-long process to negotiate entry, these jokes
no longer seem funny. Turkey must slay the inflationary beast if it
wants to join.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1970, it took just 14 Turkish lira to buy a
dollar. Now it takes more than half a million. Restaurant checks
are tallied in millions, telephone and electric bills in billions.
Corporate managers and government ministers routinely speak in
trillions.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers are too big for many computers, calculators and
cash registers. Bankers are urging the central bank, if it can do
nothing else, at least to cut off a few zeros.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate has fallen recently, but still stands at more
than 60 percent a year, marking Turkey as one of the few countries
in the world that has not managed to break an inflationary cycle.
Now, however, its leaders want to try.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new accord with the International Monetary Fund, Turkey
is expected to sell off state-owned companies, reduce subsidies and
price supports, raise the retirement age and cut the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation in Turkey is also fueled by government spending on two
hugely expensive projects that have together absorbed more than
$100 billion since the beginning of the 1990s. One, the war against
Kurdish insurgents, is already subsiding and may soon require far
less money.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's other big-ticket project is a series of dams and
reservoirs in southeastern provinces. Foreign countries have
refused to provide aid for the project, arguing that human rights
conditions in the region are unacceptable. If that now changes, and
if the Kurdish conflict continues to wind down, and Turkey moves
toward the European Union, which has set human rights improvements
as a condition for membership, these two great drains on the budget
may be at least partly plugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation has started to come down,'' Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said after returning from the summit meeting at which Turkey
was made an official candidate for membership in the European
Union. ``I believe we can bring the economy to a position ready for
full membership in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Ministry is equally optimistic. It is predicting
that inflation will drop to 25 percent by the end of 2000, 10
percent by the end of 2001, and single digits in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Private forecasters agree that inflation will fall, although
perhaps not that fast. They have also warned that groups affected
by the cutbacks may protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the disinflation policy is not a painless one,''
said Selcuk Demiralp, a senior official at the Treasury Ministry.
``We are truly committed to distributing the burden of adjustment
on different social groups on an equitable basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the European Union named Turkey as a ``candidate state,''
much attention has been focused on the sweeping political reforms
this country will have to make in order to meet European standards.
It will probably have to reduce the role of the military in
politics, repeal laws that restrict free speech and adopt a new
attitude toward Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Although these steps would be all but revolutionary, some
experts say that making the required economic changes will prove
even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political problems can be solved in one day if you have the
will,'' Dimitri Mardas, a Greek economist, said in a recent speech
in Istanbul. As a nation that joined what was then the European
Community in 1981, Greece knows both the economic and political
adaptations that membership demands, or helps create.
</P>
<P>
   ``You propose a law, you ratify it and the problem is over,''
Mardas said. ``But economic problems are much more difficult. They
can only be resolved very painfully over a long period of years.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once upon a time there was a really big kid who
grew up to be a really big kid.
</P>
<P>
   He had many talents. But the best thing he could do was take a
basketball in his large hand, leap a few inches off the ground and
throw it through a hoop ring. People would come from miles and give
him bags of gold to watch him do this amazing feat.
</P>
<P>
   But the really big kid was unfulfilled. He wanted people to
respect him for other things besides playing with a ball and
complaining to referees. He sang songs and made CDs. He pretended
he was someone else and made movies. But the people didn't seem to
care.
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided to write a book, just for kids. He called it
``Shaq and the Beanstalk and Other Very Tall Tales'' (Scholastic
Cartwheel Books, $15.95, illustrated by Shane W. Evans). He told
fairy tales. Except he put himself in as the main character.
</P>
<P>
   It looked kind of self-serving. But the kids laughed as they
read about Little Red Riding Shaq. And Shaq and the Three Bears.
And Shaq's New Clothes. And Shaq and the Three Billy Goats Gruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think they are tall tales?'' Shaq asked at the end of his
book. ``Well, OK, sure. Maybe I did s-t-r-e-t-c-h the truth a bit.
Maybe they are tall tales. But hey, what do you expect from a guy
who is over seven feet tall? Short tales?! I don't think so!''
</P>
<P>
   That made the kids laugh again.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq likes people to laugh with him, not at him. And this book
does just that.
</P>
<P>
   So the moral of this story: When you do something to help
programs like Reading is Fundamental, the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America, Athletes &AMP; Entertainers for Kids, City of Hope and
California Mentoring Initiative _ which is to get kids to read _
Shaq comes out a very, very big man indeed.

NO RADIO OR TV? NO WAY, BRADLEY RESPONDS TO GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A 1STTAKE will follow by 8:45 p.m. ET.) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said on Sunday he would halt
all radio and television commercials in his presidential campaign
if Bill Bradley did the same. But Bradley scoffed at what he called
``a ridiculous proposal'' and spurned it, almost laughingly, as a
shallow political gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   In a challenge that set off the most pointed and personal
exchanges thus far between the two Democratic competitors, Gore
proposed that rather than saturate the airwaves with advertisements
costing millions of dollars, the candidates debate twice a week
during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Offering his right hand to Bradley as they sat side-by-side in a
debate on the NBC program ``Meet the Press,'' Gore said, ``I'm
willing to do it right now, if you're willing to shake on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, looking unruffled and somewhat amused as he declined
the handshake, said, ``Al, that's good. I like that hand. But the
answer is no. I mean, why should I agree now? I'm not someone who's
interested in tactics, Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said afterward that they had not expected
Bradley to take up the challenge. Instead, they said they intended
to knock him off stride as well as tap into voter disgust with
political advertising, which some Americans consider the most
repellent aspect of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also sought to counter Bradley's claim that
he was the most authentic reformer in the race and overcome harsh
publicity about Gore's fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bradley held a high-profile town meeting with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, a Republican presidential contender, to
urge tighter campaign finance laws. The issue is of particular
appeal in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary and is one
state where both Democrats are running neck and neck in the polls,
though Gore remains ahead in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bradley had accepted the offer, it would be more in
Gore's interest to eliminate commercials because the he is already
better known than Bradley. And at this stage of the contest,
Bradley is spending more than Gore on television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to engage his rival, Gore risked appearing too
anxious, even desperate. And by mounting his challenge, the vice
president overshadowed one of his greatest assets, which had been
on display for the first half-hour of the debate: his mastery of
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarreling over Gore's challenge made for the
scrappiest, most revealing moments of the 60-minute encounter, the
candidates sparred over health care, foreign policy, education,
campaign finance and the Lewinsky scandal. Throughout the debate,
Gore sighed loudly at many of Bradley's claims, as when the former
senator described his proposal to replace Medicaid with a
subsidized health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bradley appeared calm and not particularly defensive, at
times he responded sarcastically to the vice president. After Gore
said he would rule out raising the entitlement age for Social
Security benefits _ and criticized Bradley for having once toyed
with the idea _ Bradley insisted that such a move must have been
broached in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't discuss it in all of your Social Security forums
out there?'' Bradley asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Bradley fired back, ``No one ever did, right? No one
ever did? Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates ruled out raising the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, questioning Gore's involvement in pressing for
campaign finance proposals, Bradley said he remembered visiting the
White House in 1993 with other party leaders and urging the
president to push for reforming the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you were in the loop or not,'' Bradley said
dismissively, ``but the fact of the matter is that no action took
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Gore responded, was ``because all the Republicans
voted against it.''
</P>

   MOZDOK, Russia _ Mikhail Kashpurin is a frail old man with years
of valorous service in the Soviet army, an unblemished labor record
and a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   And that story is this: He was in the wrong place at the wrong
time. The place was Grozny, and the time was Russia's military
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kashpurin, 76, is an ethnic Russian and no friend of the armed
rebels, some of them Islamic militants, who now roam the streets of
the Chechen capital. Born in Grozny, he lived with his wife in a
small wooden house on the southern outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They had no children, but enjoyed their friends and seemed to
have enough to get by. Kashpurin worked in a factory, and the
couple had a dog, a cat and 25 chickens. Kashpurin proudly
decorated his living room wall with 13 military awards from the
Great Patriotic War, as Russians call World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny's residents have endured so much hardship that not even
the prospect of a war necessarily impels them to flee. So when the
Russians began their attacks in Chechnya this fall, the Kashpurins
decided to keep an eye on the only property they had, take to their
cellar and ride out the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   They were hardly the only ones. As many as 45,000 civilians are
still trapped in Grozny, according to official Russian estimates.
What the Kashpurins, and thousands of other residents, did not
anticipate was that the airstrikes and artillery barrages would be
so fierce, even worse than the Russian bombardments during the
1994-96 war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military announced: `Don't worry. It will be precision
fire aimed at militants,''' Kashpurin recalled from his bed in this
southern Russian town. ``So we calmed down a bit. But then they
were hitting real hard. The artillery was very active, especially
the rockets and the large-caliber mortars. You practically don't
hear the shot, but the ground shakes when they explode. Oh, Lord, I
hate to even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrages never seemed to silence the militants, who
Kashpurin said had apparently hidden their anti-aircraft artillery
on a nearby hillside, then fired away at Russian warplanes as they
streaked by.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombardment continued, life in Grozny became almost
medieval. Even before the latest conflict, the Kashpurins had been
living without electricity, a legacy of the disorder that followed
the last Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Now the supplies began to dwindle as well. So they put a stove
in their courtyard and scrounged up some firewood for heat and for
preparing the kasha, or gruel, on which they survived. There was no
market in their neighborhood, but like other war-hardened residents
they had stored their own supply.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the bombing that kept them close to home.
Kashpurin, one of the few who have escaped Grozny to have given a
foreign reporter such a description of life inside the city, said
he lived in fear of bands of militants roaming Grozny's streets.
Tolik, his neighbor, walked with a limp from birth, but the
militants tried to press him into service and make him dig
trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crippled and could not handle the shovel, so eventually
they let him go,'' Kashpurin said. ``I don't think they could have
made me dig trenches. I am too old. But I might have been taken as
a hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Nov. 27, the day that shattered his life. ``I was
lying in bed when a plane zoomed by and fired a missile,'' he said.
``My wife was in the kitchen and was blown to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashpurin paused and appeared bewildered as if he could not
believe that this awful event had really happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on Dalnaya Street,'' he said. ``Forty houses were wiped
out like they never existed. So this street does not exist
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashpurin, now bedridden, is a bit hazy on what happened after
that. He knows that the ceiling collapsed and a heavy wardrobe
fell, pinning him to the ground. He knows that Tolik pulled him out
of the debris and that he lay on a concrete floor in a basement for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Then a neighbor, an old woman, decided to help. She was planning
to flee to her son, who lived in the Krasnodar region of southern
Russia, and she offered to take Kashpurin as far as Mozdok,
northwest of Chechnya. ``There was a problem getting out of
Grozny,'' Kashpurin said. ``There was no transportation, and I am
not one of these rich people who has a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulated through Grozny that the Russian government was
organizing a bus convoy to take civilians out of the city, but the
buses never appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Kashpurin was unable to walk, and his neighbors put him on a
sled and hauled him through the bombed-out streets until they found
a driver with an old Volga sedan who was willing to drive him out
of the Chechen capital for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the risk of being caught in cross-fire, the driver
avoided the main highway and instead headed out of town on the
bumpy Goragorskaya road, eventually arriving in the town of
Sleptsovsk across Chechnya's border in Ingushetia, a Russian
republic west of Grozny. ``The driver was afraid to go any farther
with Chechen license plates,'' Kashpurin said. ``So another driver
was hired to go to Mozdok.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashpurin now spends his days in bed in a small home in Mozdok,
which has taken in other ethnic Russians fleeing the fighting in
Chechnya. In a bitter twist, Mozdok is also the home of the Russian
military base that planes and helicopters use to pummel Grozny, and
the roar of the warplanes can be heard throughout the city as they
take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now I am alone without any rubles,'' he said, breaking out
again in a wail of tears. ``All my documents, my war veteran's
certificate and my 13 decorations have been lost. My God, what a
problem! I, Mikhail Aleksandrovich, am not a criminal. I have never
even been in a courtroom in my life. Why of all people did this
have to happen to me?''

MONSANTO AND PHARMACIA TO JOIN IN A DEAL VALUED AT $50 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Monsanto Co., which makes one of the world's best-selling
drugs but has come under fire recently over genetically altered
crops, and the drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. agreed to merge
Sunday in a deal that would create one of the world's largest
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies, which have a combined market value of about
$50 billion, plan to combine their growing pharmaceutical
operations and leap into the upper echelon of drug companies early
next year with more than $8 billion in worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
   Their union is an attempt to keep pace in the rapidly
consolidating world of drug makers, where big research and
development budgets and worldwide sales and distribution networks
are becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, however, will move quickly to shed the
agricultural division of Monsanto, which has come under increasing
criticism both in the United States and in Europe because of its
development of genetically modified crops, which emit their own
pesticides and immunize themselves against the use of herbicides
but also increase crop yields and hold out the promise of creating
more nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
   The new company plans to create an agricultural subsidiary and
then sell about 20 percent of the company to the public in an
initial public offering some time next year. The idea is to
separate the pharmaceutical and agricultural divisions, partly
because of shareholder complaints that the agricultural division
had been dragging down the stock price of Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   An outcry against the genetically modified crops began in Europe
earlier this year, and some of the concerns over safety have
reached American shores. A week ago, some of the nation's leading
antitrust lawyers filed a class-action suit against Monsanto,
contending the company rushed the products to market without
properly testing them. The suit also says that Monsanto, which is
now the world's second largest seed company, played a central role
in a international cartel that fixed the prices of corn and soybean
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives dismissed the suit, which is backed by
environmental advocates, as a political stunt meant to heighten
consumer fears and whip up hysteria. The company insists that the
products have been scientifically proven to be safe and that
regulators have approved their introduction in the United States,
where more than 70 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton have
been planted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, executives at Monsanto and Pharmacia say, the division of
the company will allow shareholders to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do recognize that we have some public relations issues,''
said Fred Hassan, the chief executive at Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, which
is based in Peapack, N.J. ``But the underlying science and
technology is very sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is a stock swap structured as a merger of
equals, was approved by the boards of the two companies over the
weekend. It is a union of two companies that have forged very
different paths to creating products that seek to improve the
health and well-being of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, the former chemical maker that transformed itself into
a life sciences company a few years ago, has been flirting with a
sale or merger since late last year, after its agreement to merge
with the American Home Products Corp. collapsed. Since then,
Monsanto has seen strong growth in Searle, its pharmaceutical
division, which earlier this year introduced Celebrex, the
blockbuster arthritis drug.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the big pharmaceutical company that has been
trying to bolster its presence in the United States, makes
everything from Xalatan, the best-selling glaucoma drug, to
Rogaine, the hair-growth treatment. The company also makes
Kaopectate, the over-the-counter diarrhea treatment, and Nicorette,
a gum that reduces tobacco dependency.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are expected to have combined sales of about
$17 billion this year. In drug sales alone, the new company could
become one of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be headed by Hassan. Robert B. Shapiro, the
chief executive of Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, will
serve as chairman of the new company, in a nonexecutive post, for
18 months and then will be succeeded by Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to merge with American Home Products, Monsanto was
rumored to be in taks about merging with DuPont and also Novartis.
But in recent weeks, people close to the deal said Pharmacia
emerged as the most likely partner, largely because it agreed to
take on the agriculture unit. The two companies then created what
they call a novel solution, creating a subsidiary that would be 80
percent owned by Pharmacia.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro called the entire merger ``terrific.'' He said it
combined two fast-growing drug companies with a diverse range of
products, complementary sales and marketing forces in the United
States and Europe and a $2 billion research and development budget,
among the largest in the industry.

<P>
   Just think what the language would be like without the Internet.
Until five or six years ago, ``Amazon'' was a very long, very big
river. ``Yahoo'' was a favorite expression of delight _ or, to
students of Jonathan Swift, a brutish creature. A ``web'' was for
spiders. ``Space'' was _ well, it was space. ``Dot-com,'' ``B2B,''
``e-commerce,'' ``e-mail.'' Whaaa?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the economy, and its Net effects.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, only 90,000 Americans, mostly academics, were
wired. Today, 80 million people in this country, and nearly 200
million worldwide, are online. Within two years, those numbers
could double.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail sales have risen from nothing to about $20
billion. Business-to-business transactions _ that B2B thing _ have
grown to $109 billion. By 2003, Forrester Research estimates,
online retail sales will grow to $144 billion, and B2B business
e-commerce will jump to $1.3 trillion. (That's just in the United
States, folks.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the stock market. Without the Internet, the
initial public offering market would be pretty dead. Without the
Internet, a slew of day traders might be otherwise engaged. Without
the Internet, the Nasdaq composite index almost certainly would not
be up more than 70 percent this year, and price/earnings ratios
would make a lot more sense.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with about six weeks left in the century, Mary
Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, and Jeff Camp, who follows Internet data services for the
firm, sat down to talk about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: There have been more than 200 Internet initial public
offerings this year. Is that pace sustainable in the coming 12
months?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: As long as the economic environment remains robust,
and as long as new categories of companies keep coming on, it
certainly seems as though it should. I think many people would
welcome a slowdown because each crop of companies is riskier than
the last one. That said, the aggregate opportunity is quite high
for high-risk/high-reward companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sorts of companies will we see? And how have the
waves gone so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: Increasingly, there will be new infrastructure plays.
Broadband is becoming increasingly real. Providing services to
build that business will be another big opportunity. Wireless is
another one. And many things are needed to provide for a better
user experience across the board. But the B2B theme, general
business re-engineering, will continue to be a big theme.
</P>
<P>
   It is also our view that sometime in the next year a traditional
company will throw out its traditional business model and become
more Internet-like, where it focuses on the long term and gets away
with it. To date, no one has had the guts to do it or has done it
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, we have had an infrastructure wave, including
companies like UUnet, PSI and Netccom; &UR;  &LR; a software wave, with
companies like Netscape and Spyglass; &UR;  &LR; a content wave, with
companies like Lycos, Yahoo and Excite, and retail and e-commerce,
like CDB Now and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each year a new crop of companies in a new category have
captured peoples' imaginations and created real businesses and real
wealth. Right now we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the
business-to-business area. Two years from now people may be focused
on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any reason to think that business-to-business
companies will generate profits faster than retailers like
Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   A: B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to profitability
compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if only because
Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses at these
companies will also probably not reach the level of e-commerce
companies. Right now it is too early to tell which companies are
going to be the big winners on an ongoing basis. One of the reasons
it is tough to predict is that many of these new companies are
looking at the history of the Internet and asking what lessons can
be learned from what has happened in the past. They have their eyes
much more wide open and are adapting a lot more quickly than
companies in the business-to-commerce area.
</P>
<P>
   I would feel comfortable saying that a year from now we will
have a lot more clarity about winners and losers. Often, the
biggest threat is not a market threat or a competitive threat, but
management error. That is something you can't predict.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which Internet infrastructure companies look promising?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: Four companies are worth highlighting: Exodus, which is
dominant in the high end of the United States Web hosting market;
InterNAP, which provides Internet connectivity services that
greatly increase performance and speed of company Web sites;
Akamai, a pioneer in the market for intelligent content
distribution services; and Verio, the largest Web hosting company
to small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were constructing an Internet portfolio you could not
trade at all for the next five years, which stocks would have to be
included?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: America Online, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nearly all of these companies, and a good chunk of their
managers, have never lived through a recession. What sort of impact
would a downturn have on Internet companies?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: If you think B2B, businesses are getting online for cogent
economic reasons: It reduces procurement costs; it increases
productivity; inventory management and so forth. It is unlikely
that a recession would derail that overall trend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: It could accelerate it.
</P>
<P>
   Camp: It may impact what consumers do, but my guess is that the
much larger part of the Internet, which is business-related, is
going to be moving along that trend for the reasons I just
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a decent argument that parts of the Internet are
going to be recession-proof. If you are a business going online,
you need a Web site, you need Internet access and all the different
tools and components that go into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite its rapid growth, the move to the Internet is still
in its infancy. Where are we, and how much of a lead does the
United States have on the rest of the industrialized world?
</P>
<P>
   A: It seems as if the Internet is everywhere, but it is really
concentrated in the hands of a group of very large companies.
Ninety percent of large businesses have a Web site or are doing
something on the Web. Ten percent of small businesses do. When you
consider that small businesses represent half the gross domestic
product in this country and represent 99 percent of all businesses,
a large part of the market is not engaged yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: In terms of development, Europe is probably where
the United States was in 1995 or 1996. There are a few reasons for
this.
</P>
<P>
   First, personal computer penetration isn't as high as it is in
the United States. Second, telecommunications availability is more
restrictive, and costs are higher. And regional boundaries _
language and other things _ are part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Internet growth is accelerating in those markets.
Financial service companies are more aggressive about online
banking than they have been here. And wireless Internet
connectivity is going to happen faster in Europe than here. That is
a big opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, more than half the usage by European
consumers appears to be targeted at American sites. For example, we
believe Yahoo is probably the leading Web site in France, Britain
and Germany. From a content perspective, the Yahoo and America
Online of Europe may be Yahoo and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as though experience is a great comparative
advantage. Is that the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who wring their hands whenever Amazon's or eBay's or
Schwab's site crashes should remember that those companies are
making mistakes many companies only wish they could make, because
they are servicing so much volume. They get smarter and smarter and
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Something on the order of 50 percent of all e-commerce knowledge
resides in the brains of Amazon.com employees or Amazon
programmers. They know the patterns when an average American or
foreigner goes online. That knowledge has helped these companies
become so big and to understand how to move into new markets in a
very competitive and aggressive way.
</P>
<P>
   I would not want to compete with Microsoft or Netscape or Yahoo,
or go toe-to-toe with Amazon.com or eBay. The leading companies of
today will not be failures because of start-ups. If they fail, it
will be because they made a tactical error or one of the other
leaders morphs into their business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of Microsoft, what do you think is going to happen
with the antitrust case? Will the company be broken up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the best thing to happen here is that they settle the
case and go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The focus I have had is on whether an adverse ruling will
fundamentally change the company's business model. But the things
that will fundamentally change Microsoft's business model are
already in place.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the bad news is that they will not have the kind of
market share on the Internet that they had on the personal computer
platform. The good news is that the Internet, whatever it is, is
much bigger, and they are in a position where they potentially
could have smaller market shares in many markets, so that might not
be such a bad thing.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The executive offices, with a half-dozen
paper-strewn desks in two rooms of a third-floor walk-up, are just
across the street from the basement nerve center where more than
two dozen people hunch over laptops and chatter to one another in
the dull glow of the computer screens. In other words, the ragged
bifurcated headquarters of iFilm looks pretty much like a cliched
rendering of an Internet start-up company, which is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also, in its way, a movie studio of the future.
Throughout the entertainment industry, from the major studios to
Internet start-up companies, people are trying to figure out how
the rapidly emerging digital technology will affect the movies that
people see and the ways that they see them. What iFilm is doing _
distributing digital films through the Internet to anyone with a
computer while also providing a forum for filmmakers and industry
executives to find each other _ is a good example of how this
technology is mutating the power structures that have governed
Hollywood since the advent of the talkies in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a movie studio is changing as we watch,'' said
Rodger Raderman, one of iFilm's founders and its co-chairman.
``What is a studio? If you think of it as a place where movies are
developed, produced, marketed and distributed, then we are very
close to having a technology where one person can do that all by
himself. Each person can be his own studio.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood, an industry that claims to have its finger on the
pulse of mass audience tastes, it is a perplexing time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie business is moving into an interesting, perhaps
perilous and largely unknown period when the economics of
filmmaking and the very foundation of the power structures that
have governed the business for almost a century are more fluid than
at any time in its history. The pace of change and the revolution
in technology are outstripping entertainment executives' ability to
comprehend and control their business. Unease is the mood of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites devoted to producing digital films or, like iFilm,
providing a forum for digital films produced by others have been
proliferating in recent months as wave after wave of innovative
software and hardware have begun to ease what many see as the
inevitable transition between an old film-based technology and a
new digital movie world. The common wisdom among industry analysts
is that it will take three to five years for a sufficient number of
American households to acquire either digital television sets or
broadband capabilities for their computers, making it easy and
profitable for companies to pipe films to them on the Internet.
Sometime after that, they say, in maybe another two to three years,
the technology will be in place to allow people to call up movies
on demand _ simply ordering up whatever they want, when they want
it _ obviating the need for scheduled programming or video stores.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to Hollywood then? Will people still go out to
the movies?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Raderman said, iFilm is not out to eat Hollywood's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are not the enemy,'' stressed Skip Paul, a
longtime Universal Pictures executive who founded Sega GameWorks,
the arcade company, with Steven Spielberg and was named iFilm's
other co-chairman last month.
</P>
<P>
   What iFilm wants to do, Raderman said, is ``enable'' filmmakers
and entertainment executives to meet each other in a kind of
high-technology forum where digital films can be shown through
their Web sites, where filmmakers can trade information about their
craft and where Hollywood agents and producers can gossip with one
another on a protected site and shop around for fresh ideas and new
talent. The ``communal experience'' of the movie theater will
remain important to consumers, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the future: some youngster in Indiana making a movie on
his hand-held digital camcorder, editing it on his laptop and
shipping it to someplace like iFilm, where it can be piped into
every living room in America in a blink? Will filmmaking finally
become, as Orson Welles once described it, the best toy train set a
kid ever had?
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is evolving so fast, and we want to be in the
catbird's seat when broadband becomes a reality,'' said Spielberg,
whose DreamWorks SKG studio is joining Imagine Entertainment to
create Pop.com, a Web site that will present short, original
digital films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strides that the technology has made in the last year,
really in just the last six months or so, has led me to believe
that this is really the birth of a new medium, a shift from
information to entertainment on the Internet, which will create
some great opportunities for creative people to do new kinds of
work,'' said Ron Howard, the director who co-founded Imagine, one
of Hollywood's most prolific movie and television production
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is nervous about the coming years because three things
are happening simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   First, movie technology, from the way films are made to the way
they will be shown, is riding an incredible high-technology wave
driven by the marriage of new digital movie-making gizmos and the
Internet, from digital cameras to digital editing software to
digital projectors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional movies have become more and more
expensive to produce. Driven by huge salaries for the top talent,
escalating production costs and more expensive marketing demands,
movie studios are struggling to find new formulas to make movies _
at a profit _ that will satisfy an increasingly fickle and
unpredictable audience. Because all the major studios are owned by
larger corporations, which increasingly see them as mere divisions
within a larger money-making machine, these dwindling profits have
led to growing cost-cutting demands from corporate patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the demographic bulge _ the so-called boomer
echo generation, even larger than the boomers who gave birth to
them _ that in the next decade will come into their adolescence and
early adulthood, their prime movie-going years. So much money to be
made. Can anybody figure out what these movigoers will want to see
_ and how they are going to want to see it?
</P>
<P>
   If the future is, as many believe, somehow brewing out there in
the world of digital technology and broadband distribution, then
its larval state must be here, in the basement nerve center of
places like iFilm. Raderman recently huddled over a screen,
watching a display of new iFilm software that makes viewing films
on a computer screen more pleasurable (it blacks out all of the
screen but the window showing the film, like a letterbox format).
</P>
<P>
   Basically, there are three technical issues that are being
resolved at this very moment by iFilm and other cybercompanies,
Raderman said. Movies have been available on the Internet for
years, but they have been an unsatisfying experience for most
viewers; available only in partial screen windows, taking forever
to download on most currently used modems, often herky-jerky when
played on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough has been compression software, which
allows the computer to read the image as it is playing and refresh
only those parts that are changing _ say, lips and facial
expressions if a person is talking into a camera against a static
background. Much time is saved, and the image moves more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The second technical issue is so-called streaming video.
Previously, to play a film on a home computer, viewers had to
download the whole film and then play it back. With streaming
video, now available on most home computers, the movie begins to
play when it is only partly downloaded; the remainder of the film
downloads in the background while the first portion plays, thus
reducing waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Raderman said, there is the issue of the ``size of the
pipeline'' _ that is, how the digital images are transmitted into
the computer or television set, whether by modem or cable or
satellite. There are almost constant improvements to the capacity
of the line, he said, and in getting more information through
existing lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that this becomes a viable company when 20
percent'' of the people have the technology for watching movies on
the Internet, said Lucas McDonough, iFilm's other founder and its
president. ``That's coming soon. These things are going to be
resolved simply because there is so much money to be made in
resolving them.''

GORE, BRADLEY SPAR ON HEALTH CARE, CAMPAIGN FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Senator Bill Bradley, seated just a foot
away from Vice President Al Gore, looked at Gore's outstretched
hand and refused to shake it.
</P>
<P>
   In the most heated debate of the Democratic presidential
campaign, Gore and Bradley clashed Sunday over health care and
campaign finance on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' When Gore challanged
Bradley to end television ads, Bradley refused to shake hands on
the deal, dismissing it as a ``ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds to me like you're having trouble raising money,''
Bradley said, of the suggestion to replace radio and television ads
with a series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, as a matter of fact, I'm not,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this is a ridiculous proposal,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion didn't end there. ``You know something,'' Bradley
told Gore, ``for 10 months that I was running for president, you
ignored me. You pretended I didn't exist. Suddenly I started to do
better, and you want to debate every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore apparently made the offer partly to try to undercut
Bradley's image as the reformer in the race. Bradley last Thursday
shook hands with a Republican candidate, Senator John McCain of
Arizona, on a proposal to stop accepting unregulated ``soft money''
contributions to the respective parties if both men become the
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of advertising initially put Bradley on the defensive,
as he apologized for what he called the unauthorized distributions
of flyers that accused Gore of ``uncontrollable lying'' about
Bradley's health care plan. Still, Bradley complained that Gore has
run unfair ads, especially about Bradley's health care plan. When
Bradley asked Gore to apologize for ads he has run, Gore refused,
saying there was no reason to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Health care dominated much of the debate. Bradley said his
program would directly cover 30 million out of 44 million Americans
without health insurance, with the remainder eligible for tax
breaks, which Bradley said means that his program provides ``access
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd leave no one out,'' Bradley said. Turning to Gore, he
said: ``And I think the question is who would you leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   The program's host, Tim Russert, then interjected to say that
Gore's plan would directly cover only 12 million uninsured
Americans, starkly drawing the lines of the debate that is a daily
controversy on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Bill and I have the same goal, to get to universal health
insurance,'' said Gore, who has proposed first providing coverage
to all children. ``He just told you that his plan leaves out some
14 million and offers them the chance to deduct health care
insurance premiums from their income taxes, but most of the people
who don't have health care today don't have premiums to deduct, so
they're left out. I think we have to get to universal health
insurance, and I think the way to do it is to get there step by
step.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, the two candidates disagreed about the
impact of Bradley's proposal to eliminate Medicaid as part of his
health care overhaul. Gore said that Bradley intends to replace the
current Medicaid setup by giving people ``little $150-a-month
vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong. That's not correct,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Russert said that the Clinton-Gore administration
proposed a similar plan to replace Medicaid, Gore and Bradley got
into an argument marked mostly by interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: No. What he replaces . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: . . . replaces it with . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Wrong. That's not right.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: What he proposes to replace it with . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: That's not correct.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: . . . are vouchers that are limited to $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: No.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley eventually explained that the vouchers would average
$150 and that his plan would cover many people who have neither
health insurance or Medicaid. Gore said Bradley's plan would so
costly it would be impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The two battled in similar fashion over Social Security, as
Russert attempted again and again to get both candidates to explain
how they would shore up Social Security without further raising the
retirement age. Both candidates have said they oppose raising the
retirement age, but Gore repeatedly criticized Bradley for once
considering raising the age at which retirement benefits are
available.
</P>
<P>
   When Russert asked whether Gore would ever consider raising the
retirement age, Gore at first said he wouldn't in the ``forseeable
future.'' But Gore then made his position absolute. ``I'll say
ever, sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked by Russert what ``tough choices'' they would make
about Social Security, both candidates were vague.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would convene ``a bipartisan approach to this
problem to consider all the possibilities,'' while once again
excluding the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore: ``I will guarantee that in a Gore presidency, you
will have the leadership to solve whatever problem confronts Social
Security and Medicare without raising the retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men also clashed over what many Democrats consider the
top campaign issue, education. Gore noted that Bradley voted for
experimental school voucher programs, which supply public money to
help parents send their children to private schools. Gore said he
never voted for the programs because they would drain money from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anyone should question my commitment to
public education,'' Bradley said. ``I also don't think they should
question what I've proposed. I believe that there should be a
strong federal commitment to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert kept pounding away on the voucher issue, asserting that
many non-Catholic parents are sending their children to Catholic
schools because they believe public schools are not good enough.
``Why not give them a couple hundred bucks to offset the burden of
tuition?'' Russert asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first of all,'' Gore said, ``the flaw with the voucher
theory is that the vast majority of those who receive a tiny little
down payment on the tuition cannot afford the rest of it, and when
you drain that money out of the public school system, it kicks off
a downward spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried, as he has frequently, to walk a fine line when asked
about President Clinton's legacy. Russert set up the issue by
asking Gore to name the greatest presidents, to which Gore gave
examples ranging from George Washington to John F. Kennedy. Then
Russert, noting that Gore had called Clinton one of the greatest
presidents, asked whether he would put Clinton in the company of
Washington and others. ``No, of course not,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The format of the debate clearly helped the sparks fly. The
first Democratic debate, on the campus of Dartmouth College,
featured audience questions that let the candidates ruminate and
not challenge each other. The second debate, a taping of ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' that aired last Friday night, was so languid that
host Ted Koppel at one point said that the candidates had answered
only a few questions during the first hour of the 90-minute show.
Sunday's hourlong debate, by contrast, was aggressively overseen by
Russert, who didn't mind interrupting the candidates to keep the
questions coming. Moreover, the placement of the two candidates so
close to each other at the same table created more visual
interaction, such as when Bradley declined to shake Gore's hand on
banning ads.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the debate's conclusion, the campaign staffs
went into e-mail overdrive, sending missives to reporters about the
supposed failures of the opposing candidate during the television
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley cites Lincoln, but refuses to debate,'' the Gore
e-mail said, referring to Bradley's praise of Lincoln as one of the
greatest presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore resorted to gimmickry out of a lack of confidence in
his own positive vision,'' the Bradley campaign retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the day's harsh tone, Gore said during the debate that
he didn't consider any of his criticisms of Bradley to be personal.
The vice president pledged that he would never run a ``personal
negative ad'' during the campaign.

RUSSIAN NEIGHBORS VOTE EARLY AND GRUMBLE OFTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-ELECT) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Her husband walked through mushy snow,
still in his thick brown knit sleeping shirt, to vote early in
Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday, but Mariya Chashena, 78
and feeling stiff, was in no shape to get out. So a delegation of
election officials trudged to her minuscule second-story walkup and
stood sardined in the kitchen as she sat beneath a yellowed poster
of Russia's czars, and committed democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medved! The bear means wealth,'' she declared, and marked a
big ``X'' on a ballot next to an emblem of a prowling bear. An
official held out a battered gray suitcase, fishing line wrapped
around it to prevent tampering, and she stuffed her choices through
a slot cut in the top, next to the handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``With pleasure,'' she said solemnly, ``I cast my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Polling Station 1380 helped elect the lower house of
Russia's parliament Sunday, with a 40-year-old suitcase and fishing
line and, more often than not, a good deal of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   In this once opulent neighborhood near the imposing fortress
that was Peter the Great's landmark when founding this city, now
badly frayed by Soviet neglect and capitalist poverty, perhaps half
of the 1,450 registered voters turned out in winter's half-daylight
to cast their ballots. Officials scoured the area to take ballots
to at least a dozen more shut-ins like Mrs. Chashena.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a scene straight out of Norman Rockwell, if one can
imagine Norman Rockwell in a fur hat and old boots painting the
militiamen in camouflage and carbines who stood by to ensure order.
</P>
<P>
   The militia, it must be stressed, were utterly unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has given us an end to fear,'' said Sergei
Dimitrievsky, a 45-year-old worker at a local military plant.
``Right now, I am speaking with a foreign journalist and nobody is
going to call me into his office tomorrow. I can do what I want,
and I have freedom of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell might have blanched at the leather-jacketed fellow with
five days' stubble who weaved toward the ballot station exit
proclaiming that he had voted for democracy, but had forgotten
precisely which democratic party he supported.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Pyotr B. Shelisch, the incumbent legislator and a
member of the liberal Yabloko party, who said that the campaign had
been largely free of trickery excepting, perhaps, the fire that
reduced Yabloko headquarters here to cinders last month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a day in this Petersburg precinct also suggested that
there is much about the electoral process _ good and bad _ that a
Chicago ward heeler would probably recognize.
</P>
<P>
   There was, first and foremost, a choice: 27 parties on the
ballot in all. There were Stalinists, two women's parties, several
flavors of Communists and even a vanity party, wholly owned and
operated by a Trumpian tycoon whose portrait graces his personal
brand of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, only a handful were clear favorites: the Communist
Party of the Russian Federation; Fatherland/All Russia, an
anti-Kremlin coalition led by the mayor of Moscow and former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov; and the pro-Kremlin Unity Party, also
known as Medved _ or Bear _ from its symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's two foremost parties advocating Western-style
democracy, Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, are less popular.
But polls forecast that they were likely to gather the minimum 5
percent of votes necessary to win the status in parliament of a
party bloc.
</P>
<P>
   In the crumbling high school that served as a polling place,
lined up along the familiar institutional green walls, were
observers from various parties watching for cheating and a few
policemen doing nothing much except creating a sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hall, in civics-book order, sat a row of men
and women behind tables decked in red, checking the identity of
prospective voters. Beyond them stood three voting booths _ less
booths, really, than plywood dividers draped in red curtains where
voters could mark ballots in relative privacy.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a lot about the Russian electoral process to
disconcert Westerners _ flambeed campaign offices, the lingering
use of the Russian word for ``agitation'' to describe campaigning,
the voters' complacent acceptance of flagrantly corrupted
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who comes into power steals. I know that,'' said Nina
Danilova, a 45-year-old nurse, after mentioning one candidate who,
she said, flaunts four fully outfitted Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   There also seems little doubt that Russian democracy remains a
daffodil in the snow. By anyone's measure, the campaign that ended
Sunday was brutal and often lawless, filled with slanderous attacks
and in all likelihood paid for with dirty money.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no doubt that many voters are disgusted.
``Democracy has come to a dead end in Russia,'' said Valery Gulya,
48, a radio electronics engineer who said he helped build Russia's
new Topol nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles before he was laid off
a year ago. ``Russia doesn't have democracy, but demokrazha,'' he
added, playing on the word ``krazha,'' or theft. As Gulya
complained, he finished voting for Yabloko and its strong
anti-corruption platform.
</P>
<P>
   What made the scene at Polling Station 1380 Sunday remarkable
was its very ordinariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here four years ago,'' Viktor Fyodorov, a polling
official, said as he finished delivering a ballot to one elderly
shut-in. ``The same two chairs were in the same place. The same
woman voted. Who is to say that anything has changed?''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation whose new democracy falls well short of Western
hygienic standards, that was a refreshing statement all by itself.

   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-ECONOMY (Undated) _ Historians say the Internet
should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a
successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological
step than a leap forward. Still, whether labeled a revolution or an
evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to
become greater and greater. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic showing
business investment in computers, peripherals and software.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-REFLECTIONS (Undated) _ When eight well-known executives
were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last
100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably
talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad
forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet. By
Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-READER-VISIONS (Undated) _ Asked for proposals to
improve the human condition in the next century, people were
generous with their ideas. Many visions fell into broad categories
like health, nutrition, education and transportation. This article
offers a sampling of responses.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-DEMOGRAPHICS (Undated) _ Five years into a booming
economy, America is ``depleting its pool of available workers'' _ a
warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of
known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply
an expanding work force _ and sustain a robust economy _ into the
new decade. This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and
potential immigrants. By Louis Uchitelle. (With graphic.)

Federal Reserve, which has risen from virtual obscurity to near

   OUTLOOK-CURRENCY (Undated) _ The history of money and its
future. The century began with a universal money _ gold _ and ends
with gold all but eliminated. In its place are national currencies,

currency, the euro. A look at what lies ahead. By Floyd Norris.

</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BIOTECH (Undated) _ For several years, the big quest in
biotechnology has been to determine the complete sequence of human
DNA, the genetic code of life. Now, however, that task is nearing
completion, and the biotechnology industry is facing an even
tougher job _ deciphering that code so that new drugs and
diagnostic tests can be developed. By Andrew Pollack. (With graphic

</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AGRICULTURE (Undated) _ Agribusiness leaders are as
confident as ever that the need to feed a growing world population
makes it both essential and inevitable that biotechnology will play
a central role in 21st century farming. But for now it looks like
the industry may be pulled over by consumers and fined by investors
for recklessly speeding toward such a future. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans who have complaints about
the health care system may soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many
health care professionals expect the medical system in the United
States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades
that many patients will not be able to recognize it. By David J.
Morrow.

second century in 2003, is still far from a mature industry, and
for the next decade it seems likely to move in two directions at
once. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-OIL (Undated) _ Of all the pressures on the oil industry

</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS-REED (Undated) _ As a young Citicorp executive
more than 20 years ago, John S. Reed earned a reputation as a
technology guru. Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the
country's largest financial services concern and the creation of
last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his
interest in technology, Reed admitted in an interview that the
impact and importance of the Internet escaped his attention until
recently. By Timothy L. O'Brien. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS (Undated) _ In the wake of the historic changes
made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation
is expected among financial services companies, creating more
conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United
States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment
bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say. By Patrick
McGeehan. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The changes remaking retailing come
not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases but in
what they expect their dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than
they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet
that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes,
than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores. By Leslie Kaufman.

scandals. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ If using the Internet rather than
spread sheets and word processors is driving the growth of the
personal computer industry, then mobile access to the Internet is
likely to dominate in short order. Who could possibly argue that
surfing the Web while trapped sitting in a chair at a desk is
natural or inevitable? The one flaw in this argument is that PC
sales are not shrinking. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-DAD (Undated) _ The Internet has many fathers,
but few deserve the label more than Robert W. Taylor. In 1966, as a
director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency
Information Processing Techniques Office, Taylor came up with the
idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. An interview. By
John Markoff. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WEB-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ If 1999 was the year everyone
started saying that Internet-based software would replace
conventional programs, 2000 will surely be the year the transition
begins in earnest. By Lawrence M. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET (Undated) _ Future developments in the Internet
regarding business should come in waves. Those who are studying the
relationship between business and the still-primitive and slow
Internet say that in five or 10 years those waves could well
reshape the way business is conducted. This transformation will
happen because, very basically but profoundly, the Internet permits
ease and breadth of communication, provides newfound mobility and
allows complex transactions to take place among numerous parties in
far-flung regions. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-E-COMMERCE (Undated) _ Ten years ago, Internet
prognosticators sounded overzealous when they suggested that a
network of computers would recast every facet of society. Some of
the most futuristic and utopian predictions may never play out, of
course. But the Net does seem to be bringing irrevocable change to
one part of life: buying stuff. The E-commerce column. By Bob
Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMUNICATIONS (Undated) _ Over the last decade,
cellular telephones have evolved from oddity to indulgence to
everyday accessory. Discuss the future of wireless technology with
leading communications executives, and the words ``phone'' and
``telephone'' may not be used at all. That is because they see the
future of wireless technology as having little to do with talking
and everything to do with putting the Internet into pockets and
purses around the world. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-PATENTS (Undated) _ The patents column: The debate, and
resulting litigation, over the importance of patents in the
Internet's development. By Teresa Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-NEWSPAPERS (Undated) _ Challenged to recreate themselves
both online and in print, newspapers _ and their advertisers _ have
a greater appetite for information about their appeal, their
audiences and their competition than ever, according to both those
who gather data on the Internet and those who use the data. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Shakespeare's exclamation ``O
brave new world'' is an appropriate way to begin an examination of
what advertising will be like when years no longer begin with 19.
It is even more appropriate that those words are from ``The
Tempest'' because the changes facing Madison Avenue in the next
decade will be nothing if not tumultuous. By Stuart Elliott. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MOVIES (San Francisco) _ Throughout the entertainment
industry, from the major studios to Internet start-up companies,
people are attempting to figure out how the rapidly emerging
digital technology will affect the movies people see and the ways
they see them. By Rick Lyman. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-TELEVISION (Undated) _ Although executives in the worlds
of television and entertainment are not entirely certain about the
details of the convergence of television, computers and broadband
cable systems, all agree that the experience of watching television
will prove extraordinarily different in 26 years from today's
viewing. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WALLSTREET (Undated) _ Electronic trading is driving new
market structures, so Wall Street is approaching the new millennium
the way superstitious pilots approach the Bermuda Triangle _
fearing the worst, hoping for the best but prepared for just about
anything. By Diana B. Henriques. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MARKETS (Undated) _ The upward march of the stock market
indexes has become so inexorable in recent years that most
strategists no longer weigh whether the market will rise next year.
Instead, they speculate on just how much higher it will go. By
Gretchen Morgenson. (with graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ Last month, with about
six weeks left in the century, Mary Meeker, head of the Internet
research team at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Jeff Camp, who
follows Internet data services for the firm, sat down to talk about
the future of Internet stocks. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MUTFUNDS (Undated) _ Are the mutual fund industry's best
days behind it? Sales gains are slowing. Fund company stocks are
lagging. Some fund investors have taken their big gains and cashed
in. And challenges from cheaper institutionalized money managers,
online brokerage firms and other new competitors have led some
analysts to predict that the industry is only starting to see tough
times. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMODITIES (Undated) _ If the decade of the '90s was
the greatest ever for stock prices, it was one of the poorer for
commodity prices. But as the decade ends, there are signs of life
in commodities. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing the
CRB Index since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTEREST-RATES (Undated) _ Inflation is calm. The
Federal Reserve is vigilant. And the Federal budget deficit has
disappeared. So conditions should be right for long-term interest
rates finally to fall decisively below 5 percent, a level they have
seen only briefly in the final third of the century about to end.
Maybe. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing interest
rates since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WORKPLACE (Undated) _ Across the country, thousands of
people who tried working from home part time during the 1990s have
returned to the office full time. It is enough to make one wonder
whether the workplace of the early 21st century will in fact
resemble a traditional office much more than was once thought. Do
not be fooled, workplace experts say, contending that in reality
this is the lull before the telecommuting storm. By David
Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CORPORATIONS (Undated) _ For five years a klatch of
management scholars and forward-looking executives has met at the
Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology to ponder a question: What will be tomorrow's model for
business success? By Fred Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-GLOBAL (Washington) _ A decade ago it would have been
hard to imagine that at the end of the century the world economy
would mix unparalleled American ascendancy with such pervasive
global anxiety, or that free-marketeers would be celebrating the
triumph of market capitalism while so many around the globe
questioned the cost of its victory. By David E. Sanger. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-JAPAN (Tokyo) _ To almost everyone's surprise, the
Japanese economy showed remarkable _ and remarkably diverse _ signs
of life this year. But there are many contradictions in the
economy, making it difficult to be either optimistic or pessimistic
when it comes to Japan's prospects as the century turns. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CHINA (Beijing) _ When negotiators from China and the
United States clinked their champagne glasses here last month to
celebrate a trade agreement between the two countries, nobody
exulted more than China's Internet entrepreneurs. The deal, which
opens the door to China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
will also allow foreign companies to own stakes of up to 50 percent
in Chinese Internet companies by 2006. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ After weathering a year of debt
defaults, a currency crash, an absentee president and governments
that change with the seasons, Russians have one piece of good news:
The economy has not collapsed. By Neela Banerjee. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Europe enters the new year
and the new millennium on a mission of staggering scale: an
expansion of the European Union by 13 countries and some 170
million people. By Edmund L. Andrews. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ On the theory
that things cannot get much worse, Latin America is looking to the
start of the new decade with anticipation. The past year has been a
difficult one, more onerous even than the crisis that followed the
Mexican meltdown in December 1994: It began with a currency
collapse in Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with
the numbers now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's
large economies struggling to emerge from recession. By Larry
Rohter. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-ASIA (Singapore) _ Southeast Asia's battered economies
have bounced back this year, and the most serious concern in the
year 2000, economists say, will not be the region's enduring
banking mess but the possibility that things could unexpectedly
turn ugly in the United States or Japan. By Wayne Arnold. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-OUTDATED-PRODUCTS (Undated) _ Phonograph records,
flypaper, typewriters, windup watches, carbon paper. They are
products that most people of a certain age grew up with but that
have largely vanished, usually with little notice, from everyday
life. Something presumably better has taken their place. But while
they are forgotten by many, they are not gone. By Robert D. Hershey
Jr. (With photo.)

POPE PLANS A SIX-DAY TOUR OF THE HOLY LAND IN MARCH
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II plans to fly to Israel on March 21
for a six-day tour of Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, Bethlehem
and the Sea of Galilee region, Israel's government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The visit would make John Paul just the second pope to travel to
the Holy Land, and the first to make an official visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While in Jerusalem, the pope is also expected to visit Yad
Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, and is considering a stop
at the Western Wall, a site venerated by observant Jews, said Moshe
Fogel, the director of the Israeli government's press office.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Sunday was the first official Israeli
confirmation of the long-anticipated papal visit, though the
Vatican would not confirm the plan. Fogel said, however, the dates
for the visit have been fixed by the Holy See and that details of
the pope's daily schedule were being arranged.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican diplomatic team departed Israel for Rome Sunday after
planning a tentative six-day itinerary that would begin at Tel
Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, where the pope is expected to be
received by Israel's president and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Paul VI visited the region briefly in 1964, entering Israel
for what was termed a private one-day visit to Nazareth. The
Vatican did not extend full diplomatic recognition to Israel until
1994.
</P>
<P>
   This time the visit is to be an official one, and the pope's
first destination after arrival is scheduled to be Jerusalem, where
he is planning to stay in a Roman Catholic Church residence on the
Mount of Olives, Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount of Olives is in the largely Arab eastern section of
the city, where the Vatican, like most nations, does not recognize
Israeli sovereignty. The pope also plans to spend at least a day in
Palestinian territory, meeting with the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, and saying Mass at the 1,500-year-old Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee region, the pope
is expected to return to Jerusalem for Mass on March 26 in the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher, traditionall considered the site of
Jesus' tomb.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient church has only a single narrow door. Israeli
security authorities, concerned about a large crowd at the Mass,
have been unable to persuade the often-quarreling Christian
denominations that control the church to open a new emergency
entrance in time for the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Local church leaders had said the pope's trip might be
jeopardized by Israel's authorization of the construction of a
mosque in Nazareth next to the Basilica of the Annunciation,
believed by Christians to be the place where the angel Gabriel told
Mary she would give birth to the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the pope's schedule is to include a
visit to the Nazareth church on March 25 for the celebration of the
Feast of the Annunciation, Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reneging on an agreement with Israeli authorities, Muslim
activists in Nazareth recently reinstalled a large tent on the site
of their future mosque, which is adjacent to the Basilica walls.
Though a cornerstone for the mosque was laid last month,
construction was postponed until after the pope's expected visit
under a compromise brokered by Israel's Ministry of Internal
Security.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles east of Nazareth, on the shores of the Sea of
Galilee, the pope plans to celebrate an outdoor Mass at a Catholic
youth gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites he may visit in the Galilee area are the
lakeside hill where Christ is traditionally believed to have
delivered his Sermon on the Mount, and the nearby Church of the
Heptapegon, revered as the place where Jesus fed a multitude with
five loaves of bread and two fishes.

AMERICANS ARE WARNED TO BE VIGILANT OVER HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States' top national security official
Sunday urged Americans to be ``vigilant'' as they proceed with
their holiday plans, ands worry about the threat of domestic
terrorism seems to have spread after an Algerian man was charged
with smuggling bombmaking materials across the border from British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Although National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger said he was
unaware of any other specific threat against U.S. targets and law
enforcement officials said they had taken every step possible to
ensure the public's safety, they nonetheless acknowledged a
heightened risk of terrorism against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The warning about domestic terrorism at home follows a State
Department alert recently issued for Americans traveling abroad,
which Berger called a ``yellow light, not a red light.'' But, taken
together, they underscore the concern that has been wrought by the
arrest of Ahmed Ressam, 32, identified as an Algerian national
traveling on fake Canadian identity papers and linked to extremists
using Montreal as a North American base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was charged Friday in Seattle with carrying more than 100
pounds of bomb-making supplies and a sophisticated detonating
device across the border in a rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the U.S. Customs Service began the first day of beefed
up patrols at the 301 ports of entry into the United States,
including several in Maine and Vermont, following a high alert the
agency put in place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the arrest and seizure last week, we are
redoubling our efforts,'' said Customs Service spokesman Dennis
Murphy. ``We're having more eyes and ears out there to be alert to
anything that might be out there. Inspectors need to be vigilant,
to look out for anything that could be out of the ordinary or
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Ressam's arrest and the unanswered questions about the
nature of the plot he was allegedly involved in, Berger, speaking
on the CBS's ``Face the Nation'' said: ``As we head toward the New
Years, the millennium, the end of Ramadan, this is a period of
heightened risk of terrorist actions involving Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Americans should be vigilant as they go about
their plans for the New Year,'' he said. ``If they see something
suspicious, or see packages or activities that they think are
unusual, they should obviously let law enforcement people know.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said U.S. officials were not aware of ``any other
specific threat against particular targets in the United States,
and, obviously, if that changes we'll alert the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to discuss details of how security is being
beefed up in Washington and across the country for end-of-the
century celebrations, FBI spokeswoman Debra Weierman said ``there
is heightened security at this time because it's the millennium,''
and said the agency was working with state and local law
enforcement agencies to ensure that security was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All precautions that can possibly be made have been made and
will undergo activation'' once the festivities start, Weierman
said, including the mass events on the Mall in Washington and in
New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre refused to discuss possible
security around the White House complex, but echoed Berger in
saying ``there are risks out there'' about which the public needed
to be aware.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian authorities say they believe that Ressam may
be part of a larger conspiracy stretching from Montreal and other
Canadian centers to hideaways of Islamic extremists around the
world. A massive cross-border manhunt continued Sunday for the
accomplice who apparently had been with Ressam at a motel in
British Columbia for three weeks prior to Ressam's passage into the
United States. The FBI is reportedly also investigating links
agents believe Ressam has to other Islamic extremists in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said law enforcement authorities were trying to determine
the nature of the potential plot Ressam may have been involved in
and who or what may have been his target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a conclusion has been reached with respect to
what his plan or motivation or affiliation was,'' Berger said. But
he acknowledged that investigators were looking into whether Ressam
was affiliated with any terrorist group, including the Islamic
group of Osama bin Laden, the millionaire Saudi militant based in
Afghanistan and for whose apprehension the US State Department has
posted a $5 million reward.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that in response to Ressam's arrest, the Customs
Service was concentrating its resources along land-border
locations, specifically protection of the northern and southern
borders of the United States. The northern border ports include
Derby Line and Highgate Springs in Vermont, and several points in
Maine.

 WASHINGTON: against it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was the third televised encounter between the two
Democrats, both of whom dressed in almost identical blue suits and
red-patterned ties. It was far more revealing and tightly paced
than a debate between Bradley and Gore just two days before in
Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting only inches apart, neither candidate was willing to cede
the last word to the other. Again and again, Gore shook his head
when Bradley spoke, or talked over him. Bradley, for his part, was
more calm than his rival but, compared to the last two debates, was
more inclined to stand his ground. ``That's wrong _ that's not
correct,'' he said of Gore's description of his health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Russert, the moderator of ``Meet the Press,'' prodded the
candidates to speak in specifics and, notably, pressed Gore into
discussing his missteps in fund-raising in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his most glaring mistake in fund-raising, Gore
replied, ``Oh, you know, I think that's pushing the limits, all
this was reviewed and no charges were brought. But I think it was a
mistake nonetheless.'' He said, ``Obviously we would do things
differently if we had it to do over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how Gore once called President Clinton one of the
greatest presidents, Russert asked if he was in the same company as
Washington and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Gore said. ``But I think that his
accomplishments are going to be regarded by the history books as
far more significant than his personal mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most striking exchanges came during a discussion of
unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money, when Gore
posed his challenge to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make you this offer right now,'' Gore said. ``If you will
agree, I will stop running all television and radio commercials
until this nomination is decided. That can get a lot of the money
out of the presidential campaign and accomplish one of the best
reforms. What about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied, ``It sounds to me like you're having trouble
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gore shot back. ``As a matter of fact, I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing somewhat perplexed by the challenge, Bradley went on:
``I mean, this is a ridiculous proposal. You know, the way you
communicate with people is when you talk to them. I love to talk to
them in town meetings, that's my favorite place. I've been doing
that since January. But I also love to talk to them over television
in their living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore questioned the value of 30-second commercials,
Bradley said, ``That's not so difficult to do if you know what you
believe. And if you know where you want to take the country. If you
have a positive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gore persisted, saying he and Bradley, his former
colleague in the Senate, should ``just go face to face about the
issues and get rid of all these television and radio commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not do that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The triggered a testy response from Bradley, who said, ``You
know something? For 10 months that I was running for president, you
ignored me, you pretended I didn't exist. Suddenly I started to do
better and you want to debate every day. It's ridiculous. We're
having debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing further disdain, Bradley said, ``The point is, Al, and I
don't know if you get this, but a political campaign is not just a
performance for people, which is what this is, but it is rather, a
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I'm doing,'' Gore objected.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dismissed Gore's offer as ``nothing but a ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates aren't ploys,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bradley replied, ``to come here, shake my hand. That's
nothing but a ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore insisted that his was ``a serious proposition,'' and
said that through more frequent debates the public ``will find out
a lot more about what we believe and what we're proposing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At another point, Gore offered himself as the true reformer,
saying, ``I have fought for this for 20 years. Bill went 17 years
in the United States Senate before he ever sponsored a campaign
finance reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shrum, a media consultant for Gore, said the vice president
modeled his challenge to Bradley after one made in the 1998
campaign by John Edwards of North Carolina against Sen. Lauch
Faircloth. Faircloth also rejected the challenge, and went on to
lose to Edwards. Shrum was also a consultant for Edward's campaign,
but he said it was the vice president's idea to pose the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore was ready to make the challenge in the debate on
Friday, but that the right opportunity never arose. ``He wasn't
going to force it in a debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Touching on other issues, Russert asked Bradley if he regretted
voting against using force in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and his
warning that it would become a long battle that could destabilize
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that my judgment is that it turned out that it worked
well,'' Bradley said. ``But I made the call and I'll stand by that
call.''
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates said they wanted to preserve Social
Security and Medicare benefits without raising the retirement age,
neither delved into specifics about how they would forestall an
expected cash shortfall in those programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into going down the whole list of
possibilities,'' Bradley said. ``When you are out there you have a
negotiation and you're trying to get together people so this does
not remain a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his education proposal as far more comprehensive
than Bradley's. ``Senator Bradley has a variety of little
nibble-around-the-edges proposals,'' he said. ``He doesn't reduce
class size; he doesn't improve teacher quality; he doesn't fix
crumbling schools. My plan does all of that and provides universal
preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said he was just as committed, saying, ``I think the
differences Al proposes in education program, many of the things
that, you know, I don't have a problem with, but it comes from
Washington as an education program, as opposed to helping people
where they live their lives.''

WITH POMP, CHINESE FLAG RISES OVER MACAO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAO _ As the five-star red flag was hoisted and a military
brass band rang out the national anthem, China at midnight took
back the last remaining land it had lost to European expansion, and
turned its sights on the major piece of Chinese soil still outside
of Beijing's control _ the island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotional final day of Portuguese rule over this
once-bustling port that linked lucrative trade routes from Canton
to Mexico, Portugal's red-and-green banner came down at 11:57 p.m.
Sunday night, closing the book on 442 years of colonialism in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Macao, today a casino haven-cum-colonial tourist attraction,
returned to China 2 1/2 years after Britain relinquished the
financial hub of Hong Kong. China's President Jiang Zemin bid
goodbye with a broad grin to Portugal's President Jorge Sampaio in
this second handover that confirmed Beijing as a rising global
power.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was the first European country to gain a foothold in
Asia and the last to go. But the Portuguese left Macao under far
less acrimonious or violent circumstances than the French in
Vietnam, the British in India or the Dutch in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang repeated his vow to preserve ``one country, two systems,''
the pledge that Hong Kong and Macao will continue to enjoy their
``capitalist system and way of life'' for at least 50 years after
the handover.
</P>
<P>
   China will now pursue ``an early settlement of the Taiwan
question and the complete national reunification,'' Jiang told the
crowd of 2,500 guests, and a Chinese television audience estimated
in the hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
   To the blare of trumpets, a uniformed representative of each of
the three armed services of China and Portugal goosestepped toward
one another and turned to salute their flags. The Portuguese flag
was lowered and China's banner hoisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Macao Sunday night and this morning, Chinese
flags went up on taxi antennas and buildings. Spectators packed
into the cobblestoned main plaza to watch the ceremony on a giant
TV screen and cheer. ``It's exciting because it's Chinese ruling
Chinese,'' shouted Chang Hengsin, 21, a student.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Portuguese and mixed-race natives who are staying said
they were optimistic. ``At first we were terrified, but now no. We
feel safe and happy,'' said Isabel Ferreira, 42, a former civil
servant. Like other Macanese, or Eurasian locals, Ferreira hopes
Macao will retain its fusion of East and West apparent in Macao's
architecture, festivals and food.
</P>
<P>
   But the smooth handover was tarnished, and the promises of
continuing freedoms called into serious question by dozens of
arrests and deportations in the last days of members of a religious
sect, democracy activists and even actors conducting an
unsanctioned handover performance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Hong Kong, where the world diplomatic corps and media
monitored the handover under a magnifying glass, making Beijing and
local authorities determined to prove their good will, the return
of tiny, somnolent Macao has generated little attention. Protests
at the Hong Kong handover were tolerated without incident, earning
China kudos at the time for preserving civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because of a lack of media scrutiny, local
authorities did not hesitate Sunday to arrest over 30 followers of
a spiritual group that is banned in China, but still legal here.
The Falun Gong members were peacefully exercising to draw attention
to the repression of their group in China. Police confiscated
banners and dragged them away, including a 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a very bad signal about the freedom of expression .
. . in Macao,'' said Catherine Baber of Amnesty International,
calling the arrests ``gross overreactions sullying what otherwise
would be a grand day.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, local authorities arrested about 22 artists who
were in the main plaza commemorating the handover with an
unofficial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500 Chinese troops will march into Macao Monday at noon to
establish the former colony's defense force.

EXPERTS: NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT READYING FOR Y2K
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If Y2K causes Wall Street meltdowns and martial
law, a San Fernando Valley man named George will be among the best
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   But if nothing happens, he will be stuck with 48 boxes of
oatmeal, several 55-gallon drums of water, five pounds of peanut
butter, 12 cans of Spam, six bags of cough drops, 26 rolls of paper
towels, a gas-powered generator, 500 pounds of uncooked pasta,
emergency survival bars, batteries, candles and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough to keep my family of six alive for at least a
year,'' said George, a 41-year-old animator who didn't want his
last name used.
</P>
<P>
   Although George might be the extreme, emergency services
officials and Y2K experts urge people to gather enough provisions
to last about three days, just in case utilities go out. Even if
there is no societal catastrophe from the Year 2000 bug, they'll be
ready for the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a lot of disappointed people out there if Y2K
turns out to be no big deal,'' said California State University,
Northridge Professor Allen Martin, director of the university's
Consumer Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the next earthquake or other major disaster happens,
they will be glad they are prepared. This is a good wake-up call
for Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of what people believe will happen when the new
millennium arrives is the hubbub at RECON-1, a Tarzana camping and
survival outfitter. Customers are stocking up on water, food, first
aid supplies and personal safety devices, co-owner Peter Kalaydjian
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this kind of preparation for any kind of event
during our 16 years in business,'' he said, adding that most people
react to emergencies such as the Northridge Earthquake and the Los
Angeles Riots instead of preparing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is another opportunity for us to get the word out that
they need to be prepared for disasters. It's not smart for people
to be without even the basic safety items.''
</P>
<P>
   While experts frown on panicky stockpiling or drastic financial
moves, complacency can be just as risky.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Tuesday by The Associated Press indicates
Californians aren't very worried about Y2K computer problems, with
only one in five adults ``very or somewhat worried about potential
Y2K problems causing difficulties for themselves or their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a little preparation would be smart. There's still time
to do some quick checks and set contingencies before 2000 rolls
around. And everyone should be on the lookout for last-minute Y2K
scams, particularly seniors, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are highly confident that Y2K will be a non-event, and Los
Angeles County is highly prepared for the date rollover,'' said
County Chief Information Officer Jon Fullinwider. ``But there is
always the possibility that something will go wrong, especially
with the human factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the county would be wise to make some preparations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes sense to be prepared, but not to go overboard,''
Fullinwider said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is that power outages will cripple
banking, retail and water service, Martin and other experts said.
On average it will cost $50 per person -- or about $200 for a
family of four -- to prepare from scratch for three days of
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start, people need to have a gallon of water per person per
day, nonperishable food, flashlights, a supply of batteries and a
battery-operated radio,'' Martin said. ``People also need to make
sure they have alternative heat sources, like heavy comforters and
plenty of firewood.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also recommends having a full tank of gas on New Year's
Eve, getting prescriptions filled to last through January and
keeping copies of all credit and bank transactions in December and
January.
</P>
<P>
   Those with heightened concerns are buying 55-gallon drums to
store water and specially packaged food with a 15-year shelf life,
Kalaydjian said. Some large families are also preparing to help
extended families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know that the people making fun of them for
going overboard are the same ones that will be at their front door
when a disaster happens,'' Kalaydjian said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are recommending that people have an extra week or two
of cash on hand, but are discouraging people from withdrawing large
amounts, which makes them vulnerable to theft. The Federal Reserve
predicts that most families will withdraw an extra $450 in cash in
fear that the computer bug could wipe out their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly advise people not to carry large amounts of cash,
or store large amounts of cash at home,'' said LAPD officer Jason
Lee. ``You open yourself to robbers who are watching bank and ATM
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks have reported they are Y2K ready, and even if there are
problems your money is federally insured, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not true in your home.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance coverage of cash losses typically amounts to only $200
under a standard homeowner's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who plan on hoarding cash over the holidays should be
aware that they make themselves vulnerable to a potentially
irreplaceable loss if that money is stolen,'' said Candysse Miller,
regional director of the Western Insurance Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   Martin suggests converting large amounts of cash into traveler's
checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchants will be much more likely to take traveler's checks
than personal checks if the banking system is interrupted,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   For families and small businesses, contingency planning is also
important to know ahead of time what you will do in case something
fails.
</P>
<P>
   For a small business, that means an alternate plan in case cash
registers fail such as a ready supply of hand-held calculators.
Other possibilities you might want to be prepared for: accounting
software that doesn't compute correctly or a supplier that is
knocked out of service.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing to think about: Experts have been warning that
little computer and software glitches somehow related to Y2K may
not show up for weeks or months after Jan. 1. So part of your
preparation should include remaining ready for problems down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Families should formulate plans to contact each other, or
designate meeting places, in the event communications fail. A good
plan would be to distribute the phone numbers of out-of-state
relatives to contact if you can't reach home, Martin said. Those
relatives could relay messages to your other family members when
they call.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential Y2K problem is scams designed to play on the
fears and panic of unsuspecting victims.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-November, the Justice Department had not seen a major
upswing in complaints about Y2K fraud, a spokesman said. But it
warns consumers -- particularly seniors -- to be on the alert for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's Consumer Resource Center and other state hotlines have
been receiving complaints about high-pressure sales to buy gold as
an alternative to cash, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been complaints of mechanics and salesmen
falsely claiming that microchips in cars, heating systems, cooling
systems and alarms need to be replaced, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have thought of scams you would never think of,''
Martin said. For example: Some funeral industry con artists and
estate planners have tried to cash in on the ``anniversary
reaction'' theory, which suggests elderly people are just ``holding
on'' for the new year and will die shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported schemes include purported calls from bank
employees seeking a victim's account number or social security
number so that money can be moved to a ``safe account'' or ``bond
fund'' while the bank fixes its Y2K problems. Instead, the account
number is used to drain the victim's account, according to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   To protect yourself, never give bank account, credit card or
Social Security numbers to anyone you don't know or trust, experts
say. Never turn money over to strangers. Beware of callers
promoting Y2K investments such as precious metals and watch out for
unsolicited e-mail or Internet chat rooms talking up small
companies with supposed Y2K solutions.

GREEK THEATRE CONTRACT A STEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- In the last 25 years, the Greek Theatre has
netted millions of dollars for its operator, but the city has
gotten nothing because it paid for virtually all the utilities,
repairs, maintenance and capital improvements, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The operator, Nederlander Corp.'s reward from the City Council:
a five-year extension without being subjected to competitive
bidding from other would-be contractors that would have netted the
city an estimated $1 million extra.
</P>
<P>
   While the Recreation and Parks Department has for years paid the
utilities and done maintenance on most of its 50 or so facilities
run by its concessionaires, the Greek Theatre has been among the
least profitable, according to Linda Barth, Department of
Recreation and Parks senior management analyst in the Griffith
Metro Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, looking back over the contract you could say,
`Golly, what a good deal for them,' '' Barth said, adding the old
contract was representative of the way the city did business in the
1970s, a practice the department is trying to change.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 interoffice computer memo, Barth wrote, ``What was in
the minds of the people who prepared this contract originally? It
is written so consciously to the benefit of the operator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a sweetheart deal,'' said Kris Vosburgh, executive
director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would really be news about the city of Los Angeles would
be that they're running a tight ship and that the private companies
that are benefiting from the use of city facilities are paying
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city that can't give enough away.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by council President John Ferraro, who has a years-long
friendship with city-owned Greek Theatre lobbyist/attorney Neil
Papiano, the deal was approved Dec. 8. The extension was approved
even though other firms were offering up to $1 million more _
revenues city officials said would have been realized after several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Papiano, who signs official documents as Nederlander's
secretary, did not return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle over the contract heads into the courts, where the
argument will be whether the the city's bid requirements and state
environmental laws were followed, the autopsy of Nederlander's past
financial arrangements is getting more attention. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It's a valuable contract,'' said Nederlander attorney Adam
Burke, with the downtown firm Iverson Yoakum Papiano &AMP; Hatch. He
defended the operator as a responsible company that paid its rent
and turned the theater into an important city attraction, providing
enjoyment for many people every year.
</P>
<P>
   The extension is a good business decision for the city in
ensuring its asset is upgraded, particularly the 72-year-old
bathrooms, few of them for women, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become so popular that it's become unpleasant for people
to come here,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Nederlander Chief Financial Officer David Green estimated that
since 1991 the firm has netted between $500,000 and $1 million
annually. He said the only year it operated in the red was in 1984,
when Los Angeles hosted the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year may have been as strong as $1.5 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said as to the expenses the city historically has been
picking up, ``the city decided to do what it decided to do.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mihlsten, the Latham &AMP; Watkins attorney representing
plaintiffs House of Blues Concerts in the litigation, said the
financial records speak for themselves, in that the the city never
made money on the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Recreation and Parks records show the city paid
for all the maintenance, repairs and utilities after the first
$50,000 each year, throughout the life of the contract. Those city
reimbursements, and capital improvements, equalized the $500,000 to
$1 million in gross rent the Greek paid each year, the records
show.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the Greek Theatre was making its required $50,000
deposit into the city's general fund, the city was spending about
$90,000 on its gas and water bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city even paid for the toilet paper,'' Mihlsten said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Barth said the department is in the process of requiring its
other 50 concessionaires to take over the utility payments too,
which cost the city about $250,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mihlsten said that was money that could have benefited the
entire city, not just the operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the parks are in deplorable condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barth said Nederlander won the bid in 1975 when the Greek was
struggling, and that the city was willing to help out financially
at the time, much like it did with other concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the nearly $4 million in capital improvements paid
for by the city that made the Greek's situation far less profitable
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, the city would have made a lot,'' Barth said.
</P>
<P>
   David DeFore, president of the Greek Theatre Advisory Committee,
said there was nothing to be done about ``past history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why punish someone in a free market enterprise who negotiated
a deal and who only owes the city fulfilling their contract,''
DeFore said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He said that while the committee wanted to go out for bids, the
city dragged its feet in putting together the request for
proposals. Finally, the committee became convinced it would be in
the city's interests to let Nederlander keep the concession for
five years and for them to make $5 million in improvements. There
was some urgency, in part because the theater is preparing for its
70th Anniversary Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely still want to do the RFP (request for proposal)
because I think it's best for the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recreation and parks staff also recommended seeking formal
proposals this year, but when Recreation and Parks Commissioner
Lisa Specht proposed doing that, she couldn't get a second for her
motion. The commission then voted 3-2 to support Nederlander's
unsolicited bid offer with Specht and Steve Soboroff opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a public policy matter it should be a competitively bid
project, since typically the city gets a better deal,'' said
Specht, a prominent attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Recreation and Parks General Manager Ellen Oppenheim said the
department stands by its recommendation to bid the concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most lucrative contract for the city,''
Oppenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   She added the department has not done a cost-benefit analysis of
the previous contract's terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among our charges is to serve the community with programs at
the same time we're responsible to administer the city's resources
in the most cost-effective way,'' Oppenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the theater has been meeting both those mandates, and
that the ongoing questioning is legal posturing by a firm that
represents House of Blues Concerts, operators of Universal
Amphitheater and the Greek's head-to-head competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's propaganda from the other side,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said that while he opposed the process that led to the
Nederlander extension, he would not have voted for a direct
competitor, like House of Blues, to get the city concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have shut down the Greek,'' he said. ``You never
want that kind of control of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Joel Wachs said the council in approving the
contract looked only at how the terms of the extension were more
favorable to the city than the previous contract had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really aggravating is that you had a chance to learn
from your past mistakes, but instead of going out and getting a
better deal they took care of their friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparison always was made to the past contract, rather
than to what could be.''

FORMER BELMONT PROJECT MANAGER SPEAKS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- As the Belmont Learning Center downtown sits
idled by environmental problems, Dominic Shambra -- the man who
``bears the ultimate responsibility'' for it -- lounges comfortably
in retirement at his San Gabriel Valley ranch.
</P>
<P>
   No guilt, no doubts, no question. In his mind, Mr. Belmont did a
great job and could have successfully completed that job if
political forces hadn't stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   In a financial audit last week, LAUSD chief investigator Don
Mullinax accused Shambra of having ``failed the children'' of Los
Angeles by mismanaging construction of the nation's costliest high
school _ a boarded-up, half-completed, $170 million complex that
might never be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Shambra told the Daily News during his first extensive
interview in nearly a year: ``I sleep like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, he excoriated his former colleagues,
especially those he believes pigeon-holed him as the villain of
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't screw them. They screwed themselves,'' he said. ``I
told them they'd rue the day they tried to screw me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax can write all he wants in his audits, Shambra added,
because he's authoring his own book on the scandalous $282-million
construction project. He said he's picked up his pen not so much to
get revenge as to clear his clouded name.
</P>
<P>
   The working title: ``Truth of the Matter.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Looking tanned and slimmer at his home than he did during his
district days brokering speculative real-estate deals from a
downtown highrise, Shambra, 60, is as pugilistic, unrepentant and
blunt as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed by 14 volumes of environmental concerns raised by
investigators in September and last Tuesday's financial audit of
Belmont, Shambra asked:``What is the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   In his days as a senior administrator responsible only to the
superintendent for the nation's second largest school district,
Shambra said he and his team of consultants merely used the ``power
vacuum'' within the district to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just filled it,'' Shambra said. ``Nobody at the district
had ever stepped out of that little cocoon before, and I did. We
were blazing new territory, doing something different, changing the
paradigm of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Shambra said he diligently jumped through the district's hoops
and claims he and Belmont had oversight, had people watching over
them. But in the end, he always got his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all fools,'' Shambra said of the district hierarchy,
many of whom have been forced out since the first Mullinax report.
</P>
<P>
   Shambra even insists he got the best of Superintendent Ruben
Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias claims to have shut down Shambra's operation in July
1997, but Shambra produces invoices the superintendent signed
through November 1997 to prove he continued to run the project for
nearly six more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zacarias never said a word to me,'' Shambra said. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's auditors paint Shambra as Mr. Belmont, a renegade
bureaucrat who was running a fiefdom with unmonitored and possibly
overpaid consultants doing his bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may try to defend himself by saying, `I had to do what I
had to do to get the job done,' but that doesn't make you
circumvent generally accepted accounting practices,'' Mullinax said
in an interview. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Raised in El Cerrito by Sicilian immigrant parents, Shambra was
used to scrapping and supporting himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he got a job as an LAUSD after-school playground
coordinator, where his first supervisor was Bill Anton, the man who
would become superintendent about the same time that plans for
Belmont were ripening.
</P>
<P>
   A friendship developed, with Shambra serving later as Anton's
best man. When Anton rose to an upper-management post in 1986,
Shambra followed him into the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Though technically without a managerial title, Shambra had
license to make deals for the district, assertions backed up by
LAUSD and audit records.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to Orange County ``asset-management consultant''
Wayne Wedin, Shambra found a deal mate: ``A great guy, very bright,
well-connected, knows the process.'' A guy who would be key to
getting Belmont going.
</P>
<P>
   The two soon put together an ambitious, $122 million building
blueprint for the district, which called for six joint-venture
complexes, among them a ``comprehensive high school'' at the
historical Ambassador Hotel downtown, and three elementary schools
designed to educate more than 10,000 students. The San Fernando
Valley was to have gotten a high school and an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate outcome was a parking garage at Grand Avenue and
17th Street _ and Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, what pleases Shambra most is how he quietly used the
garage to negotiate a deal whereby the Community Redevelopment
Agency agreed to contribute a percentage of its Hollywood tax
increments to the school district. The funds were placed
essentially under his control and allowed him to hire a team of
high-priced consultants to plan and develop Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked doing that kind of thing. It was exciting,'' Shambra
said, adding the district doesn't have the ``brains'' to realize
what that move was worth _ roughly $1 million. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Claiming he wasn't able to get a budget out of the district's
financiers, Shot only got funds from the CRA and the parking
garage. His account received ``contributions'' from the seller of
the largest portion of the Belmont property, Shimizu Corp. of
Japan, and the lead developer, Kajima. The gifts for his
department's work totaled $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   The board approved the donations and the money was deposited in
what was referred to in memorandums as ``Dom Shambra's account.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said the deposits did not appear to be improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had resources then,'' Shambra said.
</P>
<P>
   But they were sometimes hard to hang onto, according to Shambra
and district records.
</P>
<P>
   Former General Council Richard Mason used a portion of the
$2-million account to pay some of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers' legal fees on
Belmont. And on several other occasions, then-Superintendent Sidney
Thompson asked for money out of the account, Shambra said.
</P>
<P>
   The district is suing O'Melveny for legal malpractice, charges
the downtown firm denies.
</P>
<P>
   The cash that remained at Shambra's fingertips was doled out to
consultants, who were to be the brain trust for all the projects he
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's report, LAUSD auditors questioned some of Wedin's
invoices, including work billed on Christmas Day 1995. They also
charged that an overpayment of $11,325 may have been made to
California Financial Services, a firm run by Betty Hanson, a woman
Shambra has dated for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson declined comment for this story, but Shambra said one of
her contracts might not have been counted in the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Wedin earned more than $1.1 million in his 12-year relationship
with the district. In an interview with the Daily News, he chalked
up the failed projects to bad timing, and maintained his
$125-per-hour billings were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work nights, weekends, whatever it takes,'' he said,
adding he even worked that Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Shambra said he has askheed the FBI to review his personal
financial records, and claims to relish the idea of a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I supposedly didn't supervise two consultants. What's
criminal about that?'' Shambra said, adding he had his own methods
of keeping track of Wedin and other others.
</P>
<P>
   Of his detractors: ``I want to see those liars under oath.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Shambra's employment record shows he took over as acting
director of the Planning and Development Office in July 1992 when
Anton was superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont landed in his lap in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the biggest gorillas around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wedin, Hanson, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers' partner David Cartwright,
Ernst &AMP; Young accountants were all part of the ``dream team.'' The
accounting firm also has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no experts in the district,'' Shambra said. ``We
went outside the bureaucracy on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Shambra said he did all he could to keep district officials at
bay, saying he was purposefully mean and nasty at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was survival,'' he said. ``Inside the district, I had to
deal with all these a--holes.''
</P>
<P>
   United Teachers Los Angeles President Day Higuchi, no fan of
Shambra's, said: ``Dom's whole way of operating, once he concocted
some kind of deal, was to bulldoze any opposition or questioning
out of the way. Pretty soon it was, `Don't ask.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one questions, you can steer the whole ship into the
rocks, which is what happened with Belmont. It was where the
district finally ran aground.''
</P>
<P>
   Shambra also could be a teddy bear when it served his interests,
throwing large receptions at his home, entertaining everyone from
the superintendent to state lawmakers, board members, secretaries
and clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a kind, soft side that he also showed to parents and
students,'' Wedin said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Standing near a reproduction on his office wall of the
$30-million state check used to buy the tainted land for Belmont,
Shambra admitted he made one enormous miscalculation with regard to
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   He underestimated the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in summer 1995, the hotel and restaurant workers'
union began to challenge the project mainly because it was trying
to organize the New Otani, owned by the parent company of Belmont's
lead development, Kajima International of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Shambra came to despise the union and the union's researcher
David Koff, who worked effectively against the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a wonderful job of putting out his information,''
Shambra said. Koff will always be an``amoral man, without
scruples.''
</P>
<P>
   Koff began by providing the board with data on the financial
risks associated with Belmont in 1995, and later delved into the
project's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overestimated himself,'' Koff said. ``The Temple Beaudry
site won the war of facts.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As Belmont rose against the downtown skyline, concern was
mounting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Democratic Assemblyman Scott Wildman's Joint
Legislative Audit Committee had begun to investigate the project,
to Shambra's irritation. He tried and failed to get then-Attorney
General Dan Lungren to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was driven to make this thing happen come hell or high
water,'' Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Department of Toxic Substances Control and the
LAUSD's safety team by 1998 also were on board, and concluded that
testing on the site _ a former oil field that exudes potentially
explosive methane gas and toxic hydrogen sulfide _ had been
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outnumbered me,'' Shambra said. ``It was all easily
(mitigable).'' Flanked by his husky and German shepherd dogs,
Shambra said he won't consider his 37-year LAUSD career really over
as long as Belmont remains unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pit bull on Belmont, because there's nothing wrong with
Belmont,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An unexpectedly strong showing by pro-government
parties in Sunday's Russian parliamentary elections looked set to
give President Boris Yeltsin a more compliant legislature as he
heads into his last six months in office, and a firm launching pad
for his designated heir, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that the Communist Party, the bulwark of
the anti-Yeltsin opposition, could still emerge as Russia's largest
single party with about 25 percent of the national vote, cast on
the basis of party lists which will fill half of the 450 seats in
the Duma, the lower house of parliament. The Communists are
expected to pick up more seats in the 225 single districts, where
final results will be known later this week.
</P>
<P>
   But according to preliminary returns, the surprise winners of
the election were two parties _ including one composed of Yeltsin's
once-scorned team of liberal economic reformers _ that emerged out
of the political wilderness in the last few months, boosted by
their backing of a popular war in Chechnya and supported by a
ferocious propaganda campaign waged by the Kremlin and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   As returns trickled in, moving from east to west across Russia's
11 time zones, political commentators were speculating that the new
pro-government coalition might actually gain a majority in the
Duma, which for the last six years has been dominated by the
Communist-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If electoral trends hold up as votes are counted in Russia's
populous western regions, Yeltsin for the first time in his
presidency might take command of the legislature and, in what
remains of his final term, push through badly needed economic
reforms, including an overhaul of an unwieldy tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Widely seen as a test run for next summer's presidential
elections, the parliamentary elections confirmed the growing
authority of Putin, a 47-year-old former security officer whose
popularity ratings have soared in the four months since he was
named prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's endorsement of Unity _ also known as Medved, or Bear _
was seen by political analysts as the key behind its sudden
breakthrough onto the national political scene. Unity, an electoral
bloc concocted by the Kremlin in the last two months of the
campaign, positioned itself as a rival to a center-left
anti-Kremlin alliance headed by former prime miniter Yevgeny
Primakov and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, Russia's capital and
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov easily won re-election, turning aside a challenge that
in recent weeks had looked capable of challenging his once daunting
popularity. Exit polls showed him winning with more than 70 percent
of the city's vote. In his last race for mayor, Luzhkov won with
more than 90 perent.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, both Luzhkov and Primakov were pummeled by a
steady stream of negative, sometimes vicious broadcasts on national
television channels controlled by the Kremlin and its allies. By
Sunday, their electoral alliance, Fatherland-All Russia, which six
months ago boasted of being Russia's next party of power, had
plummeted to just 10 percent of the vote, according to an exit poll
conducted for the private television station NTV.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll showed Unity now being the new party of the
political establishment, and as such a probable magnet for
office-seekers and politically attuned business leaders. In the
poll, Unity far exceeded expectations with more than 20 percent of
the vote. Also surprising were the results for the Union of Right
Forces, a party made up of reformers whose campaign was
stage-managed by Anatoly Chubais, the often maligned author of
Russia's privatization program. The Right Forces party looked set
to top 10 percent in the national vote, a remarkable comeback for a
political group that had been written off by many experts a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Putin's influence seemed to play a role, after he
said last week he could agree with parts of the right-wing party's
economic platform. Leaders of the Right Forces, who publicly
supported Putin's tough conduct of the Chechnya war despite the
misgivings of some of their backers, have returned the compliment
by endorsing Putin for president.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of the consolidation of pro-government forces,
Putin paid a surprise visit to the Right Forces campaign
headquarters. ``This is a very important victory for everyone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen war _ loudly criticized in the West for its brutal
bombardments of civilians _ has galvanized Russian public opinion
and, according to most Russian political analysts, turned the
national debate away from a search for social stability toward an
endorsement for a strong state, headed by a strong leader.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in the national mood has been answered by Putin, a
former KGB officer who has given the Russian military a free hand
in its campaign against the Chechen guerrillas held responsible for
the lawlessness that had spread through Russia's southern regions
after the 1994-1996 Chechen war in which thousands of Russian
soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko, a liberal opposition party headed by Grigory Yavlinsky,
was the only party that called for a shift in tactics in the
Chechen war. That stance apparently cost Yabloko public support;
according to early election results, Yavlinsky's party seems
destined to remain on the political fringes, with an estimated 6 to
7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin's apparent triumph _ another in a string of
come-from-behind victories for Yeltsin and his allies _ has cast a
cloud on the political scene, as critics continued to decry the
rough and cynical methods used by the ruling circle to best their
centrist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kremlin turned its gun on the Fatherland-All Russia
electoral bloc, it all but ignored its historic opposition, the
Communist Party. The Communists showed that they still have a lock
on the anti-Yeltsin protest vote, particularly among elderly voters
who have suffered during the last 10 years of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their exceptionally dirty campaign, the authorities again
got a result which offers good advantages to the Communists,
something they hated to see,'' Luzhkov said after the vote.

MCCAIN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF POP QUIZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Sen. John McCain had his own pop quiz Sunday
and did not fare much better than Gov. George W. Bush did when he
was unable to name some world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had just finished a lively town meeting, easily and
knowledgeably covering topics from energy conservation to the
increasing cost of prescription drugs to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and the lack of bipartisanship in foreign policy. But he was
stumped at a subsequent news conference, when a reporter posed a
pop quiz and asked McCain to name the prime minister of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be Haughey, who's in serious trouble'' he said,
referring to the former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey who is
being tried on charges of obstructing an inquiry into payments made
to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain searched his memory, he said Bush should have been
asked questions of substance about foreign policy instead of being
hit with a quiz. He offered his own policy views, saying he was
``pleased with the progress of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Mitchell deserves enormous credit as does this
administration for moving that place forward,'' McCain continued.
He was referring to George Mitchell, the former Democratic senator
who oversaw the peace negotiations in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   McCain rattled off the names of Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fein, and David Trimble, the elected leader of the Ulster
Unionists. But he never came up with the name of Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's questioner tried again with an inquiry closer to home:
Who is the governor of Vermont?
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be Snelling,'' McCain said, referring to Richard
Snelling, the governor for nine years. ``I just talked about him
last night,'' he said, stalling, ``He's a Democrat. He's a
doctor....''
</P>
<P>
   Taking pity on him, someone muttered ``Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard Dean,'' McCain said, ``and I believe he is a
physician.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was a glitch in a day of town meetings and large crowds,
the senator did not appear to take it to heart. Soon he was on the
phone from his campaign bus to a radio talk show host, answering
that he was feeling just fine today ``except for the fact that I
stumbled over the name of Howard Dean.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Warren Wegele is on the front line of a medical
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After doing a simple blood test recently, doctors at the
University of Cincinnati Medical Center told Wegele, a 65-year-old
former salesman for air-compressor companies, that he had inherited
a tiny alteration in one of his genes. A certain chemical unit out
of the string of 3 billion that make up the mass of DNA in his
cells is different from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The alteration _ found in 5 percent of the population _ would
normally be of no more medical significance to Wegele (pronounced
WEG-lee) than his black hair or burly physique. But it translated
into a potential medical catastrophe for Wegele when he became ill
with congestive heart failure, a disease in which the heart muscle
no longer contracts vigorously. On average, patients with the
condition live five years after they become ill; some live 10 years
or more.
</P>
<P>
   But people with anomalies like Wegele's altered gene, doctors
told him, usually live only one to two years. For these people, the
drugs used to treat the disease may be of little help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept it,'' Wegele said of the bad news doctors gave
him about his gene, which directs heart cells to make a crucial
protein. After all, he argued, as he lay in his hospital bed,
``I've never really gotten ill, and I've always recovered from
everything instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wegele's former vigor was beside the point. Clearly ill, he
had spent weeks in the hospital, growing sicker by the day, waiting
for a heart to become available for a transplant _ the only way,
his doctors said, to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary new genetics that predicted Wegele's dire
circumstances is not about genes that confer generally good health
or health that is generally poor. Instead, it is about a collection
of common single-molecule variations in genetic material that are
normally no more important than having curly or straight hair, or
brown or blue eyes, but might be revealing when people become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe humans have hundreds of thousands of these
genetic variations, and drug companies are avidly searching for
them, convinced that they can use collections of them to identify
patients who will benefit from drugs, patients who will not, and
patients who will suffer troubling side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they say, this research will lead them into an era
of tailor-made medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So far, testing for such genetic variants is being done only at
a few medical centers as part of experimental trials. Experts
predict a gradual increase in such testing as the roster of
variations is compiled and research accelerates. They predict that
the first personalized drug prescriptions will appear in a few
years and many more will roll out over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the advanced genetic testing will probably be used for
refining drugs for the more common diseases like asthma, arthritis,
heart disease, high blood pressure and migraines. Eventually,
experts say, it could be applied to virtually any drug for any
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices could increase, some drug company executives say,
but they add that drugs will be so much more effective that they
will be worth more to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, optimistic predictions of scientists and drug
companies can go awry, and until the revolution in pharmacology
takes place, it is hard to know if the glowing predictions are
accurate. So far, relatively few genetic variants have been found
and only a small number of these have been shown to have medical
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In Wegele's case, there was no good drug to slow his disease.
But that did not mean he had not been helped. Based on their data
from a continuing study that now includes about 500 patients with
congestive heart failure, doctors at the University of Cincinnati
hospital said that the only long-term hope for people with Wegele's
genetic variant was a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test everyone who has congestive heart failure,'' said Dr.
Stephen Liggett, a lung specialist and molecular geneticist at the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, who discovered the
genetic variant and its effects on congestive heart failure.
Liggett said it was his opinion that those who had the genetic
variation, like Wegele, ``should be put on the transplant list
early and they should have more aggressive drug therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, Wegele received a new heart. A week later, Liggett
said, Wegele was well enough to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The Scientists
</P>
<P>
   From Impossible Task to Reasonable Goal
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when he was giving a technical talk to
scientists, Dr. Eric Lander had a eureka moment.
</P>
<P>
   Lander, who is director of the Center for Genome Research at the
Whitehead Institute in Boston, had assumed that it would be
hopeless to even dream of finding the common variants in human
genes. Gene alterations _ single chemical changes _ occur by
accident, at random. Those with an immediate effect on health or
fertility would be retained or eliminated by evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The other alterations would be neutral _ they would ordinarily
make no difference to the person _ and so they would slowly become
common as they were passed from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   With about 100,000 human genes and 6 billion people on earth,
the number of common variations could be enormous. But, Lander
realized, the human race numbered just 10,000 to 100,000 people as
recently as 7,000 generations ago and a population that small would
have only a modest number of common genetic variants, perhaps a few
hundred thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been enough time for the common variants to build
up,'' Lander said. For each gene, there might be two, or three,
common variations at one or two positions in the gene sequence, not
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a finite problem,'' Lander said. ``It is within
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   That insight converted him into one of the pioneers in the
search for genetic variants that can predict individual differences
in responses to illness and responses to drugs, a field known as
pharmacogenetics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time Lander was realizing that each gene might
have just a few variants, Liggett, then a researcher at Duke
University, was starting to see what such variants might mean for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett was intrigued by one particular gene, the beta-2
adrenergic receptor gene. It directs cells to make a protein that
helps relax muscles in the airways of the lungs and contract
muscles in the heart. Drugs for asthma attach themselves to the
protein, setting off a cascade of biochemical events inside the
cells that makes the airways dilate. Drugs for congestive heart
failure also attach themselves to the protein, this time making
heart muscles contract.
</P>
<P>
   In studies with cells grown in the laboratory, Liggett
discovered that the gene that codes for production of the beta-2
adrenergic receptor protein seemed exquisitely tuned by its
structure. A change in just a single chemical along the gene's
length could make the protein work slightly better, or slightly
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to find out if this could occur in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett and his colleagues recruited 100 healthy people and
began deciphering the chemical sequence of each person's beta
adrenergic receptor gene. After 18 months, he got his answer. There
were three different variants of the gene. All three worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Liggett's mind raced. Maybe this was why some
people respond better than others to asthma drugs. Maybe it was why
some people taking asthma drugs quickly became resistant to them
and others did not. Maybe it was also tied to the way patients with
congestive heart failure responded to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told me that what we had found was
unimportant,'' Liggett said. ``They were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigations,
Liggett and his colleagues showed how the genetic variants affected
disease prognosis in congestive heart failure. Reporting on tests
of 259 patients who had come to the University of Cincinnati to be
evaluated for possible heart transplants, the researchers found
that those with one particular beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene
variant did far worse than those with another. A third group was in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Within 100 days after they arrived at the hospital, about 60
percent of the patients with an isoleucine amino acid at position
164 in the protein chain were dead or required a heart transplant.
That is the variant that Wegele has.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with a different amino acid, threonine, at position
164, had a much better outcome. About 95 percent of them were alive
after 100 days without having had a heart transplant, and half were
still alive 900 days after they arrived at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in the gene appear to be important in asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent small study conducted at the University of Tennessee
at Memphis, Dr. Julie Johnson, Dr. John Lima and their colleagues
found that asthma patients who inherited from both parents the
amino acid arginine in position 16 of the beta-2 adrenergic
receptor protein responded best to the popular asthma drug
albuterol. The drug increased by 18 percent the amount of air they
could expel from their lungs. Those who inherited from either
parent the chemical glycine in that position had just a 4.9 percent
increase in the air they expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that some people respond better to
albuterol,'' Liggett said. ``But we've never known why.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge is to tailor drug treatments to help those who
have genetic variants that spell a poor prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Liggett, ``is the key to pharmacogenetics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Companies
</P>
<P>
   First-Time Step in Joint Research
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the rolling countryside near Hopewell, N.J., in a
cluster of brick buildings once owned by Mobil Oil is Bristol-Myers
Squibb's budding center of pharmacogenomics research. There, in
echoing offices still under construction, Dr. Elliott Sigal makes
bold plans to expand his staff and investments in what he believes
will be the future of the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   When executives like Sigal look at the pharmaceutical industry,
they groan. One out of 7,500 compounds that look promising in the
laboratory actually gets to the market. Only three out of 10 that
are marketed make any money for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attrition rate is a plague for the industry,'' Sigal said,
referring to the many drugs that fail.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, said Sigal, who is Bristol-Myers' senior vice
president for early discovery and applied technology, major drug
companies introduce one innovative drug into the market each year _
if they are lucky. For many drugs, he added, only half of the
patients who take them respond.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugs are worse than that. People with conditions like high
blood pressure often try one drug after another before finding a
medication that works for them.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs are rarely used, because they cause side effects in
a small proportion of patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a drug like Glaxo Wellcome's Lamictal, which is
used to treat epilepsy, can cause itching and rashes. It can only
be used by patients whose doctors are willing to start with a small
dose and gradually increase it over several months, watching to see
if a rash develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``When most general practitioners see that a drug needs dose
escalation, they use something else,'' said Dr. Allen Roses, a
neurologist who is vice president worldwide and director of
genetics at Glaxo Wellcome PLC. ``But it's a great drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Roses and others emphasize that if genetic variants could be
used to identify who would respond to a drug and who would have
side effects, the benefits for companies and patients would be
obvious. Companies could sell more drugs, more efficiently, by
marketing them to those who would be helped. And patients would get
drugs that worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   For companies like Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as
well as Pfizer, the path is clear. Last April, they and seven other
large drug companies joined forces with the Wellcome Trust, a
medical research charity, and several leading academic centers, to
compare human DNA segments and find the places where variations
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will use these variations, called single
nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and pronounced ``snips,'' to try
to develop the precisely targeted drugs of the future. Their goal
is to identify 300,000 such landmarks along the human DNA within
two years and make the results public.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 21, the group, called the SNP Consortium, published on
the Internet its first group of SNPs, identifying 2,279 of them and
describing their precise sites on human chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   But more is involved than just finding SNPs. Companies are also
worried about the bottom line: How much will it cost to find these
alterations in genes?
</P>
<P>
   Today, it costs $150 or more to identify each of a person's
SNPs, said Dr. Michael Silber, who directs pharmacogenetics
research at Pfizer. The goal, he said, is to get the price down to
pennies, which he called feasible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even a man who describes himself as ``leading the way in
caution'' is convinced that SNP analyses will become cheap enough
to be useful. Dr. Paul Spence, the executive director of
biotechnology for Searle, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto,
said that before he committed himself to SNP analyses, he actually
sat down with pen and paper and worked out the economics. Like
Spence, he concluded that cost would not be an obstacle for long.
</P>
<P>
   As for Roses of Glaxo Wellcome, as early as September 1997, he
persuaded his company to begin storing DNA samples from every
patient in most of its drug studies. The idea is that when the SNPs
are found, the company can go back and ask: What patterns of these
molecular markers correlate with what sort of drug responses?
</P>
<P>
   If one pattern is associated with a drug's efficacy and another
with bad side effects, the company would consider marketing the
drug only to those with the pattern that predicts a good response.
</P>
<P>
   To protect patients' privacy, Roses said, their names and
identifying features are not stored with their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome plans to enter the pharmacogenetics market with a
drug that is already on the market, offering patients SNP tests
before they take the drug to see if they are likely to respond.
Then the company plans to move on and use the SNP profiles as part
of drug development.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, drug company executives predict, SNP tests will
be available for several drugs and several diseases. Eventually,
most drugs will be sold with SNP tests, companies say.
</P>
<P>
   Companies expect to use ``SNP chips'' for testing. They are
devices that can be used to scan a sample of DNA for specific
genetic sequences or anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, drug company executives predict, SNP research
will reward them with hundreds of new drugs, including many that
will be unlike any on the market today. With that in mind, Sigal
said, his company has a new business goal. Rather than settling for
the current pattern of one entirely new drug on the market each
year, the company aims to have three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies see this as the way of the future.'' Sigal
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics
</P>
<P>
   Discriminatory Risks in Genetic Testing
</P>
<P>
   Mention genes and diseases to many ethicists and they will see a
dark side to a bright future. Will people be getting information
about their medical conditions that they would rather not know? Can
their privacy be protected?
</P>
<P>
   Few are more acutely aware of these problems than Dr. Francis
Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, the federal effort to map the human genes. From its
inception, the genome project has had ethicists as consultants, and
it has had to answer piercing questions about the consequences of
unveiling what could be intimate genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins is excited by the prospect of pharmacogenetics, he
sees situations in which it could raise privacy problems. Knowing
if someone will respond to a drug, or suffer a side effect, can
tell something about that person's susceptibility to disease.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists recently reported that the SNP pattern
in a cholesterol-metabolizing gene determined who would respond to
the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin. But the people who
respond to pravastatin are also the ones who will have the worst
prognosis if they do not get their cholesterol levels down.
Insurers might use that genetic information to deny or limit
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to separate the reason you did the test from
the response to it,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he added, is to pass effective laws to prevent
genetic discrimination. And, he said, ``We are pretty close to
seeing that come to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Although genetics always gives rise to ethical concerns, the
debate over pharmacogenetics has so far been muted, with even some
longtime critics of genetic testing saying that they think it will
be a blessing to doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for the research,'' said Dr. Michael Kaback, a
geneticist at the University of California in San Diego, who has
often criticized genetic testing. ``I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   His main concern, he said, is that companies will promise too
much too soon, turning the public bitter and cynical. ``Then a
whiplash occurs and you end up curtailing progress,'' Kaback said.
</P>
<P>
   Roses noted that the pharmacogenetics approach might not provide
people with information about disease susceptibility or their
medical future. While a genetic variant may make a difference in
whether a person with asthma, for example, responds to albuterol,
it does not have any bearing on whether that person will get asthma
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic variant is predicting individual physiological
responses to drug molecules, not the biochemical processes that
caused the disease being treated. And when SNP patterns are
analyzed together, as a sort of DNA bar code, they will predict
drug responses without revealing anything about the actual genes on
which the SNPs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Bartha Maria Knoppers, a law professor at the University of
Montreal, who is chairwoman of the international ethics committee
of the Human Genome Organization, an international organization of
scientists who are working on finding the sequence of the human
genome, said she thinks the benefits of the new approach are
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will probably look with some suspicion on claims that
this will ultimately be beneficial, because it is in our cultural
milieu to say `Oh, another marketing ploy,''' Ms. Knoppers said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``I think that, provided we proceed with caution,
that it can be very beneficial. There are drugs that don't work for
many people; there are drugs that are dangerous. I would think that
making drugs more therapeutic and safer surely is an ethical
goal.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, around midafternoon, Jennifer Musser, an editor of
philly.com, finds out more about her audience than any print editor
has ever known. On Dec. 5, for instance, she knew that the Web
site's most-visited article was The Philadelphia Inquirer's account
of a 76ers' basketball game, with 4,097 hits, and that the average
visitor stayed three-and-a-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer's article on a crack addict who starved her
daughter to death got barely a third as many hits, but the average
visitor lingered almost five-and-a-half minutes over the wrenching
account. Another article, a review of a performance by the rock
singer Beck, had an unusual number of hits _ because, Ms. Musser
later discovered, a Web site for the artist's fans had set up a
link to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Musser's Web site, www.philly.com, is owned by Knight Ridder
and offers visitors every article in the company's two Philadelphia
papers, The Philadelphia Inquirer and its rival, The Philadelphia
Daily News. Then it makes available to the newspapers' editors the
core data accumulated on those visits.
</P>
<P>
   Such data _ similar to the feedback that Nielsen ratings have
given television programmers and far more detailed than gross
measurements like circulation or even readership _ is golden to
newspapers as they enter the year 2000. Challenged to recreate
themselves both online and in print, newspapers _ and their
advertisers _ have a greater appetite for information about their
appeal, their audiences and their competition than ever, according
to both those who gather and those who use the data.
</P>
<P>
   What they find and how they use that information is likely to
reshape the business of newspapering, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a proliferation of news and information
sources, so people's expectations have changed,'' said Greg
Martire, the managing partner of the research firm of Clark,
Martire &AMP; Bartolomeo. ``The traditional role of the newspaper has
been nibbled away from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free weekly is doing a better job reporting on soccer
leagues; CNN is doing a better job of providing instant worldwide
coverage,'' he added. ``Given that, the newspaper has held up
remarkably well.''
</P>
<P>
   But declining circulation figures over 15 years reflect the
erosion of the audience. And years of increasing data about
audience preferences offer tempting solutions. In addition, highly
advanced presses and increasingly computerized delivery systems now
provide more opportunities to adapt to reader preferences.
Newspaper Web sites offer even more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   One core question is how willing publishers should be to marry
the data about audience preferences to the technologies that allow
them to accommodate those preferences.
</P>
<P>
   J. Walker Smith, the president of Yankelovich Partners, the
market research firm based in Norwalk, Conn., said studies by his
firm argue for more customization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to customize things,'' he said. In a world of
incessantly expanding choices, ``it will be harder and harder for
media to intrude their way into people's attention spans,'' he
added. ``Instead, they are going to have to find a way to get an
invitation to be in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, then, have an incentive to customize. But how?
Customizing for the mass market _ giving most prominence to the
articles that tend to attract the most readers _ may result in a
less attractive product.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in the news business,'' said Tom Rosenstiel,
the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a press
watchdog group based in Washington, ``my first editor said: Assume
that no more than 15 percent of the people want to read any of
these stories. So lay out your front page so that everyone who is a
potential reader wants to read at least one story.'' He added,
``The great risk of knowing how many people read every story, but
not knowing who the people are, is that you start producing only
those stories that will reach a large number of people, and in the
end, the result is you end up with even fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how people behave (their true news tastes) may not, for
instance, be the same as knowing how they see themselves. For 12
years, the Pew Research Center in Washington has conducted surveys
on the most-followed news events. There is no easy way to correlate
these with Nielsen ratings, which come closer to measuring actual
behavior. But some of the most closely watched news events, like
the O.J. Simpson trial and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales,
do not even make the top 20 on the Pew list.
</P>
<P>
   The probable gap between what people say and what people do
reflects a basic problem in the customization effort, at least when
it comes to general news. It is unclear how audiences will react if
editors tailor products to what readers show they care about at the
expense of what they say they care about _ or the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the audience for newspapers is not necessarily the
same as the audience for news online. Ms. Musser at philly.com, for
one, says that the demographics of her online news audience are
different _ younger and more male _ from those of the average
newspaper audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carol Perruso, president of latimes.com, the online site of The
Los Angeles Times, has found in recent surveys that online news
consumers themselves can be divided into two groups. ``People who
went to portal sites and television news sites such as MSNBC tended
to put a higher premium on breaking news and news summaries,'' she
said. ``And people who went to newspapers' sites favored in-depth
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while many newspapers are splitting into offline and online
versions of themselves, with slightly different audiences, they are
finding that both audiences value one of newspapers' traditional
strengths _ their depth.
</P>
<P>
   On the business side, too, there are similarities between
newspapers and their online offspring. For instance, they share the
need to keep the high-margin classified-ad franchise from being
taken over by online help-wanted sites like monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   But they have different business imperatives. It is not at all
clear that the print business model _ a combination of advertising
and circulation revenue _ will work online, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new business model is one reason Knight Ridder,
Tribune Company and The New York Times Company are exploring the
ways to have their digital properties _ Knightridder.com, Tribune
Interactive and The Times Company Digital _ issue securities that
will tap into the high value of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting infusion of capital, the companies hope, could pay
for everything from acquisitions to technological experiments that
could reduce dependence on advertisers and create services or
information packages for which subscribers would pay a premium.
</P>
<P>
   The printed newspapers, more than half of which are part of
larger newspaper chains, are meanwhile rethinking everything from
their size to their delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers, like The Washington Post and The Miami Herald,
have cut costs by reducing the width of their pages by half an inch
to save paper.
</P>
<P>
   And The Arizona Republic is perfecting a computerized delivery
system that would break apart the six-day or Sunday or both
subscription schedule and allow subscribers to opt for, say, just
the Wednesday newspaper, with the grocery ads, and the Friday
paper, with its entertainment listings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that has changed in the newspaper business in the
last century, one thing has remained constant, the amount of time
people say they spend with their daily newspaper: 15 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the average amount of time 4,000 Chicago businessmen
said they spent when they were surveyed in 1916, amid World War I.
It is the average 1,761 New York college students said they spent
in 1920. And it is the figure that emerged from focus groups
convened in recent years by Clark, Martire &AMP; Bartolomeo, the
research firm, in dozens of cities. Martire said the number did not
change even when the number of pages changed. ``The smaller paper
they just read more intensively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philly.com visitors stay, on average, 11.5 minutes, according to
the Web monitoring firm I/Pro. In the Internet Age, with the
nirvana of large broadband information pipes said to be just around
the technological corner, such persistent results are a reminder
that at the end of the bursting pipes is a human brain with an
appetite for general news that is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply has vastly expanded,'' said Rosenstiel, the media
critic. ``The natural human instinct for how much news you need,
how much time you spend absorbing the world around you, has not
changed.'' At least not in terms of reading habits.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, casts doubt on the proposition that people will
eagerly take on the task of sorting through the new avalanche of
information themselves. ``If people aren't spending any more time''
reading news, in print or online, he said, the idea ``that everyone
will be their own editor doesn't work in real life; people do not
have time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To almost everyone's surprise, the Japanese economy
showed remarkable _ and remarkably diverse _ signs of life this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, reassured by the seemingly endless stream of
corporate overhauls that began taking place, drove the stock market
higher, pushing the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index up by more
than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Topix index, a broader measure of the market, was up an even
more robust 50 percent, and an index of smaller Japanese stocks
more than doubled. Further, the need for yen to buy all those
stocks helped push the currency up against the dollar by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there the picture begins to get muddied. A stronger yen
crimps the earnings of Japan's exporting giants like Sony, Honda
and Hitachi, whose stocks are favorites of foreign investors. And
so those investors' enthusiasm for Japanese assets actually
imperils the very recovery in which they are so eagerly investing.
</P>
<P>
   Contradictions like this mark many aspects of what is shaping up
as Japan's economic renaissance after nearly a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very bumpy ride ahead for the next five years as
reform battles against anti-reform,'' said Richard Katz, author of
``Japan: The System That Soured'' (M.E. Sharpe).
</P>
<P>
   That makes it difficult to be either optimistic or pessimistic
when it comes to Japan's prospects as the century turns.
</P>
<P>
   Take consumer spending. Economists were pleasantly surprised
earlier this year when consumers started opening their wallets
after the government shored up the financial system and offered a
menu of tax breaks to encourage the spending that is needed to
reinvigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of falling wages, deferred bonuses, job cuts and
hiring freezes, the spending spree stalled late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here, noted that the
monthly Family Income and Expenditure Survey on which the
government bases some of its economic predictions was small and
included the responses of a disproportionate number of civil
servants, who have largely escaped the impact of the restructuring
sweeping the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, in the first three months of this year, when gross
domestic product was at first reported to have grown at a stunning
7.9 percent annualized rate _ later revised to 6.3 percent _ sales
of minicars were exceedingly strong because manufacturers, seeking
to dress up their performance in advance of the fiscal year-end in
March, offered deep incentives. The minicar sales boom soon
quieted.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there are two interpretations of the economy, which
slowed significantly after that strong first quarter. The growth at
the start of the year was still better than generally expected and
probably ensures that the government will live up to the growth of
six-tenths of 1 percent it pledged for the fiscal year that will
end March 31, in contrast to a decline of 2 percent in gross
domestic product in the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But a good part of the current life in the economy that has so
excited foreign investors comes from government spending _ a
whopping $177 billion at current exchange rates this year alone in
supplementary spending aimed at lifting the economy _ much of it
devoted to restoring moribund businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the government halts that spending, as it
surely must in the not-too-distant future because it cannot sustain
that level in light of its rising debt burden? If data issued at
the end of November _ when the effects of the government's previous
spending package were wearing off _ are any indication, consumer
spending will fall, housing starts will fall and construction
contracts will dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's fiscal situation is growing more worrisome. The nation
has unseated Italy as the industrialized world's biggest debtor,
with government debt climbing to an estimated 123 percent of the
country's gross domestic product. For the first time since World
War II, government bond issuance will exceed tax revenues in the
fiscal year that ends March 31, and economists expect the
government to go on spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is that, if the current economic stimulus
programs fail to create a self-sustaining recovery, they will not
be abandoned in favor of something else but rather they will be
redoubled,'' said Marshall Gittler, chief currency strategist for
Asia at Bank of America in Hong Kong, who recommends a halt to the
debt-financed supplemental spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats, politicians and some economists argue that Japan's
vast savings and extremely low interest rates make the problem less
pressing than the numbers would suggest. Privately, however, many
of them worry that they are saddling future generations with an
enormous burden, particularly since Japan has one of the lowest
birthrates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government's finances fall into ever greater
disarray, the private sector finally seems to be addressing its
financial mess. Banks and corporations have started working to
repair their balance sheets, shedding both debt and underutilized
assets.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter sold the first set of
securities backed by bad real estate debts; it was the first sign
that banks are finally admitting that the problem loans that pushed
them so perilously close to collapse in 1998 will never be
recovered and must be cleared away.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi and NEC have allied to manufacture commodity memory
chips; in the past each would have insisted on going it alone. And
Nissan Motors is writing off five factories that it is closing.
Throughout Japan, companies are finally acknowledging, and in some
cases writing off, huge deficits in their pension plans as they
face changes in accounting rules that will go into effect next
year, creating improved clarity for investors.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside here, however. While these companies attempt
to put their houses in order, they are sharply curtailing capital
investment and, in the process, crimping the economy. When Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone said it would cut its spending by $8.5
billion, NEC, one of the telephone giant's biggest suppliers and
itself in the throes of an overhaul, groaned. It, in turn, will no
doubt cut its spending, passing the pain on to its own suppliers in
a ripple that is being repeated throughout Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I cut my costs, I also cut your sales,'' Katz, the author,
noted.
</P>
<P>
   As long as that sort of reorganization continues, the economy
will be under pressure. Most economists _ and several prominent
Japanese officials, including the head of Japan's central bank,
Masaru Hayami, and Koichi Kato, a potential candidate for prime
minister _ believe that the pain will eventually lead to
self-sustaining economic momentum as leaner companies begin to
perform more competitively.
</P>
<P>
   But a good deal of hard work remains. Robert Alan Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo, said that for
Japanese companies to raise their return on assets to the levels
they enjoyed in 1990 _ about 4 percent on average, which is meager
by Western standards _ they would either have to cut labor costs by
something like 13 percent or write off as much as 50 percent of
their assets, neither of which is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' Feldman said, ``investors have probably
underestimated the required scale and scope of the restructuring
effort.''

U.S. MADE DEAL WITH CUBA TO END LOUISIANA HOSTAGE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By MARC LACEY with DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. officials ended a hostage standoff at a
Louisiana prison by striking a deal with the Cuban government that
will permit the seven Cuban inmates at the center of the uprising
to be deported to Havana, federal officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Cuban inmates, all deemed a threat to public safety by
the United States, had completed their prison sentences in this
country but were being held indefinitely because their deportation,
the usual procedure for felons who are not citizens, had been
blocked by the government of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba dropped its opposition in an agreement reached with the
State Department on Saturday, and late Saturday night the hostages
were set free and the inmates surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was highly unusual for two countries that do not
acknowledge each other diplomatically and cannot reach consensus on
far less sensitive matters. What it may portend for U.S.-Cuba
relations remains uncertain. The deal leaves unaddressed the status
of approximately 2,400 other Cubans who are in U.S. jails awaiting
deportation to Cuba, some of whom have resorted to violence in the
past to show their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a great deal of frustration among the Cubans
who are under detention without any sign of deportation,'' said
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``We view this case as distinct from the others. Here, the
inmates specifically asked to be returned to Cuba and the Cuban
government agreed to take them. That is not the case in the bulk of
the 2,400 others.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the decision to grant the
inmates' demands was appropriate in this case because it coincided
with U.S. interests. Attorney General Janet Reno was closely
involved in the decision, aides said, as were officials in the
White House and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``These inmates requested to be returned to Cuba,'' said Carole
Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, ``and if they had been
from anywhere else they would have been returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' she said, ``is we have a resolution here
that's in the best interests of the United States. We have a
situation that might have ended in a messy way that ended
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department contacted Cuban officials through the U. S.
interests section in Havana and worked out a deal in which Cuba
would accept the inmates, a State Department spokeswoman said.
``We're grateful that the situation has been resolved in a peaceful
manner,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, the inmates were taken from the prison in buses
to an undisclosed site under the custody of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Officials said the exact timing of the
deportation remained unclear, although it would most likely take
place within a few days. Because there are no direct commercial
flights between the United States and Cuba, the usual means of
deportation, the inmates could be returned on a charter flight, a
military aircraft or a Coast Guard cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Louisiana said a chaplain, a Spanish-language
television producer and the mother of one of the hostage takers all
helped resolve the standoff. It was Mercedes Villar, the mother of
inmate Roberto Villar-Grana, who first disclosed a deal between the
United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Mrs. Villar told reporters, indicating that she
had seen a written agreement guaranteeing the inmates' safe passage
to Cuba. ``They're on the bus now and going to Cuba. They're going
to an airplane and going to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The rare moment of cooperation between the United States and
Cuba came as the two countries remained at odds on another
immigration case _ that of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old boy who was
rescued off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy survived the
attempted trip to the United States, in which his mother and
stepfather drowned. Cuba has condemned the United States for not
immediately returning the boy to his father in Cuba. After initial
hesitation, the INS has sent signals recently that it intends to
send the boy home. It was unclear whether there was any connection
between the Gonzalez case and the deportation agreement. A Justice
Department official said she knew of no connection.
</P>
<P>
   Demanding to be released or senother country, the inmates
last Monday took over the prison in St. Martinville, La.. Wielding
a knife and screwdriver, the prisoners held as hostages the warden,
Todd Louvierre; a deputy, Jolie Sonnier, and five female inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban prisoners arrived in the United States two decades ago
during the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which Castro sent thousands
of Cuban criminals to Miami. After committing crimes in this
country _ offenses ranging from drug possession to rape and murder
_ they served their sentences and then found themselves in a legal
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In all of their cases, an immigration judge had ordered them out
of the country, but the lack of a repatriation agreement between
the United States and Cuba made that impossible. Because they had
been deemed threats to society by an immigration judge, the INS
could not release them pending deportation, immigration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven Cubans who are expected to be deported.
Officials said five were in the prison at the time of the
surrender, and two others were believed to be the inmates who gave
up earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants facing deportation can seek to be sent to a country
different from their country of origin as long as that country
agrees to accept them. ``If any third country had agreed to take
them, we would have sent them,'' said Russ Bergeron, a spokesman
with the INS.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The six-day ordeal ended shortly before midnight Saturday, when
a group of police officers and FBI swat team members began running
out of the prison, jumping up and down, cheering and throwing their
helmets and riot shields into the air. When reporters asked them
what was happening, they said the Cubans had given up.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the jail warden who had been shackled to a
chair and held at knifepoint since Monday was wheeled out on a
stretcher to an ambulance. Louvierre, who had grown a beard while a
hostage, was sitting up, shaking hands and smiling. He had a black
eye and a cheek welt which he received during the initial fight
with his captors, but did not appear to be seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides what you see on my face, they didn't do anything, and
that's really nothing,'' the warden told reporters at a news
conference Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The other remaining jail employee, Jolie Sonnier, came out next,
and was not sitting up on her stretcher. She and Louvierre were
both taken to a local hospital, and officials said neither had been
seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the hostage takers were led out of a side
door, unshackled, to a green and white motor coach bearing the
insignia of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts attributed the prison uprising to a flawed U.S.
policy toward Cuba, which has forced the immigration service to
keep as many as 2,400 Cuban inmates in prison well after their
sentences have expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd gone to the extreme of murder no one would have
supported these inmates,'' said Wayne Smith, who was the ranking
American diplomat in Havana under Presidents Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan and is a leading critic of the embargo against Cuba.
``But you really have to sympathize with them. What are they
supposed to do, just sit there? They obviously became desperate.
Luckily, this situation has been resolved without bloodshed.''

WHITE HOUSE WARNS OF `HEIGHTENED RISK' OF TERRORIST ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TERROR-BORDERS) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With security being tightened after the arrest of
an Algerian man who crossed the Canadian border into Washington
with powerful bomb-making materials, President Clinton's national
security adviser warned Americans on Sunday to be more vigilant
over the next few weeks because of a ``heightened risk of terrorist
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department has issued similar warnings in recent
weeks for Americans traveling abroad during millennial
celebrations, Sandy Berger, the White House's ranking security
aide, broadened the caution Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aware of any other specific threat against
particular targets in the United States, and obviously if that
changes we'll alert the American people,'' Berger said on the CBS
program ``Face the Nation.'' ``But I would think that as Americans
go about their plans for New Year's, they simply should be
vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``If they see something suspicious, or see
packages or activities that they think are unusual, they should
obviously let law enforcement people know.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, American officials have been walking a
careful line between urging citizens to exercise prudence on the
one hand, while on the other hand not seeming alarmist. But while
security forces have been put on alert in American cities that are
planning millennial celebrations, the main concern has been
overseas, because intelligence agencies have said they have
``specific and credible'' information that Americans abroad are
being targeted by extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Even without other such evidence about the risks of an attack in
the United States, the arrest in Washington state has prompted
tighter security at the borders.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that investigators had so far been unable to discern
the motives, plans and possible affiliations of the Algerian, Ahmed
Ressam, who was arrested last week after he crossed the border by
ferry into Port Angeles, Wash., driving a car filled with the
ingredients for a powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The car carried nitroglycerine, urea powder and timing devices
that officials said were capable of being used in a bomb that could
have caused substantial damage to an office building or a crowd of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that Ressam was being investigated for possible ties
to a wide range of terrorist groups, including the organization
headed by Osama Bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who lives
in Afghanistan and is accused of being behind the bombings of two
American embassies in Africa last year. Some officials have said
that Ressam may have had affiliations with the Islamic Armed Group,
a terrorist organization that operates primarily in North Africa
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Montreal, where Ressam had lived, reported that
they had discovered evidence that he might have shared an apartment
with Karim Said Atmani, who was extradited by Canada to France
following charges that he participated in several bombings,
including one of a Paris subway in 1995 that killed four people and
injured 86.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities were investigating possible ties between
Ressam and a group of 11 other men, most of Algerian origin, who
had been arrested over the last few months for thefts. Officials
say that the thefts, which consisted of more than 5,000 items, may
have been part of a broader scheme to help finance Algerian
terrorist activities. American officials have said that Ressam has
a Canadian criminal record for theft of property valued at under
$5,000, and that he was being sought on a Canadian arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest as he left Canada last week has prompted American
customs officials to tighten security even more than they already
had. Border guards, American embassies, military installations and
local police in big cities have also been on heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials in Washington said Sunday that they would add
at least 150 more inspectors at remote sites across the Mexican and
Canadian borders, including Port Angeles, in response to the arrest
of Ressam. The additional security would come from a combination of
redeployed customs inspectors and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said that
because of concerns about terrorist attacks during the year-end
holidays, Customs, like other law enforcement agencies, had been
placed on a ``heightened state of alert'' even before the latest
episode. The new steps, he said, were an additional tightening of
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to assume that this person tried to cross at a
remote point because of the fairly minimal staffing we have
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that travelers would be unlikely to have longer waits
when entering the United States, either at remote places or the
largest international airports.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies around the world have been taking steps
to head off possible terrorist acts. In Pakistan, authorities in
Islamabad said they had arrested more than 200 people, mostly
Afghan nationals, and tightened security in the largest airports to
avert attacks on American citizens, according to The Associated
Press. The arrests were made in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
and in northwestern Peshawar, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in Jordan arrested 13 people who Jordanian
authorities said were planning attacks there after being trained in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service said
Sunday that the potential for terrorist-related violence by Muslim
extremists has been a top concern of the agency in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That concern has been heightened by the attention surrounding
millennium-eve celebrations and Ressam's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic extremists may use the millennial celebrations to
further their interests with terrorist acts, said Dan Lambert of
the CSIS.

THE CONTEST: MANY PARTIES BUT FEW ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-ELECT) 
(nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian voters Sunday elected a new Duma, or lower chamber of
parliament, to sit for four years. Here are some facts and figures
about the election:
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTE: Half of the 450 seats are decided on the basis of
party lists. Any party that gets more than 5 percent of the vote
will get seats in proportion to its overall vote. The other 225
seats are decided on individual constituency races, in which
parties also take part.
</P>
<P>
   THE PARTIES: Twenty-six parties are running, with about six
expected to break the 5 percent vote threshold. The Communists,
currently the largest party, are expected to do well, along with
several centrist parties, including Unity and Fatherland-All
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES: The campaign has not paid much attention to issues.
Most of the debate has centered on the character of party leaders,
with a great deal of political mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   THE PARLIAMENT: Russia's legislature consists of the elected
State Duma and a higher chamber, the Federation Council, which
consists of governors of Russia's regions and main cities.
</P>
<P>
   THE DUMA: The lower house has the power to enact legislation and
oversee taxation, but the constitution gives greater power to the
president, who appoints the prime minister and ministers who run
the government.

JETS RALLY TO KEEP THEIR FAINT PLAYOFF HOPES ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When it seemed their season was over, the New
York Jets continued to surprise Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For a club given up for dead before a month had gone by, the
Jets took their tissue-thin playoff hopes into the final hours of
Week 14.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week they were a comeback team in the
fourth quarter. This time they halted the Cowboys, who had been 6-0
at home this season, 22-21. The winning score was the 37-yard field
goal by the enigmatic place-kicker, John Hall. Just last Sunday, he
missed two extra points against the Dolphins before kicking a
clutch fourth-quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In lifting the Jets' record to 6-8 and his mark as a starter to
4-3, Ray Lucas led the winning drive as he continued to learn on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   As the jubilant Jets left for the flight home, they were
depending on the Arizona Cardinals to beat the Buffalo Bills Sunday
night to keep the Jets' playoff hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are still hanging _ without much to hope for,'' Coach
Bill Parcells said. His biggest complaint after the game _ or at
least one that he was willing to share _ was a bad play by Lucas on
which he fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' Wayne Chrebet admitted.
``Yeah, you think back one or two victories here and there _ but
the truth is, we won some games last year that you could say was
luck, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Jets' fifth victory in their last seven games, and
while it left their future uncertain, it kept the Cowboys' division
rival Giants still firmly in the playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are looking more and more professional behind Lucas,
and they showed it against the renowned Cowboys, who are led by
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith and with a defense that is one of the
best against the run.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive drive began when the Jets took over with under six
minutes remaining on their 40. With Curtis Martin producing some
quality runs, the Jets moved to the Cowboys' 19.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Hall was calm and focused. ``I don't even hear
Bill Parcells screaming at me when I've got to come in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been concerned about last week's two extra-point misses?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you're talking about,'' he told the
questioner.
</P>
<P>
   This was an often bizarre game: A back-up tight end named Eric
Bjornson, who has the arcane skill of being able to hold a football
for place-kicks, scored his second touchdown in the last three
years to put the Cowboys ahead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But Bjornson neither caught the ball nor received a handoff from
Aikman. Instead, he loped home 20 yards on a faked field-goal
attempt to give the Cowboys a 14-13 lead. His last touchdown
running came the same way a year ago _ on a faked kick.
</P>
<P>
   This worked so well the Jets gave him the complete right side of
the field and he had little trouble crossing the goal-line after
taking the snap from Dale Hellestoroe, as Eddie Murray lined up as
if to kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had kept the Cowboys pinned back, for the most part.
But punting was to play a key role for both sides during the early
going.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets took a 6-0 lead on Hall field goals to cap their first
two possessions. The first, a 47-yarder, was the kicker's longest
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But on their third drive the Jets had to punt, and this set the
stage for the game within the game among Tom Tupa, Chris Hayes and
Deion Sanders. Tupa had said he wouldn't hesitate to kick the ball
toward Sanders, arguably the most dangerous punt-returner in pro
football. Tupa has supreme confidence in the Jets' leading
``gunner,'' Chris Hayes, who leads the club in special-teams'
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders lined up on his 40, waving the crowd on to cheer. Tupa
then launched a 55-yard bazooka shot that drove Sanders back toward
the right sideline. Hayes was off with the punt, trying to bear
down on Sanders. But the Cowboys had him covered and Hayes was
pushed continuously as the tried to find a hole to nail Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sanders eluded everyone else for 26 yards, and that
helped position the Cowboys' first score.
</P>
<P>
   Smith handled the ball four straight times _ three runs good for
27 yards, and then a 14-yard pass to the right flat, where Smith
apparently was forgotten about by the Jets' defense. He rambled in
for the score to put the Cowboys ahead by 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Jets punted, though, they produced another of
those big plays that has enabled them to stay competitive in this
learning season of Lucas'. Tupa's 51-yard punt was downed on the 1
by Dwight Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then,'' explained Tupa, ``we just decided to kick it
straight and high _ do what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could not dig out of the hole and the Jets got the
ball back in good field position. It got even better after Dedric
Ward drew a 34-yard pass-interference call against Kevin Smith that
put the ball on the Dallas 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas immediately drilled a touchdown pass to Richie
Anderson-Lucas's seventh scoring pass without an interception in
the last three games. He was to wind up firing two touchdowns,
although he was intercepted for the first time in 156 throws.
</P>
<P>
   That lead lasted only a few minutes, though, as Bjornson kept
alive his career. The Jets had a chance to go ahead as halftime
approached. Hall, though, was wide with a 49-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' lead expanded to 21-13 on another bit of trickery
in the third quarter. This time Rocket Ismail produced a 27-yard
score on an end-around.
</P>
<P>
   The surprises continued, though. Lucas, who had earlier thrown
the longest pass of his career, 35 to Keyshawn Johnson, connected
on one of 38 yards to Chrebet, then for 14 to Keyshawn _ and
finally a 2-yard scoring pass to Blake Spence.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first career score for Spence, the second-year tight
end who is one of the Parcells Five. They are the young players he
warned 10 days ago that their careers were on the line in these
final games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 21-19, the Jets went for the 2-point play. But
Lucas, on a delayed keeper, was stopped short. It was only a
temporary embarrassment. After all, Lucas said, ``the game is
slowing down for me. I'm seeing things more clearly.''

COMMENTARY: TO STOP THE EAVESDROP
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Md., Calif., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice prosecutors protect Asian money agents John
Huang and Charlie Trie so they won't rat on higher-ups; a Clinton
appointee protects Buddhist money-raiser Maria Hsia lest she expose
Al Gore; the Arkansas Bar Association refuses to disbar a member
who misled a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to the prosecution in Democratic Maryland of Linda
Tripp for daring to embarrass a Democratic president by taping her
calls with Monica Lewinsky. In a year of cover-ups and corruptions
of the law, the one person facing jail is the one who forced out
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's mistake was to rely on immunity issued by the
independent counsel. Because it had not yet been approved by a
federal judge, her subsequent taping is being prosecuted by an
ambitious pol currying Democratic favor by seeking vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   So this is a palpable case of selective prosecution for partisan
purposes, right? Yes, but. The famous Tripp taping of her
conversations with Monica, further publicized by this witch hunt in
Maryland, may do a lot of good for privacy in America.
</P>
<P>
   I became radicalized about this after learning of being
illegally wiretapped in 1969, when I was a Nixon speechwriter.
These third-party intrusions _ handing-around of transcripts of
private talks with my wife, doctor and rabbi _ were compounded by
the self-taping of calls by Nixon, following the ugly tradition set
by his Oval Office predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   That turned me into a privacy nut. In the '80s, I caught a
Reagan crony, then running the USIA, secretly taping many of his
calls. In D.C., this privacy invasion was no crime. His only
vulnerability came from calls he surreptitiously taped while in
Florida, a state that forbids such preying on its residents, but
the case was easily squelched.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Maryland's active prosecution of Tripp's surreptitious
taping _ a shameful act _ being publicized far and wide, future
miscreants will no longer be able to profess ignorance that it can
be an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   That's to the good. When your voice is recorded without your
knowledge, you may find yourself at the mercy of a blackmailer or
entrapper. If you speak with the reasonable expectation of privacy
_ as we do when speaking on the phone or in other private
conversation _ your friend or neighbor or business associate should
not be able to use your recorded voice to coerce or embarrass you.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of small, cheap recording devices, the
sense of distrust in communication has grown. What is this doing to
our society? Are we becoming a nation of snoops and doublecrossers?
Do we have to guard everything we say lest it be played back
against us? Unrecorded, you can say you were misunderstood, or turn
forgetful; but with your voice on somebody else's tape, your
faithless friend or tricky competitor can prove everything you
thought you said in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Secret taping is ethically wrong, but our ethical sense has been
eroded by easy technology and general thoughtlessness. Therefore,
we should lean on local legislators to make electronic
eavesdropping illegal, unless court-ordered for law enforcement.
That goes both for recording your own phone and wearing a wire to
entrap your friends.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the great state of New York, supposed bastion of
civil liberty, stand on this? Its latest so-called ``right to
privacy'' statute prohibits third-party wiretaps, but it allows the
taping of conversations with the consent of only one of the
participants. Some privacy; that gives New Yorkers the license to
record their callers, or to secretly tape-record anything said by
visitors to their homes or offices. Big Neighbor Is Bugging You.
</P>
<P>
   California, Florida, Maryland and 10 other alert states prohibit
that interpersonal snoopery. But states unconcerned with privacy _
New York and the rest of the sheep _ are waiting for federal law to
do their job for them. The telecommunications lobby won't let it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp's justification for taping is that she needed proof
to protect herself when the White House came after her for
truth-telling. She did what she considered right wrongly. I hope
her presumption of immunity keeps her out of the slammer, but if it
does not _ and if she were to call me from jail _ she can rest
assured I would tape nothing without her advance consent.

JAPAN CARRIES OUT EXECUTIONS IN NEAR-SECRECY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The deaths by hanging of Teruo Ono and Kazuo Sagawa last
week merited only a single sentence from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two condemned people were executed today,'' read the
announcement sent anonymously to the press on Friday. The names of
the condemned were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated telephone calls to the Justice Ministry, which oversees
executions, produced little more. Officials declined to identify
the executed, or even to describe their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The few facts known about the executed men _ their names, their
murder convictions and their lack of many relatives _ could be
learned only from lawmakers and rights advocates, and from Justice
Ministry officials who nervously confirmed the details while
insisting on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet far from being unusual, the executions were part of what has
become a peculiar twice-a-year ritual in Japan, the only advanced
industrialized country besides the United States that still
executes prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The United States executes far more people each year, but
opponents of the death penalty in Japan say this country is
distinguished by unusual cruelty in the conditions of detention and
the near-secret application of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners remain on death row as long as 20 or 30 years, with
much of the time spent in solitary confinement, Japanese rights
groups say. Families are kept in the dark until the executions have
been carried out, and the condemned prisoners themselves are given
only an hour's notice. Indeed, until recently the government made
no announcement at all about its executions and refused to confirm
their occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has executed 32 prisoners in this fashion in the last 10
years, and 50 more remain on death row.
</P>
<P>
   The executions, which typically take place in the summer and at
year's end, are conducted when Parliament is in recess, to avoid
parliamentary discussion. Local news organizations, sparsely
informed, seem little inclined to probe the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we notify the prisoner beforehand,'' said a spokesman for
the Justice Ministry, ``the person's emotional state may become
disturbed. Therefore we can't notify anyone before the hanging,
including the prisoner. After the execution, we inform the family
as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rights advocates in Japan offer a different explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government has been trying to hide the death
penalty from public discussion, very successfully,'' said Julie
Morizawa, secretary-general of Amnesty International Japan. ``We
don't know beforehand what is happening with prisoners. The
government simply executes people and then sends out a one-line fax
announcing it. This is what they call disclosure of information, or
transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   For many critics this secretiveness speaks volumes about the way
Japanese society functions. Bureaucratic authorities typically make
decisions affecting the lives of large numbers of people after
little or no public debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an outright crisis, the country's weak
nongovernmental organizations and civic groups make little noise
about policies that will affect them. The press registers the
passing of events, often serving more as an official gazette than a
critical institution, and the public quietly acquiesces.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, there is a strong tendency to sweep away
painful, embarrassing or contentious matters, however important,
rather than air them or encourage open debate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the death penalty is popular in Japan. Its critics say
any serious re-examination of the issue is all the more unlikely
since a number of spectacular recent crimes, particularly the
poison gas attack on a Tokyo subway in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few critics, including members of Parliament, see the
silence surrounding the death penalty as contributing to what may
come to be seen as the wrongful death of the prisoners executed
last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of his execution, a lawyer for Ono was petitioning
to reopen his case. But the Justice Ministry chose to ignore that
fact, said Nobuaki Futami, a legislator who is secretary-general of
the parliamentary Association for the Abolishment of the Death
Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a citizens group petitioned recently for a stay of
execution for Sagawa and succeeded in getting the Tokyo Detention
Center, where he was incarcerated, to offer its evaluation of him.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, before the prison could finish its review, the
Justice Ministry ordered that the punishment be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States,'' Futami said, ``notice is given to the
prisoner and to his family, and often a farewell dinner is even
held. If we had such practices in Japan, Mr. Sagawa would have
known that a petition had been filed on his behalf, and perhaps the
execution could have been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the ministry has become more bold in carrying out its
executions, and what we have is a big problem from the standpoint
of human rights.''

GORE AND BRADLEY AS PERFORMERS ON A POLITICAL STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DEMS-DEBATE) 
(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their Tweedledum-Tweedledee wardrobes and demeanor said a lot
about what to expect from the debate between Al Gore and Bill
Bradley on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. Sitting side by side
in dark suits and nearly identical red ties, they even folded their
hands on the table the same way, a tableau of two Democrats
fraternally agreeing on the big issues while quibbling over such
details as how to finance health care.
</P>
<P>
   But halfway through the hour, Vice President Gore used a
question about campaign finance to drag in his immodest proposal:
that the men debate twice a week and eliminate all radio and
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ridiculous proposal,'' Bradley said, and the
five-minute exchange that followed revealed more strikingly than
ever their deep philosophical differences on political stagecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came off as a postmodern actor, demonstrating honesty by
calling attention to the theatrical artifice that is a political
campaign. With roots in the Method style of displaying emotions
directly, he worked to reveal ``candor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore came off as an old-fashioned actor whose approach is to
ignore the artifice and pretend that what happens on stage is
``real.'' He was ready with his dramatic flourishes and props,
committed to the script.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like Tweedledum and Tweedledee but in
performance Bradley was Spalding Gray to Gore's Jack Lemmon, two
styles that do not belong in the same generation, much less the
same play. And performance style is not a flippant issue here; it
suggests how each man would act out the real-life role of
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could call it the `Meet the Press' agreement,'' Gore said
of his proposition. ``I'm willing to do it right now if you'll
shake on it.'' And he extended his hand to create the image
calculated to become the photo of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, Al, and I don't know if you get this, but a
political campaign is not just a performance for people, which is
what this is,'' Bradley said, subtly gesturing to the set around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I'm doing,'' Gore insisted, holding his hands to
his chest in a gesture of sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continued, saying a campaign is ``a dialogue with people
where you listen,'' his smile suggesting the absurdity of the Gore
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And he concluded by calling attention to Gore's media strategy:
``I'm not someone who's interested in tactics, Al. That was a very
interesting ploy on `Meet the Press.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't tactics, it's how we discuss issues,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Those strategies were not invented Sunday. After Bradley's
appearance on campaign finance reform on Thursday with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, a candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, a voter asked whether that staged handshake wasn't mere
``grandstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the need for media stunts, he answered, ``This is the
reality of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent ``60 Minutes,'' Gore took Lesley Stahl home to
meet his mother in Tennessee and stood on the porch casually saying
he would be back for lunch, studiously avoiding any acknowledgment
of the cameras or the event's staginess.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, both candidates seem to be warming to
the debate process. They were more engaged with each other's ideas
Sunday than they were during Friday's town hall meeting on ABC's
``Nightline,'' when they talked past each other, and Ted Koppel,
the moderator, seemed so reluctant to step in that the conversation
meandered without much purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's debate suggested that these candidates need a deft
moderator to keep them on track, which Tim Russert did with
detailed questions that helped cut through the campaign rhetoric.
And knowing when to step in and when to let the candidates go, he
smartly allowed the exchange about the Gore proposal to take its
course.
</P>
<P>
   But five minutes is long in television time, and Gore might have
won the battle of the sound bites. A CNN report, typical of the
debate coverage, began by noting that Bradley ``will not be taking
up Gore's offer'' to drop advertising. Playing a few seconds of the
conversation, it reduced a revealing exchange to the kind of skewed
news snippet that may be the media campaign's true defining force.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Warren Wegele is on the front line of a medical
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After doing a simple blood test recently, doctors at the
University of Cincinnati Medical Center told Wegele, a 65-year-old
former salesman for air-compressor companies, that he had inherited
a tiny alteration in one of his genes. A certain chemical unit out
of the string of 3 billion that make up the mass of DNA in his
cells is different from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The alteration _ found in 5 percent of the population _ would
normally be of no more medical significance to Wegele (pronounced
WEG-lee) than his black hair or burly physique. But it translated
into a potential medical catastrophe for Wegele when he became ill
with congestive heart failure, a disease in which the heart muscle
no longer contracts vigorously. On average, patients with the
condition live five years after they become ill; some live 10 years
or more.
</P>
<P>
   But people with anomalies like Wegele's altered gene, doctors
told him, usually live only one to two years. For these people, the
drugs used to treat the disease may be of little help.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary new genetics that predicted Wegele's dire
circumstances is not about genes that confer generally good health
or health that is generally poor. Instead, it is about a collection
of common single-molecule variations in genetic material that are
normally no more important than having curly or straight hair, or
brown or blue eyes, but might be revealing when people become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe humans have hundreds of thousands of these
genetic variations, and drug companies are avidly searching for
them, convinced that they can use collections of them to identify
patients who will benefit from drugs, patients who will not, and
patients who will suffer troubling side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they say, this research will lead them into an era
of tailor-made medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So far, testing for such genetic variants is being done only at
a few medical centers as part of experimental trials. Experts
predict a gradual increase in such testing as the roster of
variations is compiled and research accelerates. They predict that
the first personalized drug prescriptions will appear in a few
years and many more will roll out over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the advanced genetic testing will probably be used for
refining drugs for the more common diseases like asthma, arthritis,
heart disease, high blood pressure and migraines. Eventually,
experts say, it could be applied to virtually any drug for any
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices could increase, some drug company executives say,
but they add that drugs will be so much more effective that they
will be worth more to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, optimistic predictions of scientists and drug
companies can go awry, and until the revolution in pharmacology
takes place, it is hard to know if the glowing predictions are
accurate. So far, relatively few genetic variants have been found
and only a small number of these have been shown to have medical
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In Wegele's case, there was no good drug to slow his disease.
But that did not mean he had not been helped. Based on their data
from a continuing study that now includes about 500 patients with
congestive heart failure, doctors at the University of Cincinnati
hospital said that the only long-term hope for people with Wegele's
genetic variant was a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, Wegele received a new heart. A week later he was well
enough to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Liggett, a lung specialist and molecular geneticist
at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, was intrigued
by one particular gene and found that there were three variants of
it. Last year, in a paper in The Journal of Clinical
Investigations, Liggett and his colleagues showed how these genetic
variants affected disease prognosis in congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Tennessee at Memphis, Dr. Julie Johnson,
Dr. John Lima and their colleagues obtained similar results in a
study of asthma patients.
</P>

   Now the challenge is to tailor drug treatments to help those who
have genetic variants that spell a poor prognosis. ``That,'' said
Liggett, ``is the key to pharmacogenetics.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, ten large drug companies joined forces with the
Wellcome Trust, a medical research charity, and several leading
academic centers, to compare human DNA segments and find the places
where variations occur.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will use these variations, called single
nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and pronounced ``snips,'' to try
to develop the precisely targeted drugs of the future. Their goal
is to identify 300,000 such landmarks along the human DNA within
two years and make the results public.

RABBI CALLS FOR ACTION ON GUNS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of Reform Judaism's synagogue organization, the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, voted overwhelmingly Sunday to adopt
a resolution calling on social action committees in Reform
synagogues to urge congregants to write their congressional
representatives ``demanding that effective gun control'' laws be
enacted next year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came a day after the union's president, Rabbi Eric
Yoffie, delivered a sermon saying Reform Jews should regard gun
control as ``a solemn religious obligation'' to counter what he
called society's idolatry of guns.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, passed by a voice vote at the union's biennial
assembly in Orlando, Fla., also urged that each of the union's 875
Reform congregations invite elected officials in their area to talk
about their positions on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union has previously spoken out for gun control,
the resolution goes further in asking Reform Jews to take specific
actions and saying the next several months may be crucial to the
passage of gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Yoffie delivered a sermon to the 4,700 people at
the gathering, in which he urged greater efforts to protect
children. ``Now is the time to assemble a critical mass of citizens
who will stand up and say no to the deadly toll that guns take on
the lives of our children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gun-flooded society has turned weapons into idols,'' he
said, ``and the worship of idols must be recognized for what it is
_ blasphemy. The only appropriate religious response to idolatry is
sustained moral outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before his sermon, Yoffie said the union wanted
to go beyond rhetoric, to launch a nonpartisan but ``very, very
focused'' effort. In the past, he said, ``there's been a great deal
of passion'' by opponents of gun control, and not enough by its
supporters among Reform Jews.

NBC TO SUPPORT A HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE OVER PHONE LINES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Mass.) (EDS: Note (AT) in place of symbol in 20th graf) 
 (rk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC, along with several affiliated companies, has agreed to
support a new nationwide service that will offer high-speed
Internet access over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NBC's primary forays into the Internet have been
MSNBC, its cable and Internet news joint venture with Microsoft,
and the Snap.com Web service, a broad search and directory site, in
which it is the controlling shareholder. Both MSNBC and Snap.com
serve people who already have a connection to the Internet at their
homes or offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now NBC and affiliate companies are investing $70.5 million for
a 19.5 percent stake in Telocity, a company based in Cupertino,
Calif., that last month introduced a high-speed DSL, or digital
subscriber line, Internet service for $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The investment represents $37.5 million in cash and $33 million
in television advertising and online promotion and will be made by
NBC; its parent company, General Electric; NBCi, the company that
operates Snap; and Value Vision International, a cable shopping
channel in which GE has a large stake.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed Internet access, also known as broadband service, can
be offered either over cable television systems or telephone lines.
In either case, the speed of downloading information can be as much
as 20 to 30 times faster than using standard 56K modems. That is
fast enough to let users link to audio and video programming as
well as Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is NBC's turf,'' said Martin J. Yudkovitz, president of
NBC Interactive Media. ``High-speed broadband means video. And
finally the Internet is moving to a turf we understand as well as
or better than anyone else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is entering one of the most competitive and difficult areas
of the Internet. America Online, which dominates the market for
traditional slow-speed access, said on Friday that its subscriber
base had reached 20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing segment of the Internet-access market,
however, is made up of companies offering deeply discounted or free
Internet services, including NetZero and new offerings from
Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's entry into the high-speed market will compete with cable
companies, including AT&AMP;T and Time Warner, telephone companies like
Bell Atlantic, and newcomers like Rhythms NetConnections. America
Online has its own high-speed offering in the form of deals with
telephone companies, called AOL Plus, which also uses DSL
technology over standard phone lines. The growing competition is
likely to depress the prices for high-speed service, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current price is $49.95 a month, but prices will go way
down over the next 18 months,'' predicted Dave Burstein, the editor
of DSL Prime, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement calls for NBCi to create programming for
Telocity that would include the portal features of Snap plus
special audio and video programming that takes advantage of the
high speed.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will receive some Telocity subscription revenue and Telocity
will earn part of the revenue NBC earns selling ads on the service.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement lets NBC invest in rivals of Telocity, but
Telocity is prohibited from dealing with competitors of NBCi.
Indeed, Snap now provides programming for several other companies
that offer high-speed service, including Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Telocity was founded in 1997 by Peter Olson, a founder of Octel
Communications, a voice-mail equipment maker that was bought by
Lucent Technologies. It does not operate its own telecommunication
network; instead, it leases DSL connections from local telephone
companies. DSL allows a single telephone line to be used
simultaneously for voice calls and high-speed data.
</P>
<P>
   Telocity, however, employs a high-speed modem that enables
consumers to connect a computer to the DSL line without requiring a
visit from a technician. The device also contains a microprocessor
and has the capacity to offer other services like home networks,
video feeds to television sets and home security.
</P>
<P>
   Officially Telocity sells the modem for $99, though it is
offering it free in promotions. The cost to build the device will
be about $150 next year, as volume increases, said Patti Hart, the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Telocity service is now available in Chicago and several
cities in the Southeast. It has 2,500 subscribers. By the end of
next year, the company plans to offer the service in 35 major
markets nationwide and in 50 markets by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market for high-speed access has grown slowly, in
large part because the services were not available to most
customers. The Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, estimates
that only 11 percent of homes in the United States can now get DSL
service and 25 percent can get high-speed cable service. So far,
Yankee estimates, there are 300,000 home users of DSL, with SBC
Communications as the technology's leading provider.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 2 million households now subscribe to high-speed
cable modem services. Excite(AT)Home, the high-speed Internet
service controlled by AT&AMP;T and a group of other cable companies,
has 1 million subscribers. Road Runner, backed principally by Time
Warner and the MediaOne Group, has 420,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC is betting that these numbers will grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look eight years out, we believe that 60 to 70 percent
of the households will have broadband access,'' said Edmond
Sanctis, the president of NBCi.

WHITE HOUSE WARNS OF `HEIGHTENED RISK' OF TERRORIST ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to insert `the state of' in lede for clarification.) 
(See also TERROR-BORDERS) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With security being tightened after the arrest of
an Algerian man who crossed the Canadian border into the state of
Washington with powerful bomb-making materials, President Clinton's
national security adviser warned Americans on Sunday to be more
vigilant over the next few weeks because of a ``heightened risk of
terrorist actions.''
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department has issued similar warnings in recent
weeks for Americans traveling abroad during millennial
celebrations, Sandy Berger, the White House's ranking security
aide, broadened the caution Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aware of any other specific threat against
particular targets in the United States, and obviously if that
changes we'll alert the American people,'' Berger said on the CBS
program ``Face the Nation.'' ``But I would think that as Americans
go about their plans for New Year's, they simply should be
vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``If they see something suspicious, or see
packages or activities that they think are unusual, they should
obviously let law enforcement people know.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, American officials have been walking a
careful line between urging citizens to exercise prudence on the
one hand, while on the other hand not seeming alarmist. But while
security forces have been put on alert in American cities that are
planning millennial celebrations, the main concern has been
overseas, because intelligence agencies have said they have
``specific and credible'' information that Americans abroad are
being targeted by extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Even without other such evidence about the risks of an attack in
the United States, the arrest in Washington state has prompted
tighter security at the borders.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that investigators had so far been unable to discern
the motives, plans and possible affiliations of the Algerian, Ahmed
Ressam, who was arrested last week after he crossed the border by
ferry into Port Angeles, Wash., driving a car filled with the
ingredients for a powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The car carried nitroglycerin, urea powder and timing devices
that officials said were capable of being used in a bomb that could
have caused substantial damage to an office building or a crowd of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that Ressam was being investigated for possible ties
to a wide range of terrorist groups, including the organization
headed by Osama Bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who lives
in Afghanistan and is accused of being behind the bombings of two
American embassies in Africa last year. Some officials have said
that Ressam may have had affiliations with the Islamic Armed Group,
a terrorist organization that operates primarily in North Africa
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Montreal, where Ressam had lived, reported that
they had discovered evidence that he might have shared an apartment
with Karim Said Atmani, who was extradited by Canada to France
following charges that he participated in several bombings,
including one of a Paris subway in 1995 that killed four people and
injured 86.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities were investigating possible ties between
Ressam and a group of 11 other men, most of Algerian origin, who
had been arrested over the last few months for thefts. Officials
say that the thefts, which consisted of more than 5,000 items, may
have been part of a broader scheme to help finance Algerian
terrorist activities. American officials have said that Ressam has
a Canadian criminal record for theft of property valued at under
$5,000, and that he was being sought on a Canadian arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest as he left Canada last week has prompted American
customs officials to tighten security even more than they already
had. Border guards, American embassies, military installations and
local police in big cities have also been on heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials in Washington said Sunday that they would add
at least 150 more inspectors at remote sites across the Mexican and
Canadian borders, including Port Angeles, in response to the arrest
of Ressam. The additional security would come from a combination of
redeployed customs inspectors and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said that
because of concerns about terrorist attacks during the year-end
holidays, Customs, like other law enforcement agencies, had been
placed on a ``heightened state of alert'' even before the latest
episode. The new steps, he said, were an additional tightening of
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to assume that this person tried to cross at a
remote point because of the fairly minimal staffing we have
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that travelers would be unlikely to have longer waits
when entering the United States, either at remote places or the
largest international airports.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies around the world have been taking steps
to head off possible terrorist acts. In Pakistan, authorities in
Islamabad said they had arrested more than 200 people, mostly
Afghan nationals, and tightened security in the largest airports to
avert attacks on American citizens, according to The Associated
Press. The arrests were made in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
and in northwestern Peshawar, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in Jordan arrested 13 people who Jordanian
authorities said were planning attacks there after being trained in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service said
Sunday that the potential for terrorist-related violence by Muslim
extremists has been a top concern of the agency in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That concern has been heightened by the attention surrounding
millennium-eve celebrations and Ressam's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic extremists may use the millennial celebrations to
further their interests with terrorist acts, said Dan Lambert of
the CSIS.

HEALTH CARE PROPOSALS HELP DEFINE DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore
have been sniping at each other over health care for weeks, and
their disagreements have become a way of defining the differences
between the two candidates for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised debate Sunday, the candidates continued to argue
over the merits and details of their health care proposals, with
each accusing the other of distorting his position.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health policy is, as might be expected, a continuation of
policies proposed by President Clinton since the collapse of his
plan in 1994 to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, like Clinton, proposes a series of incremental steps to
expand two programs for poor people and low-income families _
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. And like
Clinton, Gore proposes a major investment in Medicare, the federal
insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, to offer
prescription drug coverage to all beneficiaries and to shore up the
hospital insurance trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says his proposals are bolder, more ambitious and more
comprehensive. He says he would require all parents to obtain
insurance for their children. And he would let families purchase
insurance through the health program that covers government
workers, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Bradley
would offer subsidies, on a sliding scale, to help low-income
families buy such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When he unveiled his proposals in September, Bradley emphasized
``the importance of government doing a few big things well.'' And
on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' Sunday, Bradley said his
proposals showed that he was ``willing to deal with a big problem,
a comprehensive problem in a way that ensures middle-class
Americans some health.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, like Gore, would provide prescription drug benefits
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposals cost more than Gore's, but the disparity is
not as great as is often suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, Bradley and Gore have chosen to spend the
money in different ways. Bradley would use most of the money to
expand coverage for people under the age of 65, while Gore would
use billions of dollars to extend the life of the Medicare's
hospital trust fund by 12 years, to 2027.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore said he would set aside 15 percent of the
anticipated federal surplus over 15 years for Medicare,'' and he
asserted that Bradley ``does not set aside a penny for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain how he would ensure the solvency of Medicare
for the baby-boom generation, Bradley said, ``We're going to be
able to probably have a reduction in Medicare costs over time,''
because of breakthroughs in drugs and healthier living habits,
including more exercise and less smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a comparison of the main aspects of the Democrats'
health care proposals:
</P>
<P>
   COST: Bradley says his proposals would cost $55 billion to $65
billion a year. In the current political climate, that is a huge
sum. In the last 10 months, Congress struggled to find an
additional $3 billion a year for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money sought by Bradley would be used to subsidize
the premiums on private insurance bought by low-income families. In
addition, $5 billion to $7 billion would go for tax breaks to help
people buy health insurance, $10 billion would go for Medicare drug
benefits and $2 billion would be used to improve public health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has given only 10-year cost estimates for his
proposals. He says he would spend $146 billion over 10 years, about
$15 billion a year, to increase the number of people with health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore says he would invest $374 billion in Medicare
over the next 10 years. That includes $118 billion for drug
benefits. Most of the remainder would bolster the Medicare trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   THE COVERAGE: Bradley says his proposals would provide health
insurance for 30 million of the 44 million Americans who have no
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore say his proposals would cover 11 million to 15
million people.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAID: In place of Medicaid as it now exists, Bradley would
offer financial assistance to low-income people to buy private
health insurance. ``The nation,'' he says, ``should mainstream
current recipients of Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be a major change. Medicaid now provides health
insurance to 40 million people. The package of benefits is more
generous than that typically offered to workers by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says his proposal would ``provide greater choice of
insurance plans'' to people now on Medicaid. But Gore has harshly
criticized Bradley's proposals, saying they would shred an
important part of the safety net for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Sunday that Bradley's plan ``eliminates Medicaid and
replaces it with little $150-a-month vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied: ``That's wrong. That's not correct. It's not a
voucher.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, rather, a rough approximation of the federal contribution
to the cost of private health insurance for poor people. Bradley's
Web site says that for current Medicaid recipients and for adults
with annual incomes below the poverty level ($16,400 for a family
of four in 1997), the government would pay the full annual premium,
$1,800 a year for an adult and up to $5,000 for a family.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says it is difficult to buy good health insurance through
the federal employees program for $1,800 a year, or $150 a month.
``Ninety-five percent of all the health insurance plans that are
part of the Federal Employee Benefit Plan have premiums that are
far in excess of the $150 a month,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insisted that these figures were ``not a cap'' on the
federal contribution, but rather ``a weighted average'' of what the
government would contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Medicaid is far from perfect. ``Medicaid is
supposed to cover people who are poor,'' he said. ``But 40 percent
of the people who are in poverty in this country do not have any
health insurance. None. Medicaid doesn't cover them.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN: The candidates agree on the importance of health
insurance for children, but disagree on the best way to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he would ``guarantee access to affordable health
coverage for every child in America,'' by offering tax breaks and
by expanding Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says he would guarantee not just access to insurance,
but actual coverage. Under his proposal, he said, ``no child in
this country will be without health insurance.'' Parents will
enroll their children in health plans at the moment of birth, just
as they sign up for auto insurance when they buy cars, he said.

PERFECT GIFTS OF THE SEASON FOR A HIKER OR A CANOEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are still stumped on what to get a friend for the
holidays, you might consider a map. It can be a visual delight, an
essential navigational tool or a fascinating historical record.
</P>
<P>
   If your friend's digs are sufficiently commodious, consider a
wall map. The maps produced by Raven Maps and Images are not only
beautiful, they also give you the big picture of your state or
region at a glance. The company's offerings include maps of 43 of
the 50 states, one for North America and another for the entire
United States (minus Alaska and Hawaii), plus world maps.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these maps unusual is their almost three-dimensional
appearance, achieved through elevation tinting and shading that
enables the viewer to instantly see the contours of the land. The
tinting ranges from greens for the lower elevations, through
yellows, tans, browns, grays and, finally, white for the highest
points. The shading is applied as if the sun were in the northwest.
Those skilled in reading standard topographic maps can swiftly
discern mountains, hills and valleys, and river drainages, but it's
a knack that takes much time to master.
</P>
<P>
   Raven's state maps, which include major highways, cities, towns,
lakes and rivers, put landforms in perspective with minimal reading
effort. They would be an ideal gift for many, but are large in
order to accommodate their exquisite detail _ so large that you're
not going to find room for one of them in many places in the
average home. My Raven map of Maine, which measures 36 inches by 48
inches, will hang on the staircase wall of my family's lodge on
Maine's Salmon Stream Lake, alongside several topographic maps that
zero in on the specific area.
</P>
<P>
   Raven maps vary in size. The New York State map is 43 inches by
59 inches; the map of Alaska is 35 by 64; that of the lower 48
states is 37 by 58. On the other hand, Massachusetts, Connecticut
and Rhode Island are combined in one map that measures 32 by 36.
Obviously, the maps of some of the larger states and of the lower
48 are on a more condensed scale than the others.
</P>
<P>
   State maps cost $25, or $45 for a laminated version.
Information: (800) 237-0798 or www.ravenmaps.com.
</P>
<P>
   Raven maps are not, of course, for those who wish to find their
way on foot across the wilderness. For that, one's minimal needs
are a decent compass and topographic maps drawn to a suitable
scale. A topo map on a scale of 1:25,000, on which one inch equals
slightly more than 2,000 feet, is ideal, although maps with a scale
of about one inch to a mile are satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Costing only a few dollars each, topos also make good gifts, but
you have to know the precise area that the person _ hiker, hunter
or canoeist _ plans to visit. Such maps come in so-called
quadrangles and you might, for example, need to buy four of them to
embrace the area your friend intends to explore.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you get lucky. I have before me the Errol (New
Hampshire) quadrangle of the topographic map series put out by the
United States Geological Survey, and it so happens that its
northern half completely covers the area where I frequently go deer
hunting. It is on a scale of 1:62,500, approximately an inch to the
mile. The map measures 17 by 12 inches, and most of my hunting is
confined to a four-mile-square area. A deer hunter poking along in
the boondocks rarely covers more than a few miles each day; if he
does, he's moving too fast. He obviously will need fewer maps than
someone who plans hiking or canoeing explorations of a region.
</P>
<P>
   Topo maps can often be had from sporting goods shops or
bookstores. In general, however, such stores only carry maps of
their own state or adjoining ones. Maps of the United States east
of the Mississippi can be obtained by writing Branch of
Distribution, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads St.,
Arlington, Va. 22202, and requesting a map index for the state you
are interested in, or by ordering online at mapping.usgs.gov.
</P>
<P>
   If all this map searching seems too time-consuming, you could
make a gift of a Sierra Club paperback, ``Land Navigation
Handbook'' by W.S. Kals. It is a first-rate text on using map and
compass, and it lists many map sources. An equally good text is
``Be Expert With Map and Compass'' by Bjorn Kjellstrom (Scribners).
</P>
<P>
   Some maps can also lead one on a delightful journey to centuries
past. ``Mapping Boston'' (280 pages, MIT Press, illustrated, $50)
edited by Alex Krieger, David Cobb and Amy Turner, is a big,
handsome, brilliantly executed blend of old and new maps and
related essays on the social, political and physical history of
Boston as well as that of American cartography. Included are old
and rare maps from Norman B. Leventhal's unmatched collection.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising historical nuggets are constantly encountered in
``Mapping Boston,'' such as the information that large areas of the
city were built on land created by dredging muck from tidal flats
or salt marshes that once teemed with shellfish, ducks and rail
birds.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the book's publication, exhibits from Leventhal's map
collection run through Jan. 14 at the Boston Public Library and the
New England Aquarium. &QL;

MASHIA STARTS IN USC VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's search for a point guard took an interesting
turn Sunday, when senior Erica Mashia made her first start since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's a minor miracle she's playing at all. Mashia battled two
hip injuries and major knee surgery, and often during the previous
three years, her career was believed to be over.
</P>
<P>
   She's still not close to being the player who was a Pacific-10
All-Freshman team selection in 1996, but Mashia played 17 solid
minutes and scored four points in USC's 71-53 victory over Baylor
before 563 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erica wants to try it. It's her natural position,'' USC coach
Chris Gobrecht said. ``She pushes the ball hard. We're still
talking three years she hasn't played.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Mashia got the start is because Gobrecht has
rotated Ayeshia Smith, Lauren Smith-Hams and Camille Norwood at the
position. All three played against Baylor, but no one has claimed
the starting position, and it's likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you tell? You don't like my point guard by committee?''
Gobrecht joked. ``Even if Erica plays point guard, she doesn't have
a lot of minutes in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashia struggled at times, and had seven turnovers, but she's
doing much better than expected considering her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably 75-80 percent (recovered) but I still think I can
get a lot back,'' Mashia said. ``I played all right. In the first
half, I was tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (5-2), who are off to their best start in Gobrecht's
three years, used an 18-4 first-half run to take a 36-24 lead. They
outscored the Lady Bears 19-9 to start the second half and led
58-35 with 12:41 left.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (3-4) cut the lead to 13 points (61-48) with 3:36
remaining but got no closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a ways to go,'' Gobrecht said. ``When we all
work hard we're pretty good. Our problem is we don't have an
in-between. We were flat for six to eight minutes. What we can't do
like other teams can is mess around.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, USC was led by forward Danielle Golay, who had a
season-high 19 points. Forward Tashara Carter and guard Tiffany
Elmore each had a season-high 14 points while reserve forward
Carmen Krause had a career-high 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting better,'' Golay said. ``We're not the
7-20 team like last year. We're looking at getting rid of the lull.
It comes every game but we're starting to narrow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is about to hit a rough part of its schedule, with road
games at UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday, at Notre Dame on Dec. 27 and
Rutgers on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all big-time games for us,'' Golay said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Gobrecht said she is still waiting for 6-foot-4 freshman
center Portia Mitchell to pass a conditioning test before allowing
her to join the team. ``This team needs her,'' Gobrecht said. ``But
there are times she has to make running or else she can't be out at
practice.'' Gobrecht is not sure if she will consider redshirting
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   All three of USC's of fall signings _ Ebony Hoffman of Narbonne
High, Ryane Alexander of Copperas Cove, Texas, and Aisha Hollans of
Berkeley _ attended the game, because their high school teams are
playing in the Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara.

FEICK'S JUMP SHOOTING SURPRISES MUTOMBO AS NETS DOWN HAWKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the 50 or so games since Jamie Feick
first emerged as a legitimate NBA player, he has become known as a
brawler, a strong and physical hustler who tracks down missed shots
with ferocity. But Feick has never seen himself in such limited
terms.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind, he has always been a good leaper, a solid passer
and the owner of a dependable jump shot out to 18 feet. All but
Feick's New Jersey Nets teammates and coaches have been less than
receptive to his view of himself, smiling and remaining silent as
he relates his various gifts. After Sunday night, however, the
notion of Feick as a jump shooter might finally gain acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' 6-foot-8-inch center solved the league's most
intimidating interior defender, Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, by
drifting outside and draining jump shots from as far as 21 feet
away. Feick's shooting display, along with his team-high 13
rebounds, helped the Nets (8-17) defeat the Hawks, 96-88, before
11,990 fans at Continental Arena. The victory was the Nets' fifth
straight at home and their sixth in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a clearly tickled Feick, who hit seven jump shots in
scoring a season-high 16 points on 8-for-13 shooting, recited the
spiel he has been setting before reporters since he arrived in New
Jersey on a 10-day contract on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it; I just don't use it a whole lot,'' Feick said
with a smile, when asked about his outside touch. ``Today I just
felt like I was in a rhythm. Mutombo was sagging off of me, and I
just tried to bring him away from the basket to open things up. And
I had some open looks and just took the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Feick, who entered the game averaging 7.2 points on 41.8 percent
shooting, did nearly all of his damage during critical stretches.
After Atlanta (10-14) used a 19-3 run to turn a 12-point deficit
into a 51-47 lead in the second quarter, he followed a 3-pointer by
Johnny Newman with consecutive 19-footers to keep the Nets from
going into the locker room without momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He sparked another rally in the third quarter by scoring three
straight Nets baskets to close a 69-65 gap and tie the game at 73
heading into the fourth. Stephon Marbury, who made two free throws
during the Feick run, teamed with his center for a fascinating
play.
</P>
<P>
   While Feick was cutting to the right side of the basket, Marbury
hit him with a bullet pass from the left wing. With his momentum
pulling him upwards, Feick caught the ball and managed to avoid a
flying Chris Crawford while keeping his left foot on the ground.
Now on the other side of the basket, he put in a layup to start the
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be ugly,'' Feick said of his basket, ``because it
sure felt ugly. I don't know how I did it. Just lucky, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Feick gave the Nets a 77-75 lead with a 19-footer early in the
fourth and then got beside himself. Apparently feeling his oats, he
lofted a long jumper from the top of the key on the Nets' next
possession and hit nothing but air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got fouled on that one,'' Feick joked.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, he started the game-turning 14-5 run with a 16-footer
with 5 minutes, 43 seconds remaining that put the Nets ahead by
83-79. Kendall Gill added two jumpers. Kerry Kittles scored on a
fast-break layup. Keith Van Horn scored consecutive baskets on
splendid inside moves, and then Feick closed the spurt with another
19-footer with 19.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, who had 13 rebounds but just four points in a lethargic
offensive effort, was stunned by Feick's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he was capable of making shots from out there,''
Mutombo said. ``I take my hat off to him. I didn't want to chase
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been their style during their resurgence, the Nets'
offense was characterized by balance. Van Horn led with 20 points
and eight rebounds. Gill added 15 points, five assists and two
steals while Kittles scored 14. And Marbury, shooting 5 for 13, had
12 points and 11 assists.

MENTALLY ILL ARE SQUEEZED BY PARSIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looked at one way, the surgeon general's new report
is a comprehensive analysis of the sorry state of America's mental
health care. Looked at another way, it is a primer in two political
truisms: one, follow the money; two, beware every policy's
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the money trail: The report faults private insurance
companies for failing to cover mental illness as much as physical
ailments. But it fails to tell you that the federal government
itself is guilty of the same stinginess. Medicaid, the government's
insurance program for the poor, does not reimburse the states for
the cost of treating most patients who need long-term care in state
psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's federally sanctioned discrimination against the mentally
ill,'' says D.J. Jaffe, a board member of the Treatment Advocacy
Center, a public interest law firm for the mentally ill based in
Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the unintended consequences: When Medicaid began in
1965, excluding reimbursement for institutions for mental disease _
the state hospitals _ seemed to make sense. But the policy went its
own wrong way, with sad, sometimes tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The policy encouraged the cost-cutting discharge of patients
from state mental hospitals. As the surgeon general, Dr. David
Satcher, notes, the federal government thought it was wise to keep
responsibility for the mentally ill with the states, where it had
traditionally been. And it offered subsidies to encourage states to
move patients into smaller, more humane community residences.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of federal dollars and the earlier development of drugs
that can stabilize many mental patients stimulated the states to
aggressively empty the big hospitals. Medicaid did offer
reimbursement for care in smaller residences, defined as those
caring for 16 or fewer patients. The theory was perfect: move
patients out of inhumane warehouses and into the more caring
surroundings of group homes.
</P>
<P>
   The unforeseen troubles were numerous. Communities balked at
developing group homes. Those that were created generally reject
the sickest, most troubled and sometimes violent patients. And the
states generally refused to pass along to localities the money they
were saving by releasing patients from big institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Result: a drastic shortage of smaller residences. States have
pushed out huge numbers of patients from large hospitals.
Nationwide, 60,000 people live in state psychiatric hospitals
today, compared with 500,000 in 1965. In New York state, just under
5,000 patients live where 93,000 were cared for in 1953. If all
those released and those never admitted were now getting good,
sustained treatment, fine. But many live in the streets or move in
and out of jail. At any given time, for example, 3,000 of the
20,000 inmates in Rikers Island are judged to be mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in need of long-term care lack the supervision to
provide them with medication. The consequences can be tragic.
Andrew Goldstein, a man suffering from schizophrenia, was living
without care in a basement apartment in Queens, even though he knew
he was sick and had begged for hospitalization. As the world now
knows, he stopped taking his medication and wound up pushing Kendra
Webdale to her death in front of a subway train.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein kept asking to be returned to a group home on the
grounds of Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. But there was no room for
him, because New York never developed a viable system to care for
the severely mentally ill outside the big hospitals, which fell out
of favor in part because the federal money was no longer there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely to be available soon. Donna E. Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, said in an interview on
Friday that while President Clinton wants to renegotiate contracts
with federal workers to give them better mental health coverage,
she knows of no plan to revise Medicaid's reimbursement policy.
</P>
<P>
   So the responsibility remains with the states, which have done
such a bad job. Especially New York. Last month, in response to the
bad publicity created by the Goldstein case and specific criticism
of his budget cuts, Gov. George Pataki provided more money for care
of the mentally ill and called a halt to the permanent elimination
of beds in state mental hospitals. But the discharge of hospital
patients into the ``community'' continues.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Pataki initiative catch up with 34 years of misguided
policies? Will it take another tragedy to give the severely
mentally ill the help they _ and we _ need?
</P>
<P>
   To find the answer to that question, a suggestion: follow the
money.

N.Y. STATE WELFARE LAW SEPARATES TWO BOYS FROM THEIR MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Dec. 7, in the office of the Suffolk County
Department of Social Services in Coram, N.Y., two caseworkers and
four guards took Billy and Dillon Engesser, ages 8 and 4, into
foster care. Officially, their mother, Eve Engesser, who is
unemployed and homeless, became the first parent in the county to
lose custody of her children as a result of regulations that make
work and other welfare rules a condition of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say they are only following state regulations
aimed at pushing homeless families to self-sufficiency _
regulations that the Giuliani administration wants to enforce in
New York City. The rules call for children to be placed in foster
care if they are considered at imminent risk when their parents are
ejected from a homeless shelter for violating work requirements and
other rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ralph B. Wright, minister of the Yaphank Presbyterian
Church in Yaphank, N.Y., where the Engessers were parishioners
before they became homeless, called the result ``outrageous.'' He
said he had driven the family to the social services office in the
belief that he had brokered an alternative to foster care during
the four-month period when the boys' 22-year-old mother is barred
from shelter, a penalty imposed after she missed a workfare
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children were crying, the mother was crying, the
grandmother was going into hysterics,'' Wright recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Nowak, spokesman for Suffolk County's Department of
Social Services, declined to discuss details of case on the ground
of confidentiality. ``It's not for us to determine whether or not
the rules are appropriate,'' he said. ``If we were to do otherwise
it would be to go against state regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who participated in the Family Court hearing on the
matter, said county lawyers acknowledged there had been no child
abuse or neglect. And the minister said the judge, Jeffrey Arlen
Spinner, who is to determine Monday how Christmas visitation will
be handled, said the children would be returned the moment their
mother found a home. Yet, an Internet search has turned up nothing
for the $650 to $700 rent allowance set by the county.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had told the children they would be placed in temporary
housing with their grandparents, Edward Engesser, a disabled Air
Force veteran, and Barbara Engesser, a diabetic recovering from
surgery, who had emerged from the hospital into homelessness just
as their daughter and her two sons were being ejected from the
shelter. Instead, caseworkers abruptly revealed that they had
decided the grandparents were too disabled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is appealing recent orders by two
state court judges temporarily halting enforcement of the
regulations in the city, where a 1989 court ruling, upheld on
appeal, declared that children cannot be taken into foster care for
lack of housing, and that services and housing subsidies should be
used instead.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit based on that case is expected to be
filed shortly in Suffolk County, where the rules have been enforced
since 1996 and about six families are now expelled each month.
Families are warned that unless they have a plan for the children,
child protective services will be summoned. But until now, no
children had been removed because parents typically said they had
housing, and the county did not check. But recent media attention
highlighted families who were actually sleeping on floors or in
cars with their children.
</P>
<P>
   County officials maintain that ejection is only a last resort to
discipline those who refuse to work for their shelter, or who
disobey other rules despite ample help. But the case of Eve
Engesser, who was 13 when Billy was born and left school in 10th
grade, illustrates the more complicated picture of cumulative
missteps that can no longer be rectified, rather than a refusal to
work. She said she misunderstood a letter to appear at the county's
Department of Labor, believing she was already complying because
she attended the Employment Readiness Program in the same building.
The missed appointment led to ejection because she had two other
welfare sanctions before she became homeless.
</P>
<P>
   One, she said, resulted when she missed high school equivalency
classes because Billy was sick. Another dated from Dillon's
infancy, when she was summoned for a work assignment, only to be
sent home by a supervisor who told her she was exempt, she said,
then penalized for not going.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a world with legalisms that would make the Pharisees
look like saints,'' said Wright, who also works as a tax
accountant. ``They set these people up to fail, and then they
sanction them when they do fail. So they're punishing the children
for the failure of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy's father has not been in the picture for years. Also 13
when his son was born, he has yet to pay $400 a month in child
support recently ordered by a court. Dillon's father just lost an
effort to contest his paternity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boys were were placed in foster care on Dec. 7 _ at a
cost of $810 a month _ they have been allowed to see their mother
only once, for two hours, in a county office in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
Billy, a third grader, has not been in school since his removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `Mommy, how much time do we have left?' and
`Mommy, I don't want you to go,''' the boys' mother said through
tears after the visit. She wept again as she searched through the
plastic bags that now hold the family's belongings in an unheated
building behind the Yaphank church.
</P>
<P>
   The jumble of toys, clothing and memorabilia included Dillon's
first footprints, the valentines the children made her last year
and the Power Ranger figure that Dillon has carried to bed with him
since babyhood. Because their removal was unexpected, Wright said,
the boys went into foster care with only the clothes on their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   As the minister drove her through Yaphank, Ms. Engesser
wistfully pointed out the house where the whole family used to live
in a $703-a-month attic apartment. After the house was sold, she
said, they made a disastrous attempt to relocate to Florida. Unable
to find affordable housing on their return, she and the boys
entered the HELP-Suffolk shelter in Bellport, where 76 families
live in apartmentlike units. They were ejected on county orders on
Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's a tragedy that this family has been
separated,'' said Richard Motta, president of HELP-USA, the
nonprofit parent agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the ejection, Ms. Engesser's father spent his $863
veteran's check to house the family in a motel for four nights. Now
the grandparents have been placed by the county in another motel,
and could be kicked out for letting their daughter sleep there,
Wright said. But her mother needs her care, and she has nowhere
else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare that someone can come and take your own flesh
and blood,'' the grandmother cried. ``Why? Because we're poor.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: GIANTS LEARN THAT RAMS ARE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-GIANTS-RAMS) 
 (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Rams believed the Giants saw them this way:
</P>
<P>
   As puppies. Soft and cuddly. No experience at being a
frontrunner or a champion. A bunch that had not beaten a winning
team and therefore was living a dream. A team they could run on. A
team they could score on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respected the Giants before they came here; we didn't say
too much,'' said Rams linebacker Mike Jones. ``But here was all
this stuff last week coming from them about not being in awe of us
and how they could run the ball on us. We took this game very
personally. You could tell by all of the pushing and shoving out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And jawing and baiting. One Ram, Orlando Pace, fell for it _ he
was tossed for fighting a little more than seven minutes before
halftime of Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team, they talk a bunch of smack and it ain't pretty,''
said Rams cornerback Todd Lyght. ``They did a good job getting
Orlando out of the game. They knew with all of our guns they had no
chance of beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``Howard Cross was yelling at us before the game:
`West Coast offense! Soft offense!' All they did all day was bring
the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel, the Giants head coach, said no, he was sure his team
respected the Rams. He said studying films revealed to his players
that the Rams were physical.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all of the raw attitude surrounding Giants-Rams was simply
gamesmanship, Fassel said. And emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, especially for the Giants, there was too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agnew, a defensive tackle, used to play for the Giants. He
is a Ram now. ``The only thing the Giants said to me all day was,
`Hello, Ray,''' Agnew said, smiling. ``I know those guys. The
Giants have a lot of very confident players. Everything they say
they believe. When I was there we didn't think the teams from the
NFC West were as physical as the teams from the NFC East. I'm sure
the Giants thought that of the Rams. You can think anything you
want. The problem is when you have to go out and prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Ray.
</P>
<P>
   He's got something there, because that is exactly where it got
sticky for the Giants in their 31-10 loss to the Rams here at the
Trans World Dome. The Giants could prove nothing. They pushed and
got shoved.
</P>
<P>
   They did not gain a first down until a few plays into the second
quarter. In the game's first 15 minutes, the Rams smacked the
Giants and were by far the more physical team. In the first quarter
the Rams won in first downs, 8-0. In yards, 141-13. In plays, 30-6.
After a quarter, the Rams led by 3-0, but it seemed like 30-0. And
then three plays into the second quarter, it was 10-0 Rams.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Giants offense finally managed 10 points
_ but the Rams defense scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense outscored their offense for the game, 14-10, and
any time you do that, you can take great pride in that,'' Lyght
said. ``Obviously our offense is strong and we have the best
offense in the league. But our defense is special, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the league's No. 1-ranked defense against the run. The
Rams defense has now scored seven touchdowns, breaking its team
record of six set in 1978. It scored twice Sunday against the
Giants, with safety Devin Bush returning an interception 45 yards
for a score and Jones returning one 22 yards for another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants must have been concerned with how the Rams offense,
especially in this building, had jumped on teams early and
strangled them and made the game over before halftime. The Rams
entered this game having outscored teams by 113-46 in the first
quarter and by 136-71 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only a 10-0 halftime deficit for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   That score, however, was insurmountable for the Giants because
of the focus, determination, grit, power and physical play of the
Rams defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long day for them,'' said London Fletcher, the Rams
fierce linebacker, who kept providing bit hits and big plays en
route to a team-high eight tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``Our defense has played well all year. But you know
that everyone wants to see people score touchdowns. Our offense has
been the highlight of our team and that is good. As long as we keep
playing well as a defense, we know what can happen. There will be
days where our offense doesn't click like it usually does and the
defense will have to make the statement of the game. And that's
what we did today. And that statement is we are a very physical
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are a 12-2 team. The victory earned them homefield
advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. Any NFC team with plans of
reaching Super Bowl XXXIV next month in Atlanta will most likely
have to meet this team in St. Louis first. They are unbeaten (7-0)
in their dome this season, on a fast turf track with a fast, quick
offense. A physical one, too. But they are even more physical on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rams have finally beaten a team that entered with a
winning record. That was a missing link for them, something that
hung over their heads like a black cloud. They won with defense.
They have homefield advantage in the playoffs. Their confidence is
bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theme this week was we didn't know how good we are or how
good we can be,'' said Dick Vermeil, the Rams head coach. ``I think
we're a pretty good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants, and all of the league, must agree.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ An unexpectedly strong showing by pro-government
parties in Sunday's Russian parliamentary elections looked set to
give President Boris Yeltsin a more compliant legislature as he
heads into his last six months in office, and a firm launching pad
for his designated heir, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that the Communist Party, the bulwark of
the anti-Yeltsin opposition, could still emerge as Russia's largest
single party with about 25 percent of the vote, cast on the basis
of party lists which will fill half of the 450 seats in the Duma,
the lower house of parliament. The Communists are expected to pick
up more seats in the 225 single districts, where final results will
be known later this week.
</P>
<P>
   But according to preliminary returns, the surprise winners of
the election were two parties _ including one composed of Yeltsin's
once-scorned team of liberal economic reformers _ that emerged out
of the political wilderness in the last few months, boosted by
their backing of a popular war in Chechnya and supported by a
ferocious propaganda campaign waged by the Kremlin and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   As returns trickled in, moving from east to west across Russia's
11 time zones, political commentators were speculating that the new
pro-government coalition might actually gain a majority in the
Duma, which for the last six years has been dominated by the
Communist-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If electoral trends hold up as votes are counted in Russia's
populous western regions, Yeltsin for the first time in his
presidency might take command of the legislature and, in what
remains of his final term, push through badly needed economic
reforms, including an overhaul of an unwieldy tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Widely seen as a test run for next summer's presidential
elections, the parliamentary elections confirmed the growing
authority of Putin, a 47-year-old former security officer whose
popularity ratings have soared in the four months since he was
named prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's endorsement of Unity _ also known as Medved, or Bear _
was seen by political analysts as the key behind its sudden
breakthrough onto the national political scene. Unity, an electoral
bloc concocted by the Kremlin in the last two months of the
campaign, positioned itself as a rival to a center-left
anti-Kremlin alliance headed by former prime miniter Yevgeny
Primakov and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, Russia's capital and
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov easily won re-election, turning aside a challenge that
in recent weeks had looked capable of challenging his once daunting
popularity. Exit polls showed him winning with more than 70 percent
of the city's vote. In his last race for mayor, Luzhkov won with
more than 90 perent.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, both Luzhkov and Primakov were pummeled by a
steady stream of negative, sometimes vicious broadcasts on national
television channels controlled by the Kremlin and its allies. By
Sunday, their electoral alliance, Fatherland-All Russia, which six
months ago boasted of being the next party of power, had plummeted
to just 10 percent of the vote, according to an exit poll conducted
for the private television station NTV.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll showed Unity now being the new party of the
political establishment, and as such a probable magnet for
office-seekers and politically attuned business leaders. In the
poll, Unity far exceeded expectations with more than 20 percent of
the vote. Also surprising were the results for the Union of Right
Forces, a party made up of reformers whose campaign was
stage-managed by Anatoly Chubais, the often maligned author of
Russia's privatization program. The Right Forces party looked set
to top 10 percent in the national vote, a remarkable comeback for a
political group that had been written off by many experts a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Putin's influence seemed to play a role, after he
said last week he could agree with parts of the right-wing party's
economic platform. Leaders of the Right Forces, who publicly
supported Putin's tough conduct of the Chechnya war despite the
misgivings of some of their backers, have returned the compliment
by endorsing Putin for president.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of the consolidation of pro-government forces,
Putin paid a surprise visit Sunday night to the Right Forces
campaign headquarters. ``This is a very important victory for
everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (NEW MATERIAL BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The final composition of the new Russian parliament will not be
known until votes from the 225 single districts are counted.
National parties that fail to gain at least 5 percent of ballots
will not be allowed into parliament, and their votes will also be
redistributed among the victors.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary returns showed only six of the 26 competing parties
making that 5 percent threshold. Among the losers were Our Home is
Russia, headed by former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
created for the 1995 elections as the then ``party of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary returns showed the party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the maverick nationalist leader who has supported the Kremlin on
crucial votes, winning more than 7 percent of the vote, thus
guaranteeing its place in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the financier and media magnate who played a
key role in the dirty ``information wars,'' looked set to win a
parliamentary seat from the North Caucasus region of
Karachayevo-Cherkessia, according to early returns.
</P>
<P>
   (NEW MATERIAL ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen war _ loudly criticized in the West for its brutal
bombardments of civilians _ has galvanized Russian public opinion
and, according to most political experts, turned the national
debate away from a search for social stability toward an
endorsement for a strong state, headed by a strong leader.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in the national mood has been answered by Putin, a
former KGB officer who has given the Russian military a free hand
in its campaign against the Chechen guerrillas held responsible for
the lawlessness that had spread through Russia's southern regions
after the 1994-1996 Chechen war in which thousands of Russian
soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko, a liberal opposition party headed by Grigory Yavlinsky,
was the only party that called for a shift in tactics in the
Chechen war. That stance apparently cost Yabloko public support;
according to early election results, Yavlinsky's party seems
destined to remain on the political fringes, with an estimated 6 to
7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin's apparent triumph _ another in a string of
come-from-behind victories for Yeltsin and his allies _ has cast a
cloud on the political scene, as critics continued to decry the
rough and cynical methods used by the ruling circle to best their
centrist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kremlin turned its gun on the Fatherland-All Russia
electoral bloc, it all but ignored its historic opposition, the
Communist Party. The Communists showed that they still have a lock
on the anti-Yeltsin protest vote, particularly among elderly voters
who have suffered during the last 10 years of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their exceptionally dirty campaign, the authorities again
got a result which offers good advantages to the Communists,
something they hated to see,'' Luzhkov said after the vote.

   Yavlinksy, who has remained in opposition throughout the Yeltsin
era, was even more scathing in his criticism of the Kremlin's

MONSANTO AND PHARMACIA TO JOIN IN A DEAL VALUED AT $50 BILLION
</HEADLINE>

shareholder breakdown for both companies, name of new company

<P>
   The Monsanto Co., which makes one of the world's best-selling
drugs but has come under fire recently over genetically altered
crops, and the drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. agreed to merge
Sunday in a deal that would create one of the world's largest
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies, which have a combined market value of about
$50 billion, plan to combine their growing pharmaceutical
operations and leap into the upper echelon of drug companies early
next year with more than $8 billion in worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
   Their union is an attempt to keep pace in the rapidly
consolidating world of drug makers, where big research and
development budgets and worldwide sales and distribution networks
are common.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, however, will move quickly to separate the
agricultural division of Monsanto, executives said. The company has
come under criticism both in the United States and in Europe
because of its development of genetically modified crops, which
emit their own pesticides and immunize themselves against the use
of herbicides but also increase crop yields and hold out the
promise of creating more nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
   The new company plans to create an agricultural subsidiary and
then sell about 20 percent of the company to the public in an
initial public offering some time next year. The idea is to
separate the pharmaceutical and agricultural divisions, partly
because of shareholder complaints that the agricultural division
had been dragging down the stock price of Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   An outcry against the genetically modified crops began in Europe
earlier this year, and some of the concerns over safety have
reached American shores. A week ago, some of the nation's leading
antitrust lawyers filed a class-action suit against Monsanto,
contending the company rushed the products to market without
properly testing them. The suit also says that Monsanto, which is
now the world's second largest seed company, played a central role
in an international cartel that fixed the prices of corn and
soybean seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives dismissed the suit, which is backed by
environmental advocates, as a political stunt meant to heighten
consumer fears. The company insists that the products have been
scientifically proven to be safe and that regulators have approved
their introduction in the United States, where more than 70 million
acres of corn, soybeans and cotton have been planted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, executives at Monsanto and Pharmacia say, the division of
the company will allow shareholders to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do recognize that we have some public relations issues,''
said Fred Hassan, the chief executive at Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, which
is based in Peapack, N.J. ``But the underlying science and
technology is very sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is a stock swap structured as a merger of
equals, was approved by the boards of the two companies over the
weekend. It is a union of two companies that have forged very
different paths to creating products that seek to improve the
health and well-being of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, the former chemical maker that transformed itself into
a life sciences company a few years ago, has been flirting with a
sale or merger since late last year, after its agreement to merge
with the American Home Products Corp. collapsed. Since then,
Monsanto has seen strong growth in Searle, its pharmaceutical
division, which earlier this year introduced Celebrex, the
blockbuster arthritis drug.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn makes everything from Xalatan, the
best-selling glaucoma drug, to Rogaine, the hair-growth treatment.
The company also makes Kaopectate, the over-the-counter diarrhea
treatment, and Nicorette, a gum that reduces tobacco dependency.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are expected to have combined sales of about
$17 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the new company has not been selected, but it will
be based in Peapack. The agriculture company, which also makes the
best-selling herbicide Roundup, will continue to be based in
Monsanto's headquarters city, St. Louis, and will be led by Hendrik
Verfailles, now the chief operating officer at Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto shareholders, who will receive one share of the
combined company for each Monsanto share, will own 51 percent of
the new entity. Pharmacia shareholders will get 1.19 shares of the
new company for every Pharmacia share they own.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be headed by Hassan. Robert B. Shapiro, the
chief executive of Monsanto, will serve as chairman of the new
company, in a nonexecutive post, for 18 months and then will be
succeeded by Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to merge with American Home Products, Monsanto was
rumored to be in taks about merging with DuPont and also Novartis.
But in recent weeks, people close to the deal said Pharmacia
emerged as the most likely partner, largely because it agreed to
take on the agriculture unit. The two companies then created what
they call a novel solution, creating a subsidiary that would be 80
percent owned by Pharmacia.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro called the entire merger ``terrific.'' He said it
combined two fast-growing drug companies with a diverse range of
products, complementary sales and marketing forces in the United
States and Europe and a $2 billion research and development budget,
among the largest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to create a heck of a pharmaceutical business,''
Shapiro said. ``This answers a lot of questions for Searle. This
puts together two companies with complimentary geographic
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes after months of speculation about which company
Monsanto would tie the knot with and after a year of blockbuster
mergers and acquisition battles in the pharmaceutical world. Pfizer
Inc. and American Home Products are tangling over control of
Warner-Lambert. Earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst, two
giant drug makers, merged, and Astra combined with Zeneca, forming
the largest drug maker, with more than $10 billion in drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, were lukewarm about the possibility of a
merger on Friday, when speculation about a deal first surfaced.
Shares of Monsanto rose $1.375, to $41.75, and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn
dropped $2.75, to $50.25.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts said the deal did not make sense,
adding that Pharmacia could be hurt by the agricultural unit, which
has more than $6 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need agriculture,'' said Kenneth R. Nover, an
analyst at A.G. Edwards, who follows Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. ``I
wouldn't touch it for that alone. The ag chemicals business is too
much of a hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he was not concerned about the stock reaction on
Friday. Wall Street has not heard the details of the plan and so
did not have the necessary information to react positively, he
said. The company, for example, expects more than $600 million a
year in cost savings from the combination. And Nover at A.G.
Edwards said he had not heard the details but that a deal could
increase Pharmacia's presence in the United States.

U.S. MADE DEAL WITH CUBA TO END LOUISIANA HOSTAGE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS 10th graf with no response to request for comment from Cuban
officials.) 
 (rk) 
 By MARC LACEY with DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. officials ended a hostage standoff at a
Louisiana prison by striking a deal with the Cuban government that
will permit the seven Cuban inmates at the center of the uprising
to be deported to Havana, federal officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Cuban inmates, all deemed a threat to public safety by
the United States, had completed their prison sentences in this
country but were being held indefinitely because their deportation,
the usual procedure for felons who are not citizens, had been
blocked by the government of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba dropped its opposition in an agreement reached with the
State Department on Saturday, and late Saturday night the hostages
were set free and the inmates surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was highly unusual for two countries that do not
acknowledge each other diplomatically and cannot reach consensus on
far less sensitive matters. What it may portend for U.S.-Cuba
relations remains uncertain. The deal leaves unaddressed the status
of approximately 2,400 other Cubans who are in U.S. jails awaiting
deportation to Cuba, some of whom have resorted to violence in the
past to show their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a great deal of frustration among the Cubans
who are under detention without any sign of deportation,'' said
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``We view this case as distinct from the others. Here, the
inmates specifically asked to be returned to Cuba and the Cuban
government agreed to take them. That is not the case in the bulk of
the 2,400 others.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the decision to grant the
inmates' demands was appropriate in this case because it coincided
with U.S. interests. Attorney General Janet Reno was closely
involved in the decision, aides said, as were officials in the
White House and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``These inmates requested to be returned to Cuba,'' said Carole
Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, ``and if they had been
from anywhere else they would have been returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' she said, ``is we have a resolution here
that's in the best interests of the United States. We have a
situation that might have ended in a messy way that ended
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department contacted Cuban officials through the U. S.
interests section in Havana and worked out a deal in which Cuba
would accept the inmates, a State Department spokeswoman said.
``We're grateful that the situation has been resolved in a peaceful
manner,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials in New York and Washington did not
return calls seeking comment on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, the inmates were taken from the prison in buses
to an undisclosed site under the custody of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Officials said the exact timing of the
deportation remained unclear, although it would most likely take
place within a few days. Because there are no direct commercial
flights between the United States and Cuba, the usual means of
deportation, the inmates could be returned on a charter flight, a
military aircraft or a Coast Guard cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Louisiana said a chaplain, a Spanish-language
television producer and the mother of one of the hostage takers all
helped resolve the standoff. It was Mercedes Villar, the mother of
inmate Roberto Villar-Grana, who first disclosed a deal between the
United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Mrs. Villar told reporters, indicating that she
had seen a written agreement guaranteeing the inmates' safe passage
to Cuba. ``They're on the bus now and going to Cuba. They're going
to an airplane and going to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The rare moment of cooperation between the United States and
Cuba came as the two countries remained at odds on another
immigration case _ that of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old boy who was
rescued off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy survived the
attempted trip to the United States, in which his mother and
stepfather drowned. Cuba has condemned the United States for not
immediately returning the boy to his father in Cuba. After initial
hesitation, the INS has sent signals recently that it intends to
send the boy home. It was unclear whether there was any connection
between the Gonzalez case and the deportation agreement. A Justice
Department official said she knew of no connection.
</P>
<P>
   Demanding to be released or sent to another country, the inmates
last Monday took over the prison in St. Martinville, La.. Wielding
a knife and screwdriver, the prisoners held as hostages the warden,
Todd Louvierre; a deputy, Jolie Sonnier, and five female inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban prisoners arrived in the United States two decades ago
during the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which Castro sent thousands
of Cuban criminals to Miami. After committing crimes in this
country _ offenses ranging from drug possession to rape and murder
_ they served their sentences and then found themselves in a legal
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In all of their cases, an immigration judge had ordered them out
of the country, but the lack of a repatriation agreement between
the United States and Cuba made that impossible. Because they had
been deemed threats to society by an immigration judge, the INS
could not release them pending deportation, immigration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven Cubans who are expected to be deported.
Officials said five were in the prison at the time of the
surrender, and two others were believed to be the inmates who gave
up earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants facing deportation can seek to be sent to a country
different from their country of origin as long as that country
agrees to accept them. ``If any third country had agreed to take
them, we would have sent them,'' said Russ Bergeron, a spokesman
with the INS.

   The six-day ordeal ended shortly before midnight Saturday, when
a group of police officers and FBI swat team members began running
out of the prison, jumping up and down, cheering and throwing their
helmets and riot shields into the air. When reporters asked them
what was happening, they said the Cubans had given up.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the jail warden who had been shackled to a
chair and held at knifepoint since Monday was wheeled out on a
stretcher to an ambulance. Louvierre, who had grown a beard while a
hostage, was sitting up, shaking hands and smiling. He had a black
eye and a cheek welt which he received during the initial fight
with his captors, but did not appear to be seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides what you see on my face, they didn't do anything, and
that's really nothing,'' the warden told reporters at a news
conference Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The other remaining jail employee, Jolie Sonnier, came out next,
and was not sitting up on her stretcher. She and Louvierre were
both taken to a local hospital, and officials said neither had been
seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the hostage takers were led out of a side
door, unshackled, to a green and white motor coach bearing the
insignia of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts attributed the prison uprising to a flawed U.S.
policy toward Cuba, which has forced the immigration service to
keep as many as 2,400 Cuban inmates in prison well after their
sentences have expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd gone to the extreme of murder no one would have
supported these inmates,'' said Wayne Smith, who was the ranking
American diplomat in Havana under Presidents Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan and is a leading critic of the embargo against Cuba.
``But you really have to sympathize with them. What are they
supposed to do, just sit there? They obviously became desperate.
Luckily, this situation has been resolved without bloodshed.''

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The typical Jets fan will look at Sunday's
victory over the Dallas Cowboys with a mixture of exhilaration and
pain; pleased by the victory, haunted by what might have been and
what is likely to be. The Jets won for the fifth time in seven
games; barreled into Texas Stadium and handed the Cowboys their
first home defeat of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They came here Sunday, hoping against hope to keep their faint
hopes alive. Hoping that two of their three American Football
Conference rivals Seattle, Buffalo and Miami would lose.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Jets the playoffs are a pipe dream. A longshot at
best. What they had better be focusing on is the big, big picture
of who will own the franchise and the smaller picture of who will
coach the team. For the fans' purpose, the third and, in the long
run, most significant picture is who will play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with Ray Lucas. Lucas' progress from the summer, when
he was the Jets third-string quarterback and suffered through a
disastrous preseason game against Green Bay, to Sunday's effort in
Dallas has been stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what a lot of you were saying after the Green Bay
game,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said Sunday. ``He's come a long
way. I'm proud of him. He was less than perfect, but he was good
enough. This puts him over the top as a starter, and that's good
news.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Parcells got the word ``starter'' out of his
mouth, someone asked whether he meant ``starting,'' as in next
season. Parcells was incredulous: ``You guys had him out of here,
now you're giving him the job. Close your eyes, tell me what I'll
do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, everyone, from Lucas to Parcells to several teammates
had doubts and pangs of panic in the week following Vinny
Testaverde's season-ending injury. Parcells didn't see him Lucas as
the answer, or even as a solution. Lucas was the poor man's Kordell
Stewart, a secret weapon, a special-teams players, a spark to go in
at quarterback and give the team a jump start. No one saw him has
the battery.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, do they now?
</P>
<P>
   Before the Miami victory last week, Parcells said he still did
not have enough information about Lucas in all situations to know
if he could even be a backup. Earlier this week Parcells said that
if Lucas continued to improve, he would make him Testaverde's
backup. ``Wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' problem-next year will be the growing perception that he
is no better than a backup. He came into the season as the Jets
third-string quarterback. He started six games _ and would have
started more had he not been injured _ and led the Jets to
victories over Miami, Buffalo and New England. Regardless of what
Lucas says publicly, the idea of being happy to be in the National
Football League, only playing at quarterback, disappeared several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 quarterbacks starting for the first time, Lucas, has the
second-highest rating. He has thrown seven touchdowns in the last
three games with no interceptions. He has the lowest interception
percentage of any first-year starter in the NFL, and the least
experience, having spent three seasons as a jack-of-all-trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm a starter,'' Lucas said. ``The biggest change
form the summer to now is opportunity: the opportunity to play, the
opportunity make mistakes the opportunity to grow with the offense.
Everything is moving a lot slower for me now.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest burden on Lucas has been to make good decisions.
For the most part, he has succeeded. Sunday he fumbled a crucial
fourth-quarter snap on a crucial down. But in a game where Troy
Aikman was dismal, Lucas survived. Before the third-quarter
interception, Lucas had attempted 155 passes without an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is the incumbent. Lucas is starting material. Maybe
not in New York, maybe not with the Jets, but somewhere. He may
back up Testaverde next season, as well he should if Testaverde
reports to camp healed and healthy. But he will be a starter
playing a backup's role. Does the coach see Lucas that way?
</P>
<P>
   The Jets dilemma comes when the coaches ask what happens if
Testaverde goes down. He conceded a few weeks ago that what
troubles him was that his injury was an age injury. He is concerned
that the same injury could happen next season. He said he could
tear the other Achilles in the shower. The farther Testaverde gets
from his miracle year _ and that is considerable for a 37-year-old
quarterback who was forced to take a year off. Is Ray Lucas the
Jets guy? Or do the Jets go out and trade for a quarterback they
consider to be starting caliber?
</P>
<P>
   Those are questions for another time. For now the Jets are
reveling in the glow of a strong finish. They must sweep the last
two games to reach .500. Sunday the Jets bought the Giants a little
time and kept their withering dream alive.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas made a huge stride, too. But there are bigger
challenges to come. He will have to battle perception. That will be
tougher competition than anyone the Jets bring to camp. &QL;

`TRUE HISTORY AND REAL ADVENTURES': CHALFONT DELIGHTS, PLAY
DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kathleen Chalfant can do almost no wrong. If she
wasn't already a star after playing a Mormon mom, a rabbi and Ethel
Rosenberg in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Angels in America,'' she
became one last year, winning every Off Broadway acting award in
sight as the dying poetry professor in the Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Wit.'' Now her devotees will follow her to ``True History and
Real Adventures,'' which opened Sunday night at the Vineyard
Theater, and they are bound to be disappointed, not in Ms.
Chalfant, who delights every time she steps onstage, but in what
surrounds her.
</P>
<P>
   What could Sybille Pearson have been thinking when she wrote
this scattered, seemingly aimless play? A play with occasional
music, in fact, but the music, by Mel Marvin, seems simply
intrusive most of the time. It's a bad sign when the interviews the
playwright and the director give about a work are more moving than
the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``True History and Real Adventures'' (a deadly title, although a
meaningful one, once you've analyzed the themes) begins in 1893. On
the surface it is about a young Scottish woman who sees a play
about Calamity Jane, becomes obsessed with her and eventually meets
her, after traveling America with a band of equally young,
ambitious, slightly dishonest fellow immigrants with plans and
problems of their own.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Pearson means this to comment on, she says, is the
theater's ability to tell truth through lies. Michael Mayer, the
director (whose recent noteworthy work has included ``Side Man''
and ``A View From the Bridge''), says the play's lesson is the need
to claim ownership of your own history. Calamity, of course, may
not have done everything she was said to do, and her young fan ends
up becoming a celebrity herself, complete with legendary incidents
that never happened and a fringed western pantsuit that would have
looked at home on the Grand Ole Opry in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearson also means to point out the similarities between the
1890s and the 1990s and finds a couple of amusing examples. At one
point, a character explains President William McKinley's
trickle-down theory of economics. And out West, the young
immigrants go into business selling a miracle tonic (mostly
cocaine), which they promote as the 19th-century equivalent of
Viagra. The townsfolk fall all over one another to buy it. The
sales team, it is presumed, leaves town before the customers learn
about cocaine's long-term effects on virility.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the play is trying to say too many things without a
unifying insight. Several times, prejudice against the two major
black characters is powerfully demonstrated and forcefully
discussed. (A black man is shot dead for dancing with a white
woman, although she was the one who initiated the dance; a black
woman learns about the promise of the AME Zion Church.) Trouble is,
the racial theme is quickly abandoned each time, having thrown the
play off balance and left passions unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Goethals, whose career as a child actress brought her
such varied credits as the Roundabout Theater's ``Four Baboons
Adoring the Sun'' and a television sitcom about an adolescent
tennis pro (``Phenom''), is lovely as the central character,
Margaret Mackenzie. Margaret changes her name to Pearl Hart, but
unfortunately for Ms. Goethals, the character is missing a soul.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant, who is billed as Calamity Jane, isn't seen as that
character until near the end of the play, but she does wonderful
things with a series of other characters, most of which she plays
for one scene only. She even manages to put on a mustache, a top
hat and a German accent and play the cakewalk-dancing Count of
Glumbowitz with gender-irrelevant charm and believability. The rest
of the cast members, many of them so young they are literally
members of the class of '99, show lots of promise but have good
moments and bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the end they're all lost in a story with a message that the
script isn't articulate enough or focused enough to convey. When
young Margaret sees the play about Calamity's exploits, she goes
backstage, hoping to meet her new heroine. But Margaret's naivete
comes across as just that, the case of a girl who buys a theater
ticket but doesn't understand the concept of acting and
make-believe, not as a metaphor for the blurring of fiction and
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ms. Pearson seems to intend the entire play as a sort
of warning against a collective American egotism, going into a new
century overconfidently. That may have been the mind-set in 1899,
but a hundred years later instant Internet millionaires are just
about the only Americans in that mood. Most of the rest of us can't
seem to look ahead much farther than Jan. 1, when we'll learn
whether our computers still work. ``True History and Real
Adventures'' continues through Jan. 2.

`STUART LITTLE' TAKES CHEESE AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Stuart Little'' scored at the nation's
multiplexes as the family-oriented comedy led a moderate weekend
with an estimated $15.4 million at 2,878 theaters during the
Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening weekend of ``Stuart,'' based on the classic
children's book about a talking mouse who finds a home with a human
family, performed above expectations in the difficult-to-predict
market for children and their parents. Its near-term prospects
appear strong, given that schools will be out for the next two
weeks over Christmas and New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend should put us on the road to $100 million,'' said
studio spokesman Ed Russell. ``We are drawing lots of families of
all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell noted that grosses for ``Stuart'' jumped from $3.7
million Friday to $6.4 million on Saturday, indicating strong
word-of-mouth among the target audience.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
credited Sony with a solid marketing campaign. ``The awareness of
`Stuart Little' skyrocketed during the past week,'' he noted.
``It's in a good position to do very well on the next two
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said ``Stuart Little''
represents a strong rebound for Sony following a year that saw
success only from ``Big Daddy'' and ``Blue Streak.'' ``Sony has to
be very happy about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony spent a reported $90 million on ``Stuart Little,'' with a
significant chunk used to create a computer-generated mouse with
life-like expressions and movements.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' second weekend of ``The Green Mile'' held up well
in second with $12.6 million at 2,875 theaters as the prison drama
dropped only 30 percent from its opening. It edged Disney's fifth
weekend of mega-hit ``Toy Story 2'' with $12.1 million at 3,228
theaters. It fell just 32 percent form the previous weekend to move
its total past $153 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' has eclipsed ``The Sting'' for 61st place on the
all-time domestic gross list and has an excellent chance of
becoming the 29th film to top $200million.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Disney films were battling for fourth _ the second
weekend of ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' with $8.3 million at
2,162 theaters and the opening of ``Bicentennial Man,'' a
comedy-fantasy starring Robin Williams as a robot who assumes human
form, with $8.29 million at 2,518 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The return for ``Bicentennial Man'' came in below expectations,
given Williams' track record in hit comedies such as ``Mrs.
Doubtfire'' and ``Patch Adams.'' ``This one just did not have the
vibe of a very successful film,'' Rockwell said. ``People want to
see Robin Williams in the same kind of vehicle as his other hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, 20th Century Fox's
drama-romance ``Anna and the King,'' generated disappointing
results in sixth with $5.1 million at 2,134 theaters despite mostly
favorable reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The project, starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat, recreates
school teacher Anna Leonowens' story of teaching the 58 children of
the king of Siam, but lacks the music and dancing of the 1956 hit
``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said that ``Anna'' could still generate respectable
business in Middle America markets due to strong moviegoer response
and the probability of multiple Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family films can do excellent business at this time of year,''
he added, noting that 1997's ``Mouse Hunt'' took in only $6.1 on
its opening weekend but eventually topped $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   November holdovers took the last four slots of the top 10, led
by MGM's fifth weekend of ``The World Is Not Enough'' with $4
million at 2,625 theaters to push its 31-day total past $105
million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``Sleepy Hollow'' followed in
eighth with $3 million at 2,564 sites to hit nearly $86 million and
edge Universal's fourth weekend of ``End of Days'' with $2.9
million at 2,460 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's seventh weekend of ``Bone Collector'' finished a
distant 10th with $1 million at 1,115 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's opening of critical favorite ``Magnolia,'' an
ensemble drama starring Tom Cruise and based in the San Fernando
Valley, drew exceptionally well with $180,000 at seven theaters.
USA Films' debut of ``Topsy Turvy,'' which recently was named best
1999 film by the New York film critics, also generated strong
business with $29,000 at two screens, as did Miramax's expanded run
of ``The Cider House Rules'' with $350,000 at 37 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled about $80 million, up 4 percent from
the same period last year, as 1999's box office remained on track
to set a new record at $7.5 billion, up 8 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans starting vacations this week, studios will try to
take advantage by opening four high-profile entries. Warners's
football drama ``Any Given Sunday,'' with Al Pacino, and
Universal's comedy ``Man On the Moon,'' with Jim Carrey as Andy
Kaufman, will both roll out Wednesday; DreamWorks' comedy ``Galaxy
Quest'' and Paramount's drama ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' will both
open on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Final totals for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.

PINCAY-VALENZUELA RACE IS DOWN TO THE WIRE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay and Pat Valenzuela are going
down to the final day in their race for the Hollywood Park jockey
championship. No matter who wins it'll be an unlikely achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, leads Valenzuela, back since September from a nearly
two-year suspension, by 30 victories to 28 after both went winless
Sunday. Pincay is scheduled to ride seven horses today; Valenzuela
is named on eight horses, including a morning-line favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay hasn't won a riding title since the 1991 Hollywood Park
spring-summer meet. He'd be the oldest man to win a Southern
California jockey title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the icing on the cake,'' said Pincay, who broke
Bill Shoemaker's career-wins record with No. 8,834 on Dec. 10 and
is up to 8,842 now.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, whose career is dotted with drug-related
suspensions, said he's thrilled with his Hollywood Park performance
even if he doesn't win the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'd have thought, two months after I started riding again,
that I'd be in this position?'' he said. ``It's an accomplishment
to be right behind (Pincay). Laffit's always been an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Nakatani rode two winners Sunday and, with 26 at the meet
and four scheduled mounts on the 12:30 p.m. final card, has a
mathematical chance to tie for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside wins: Surfside, getting the kind of trip that jockey
Pat Day would have liked in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, won
the $380,250 Hollywood Starlet by seven lengths over longshot She's
Classy and three other 2-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Seattle Slew and Flanders had finished third
behind D. Wayne Lukas stablemate Cash Run in the Breeders' Cup race
Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park after an indifferent start left her
racing wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad, because I really think she's the best filly in
the country,'' Lukas said after winning his seventh Starlet.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas indicated he'd like to try Surfside against males in the
Triple Crown preps. Her 1:43.51 clocking for 1 1/16 miles was about
a length and a half slower than Hollywood Futurity winner Captain
Steve's 1:43.27 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a big, long-striding filly, and if you want to take on
boys, she's the kind you'd do it with,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   The Overbrook Farms filly is 4 for 6. She has won two Grade I
races, the first the Frizette at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bob Baffert has clinched the training title. He holds a
14-11 lead over Richard Mandella, who didn't enter a horse on the
closing-day card.... The Daily News' Bob Ike leads Jack Karlik by
three winners in the newspaper handicappers' contest.

EDITORIAL: A FOCUSED ROLE FOR THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers proposed last week that the
International Monetary Fund begin to move away from making
long-term loans to developing countries and focus instead on one
key mission: lending to countries in temporary financial crisis.
That sensible proposal will attract bipartisan support in a
Congress that has grown increasingly hostile to the fund's
perceived failures in Russia, Brazil and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Summers knows that a congressionally appointed
commission will soon propose trimming fund missions along the lines
he suggests. The commission, led by Prof. Allan Meltzer of Carnegie
Mellon University, has tentatively decided to recommend eliminating
the fund's programs to promote development in poor countries _ a
responsibility it thinks should be solely the World Bank's. The
commission would also eliminate fund programs that promote the
transition of the former Soviet Union to markets. Summers' speech
not only pre-empts the commission's recommendations, but also helps
insulate Vice President Al Gore from Republican criticism of the
fund's failed bailout of Russia, which was undertaken with the
Clinton administration's vigorous support.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries wind up borrowing from the fund for 30 or 40
years with no decisive results. Many of these countries, Summers
points out, could tap private capital markets instead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Summers' speech did not go nearly as far as critics of the
fund would have liked. He suggested that the fund continue to lend
to the poorest countries to combat poverty, thus watering down his
call for narrowing its mission. He embraced the tools by which the
fund currently lends money during crises whereas Meltzer says his
commission will propose major improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Summers disappointed some critics by issuing only a half-hearted
call for the fund to lend to distressed countries even when they
owe money to foreign banks. Many economists object to the fund's
current practice of requiring that banks be paid in full before the
fund steps in _ guaranteeing that the banks walk away unscathed
while workers suffer the full brunt of economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the Soviet Union, the fund was the only
international financial institution willing and able to help the
former Communist countries move to markets, but its ability to sway
the destiny of these economies is quickly receding. The World Bank
is better positioned to fight poverty in poor countries that cannot
attract private capital. That leaves emergency lending as the one
mission the fund is best equipped to handle. Summers does not go
that far. But he has at least put the United States in position to
start shoving the fund in that direction.

SUGAR RAY ROBINSON RANKS AS A PERFECT NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He had no flaws.
</P>
<P>
   He could punch with both hands and he could take a punch. He
could box and he could bang. He could think and he had all the
right instincts.
</P>
<P>
   And he had the opportunity to use his divine skills.
</P>
<P>
   He had 202 professional bouts, winning 175, and fought a list of
opponents that reads like a Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He was undefeated in welterweight bouts, holding the world title
from 1946 to 1950, was a five-time middleweight champion and was
competitive until the day he retired at 44 in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He was Sugar Ray Robinson, the greatest fighter of the century.
</P>
<P>
   This list of the 10 greatest fighters pound-for-pound of
all-time is based on ability and accomplishments, which includes
quality of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   1. Sugar Ray Robinson (175-19-6, 109 KOs) 1940-65. Ten years
into his career, mostly as a welterweight, he was 128-1-2. Of his
19 losses, 14 occurred after he turned 36 and 10 came after 40,
when he was fighting because he needed money.
</P>
<P>
   No fighter in history dominated his division as Robinson
dominated the welterweight class and he was almost as good as a
middleweight. He also was beating light heavyweight champ Joey
Maxim when he collapsed because of heat.
</P>
<P>
   He beat some of the greats _ Jake La Motta, Henry Armstrong, Kid
Gavilan, Randy Turpin, Rocky Graziano, Carmen Basilio and Gene
Fullmer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Henry Armstrong (150-21-9, 101 KOs) 1933-45. He personified
the destructive power of perpetual motion. He might've thrown more
punches _ and inflicted more pain _ than any other fighter in
history.
</P>
<P>
   He will be remembered for perhaps boxing's greatest
accomplishment: He held the welterweight, lightweight and
featherweight titles simultaneously and almost made it four belts,
drawing with Ceferino Garcia in a middleweight title bout.
</P>
<P>
   3. Muhammad Ali (56-5, 37 KOs) 1960-81. No one had the presence
of Ali and few could fight as well.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, he could move more fluidly and had more speed than
any heavyweight in history. That, combined with a great chin and
immeasurable guile, made him all but unbeatable when he was at his
best.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the good fortune of fighting in the greatest era for
heavyweights. Among those he beat: Sonny Liston, Floyd Patterson,
Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Ken Norton and Jerry Quarry.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is that the 3{ years he was away because he
refused induction into the armed services might've been his best.
</P>
<P>
   4: Joe Louis (68-3, 54 KOs) 1934-51. He's ranked below Ali only
because of quality of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The beloved ``Brown Bomber'' might not have had the foot speed
Ali had, but his hands were very quick and he had impeccable boxing
skills and crushing power. He also had a frightening killer
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his heavyweight championship a record 25 times over
an unfathomable 13 years (including a three-year hiatus during the
war). No one, not even Ali, dominated the division as Louis did.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, beat many fine fighters _ Max Schmeling, Jack Sharkey,
Max Bear and Jersey Joe Walcott, among them.
</P>
<P>
   5. Harry Greb (115-8-3, 51 KOs, 179 no-decisions) 1913-26. Greb,
the least known on this list, is regarded by historians as a
monster.
</P>
<P>
   He was called the ``Pittsburgh Windmill'' because of his style,
in which innumerable punches came from all angles and wreaked havoc
on helpless opponents. He also didn't care much for rules: He did
anything and everything he could get away with.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest victory was over future heavyweight champ Gene
Tunney in an American light heavyweight title bout, the only loss
of Tunney's career, and was world middleweight champ for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Greb had a secret that was revealed only after his untimely
death at 32 and was proof of his greatness: He was blind in one eye
the last five years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   6. Benny Leonard (85-5-5, 69 KOs, 119 NDs) 1911-32. He might've
been the greatest boxer in history !ital!and had good power.
</P>
<P>
   He lost three times before he turned 17 and only twice more,
once on a disqualification and once at 36 in his last fight,
against the great Jimmy McLarnin.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he fought the best lightweights of his day and
invariably ended up on top. This was true even in the no-decision
era, during which law prohibited decisions but winners were in
effect declared by newspaper accounts the following day.
</P>
<P>
   He was lightweight champ from 1917 to 1923. He later came out of
a seven-year retirement because of financial difficulties and
compiled a record of 18-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   7. Jack Dempsey (61-6-8, 50 KOs) 1914-27. He was Babe Ruth of
boxing at the time the Bambino ruled baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't beat his opponents, he mauled them. Of his 50
knockouts, 36 came in three rounds or less, a testament to his
unusual tenacity and power.
</P>
<P>
   His cruel beating of the much-bigger Jess Willard to win the
heavyweight title he would hold for seven years was one of the most
brutal in boxing history.
</P>
<P>
   It took a slick boxer like Tunney to take him down.
</P>
<P>
   8. Willie Pep (230-11-1, 65 KOs) 1940-66. Like Leonard, the
two-time featherweight champ was a boxing marvel.
</P>
<P>
   He was blazing quick and virtually impossible to hit. He once
won a round without throwing a punch, as the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   He was 134-1-1 before his first of three losses to the
rough-and-tumble Sandy Saddler.
</P>
<P>
   9. Roberto Duran (102-14, 69 KOs) 1967-98. We remember him first
as a welterweight, then as a middleweight and finally as a fighter
who hung on too long.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was at his greatest as a lightweight. With unnerving
viciousness and fine-tuned skills, he owned the 135-pound division
from 1972 to 1978. He lost only a decision to Esteban DeJesus
during that period and later avenged the loss.
</P>
<P>
   He was 73-1 at one point and suffered six of his losses after he
turned 38.
</P>
<P>
   His most publicized victory was his ``no mas'' loss to Sugar Ray
Leonard, but he had beaten Leonard by decision in their previous
bout.
</P>
<P>
   10. Archie Moore (194-26-10, 141 KOs) 1936-63. He had more
knockouts than all but a handful of boxers had fights during his
remarkable 28-year career.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get his first championship bout until he was 39,
beating Joey Maxim for the light heavyweight title in 1952. His
last defense was at 48 in 1961, at which time he began
concentrating on the heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   He lost to Rocky Marciano and Patterson in two attempts to win
the heavyweight crown.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10: 11. Jack Johnson. Nat Fleischer, the editor of The
Ring magazine who saw every great fighter of the first half
century, said Johnson was the greatest heavyweight; 12. Billy Conn.
The great light heavyweight champ almost beat Louis in his prime;
13. Jimmy Wilde. The greatest British fighter dominated the
flyweight division early in the century; 14. Gene Tunney. The
before-his-time boxer beat Dempsey twice and Greb twice; 15. Sam
Langford. He never received a title shot because he was black but
won consistently between the lightweight and heavyweight divisions
early in the century; 16. Ezzard Charles. He's remembered as
heavyweight champion but was a dominating light heavyweight; 17.
Marvin Hagler. He was the best middleweight since Robinson. 18.
Aaron Pryor. The once-beaten junior welterweight could've been in
the top 10 if if weren't for drug abuse; 19. Stanley Ketchel. The
big punching middleweight champ once knocked down Jack Johnson. 20.
Sugar Ray Leonard. He captured the public's imagination and beat
the best of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Among others: Readers had many worthy suggestions for the top 10
who aren't listed here. Among them: Ike Williams, Manuel Ortiz,
Julio Cesar Chavez, Roy Jones Jr., Carlos Monzon and Kid Gavilan.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The successful debuts of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and
World Wrestling Federation Entertainment _ enterprises that went
public side by side on Oct. 19 this year _ provide indisputable
evidence that the stock market has entered a thrilling new era
where the old rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago on that same date stocks were tanking, but now
they are flourishing and everybody wants a piece of the action.
Because of this, the early years of the new millennium are sure to
bring us initial public offerings far more exotic than any we have
witnessed to date.
</P>
<P>
   One reason traditional yardsticks are useless in measuring the
prospects of companies like Martha Stewart and the WWF is that each
is in the Zeitgeist industry, an enigmatic and very possibly
nonexistent segment of the economy where profits are directly
pegged not to specific products but to a particular consumer vibe.
The Zeitgeist industry may well be the fastest-growing segment of
the world economy, a sector that will one day overtake automobiles,
drugs and even high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since the industry celebrates a public fascination, it is hardly
a coincidence that both Martha Stewart and the wrestling federation
are rooted in television, the ultimate arbiter of public taste. So
investors should not be surprised when Rosie O'Donnell, mistress of
the morning airwaves, goes public with Rosie O'Donnell Living.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Martha Stewart has tapped into the obsessive quest for
perfection of the upwardly mobile, Ms. O'Donnell has tapped into
the frantic search for adequacy of so many Americans. An adequate
stand-up comic herself who has evolved into an adequate actress and
a more-than-adequate talk-show host, Ms. O'Donnell is a goddess to
her legions of fans. By going public with a company that will
market comfort foods, comfortable clothing, functional appliances
and a cozy magazine, Ms. O'Donnell should be able to raise
billions.
</P>
<P>
   So should (AT).com. The power of this icon cannot be
underestimated. The ``(AT)'' symbol is perhaps the most vital
graphic linchpin of the Internet for without it e-mail messages
could not be delivered. Were it mutilated, destroyed, rendered
inoperative or even briefly held for ransom, electronic roadkill
would litter the Information Highway. Knowing this, the
entrepreneurs who take (AT).com public will be able to use the vast
proceeds of their market entry to infiltrate the communications
system even more by successfully introducing and copyrighting
symbol-words like h(AT), c(AT), r(AT)-a-t(AT)-t(AT) and
(AT)mosphere, employing the slogan: ``Saving keystrokes each day
keeps the ergonomist away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the IPOs of the infant millennium, of course, will be
rigorously pegged to the amorphous Zeitgeist _ anymore than were
this year's roaring successes: Goldman Sachs Group, Delphi
Automotive and United Parcel Service. Big offerings like these,
along with the ubiquitous dot-coms _ and the biggest success of
all, the Internet-related VA Linux Systems _ propelled the IPO
market to big bucks, a record volume of $69 billion through
mid-December. That's already above the 1996 record of $50 billion,
according to Thomson/ Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Some new offerings will simply capitalize on any opportunity to
attract an ambitious, credulous investing public, whose appetite
for IPO's this decade grew more than fourfold, to $340 billion from
$75 billion in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Eager investors can be expected, for instance, to snap up Planet
United Nations. The U.N. sits on some very valuable Midtown
Manhattan real estate and could be a great place to promote a
restaurant with the cachet of a sophisticated international
clientele. The money it raises would once and for all end the
squabbles over nations that have not paid their dues.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of squabbling nations, with emerging markets once again
beating Wall Street, it might behoove the world to brace for an
unorthodox IPO or two, like Mujahedeen.com. Traditionally, third
world rebels have financed their operations by obtaining covert
funds from abroad _ an approach that prevents the insurgency-minded
public from directly participating in third world upheaval. In
taking Mujahedeen.com public, Afghan guerrillas will generate
profits by charging subscribers a monthly rate to watch live
Internet footage of clashes in the foothills of Pakistan and allow
subscribers to proffer hints on strategy to mujahedeen leaders in
interactive chat rooms every evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahedeen.com will also offer $65,000 adventure-travel packages
to baby boomers who, having found the climb up Mount Everest too
old hat, will get their kicks by locking swords in the Hindu Kush.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of old hat, old is really new in some quarters _ granny
glasses are in vogue, and today's close-cropped men could have
stepped out of a Jack Webb movie. Recognizing the trend, Irony
``R'' Us will make a bundle by reintroducing Disco Era
bell-bottoms, Nehru jackets, Clark Kent eyeglasses, Day-Glo
platform shoes and Louise Brooks hairstyles at the strategic
moment. With the funds raised from the IPO of Irony ``R'' Us, the
founders will be able to blanket the nation with a chain of
Saturday night restaurants called Trattoria Travolta and a line of
Village People casual wear.
</P>
<P>
   As the financial services industry restructures itself, unusual
marketing channels will become increasingly popular. That is where
the Girl Scouts come in. They are a marketer's dream: Trustworthy,
with outstanding brand recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Girl Scouts have raised money for good causes by
selling cookies door to door. In the future, they will earn merit
badges for selling annuities, life insurance, emerging-market
mutual funds and high-yield bonds door to door.
</P>
<P>
   By going public, the Girl Scouts will not only raise enough
money to train young women in the art of financial planning but
will also have enough cash left over to get some new uniforms. With
their newfound capitalist prowess, after all, the girls will want
boardroom apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of boardrooms, AMEX.com promises to become a real
highflier sometime in the next thousand years. Though it may come
as a surprise to many, the American Stock Exchange still exists,
and, like a bear emerging from hibernation, it may one day become a
force to be reckoned with. Like many IPOs, it will lure investors
with the promise of great profits _ the average IPO this year rose
50 percent on opening day, while the average Internet IPO doubled _
and then use the cash raised by going public to attract exciting
young companies, build an opulent new headquarters, hire an
attention-getting chairman and explain to the public, with the help
of a catchy new slogan, what function it serves.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan? ``At AMEX, We Make Money the Old-Fashioned Way. We
Go Public.''

BAILEY FILLS UCLA VOID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the week began, guard Ryan Bailey appeared to
have as much chance of sparking UCLA's struggling offense as wet
paper. His injury-plagued early-season performances were spotty,
and he didn't play against Gonzaga because of tendinitis in his
foot.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey had other ideas. Missing the Gonzaga game had given
his painful foot a chance to heal. All he needed were a few good
practices, and he'd hop off the bench to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the exhibition season, my timing was so off it was
ridiculous,'' Bailey said. ``I hadn't played for a month. I wasn't
shooting well. I wasn't in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest did wonders for Bailey's foot, although he felt
helpless during the Gonzaga debacle. He practiced long and hard
last week, and sure enough, he rescued the Bruins against DePaul _
charging off the bench for seven rebounds, five assists and three
steals in 26 minutes. He ran UCLA's fast break and half-court
offense the way they're designed, enabling Earl Watson to slide to
wing guard, his natural position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot well, but I did a lot of other things,'' Bailey
said after the spirited 76-58 victory. ``Pushing the ball upcourt
is one aspect I bring to the team. That's my true position.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Baron Davis, Bailey is UCLA's only pure point guard.
Watson plays the position, but he looks to score more than
distribute, and he often makes poor decisions. Freshman Jason
Kapono is a deft ballhandler, but he's more effective as the vortex
than the initiator.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Bailey stays healthy, makes passing his priority and
plays sound defense _ it's his biggest weakness _ there will be
plenty of minutes available.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end: The Bruins spent most of the game in a matchup
zone designed to keep their big men out of foul trouble and contain
DePaul All-American Quentin Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   It worked on both counts. Dan Gadzuric played 35 minutes and
Jerome Moiso 30 in the best combined effort of their careers: 32
points, 20 rebounds and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the big men healthy, out of foul trouble and on
the practice floor, we can be a pretty good team,'' coach Steve
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, probably the best player UCLA will face this season,
scored a game-high 22 points, but he needed 23 shots. Afterward, he
credited UCLA's zone for his shooting woes (8 of 23) _ a zone the
Bruins probably will use against the elite teams on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matchup zone I think gave (Richardson) a different look,''
Lavin said. ``We don't have a lot of foot speed, but we're long. We
get those branches out.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Reserve forward Sean Farnham, recovering from a
sprained knee, was available Saturday but didn't play (coach's
decision).
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Ray Young _ supposedly two of UCLA's best perimeter
shooters _ are 3 of 21 from 3-point range in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA flew to Hawaii on Sunday and will hold a two-hour practice
this afternoon in preparation for Tuesday's game (3 p.m.) against
Maine.

EDITORIAL: HAWAII'S WDHED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year legal battle that ignited national debate over
opening the institution of marriage to same-sex couples has ended
quietly in Hawaii. With a four-page order, the state's top court
dismissed the path-breaking lawsuit on the grounds that it had been
rendered moot by a 1998 amendment to the state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier court decisions had found that the state's longstanding
ban on same-sex marriages amounted to unjustifiable sex
discrimination under the state constitution. But the new decision
held that the 1998 amendment, which was passed by the State
Legislature and ratified by voters, ``validated'' Hawaii's
discriminatory marriage license rules by ``taking the statute out
of the ambit of the equal protection clause of the Hawaii
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the court did not elaborate on its reasoning. The
amendment's wording merely gave the Legislature the power to pass a
law banning same-sex marriages _ a power the Legislature never
exercised after the amendment's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii case triggered an ugly backlash that led Congress and
some 30 states to pass measures to avoid honoring gay marriages in
the event Hawaii courts permitted them. Even so, the case has had a
positive cultural impact. For many fair-minded Americans, the idea
of allowing same-sex unions no longer seems as threatening as it
once did. The case highlighted the unfairness of denying same-sex
couples the benefits that flow from civil marriages, and it
challenged unfounded fears about the harm to traditional marriage
if gay people had the freedom to wed.
</P>
<P>
   Important civil rights battles are rarely won in the first
round. Another case seeking recognition of gay marriages is working
its way through the courts in Vermont. Someday same-sex couples and
their families will achieve the legal recognition and acceptance
they deserve. The Hawaii challenge failed to produce that
breakthrough. But such a breakthrough now seems inevitable.

PREMIER GAINS IN HIS BID TO SUCCEED YELTSIN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Communists were on target to get the most votes,
but Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his war effort in
Chechnya appeared to be the big winners Sunday as Russia elected a
new lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Riding on Putin's message of national pride and strong
leadership for Russia, parties allied with the former KGB agent did
better than expected in the vote for the State Duma, taking 36
percent of the vote versus 28 percent for the Communists, according
to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's hopes of succeeding President Boris N. Yeltsin also got
an important boost six months before next year's presidential
election. Fifty percent of voters surveyed in a nationwide exit
poll Sunday said they would vote for the premier. Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov rated second in the poll with 17 percent, and
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ranked third with 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of the voting indicate that the next State
Duma, for years a bastion of antigovernment sentiment, could have a
pro-Kremlin majority for the first time since its creation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But what that means for Russia's transition to a market-oriented
democracy is unclear. In his four months as premier, Putin has said
little about his economic plans. So far, the main source of his
popularity has been Russia's three-month military campaign against
Islamic separatists in Chechnya, which is widely seen here not only
as a success for the army, but also as a sign of Russia's
rejuvenation as a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The main pro-Kremlin bloc in Sunday's vote, Unity (also known as
``The Bear''), clearly benefited from its backing by Putin and the
close involvement of its leader, Emergencies Minister Sergei
Shoigu, in the war effort. Unity's rating was nil when it was
hastily formed in September; results of a nationwide exit poll
shown on NTV television indicated The Bear would snare 25 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another bloc that has allied itself with Putin's presidential
campaign, the Union of Right Forces, scored a surprising 11 percent
in the exit poll. The bloc is led by the ``young reformers,''
proponents of Western economic models who have held senior
government posts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 10 years the Duma will not be controlled
by the Communists,'' said former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
leader of the Union of Right Forces. ``This victory is hard to
overestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a ringing endorsement of market economics,
analysts attributed the bloc's strong showing to the heavy
promotion it received on Russia's two main state-run television
stations in the last three weeks of the campaign, and to the strong
pro-war stance taken by its leaders. Many Russians blame the
reformists for everything that has gone wrong with the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Putin himself was more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would like very much the new Duma to be efficient and easy
to cooperate with in solving the country's acute problems,'' he
said after voting in western Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll predicted 11 percent for the Fatherland/All Russia
alliance of Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who cruised to
reelection Sunday in the Russian capital despite the disappointing
national result for his coalition. The poll predicted that the
liberal Yabloko party would win 8 percent, and forecast that a bloc
led by flamboyant nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky would gain 5
percent of the vote, the minimum vote needed for parties to place
their members in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Partial official results released early Monday showed Unity/Bear
with 27.6 percent of the vote versus 25.3 percent for the
Communists, with about 7.9 percent for Zhirinovsky, 7.5 percent for
the Union of Right Forces, 6.6 percent for Fatherland/All Russia
and 5.7 percent for Yabloko. But these results were compiled mainly
from Russia's Far East, where only 10 percent of the country's 107
million voters live.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the war was one of the main issues in a campaign in
which parties rarely talked about how they would make life better
in a country where millions of workers go months without being paid
and the health system, education, and other social services have
yet to recover from 10 years of economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Communists, staunch critics of Yeltsin throughout his
eight years as Russia's leader, appeared to capitalize on their
appeal to discontented voters. But the Communists' first-place
showing does not guarantee that they will have the most seats in
the Duma. Only half of the house's 450 seats are decided by
parties' showing in the national vote; the other 225 seats are
contested in individual constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Only when these votes are tallied will the makeup of the Duma,
and the policies it will pursue, become clear. Sunday, several
prominent progovernment candidates, including another former prime
minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, and oil baron and reported
Kremlin insider Roman Abramovich appeared to have won seats.
Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky, a prime strategist for the Unity
bloc, was ahead in his region. Political analyst Igor Bunin
predicted that the Kremlin would, for the first time since the Duma
was created in 1993, have the simple majority needed to elect a
supporter as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian governments
have always feuded with parliament; the Duma was created in 1993
after Yeltsin used tanks and troops to destroy the previous
legislature, which had defied his attempt to dissolve it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's allies won despite Yeltsin's endorsement, rather than
because of it. Russians have come to associate their president with
corruption, economic crises, and a lack of authority personified by
his own erratic behavior and declining health. Putin, and the
parties he supports, have managed to create the impression of
vitality. Even though Unity/Bear has no recognizable party
platform, this was more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a longing for powerful authority,'' noted Dmitry
Oreshkin, a spokesman for Russia's federal electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said the vote appeared to have been conducted fairly,
although they had witnessed ``family voting'' practices, where the
head of a household votes on behalf of the entire family. In one
Moscow polling station, voters asked one another for advice on how
to choose among two dozen parties. NTV reported that some stations
ran out of paper ballots, and local election officials added to the
confusion by crossing out candidates who were on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, the Communist Party accused opponents of trying
to blacken its image by placing 24 bottles of vodka outside its
headquarters, Reuters reported. The party apparently feared that
voters might have seen the bottles as an attempt to secure their
votes through bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vodka shots were sold at low prices, apparently to
entice citizens to brave the winter weather and get out the vote.
But even where there was no liquid encouragement, turnout was
solid: 57 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was marred by a heavy-handed effort to discredit
the Fatherland/All Russia alliance, put on by the country's main
television station, ORT, which is controlled by Berezovsky and
reaches most of Russia's households. Sergei Dorenko, the ORT host
who led the campaign against Luzhkov and Primakov, was pleased with
Sunday's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electoral show has been successful,'' Dorenko told
reporters. ``Now Luzhkov and Primakov cannot be considered
realistic candidates for president.''

SUPERSTORES FINDING ROOM IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, the city council defeated a plan by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that would have made it easier for
warehouse-style superstores to come into the city. Undeterred,
national chain stores said this setback would not stop them from
entering the lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, 40 superstores such as Kmart, Home Depot and Target
have sprouted in New York, and more are expected. The stores have
fashioned themselves for the market. To get around zoning
restrictions, some chains have squeezed themselves into smaller
spaces, and others have taken advantage of loopholes _ by putting
most of their floor space in a basement.
</P>
<P>
   With New York being the last frontier for such stores, often
called big boxes, plans to build more often evoke opposition,
especially in more densely populated areas. But there the stores
are catching on with many consumers. Target and Kmart say their New
York stores are among their top performers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Home Depot, which has six stores in the city
and is about to open another, filed a building permit application
for yet another.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kmart opened a another store, and Target plans to
take over the site of a former Stern's in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Now Costco, the chain famous for its warehouse-style stores, is
planning the largest supermarket in Manhattan. The company recently
scrapped plans to build another supermarket, on 14th Street, but a
shopping center in East Harlem that would house both a Home Depot
and a Costco recently made it through the zoning review.
</P>
<P>
   Queens is dotted with so many superstores that some couples have
stopped driving to Nassau County to shop.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem as if the national retailers are descending on the
city at a breathtaking rate _ Costco already has three stores in
the city _ but Giuliani administration officials maintain that the
pace is not quick enough, and they contend that the number of new
stores in New York falls short of the number needed to compensate
for the retail jobs lost in the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   And, administration officials say the existing zoning
regulations _ drawn up 25 years ago to keep industries and lure new
ones into manufacturing areas _ make no sense because they restrict
only certain categories of retailing. Thus, movie multiplexes, Home
Depots and other giant retail outlets that were not envisioned when
zoning regulations were changed in 1974 are proliferating while
badly needed supermarkets are not.
</P>
<P>
   City council members deny they hindered the development of
superstores. ``The argument was that these stores could not come
here without changing the law,'' said Walter L. McCaffrey, the
chairman of the City Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee.
``That's obviously not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Mayor Giuliani's unsuccessful plan, any store up to
200,000 square feet _ bigger than three football fields _ would
have been able to establish itself in one of these manufacturing
areas without a zoning exception. Based on calculations of how many
dollars city residents were spending outside the city,
administration officials said abolishing the zoning restrictions
could have resulted in as many as 57 additional stores.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern for opponents of the mayor's plan was the effect
superstores would have on smaller retailers. But so far, no one can
be sure what the impact has been.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants in Brooklyn take issue with that notion. ``They
come in here at the expense of the existing businesses,'' said
Peter Morisi, a pasta wholesaler. ``The vast majority of people are
complaining that their business is not what it used to be.'' Morisi
said he closed his retail shop, the Macaroni Store, at Fifth Avenue
and 18th Street, in 1997, in part because of the competition from
the new Costco in Sunset Park.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani administration officials, the
inconsistencies in the zoning regulations are hardest on the
supermarket chains, which lack the resources of the other national
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey Gutman, a spokesman for Pathmark, which is building
or has opened eight stores in the city since 1996 and also has its
eye on 14th Street, said that supermarkets can find ways to
surmount the New York regulatory hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarket chains that are fixed in their view of what a
store should look like _ the parking always outside the door,
receiving always in the center to the rear _ are going to be
disappointed,'' Gutman said. ``Those willing to be flexible and
creative will find a way to get stores built.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a larger presence in Manhattan, Costco hopes to open
a store between 55th and 56th Streets on 10th Avenue that would be
based on a new model called Costco Fresh, specializing in food.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively small at 70,000 square feet (the Long Island
City store is 130,000 square feet), it would be the largest
supermarket in Manhattan _ about seven times the size of an
independent supermarket. There would be no parking.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Costco's plans are meeting fierce resistance from
community groups and elected officials in some of the city's most
politically active neighborhoods. Although Jeffrey H. Brotman,
Costco's chairman, denies it, neighborhood opposition is widely
believed to have forced the company out of a development that will
replace the 14th Street Armory. Now Costco plans to re-evaluate a
proposal to open a store on 23rd Street that was shelved because it
did not conform to Chelsea's new zoning plan.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the stores would bring thousands of cars and
trucks to their heavily traveled neighborhoods and are not needed
in Manhattan, where most people make do without cars or storage
space. They also fault Costco for its $40 annual membership fee,
saying it is out of reach for many residents, and for its refusal
to accept food stamps or the electronic debit cards that welfare
recipients use. Leaders of unions that represent supermarket
employees have joined the fight because workers in newer Costco
stores are not unionized.

DOROTHY ALLISON, 74, `PSYCHIC DETECTIVE' CONSULTED BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Allison, a self-proclaimed psychic with a knack for
turning up at the scenes of notorious crimes, died on Dec. 1 at
Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, N.J. She was 74 and lived
in Nutley, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison, a small woman in thick, oversized glasses,
materializedto offer to solve crimes including the Patricia Hearst
kidnapping, the ``Son of Sam'' killings, the murders of children in
Atlanta and the death of JonBenet Ramsey. She was not successful in
those cases, but her supporters insist that she hit the mark on
others.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Robert DeLitta of the Nutley Police Department, which
became something of a booking agent for Ms. Allison, said, ``The
information she provided was very, very accurate _ right on the
money.'' He said hundreds of police departments from all over the
world called the Nutley police to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   Her fame made her the emblem of a vigorous debate about the
efficacy and legitimacy of so-called psychic detectives. ``Dorothy
couldn't locate Patty,'' Randolph Hearst, Patricia's father, said
in a Newsweek interview. ``But she is honest and reputable. I
wouldn't laugh at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics, many armed with volumes of research, insist that
psychics have never solved a single crime. Joe Nickell, a columnist
for Skeptical Inquirer, the magazine of the Committee for the
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, said in an
interview that psychic detectives use a trick called
``retrofitting,'' which involves tossing out several clues, like a
number or a mention of water, that are interpreted to fit the facts
after they become known.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments may waste valuable time and resources digging
in specific spots and draining ponds on the erroneous advice of a
psychic, he said. ``Certainly Dorothy Allison caused a great deal
of _ I'm sure unintended _ mischief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine, said in an
interview that psychic detectives commonly make logical
predictions; for example, they suggest that a corpse will be found
in a remote area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a body, are you going to dump it in a crowded
city?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Allison named names, they were not always the right
ones. In the case of the murders of about a dozen black children in
Atlanta in 1979-80, she gave the police 42 names of possible
killers, and none of the names were Wayne or Williams. A man named
Wayne B. Williams was eventually convicted of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison became something of a cult figure after many
newspaper articles and television shows depicted her as a
great-grandmother sitting at her kitchen table, concentrating on
astrological charts and gazing at gruesome photographs of crime
scenes. Visitors to her house noticed many commendations from
police departments, some of which officially say they do not use
psychics.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Jersey City and grew up there. Her psychic
sensations became public knowledge in 1968, when she told the
Nutley police that they could find the body of a missing boy in a
drainage pipe. Though it has been widely reported for three decades
that they did, Nickell said that according to his research, the
body was found floating in a pond by a man looking for a place to
bury his dead cat.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the years, Ms. Allison said she had worked on
more than 5,000 cases, so many that she had trouble recalling the
names of victims. She said she had led detectives to 250 bodies and
had solved hundreds of murders. Among the police departments that
consulted her was New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   Chief DeLitta of the Nutley police said she had been helpful on
many occasions, citing a 1993 bludgeoning murder. Among Ms.
Allison's correct predictions were double letters in the names of
the suspect and a street that figured in the case, the occupation
of the suspect's father, and the facts that the suspect lived in a
garden apartment next to a yellow house and that one of his car's
headlights was out.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the murder weapon would be found in a river. The
weapon was never found, but the man convicted of the crime later
admitted throwing it in the river, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison refused payment for her work, saying it would be
``blood money.'' She did accept money for expenses and payments for
appearances on talk shows and other forums. She also wrote articles
and books, the most successful of which was ``A Psychic's Story,''
published in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Bob; two sons, Alex Allison of
Nutley and Robert McBride of Stone Ridge, N.Y.; a daughter, Dorothy
McBride of Montville, N.J.; seven grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me if I believe in psychics, I'd say no _ only
very few,'' Ms. Allison said in a 1996 interview in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   She had harsh words for psychics who advertise on television, a
practice she shunned. ``Those 1-900 number people should be
arrested,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   With a year-end deadline looming, state legislators and Gov.
George Pataki have announced an impressive health care package that
offers coverage to thousands of uninsured New Yorkers and helps pay
for it by boosting the tax on a pack of cigarettes by 55 cents. The
agreement also draws on funds from a nationwide tobacco industry
settlement that is expected to bring in half a billion dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated package looks like a significant, and long
needed, expansion in state support for the three million New
Yorkers who need medical insurance. Equally important, it will
maintain the financial ability of New York's hospitals to serve the
poor and to educate physicians. The only disappointment is that the
bill would set aside an average of $37 million a year for new
anti-smoking programs, which is a considerable boost to the $20
million currently being spent but still short of what is needed to
discourage smoking among adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal offers stability for hospitals, clinics and nursing
homes. It takes no additional cuts out of Medicaid funds and
maintains a surcharge on hospital fees for insured patients to help
pay the cost of medical education and charity cases. It also
expands the state's Child Health Plus plan to adults, offering
insurance to those at or near the poverty level. The plan now
covers about 400,000 children. It would be expected to cover about
180,000 adults over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is expected early this week to approve the
agreement, technically a recasting of the Health Care Reform Act.
Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, has said he sees no harm
in delaying a Senate vote until the next scheduled session in early
January. But a good deal like this should not sit around, giving
special interests, including those unhappy about an increase in
cigarette prices, time to make it unravel. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   When the opposition tries to take the higher road, it makes
little sense to stick to the lower road, hoping the entire scene
will simply go away. But that, in effect, has been the stubborn
stance on lobbying reform taken by the New York state Assembly as
led by Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. Silver claims
to want a tough lobbying reform package, but he has not issued any
proposal of his own and has failed to allow the most enlightened
bill on this issue to make it to the Assembly floor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Silver has been outflanked by his Republican
opponent, the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. Bruno
persuaded the Senate last week to pass a lobbying reform bill and
agree to a voluntary ban on virtually all gifts. These steps
constitute a good first stab at deflecting the pervasive influence
of special interests in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   New York's feeble law on lobbying is set to expire at the end of
this year and the Legislature initially appeared ready to extend
the toothless measure for four years. In July, however, The Times
revealed how much money Philip Morris' lobbyists had spent
dispensing gifts, tickets and other benefits to 115 current and
former lawmakers in Albany _ details that were revealed in national
tobacco litigation but not in company reports to the lobbying
commission in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   To calm the ensuing criticism, Bruno got the Senate to pass his
bill, knowing that the Assembly might not endorse it. To deflect
criticism that this was a one-house publicity stunt going nowhere,
the Senate also endorsed voluntary guidelines for its members. The
bill does not go far enough, most seriously because it fails to
give auditing power to the commission that oversees the lobbying
industry. But at least Bruno has registered embarrassment over the
lobbying excesses that resulted in fines of more than $75,000 for
Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bruno's public relations coup caught the Assembly
leadership off guard, Silver and his staff have been busily trying
to poke holes in the Senate bill while offering little beyond
promises to replace it. One suggestion _ a 30-day extension to the
present law _ merely raises a question whether Assembly members
figured that if they stalled long enough, the pesky issue of
lobbying reform would disappear. Meanwhile, an excellent lobbying
reform plan put together by Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a
Democrat from Manhattan, has been gathering mold in the committee
rooms of Albany's lower house, at Silver's orders.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the Assembly and Gov. George Pataki to stake out
higher ground on lobbying and gifts, not for political gamesmanship
but as a matter of ethical necessity.

JACKSON BARRETT MAHON, 78, HEROIC WORLD WAR II FLIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackson Barrett Mahon, an American fighter pilot shot down over
France in World War II who was one of several Allied airmen thought
to have inspired the 1963 movie ``The Great Escape,'' died on Dec.
4 in a hospice in Las Vegas. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his daughter Doris Keating
Schlesinger said. Mahon lived in Henderson, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, when the war was raging in Europe but the United States
had not yet been drawn in, Mahon, who was from Bakersfield, Calif.,
enlisted in Britain's Royal Air Force and began flying Spitfires on
combat missions with Eagle Squadron 121, a unit composed of
American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   After completing 98 missions and shooting down nine enemy
aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Mahon was reported missing in 1942
after a raid over northern France. The British Air Ministry awarded
him the Distinguished Flying Cross while he was missing; the
citation called him ``an extremely skillful and confident pilot,
whose courage, especially when attacking superior numbers of
hostile aircraft, has been unsurpassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahon, who went down over Dieppe, wound up a German prisoner at
Stalag Luft III in Polish Silesia. Over the next two years, he and
other POWs stealthily dug tunnels under the barbed-wire fence that
surrounded the camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahon could not wait for the tunnel to be finished. He
seized a chance to break out alone and made it to the Czech border,
where he was captured.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped again, only to be recaptured and placed in solitary
confinement. ``That was what saved his life,'' Ms. Schlesinger
said. ``When the tunnel was ready, he was still locked up and
couldn't join the others who went through it. Most of them were
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 76 British airmen escaped through the tunnel, but only
three made it back to Britain. Within a few days, 50 were captured
and executed on the personal instructions of Hitler. The rest were
quickly returned to other POW camps.
</P>
<P>
   Mahon was finally liberated by the U.S. Third Army under Gen.
George S. Patton Jr. in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the escape was first told in the 1949 book ``The
Great Escape'' by Paul Brickall, an Australian flier who survived
Stalag Luft III and drew on his own experience. The story was
retold on television in 1951 and then in the movie of the same
name, which contained a purely fictional motorcycle chase, inserted
to allow its star, Steve McQueen, to show off his jumping skill.
Mahon was recruited as technical adviser on the film.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, after the death of John Dortch Lewis, an American
survivor of Stalag Luft III, friends of Lewis' asserted that he had
been the model for the irascible and surly character played by
McQueen. Brickall met Lewis after the war and confirmed that he had
been a prisoner at Stalag Luft III, but Lewis never went through
the tunnel. After three foiled attempts, he escaped by bolting from
a German train carrying POWs.
</P>
<P>
   Another claimant was Sydney M. Pozer, a Canadian gunner shot
down in a British bomber. Pozer, who died in 1996, survived because
he drew a short straw in the lottery that preceded the breakout and
he never went through the tunnel.

RELIGION-YOUNG (PHOENIX) _ It's 7 o'clock Sunday night during
finals week at Arizona State University, and there's standing room
only at the All Saints Catholic Newman Center Mass. Most weekends,
about 1,300 students pile in to the non-traditional sanctuary for
the center's five Masses. During finals, the Rev. Nathan Castle
says, the number swells about 20 percent. Do they come to pray for
good grades? Some probably do, Castle jokes. But for those who
regularly attend, the Newman Center Mass offers a connection that
goes beyond the liturgy and familiar hymns. On the eve of the 21st
century, at ASU and secular schools across the Phoenix area,
students are exploring things spiritual _ whether through organized
religion or less defined means. By MAUREEN JENKINS. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL;

BRIGHT LIGHTS, SIN CITY: `PORTRAITS' OF VEGAS' MOVERS AND SHAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 
 ``THE FIRST 100:  PORTRAITS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHAPED LAS
VEGAS'' 
 By A.D. Hopkins and K.J. Evans from the archives of 
 the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal''  (Huntington Press, $34.95) 
 &HT;     By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just slot-machine feeders finding the new Las Vegas to
be an irresistible attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, too, are squinting into the Strip's bright lights
and seeing dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press recently published a collection of
essays titled ``The Real Las Vegas: Life Beyond the Strip.''
Villard Books offers Andres Martinez's ``24/7: Living It Up and
Doubling Down in the New Las Vegas.'' Early next year, Bantam
Doubleday Dell will sell Pete Earley's ``Super Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Combine Sin City's colorful past with its current
boom, and you've got a sizzling 20th century story.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in the finer details of that story could
start with ``The First 100,'' a new book from Las Vegas publisher
Huntington Press.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of profiles, the book _ actually a reprint of a
massive project by the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal'' _ tells the
city's history through its people. It was an end-of-the-century
undertaking designed to document a place perpetually engaged in
furious re-invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people I almost cried for not getting to meet,''
said A.D. Hopkins, who with K.J. Evans oversaw the project for the
``Review-Journal.'' ``For a lot of these people, there was no
archival material. For a lot of people here, we were establishing
the archival material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The First 100'' includes the people behind some familiar Las
Vegas names and landmarks, including John C. Fremont, Harley
Harmon, James Cashman, Pat McCarran and Benny Binion.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are the peculiarly Las Vegas histories of marquee
names such as Caesars Palace and Circus Circus builder Jay Sarno,
Donn Arden (credited with perfecting the over-the-top _ and
sometimes topless _ showroom spectacular), Benjamin (don't call him
``Bugsy'') Siegel, Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of entries examines lesser-knowns while telling the
unlikely tale of how a mixture of Mormons, mobsters and
multimillionaires built a premier vice-tourism destination from raw
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, a 30-year Las Vegas veteran, once edited the
``Review-Journal's''history-heavy (but now, alas, defunct) Sunday
magazine, ``Nevadan.'' Hopkins personally wrote many of the
entries, as did the late K.J. Evans, another former ``Nevadan''
editor. (The entire project is also archived online at
www.lvrj.com, the paper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently a special-projects editor for the paper, Hopkins, 56,
said a list of 300 profile subjects was suggested by readers, as
well as a committee of historians and ``Review-Journal'' staffers.
</P>
<P>
   The first big list ranged from beloved grade-school teachers to
beauty queens, bankers to burlesque stars. The final cut didn't
limit the list to the merely historically important.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable dose of imagination went into the selection
process. How else to explain the inclusion of John Seibold, who
popularized Las Vegas-based sightseeing flights over the Grand
Canyon? Or fabled hypemeister Bob Stupak, who was inspired to build
the Stratosphere Tower when a heavy windstorm blew down the sign in
front of his tacky Vegas World casino?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the nominees) were important, but not very
interesting,'' Hopkins said. ``They were supposed to have a
long-term effect, but if there was a story that we wanted to tell,
we wouldn't let it slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins admitted that many of the people who didn't make the
final list were as fascinating as those who did. Take Larry Snow,
who popularized the game baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baccarat makes money for hotels,'' Hopkins said. ``Sometimes
it's the difference between profit and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Or John Stuart, who pioneered the celebrity-impersonator show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of those, and it was his idea,''
Hopkins said. ``If you come up with a winning idea, a trend in
entertainment that shows no sign of of quitting, that's worth
something. That's a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been 150, he'd have made it.'' &QL; 
``The First 100'' can be ordered on the Web
(www.hungtingtonpress.com) or by telephone (1-702-252-0655). Dave
Walker can be reached at (602) 444-8625 or

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ROUND UP OF BIG BOOKS) 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

NEWS ANALYSIS: MOVING OF DIALLO TRIAL COMES UNDER FIRE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the seesaw that is political life in New York, the
Rev. Al Sharpton was up last March, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
down. Sharpton was leading demonstrations and a civil disobedience
campaign to protest the police shooting of Amadou Diallo. Giuliani
was on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court
ruled that the trial of the four officers charged with
second-degree murder in Diallo's death should be moved from the
Bronx to Albany, specifically citing the demonstrations and more
than 1,000 arrests that accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   In embracing the decision, Giuliani did not mention Sharpton by
name, but there was no question where his finger was pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is, there was a concerted effort on the part of
numerous people to make it impossible to have a fair trial in New
York,'' the mayor said Sunday. ``When you start marching, demanding
that people be indicted _ you get out in front of courthouses and
demand that people be indicted, that's like the Old West. I mean
the reality is that the judge, the judges, five judges unanimously
decided that, rendered a very, very wise decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, of course, rejected the implication that his strategy
had backfired. None of the orchestrated arrests had taken place in
the Bronx, he said, and the demonstrations had stopped after the
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's decision, by five appointees of Gov. George
Pataki, did not just move the trial: it validated Giuliani's
worldview, whether of the protesters or what he considered biased
news media coverage. It also moved a potentially troublesome trial
from the city to a conservative county where further protests are
only likely to burnish Giuliani's reputation as a tough sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   David Meyer, an associate professor of sociology at the
University of California at Irvine, who observed the Diallo
protests while teaching at City College, said: ``There's a
political angle _ protecting Giuliani. If demonstrators are in the
street every day talking about police brutality'' during a Bronx
trial, he said, ``it's something he has to respond to every day in
an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   So inevitably, perhaps, some saw a decision intended to remove
the case from politics as being steeped in it. Norman Siegel,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that
in the Abner Louima case, in which thousands marched over the
Brooklyn Bridge in protest, the judge, Eugene M. Nickerson, said he
would keep looking for jurors until he found an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the Diallo case, the Appellate Division said any attempt to
impanel a jury would be ``fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Siegel asserted, is the judiciary. Federal
judges like Nickerson are appointed for life, and thus are
independent of any political influence. In the state court system,
judges are appointed by politically elected officials and must be
reappointed. ``The judges are very ambitious,'' he said. ``In the
middle level of the court system any good judge who's not near
retirement is thinking in the back of their mind, wouldn't it be
nice to be on the New York Court of Appeals?''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately or not, Siegel said, the decision also meant that
five white male judges were removing the case from the jurisdiction
of a black woman, Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who was scheduled
to preside over the case in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hearing in the last 48 hours that at least the result, if
not the intention, was to take her out,'' he said. ``You don't want
to have that as the backdrop to a potentially polarizing and
racially charged trial. This gives material to people who don't
believe in the legal system or want to undermine the legal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   G. Michael Bellinger, a former prosecutor now in private law
practice, agreed. Bellinger, who is black, spent Sunday researching
similar decisions, he said Sunday night, and concluded that no
black criminal defendant had had his or her trial moved before a
judge had even tried to impanel an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops in the Bronx usually opt for a bench trial,'' he said.
``We know the judge in this case is black, and it just so happens
that the appellate court rushes in and saves them.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the man accused of attacking Nicole Barrett with a brick
be granted a change of venue at a similar stage in his legal
proceedings, he asked, noting the torrent of news coverage that
case had received?
</P>
<P>
   Steven Zeidman, executive director for the Fund for the Modern
Courts, agreed that ``with African-American defendants, those
motions are made and denied in a heartbeat.'' But, he said, that
did not mean it was wrong to move the Diallo case; rather, it meant
too few previous cases had been given a change of venue. ``It makes
sense under the law,'' he said of the decision, ``but I think
people rightly look at it and say why this case as opposed to all
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he defended the decision _ if not the choice of Albany
_ he said he was worried that it could have a ``chilling effect''
on community activity. ``Will this case be used as a bellwether
from now on in a criminal case if there is a hue and cry in
public?''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union, defended
the court's response to the protests, although he, too, wondered,
``why Albany?'' In trying to use protest to influence judicial
proceedings, he contended, Sharpton had brought ``Southern
politics'' north.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking at the South of 40 years ago,'' he said,
``this is the kind of thing that liberals are supposed to be
opposed to _ that mobs could sway the courts.''

composer John Harbison was looking for an enterprising lyricist to
give an authentic 1920s flavor to pop songs in his new opera, ``The
Great Gatsby,'' which receives its world premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, he turned to the eclectic
Horwitz. Horwitz, who can bring to mind Kevin Kline on lithium,
fashioned lyrics to five of Harbison's songs reminiscent of the
period, performed live by a band vocalist or played over the radio
during the opera. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, believes that the growth of business-to-business online
services will open up opportunities for companies that are willing
to take on the risk. ``B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to
profitability compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if
only because Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses
at these companies will also probably not reach the level of
e-commerce companies,'' says Meeker. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York

are a nuisance. Morrisson, president of the local Citizens for Deer
Control, blames the deer for everything from the disappearance of
traditional mountain laurel to the sudden rarity of the
yellow-breasted chat. For now, fat, sassy and in mating rut lately,
the deer graze the park secure, by law, from the many specialized
hunters who are busy now taking seasonal aim at the backyard deer
problem. (Laura Pedrick/The New York Times)

bombarded Grozny and his flight out of Chechnya. Kashpurin, who
wife was killed in a fierce attack, now spends his days in bed in a
small home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians
fleeing the fighting in Chechnya. ``I was lying in bed when a plane
zoomed by and fired a missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the

for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. Taylor wrote a white
paper in 1968, a year before the network was created, with another
ARPA research director, J.C.R. Licklider. The paper, ``The Computer

about the potential of a computer network. (Peter DaSilva/The New

   (NYT6) ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-ELECT-1
-- Russian election workers at polling Station 1380. As of late
Sunday Russian voters elected a new Duma, the lower house that has
the power to enact legislation and oversee taxation, to sit for
four years. In this once opulent neighborhood near the imposing
fortress that was Peter the Great's landmark when founding this
city, now badly frayed by Soviet neglect and capitalist poverty,
perhaps half of the 1,450 registered voters turned out in winter's
half-daylight to cast their ballots. (James Hill/The New York

Ransom Bruce tries out a manual typewriter at Hammacher Schlemmer.
Phonograph records, flypaper, typewriters, windup watches, carbon
paper. They are products that most people of a certain age grew up
with but that have largely vanished, usually with little notice,
from everyday life. Something presumably better has taken their
place. But while they are forgotten by many, they are not gone.

   (NYT3) MOZDOK, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-CHECHNYA --
Mikhail A. Kashpurin, 76, a frail old man with years of valorous
service in the Soviet Army now spends his days in bed in a small
home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians fleeing
the fighting in Chechnya. Grozny's residents have endured so much
hardship that not even the prospect of a war necessarily impels
them to flee. The Kashpurins, and thousands of other residents, did
not anticipate such fierce air strikes and artillery barrages. But
that all changed for Kashpurin on Nov. 27, the day that shattered
his life. ``I was lying in bed when a plane zoomed by and fired a
missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the kitchen and was blown to
pieces.'' (James Hill/The New York Times)

distributes digital films through the Internet and allows filmakers
and industry executives to connect. ``The idea of a movie studio is
changing as we watch,'' says Raderman. ``What is a studio? If you
think of it as a place where movies are developed, produced,
marketed and distributed, then we are very close to having a
technology where one person can do that all by himself. Each person
can be his own studio.'' (Peter DaSilva/The New York Times)

OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA -- Fiat automobiles roll off the assembly
line in the Argentine province of Cordoba. latin America hopes its
difficulties are behind it. Still, to a large extent than in
advanced industrial regions, Latin America may not be fully the
master of its own fate. As the fallout from crises in East Asia and
Eastern Europe in recent years has shown, all that would be needed
to erase many of the gains expected in 2000 is the appearance of
new problems in, say, Indonesia and renewed skittishness among
investors. (Horacio Paone/The New York Times)

(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ Forget Finland's reindeer, London's Dickens or New
York's FAO Schwartz. When it actually comes to making the stuff of
good tidings, Hong Kong is the most Christmassy place there is.
</P>
<P>
   From its companies come most of the world's toys, along with its
Christmas-tree lights, trimmings and yes, even the trees
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the big green spruce or sparkling white pine around which
their presents are stacked, millions of good little boys and girls
this year can thank just one Hong Kong company: Boto, the
abominable snowman of the fake-Christmas-tree industry, which has
captured nearly 45 percent of the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's factories in Shenzhen, China employ 6,500 workers,
filling up to 50 containers a day with hand-wrapped triumphs of
faux foliage to spread cheer around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are eighteen-foot pines, with real cones and authentic
smell; or smaller white, gold and silver varieties in flocked,
frosted or prelighted form; or just wreaths, centerpieces,
garlands, swags or sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's vertically integrated operation makes everything from the
lights, ornaments and tinsel to PVC rigid film, which is cut up to
make ``needles.''
</P>
<P>
   While the eggnog flows, this is a great business. Thanks in part
to a glowing report by David Webb, a usually Scrooge-like
independent Hong Kong analyst, its shares are up nearly 6 percent
this week, near an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which are growing at 20 percent a year, will hit $100
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a fly in Boto's brandy butter. What does it do for
the rest of the year? The toy companies have birthdays, new
products and parental indulgence to keep their sales going
throughout the year. But there is little call for frosted elms in
July.
</P>
<P>
   This clever company has, however, found a neat solution: an
equivalent but opposite seasonal product.
</P>
<P>
   In the off months, its Shenzhen elves now make rather spiffy
garden furniture in a new factory next to its tree workshop. &QL;

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- GATSBY-OPERA-LYRICIST --
Murray Horowitz, 50, conjuring up radio days of the 1920s. When the
composer John Harbison was looking for an enterprising lyricist to
give an authentic 1920s flavor to pop songs in his new opera, ``The
Great Gatsby,'' which receives its world premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, he turned to the eclectic
Horwitz. Horwitz, who can bring to mind Kevin Kline on lithium,
fashioned lyrics to five of Harbison's songs reminiscent of the
period, performed live by a band vocalist or played over the radio
during the opera. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

   (NYT14) NEW YORK -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- OUTLOOK-INTERNET -- Mary
Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, believes that the growth of business-to-business online
services will open up opportunities for companies that are willing
to take on the risk. ``B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to
profitability compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if
only because Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses
at these companies will also probably not reach the level of
e-commerce companies,'' says Meeker. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York

James M. Morrisson, at the Valley Forge National Historical Park
where deer are protected, leads a group of citizens who say deer
are a nuisance. Morrisson, president of the local Citizens for Deer
Control, blames the deer for everything from the disappearance of
traditional mountain laurel to the sudden rarity of the
yellow-breasted chat. For now, fat, sassy and in mating rut lately,
the deer graze the park secure, by law, from the many specialized
hunters who are busy now taking seasonal aim at the backyard deer
problem. (Laura Pedrick/The New York Times)

Mikhail A. Kashpurin, 76, a frail old man with years of valorous
service in the Soviet Army, weeps as he tells of his ordeal in
bombarded Grozny and his flight out of Chechnya. Kashpurin, who
wife was killed in a fierce attack, now spends his days in bed in a
small home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians
fleeing the fighting in Chechnya. ``I was lying in bed when a plane
zoomed by and fired a missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the
kitchen and was blown to pieces.'' (James Hill/The New York Times)

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- OUTLOOK-COMMUNICATIONS -- A
prototype of a wireless phone being developed by IBM has a small
screen at its base. Communications executives expect wireless
phones of the future to make increasing use of the Internet. By
2002, wireless subscribers could have access to as much as a
million bits of digital information each second, just about enough
for a television-quality videophone and about 20 times the 56K
connection speed supported by today's fastest home modems. (Joyce

   (NYT10) WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Dec. 19, 1999 --
OUTLOOK-INTERNET-DAD -- Robert W. Taylor, who never profited
personally from the commercial Internet boom, is the real
``father'' of the Internet. It was Taylor who came up with the idea
for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. Taylor wrote a white
paper in 1968, a year before the network was created, with another
ARPA research director, J.C.R. Licklider. The paper, ``The Computer
as a Communications Device,'' was one of the first clear statements
about the potential of a computer network. (Peter DaSilva/The New

of a genetic variant and its effects on congestive heart failure
helps explain why patients responded differently to treatment.

-- Mariya Chashena, 78, of St. Petersburg, was unable to go to her
neighborhood polling station, so election officials came to her
apartment so she could cast her ballot in the Russian parliamentary
elections on Sunday. As of late Sunday Russian voters elected a new
Duma, the lower house that has the power to enact legislation and
oversee taxation, to sit for four years. (James Hill/The New York

   (NYT6) ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-ELECT-1
-- Russian election workers at polling Station 1380. As of late
Sunday Russian voters elected a new Duma, the lower house that has
the power to enact legislation and oversee taxation, to sit for
four years. In this once opulent neighborhood near the imposing
fortress that was Peter the Great's landmark when founding this
city, now badly frayed by Soviet neglect and capitalist poverty,
perhaps half of the 1,450 registered voters turned out in winter's
half-daylight to cast their ballots. (James Hill/The New York

Craig Venter of Celera Genomics examines a plate of bacterial
colonies about to be sampled for DNA sequencing by the robotic
sampler behind him. The biggest opportunities and challenges in
biotechnology for the millennium are expected to come from
genomics, the study of the human genetic code. The Human Genome
Project, sponsored by the federal government, is expected to finish
the ``rough draft'' of the genome by spring and to be completed in
2003. (Marty Ktaz/The New York Times)

Ransom Bruce tries out a manual typewriter at Hammacher Schlemmer.
Phonograph records, flypaper, typewriters, windup watches, carbon
paper. They are products that most people of a certain age grew up
with but that have largely vanished, usually with little notice,
from everyday life. Something presumably better has taken their
place. But while they are forgotten by many, they are not gone.
(Barbara S. Alper/The New York Times)

   (NYT3) MOZDOK, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-CHECHNYA --
Mikhail A. Kashpurin, 76, a frail old man with years of valorous
service in the Soviet Army now spends his days in bed in a small
home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians fleeing
the fighting in Chechnya. Grozny's residents have endured so much
hardship that not even the prospect of a war necessarily impels
them to flee. The Kashpurins, and thousands of other residents, did
not anticipate such fierce air strikes and artillery barrages. But
that all changed for Kashpurin on Nov. 27, the day that shattered
his life. ``I was lying in bed when a plane zoomed by and fired a
missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the kitchen and was blown to
pieces.'' (James Hill/The New York Times)

Rodger Raderman, one of iFilm's founders and its co-chairman. iFilm
distributes digital films through the Internet and allows filmakers
and industry executives to connect. ``The idea of a movie studio is
changing as we watch,'' says Raderman. ``What is a studio? If you
think of it as a place where movies are developed, produced,
marketed and distributed, then we are very close to having a
technology where one person can do that all by himself. Each person
can be his own studio.'' (Peter DaSilva/The New York Times)

   (NYT1) CORDOBA, Argentina -- Dec. 19, 1999 --
OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA -- Fiat automobiles roll off the assembly
line in the Argentine province of Cordoba. latin America hopes its
difficulties are behind it. Still, to a large extent than in
advanced industrial regions, Latin America may not be fully the
master of its own fate. As the fallout from crises in East Asia and
Eastern Europe in recent years has shown, all that would be needed
to erase many of the gains expected in 2000 is the appearance of
new problems in, say, Indonesia and renewed skittishness among
investors. (Horacio Paone/The New York Times)

traditional mountain laurel to the sudden rarity of the
yellow-breasted chat. For now, fat, sassy and in mating rut lately,
the deer graze the park secure, by law, from the many specialized
hunters who are busy now taking seasonal aim at the backyard deer
problem. (Laura Pedrick/The New York Times)

   (NYT12) MOZDOK, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-2 --
Mikhail A. Kashpurin, 76, a frail old man with years of valorous
service in the Soviet Army, weeps as he tells of his ordeal in
bombarded Grozny and his flight out of Chechnya. Kashpurin, who
wife was killed in a fierce attack, now spends his days in bed in a
small home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians
fleeing the fighting in Chechnya. ``I was lying in bed when a plane
zoomed by and fired a missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the
kitchen and was blown to pieces.'' (James Hill/The New York Times)

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- OUTLOOK-COMMUNICATIONS -- A
prototype of a wireless phone being developed by IBM has a small
screen at its base. Communications executives expect wireless
phones of the future to make increasing use of the Internet. By
2002, wireless subscribers could have access to as much as a
million bits of digital information each second, just about enough
for a television-quality videophone and about 20 times the 56K
connection speed supported by today's fastest home modems. (Joyce

   (NYT10) WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Dec. 19, 1999 --
OUTLOOK-INTERNET-DAD -- Robert W. Taylor, who never profited
personally from the commercial Internet boom, is the real
``father'' of the Internet. It was Taylor who came up with the idea
for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. Taylor wrote a white
paper in 1968, a year before the network was created, with another
ARPA research director, J.C.R. Licklider. The paper, ``The Computer
as a Communications Device,'' was one of the first clear statements
about the potential of a computer network. (Peter DaSilva/The New

   (NYT8) ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-ELECT-3
-- Mariya Chashena, 78, of St. Petersburg, was unable to go to her
neighborhood polling station, so election officials came to her
apartment so she could cast her ballot in the Russian parliamentary
elections on Sunday. As of late Sunday Russian voters elected a new
Duma, the lower house that has the power to enact legislation and
oversee taxation, to sit for four years. (James Hill/The New York

-- Russian election workers at polling Station 1380. As of late
Sunday Russian voters elected a new Duma, the lower house that has
the power to enact legislation and oversee taxation, to sit for
four years. In this once opulent neighborhood near the imposing
fortress that was Peter the Great's landmark when founding this
city, now badly frayed by Soviet neglect and capitalist poverty,
perhaps half of the 1,450 registered voters turned out in winter's
half-daylight to cast their ballots. (James Hill/The New York

biotechnology for the millennium are expected to come from

Ransom Bruce tries out a manual typewriter at Hammacher Schlemmer.
Phonograph records, flypaper, typewriters, windup watches, carbon
paper. They are products that most people of a certain age grew up
with but that have largely vanished, usually with little notice,
from everyday life. Something presumably better has taken their
place. But while they are forgotten by many, they are not gone.

   (NYT3) MOZDOK, Russia -- Dec. 19, 1999 -- RUSSIA-CHECHNYA --
Mikhail A. Kashpurin, 76, a frail old man with years of valorous
service in the Soviet Army now spends his days in bed in a small
home in Mozdok, which has taken in other ethnic Russians fleeing
the fighting in Chechnya. Grozny's residents have endured so much
hardship that not even the prospect of a war necessarily impels
them to flee. The Kashpurins, and thousands of other residents, did
not anticipate such fierce air strikes and artillery barrages. But
that all changed for Kashpurin on Nov. 27, the day that shattered
his life. ``I was lying in bed when a plane zoomed by and fired a
missile,'' he says. ``My wife was in the kitchen and was blown to
pieces.'' (James Hill/The New York Times)

changing as we watch,'' says Raderman. ``What is a studio? If you
think of it as a place where movies are developed, produced,
marketed and distributed, then we are very close to having a
technology where one person can do that all by himself. Each person

OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA -- Fiat automobiles roll off the assembly
line in the Argentine province of Cordoba. latin America hopes its
difficulties are behind it. Still, to a large extent than in
advanced industrial regions, Latin America may not be fully the
master of its own fate. As the fallout from crises in East Asia and
Eastern Europe in recent years has shown, all that would be needed
to erase many of the gains expected in 2000 is the appearance of
new problems in, say, Indonesia and renewed skittishness among
investors. (Horacio Paone/The New York Times)

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If there was any hope at Florida State that the 1999 football
season would be a peaceful one, it went out the window on the
morning of July 8, six weeks before the season was due to begin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Delta Airlines employee at Tallahassee Regional Airport
contacted the university's athletic department to report two
Florida State players were booked to travel later that day to
Houston. Because it was known that clients of Houston-based agent
Carl C. Poston III were gathering that weekend for a lavish party,
the call set off alarms. Because one of the FSU players due on the
flight was Peter Warrick, the alarms rang louder than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The call set in motion a chain of events that would include an
airport stakeout, questions for Warrick and two of his teammates
and an investigation of Poston's company, Professional Sports
Planning Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As Florida State has marched to an unbeaten season, a No. 1
ranking and a spot opposite No. 2 Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl,
investigators from the Florida State University Police Department
and the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation
have interviewed witnesses and obtained records attempting to learn
how Poston's company has tried to procure Warrick, the Seminoles'
star receiver, and other FSU players as clients.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially the No. 1 overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft,
Warrick will bring hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions
to whomever serves as his agent.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents and sources familiar with the Florida
inquiry, investigators have developed information indicating a PSP
employee, Jeff Knox, arranged the purchase of airline tickets for
Warrick, FSU receivers Laveranues Coles and Ron Dugans, and
Warrick's former roommate, Joe Vegas, to travel from Tallahassee to
Houston on July 8, two days before the PSP party.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the case are statements made under oath by a Boca
Raton, Fla., travel agent, Angela Steffer. According to the
sources, Steffer told investigators she booked the flights and
issued the tickets at Knox's request and later followed his
directive to cover up his company's involvement when the matter was
scrutinized by Florida State officials.
</P>
<P>
   Coles traveled to Houston as scheduled, but the others did not,
their tickets scuttled after the Delta employee at the Tallahassee
airport noticed Warrick's and Dugans' names in his computer and
contacted Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ticket meant Coles had violated NCAA rules, which bar
student-athletes from receiving cash or other benefits from agents.
The matter caused him to miss the Seminoles' first game of the
season, against Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coles was the only FSU player to make the trip, the
matter could have serious repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sports agents operating in Florida must be licensed through the
state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation. The
process requires applicants to pass an examination, post a $15,000
surety bond, pay a series of fees and submit to a criminal
background check through the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting athletes attending Florida schools and engaging in
other agent-related activities in the state without a license is a
third-degree felony, punishable by a maximum of five years in
prison and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Poston is licensed as an agent in Florida; Knox is not.
</P>
<P>
   According to Natalie Kelly, communications director for the
state Department of Business and Professional Regulation, a
licensed agent can be charged with criminal misconduct if an
unlicensed employee is conducting agent-related business in Florida
on the agent's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   A licensed agent involved in conduct contrary to NCAA
regulations also can receive administrative penalties, including
suspension or revocation of his or her license.
</P>
<P>
   FSU police spokesman Jack Handley said last week he could not
comment on the PSP case because it is an open investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an active, ongoing investigation as we speak in
conjunction with DPR,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Poston nor Knox responded to repeated messages from the
Chronicle. Eliot P. Green, a New York attorney who informed Florida
State he was representing Poston and PSP, also did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Green wrote FSU athletic director Dave Hart Jr. in October
advising him that no representatives of PSP would attend the
university's annual ``agent day,'' a school-sponsored event in
which players meet and interview potential agents.
</P>
<P>
   Green's letter, provided to the Chronicle by Florida State,
cited the ``media circus'' stemming from the investigation and
stated it had seriously damaged the company's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic that my client will not attend the FSU agent day
due to investigations that have produced no evidence of any
wrongdoing on the part of our client,'' Green wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Professional Sports Planning Inc. is the corporate name for the
high-profile sports agency operated by Poston, based in Houston,
and his brother, Kevin, who is based in Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers, both attorneys, have been agents for a decade.
They are perhaps best known for their representation of the Phoenix
Suns' Penny Hardaway, one of the NBA's most recognizable players.
They also have negotiated contracts for some of the NFL's recent
high draft choices, including Oakland Raiders cornerback Charles
Woodson, the 1997 Heisman Trophy winner and the fourth pick in the
1998 draft; and St. Louis Rams offensive tackle Orlando Pace, the
first player chosen in the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Postons' clients are two former Florida State stars _
Kansas City kick-return specialist Tamarick Vanover and Miami
cornerback Terrell Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Knox, based in Houston, was identified as Professional Sports
Planning's ``client services manager'' in company correspondence
with the Texas Secretary of State's office in 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Minnix, Florida State's associate athletic director for
compliance, said Knox is a ``regular'' in Tallahassee and was in
Tempe, Ariz., when Florida State was there preparing for the 1999
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick entered the season as one of the leading candidates for
the Heisman Trophy, but his chances were irrevocably damaged when
he and Coles were arrested in October on felony theft charges
stemming from an incident at a Dillard's department store in
Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended for two games before pleading
guilty to a reduced charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the suspension, Warrick caught 71 passes for 934 yards
and 12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Coles was ruled ineligible by Florida State as a result of his
Houston trip but was reinstated immediately by the NCAA because he
had been withheld from the season opener. He subsequently was
dismissed from the team because of his involvement in the Dillard's
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, including Texas, have laws relating to sports
agents, but few have shown Florida's zeal for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attitude drew national attention as a result of the
Florida State Foot Locker scandal, in which eight FSU players were
found to have participated in a shopping spree financed by a
would-be agent at a Tallahassee Foot Locker store in 1993. The case
resulted in three individuals receiving fines or jail time for
failing to register as agents in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping trip, disclosed by Sports Illustrated after Florida
State had won the 1993 national championship, also led the NCAA to
place the university on a year's probation for failing to monitor
and adequately investigate players' involvement with agents.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix, interviewed recently about the Poston case, said he and
others at Florida State became concerned when a Delta employee at
the Tallahassee airport who handles the university's charter
flights called Andy Urbanic, FSU's associate athletic director for
football operations, on the morning of July 8. According to Minnix,
the Delta employee was curious why Warrick and Dugans had been
switched to a later flight to Houston, a change that would
necessitate an extra charge of $75.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Every, a football recruiting assistant, was dispatched to
the airport to see whether FSU players were boarding that
afternoon's Delta flights for Atlanta, the first leg of the trip to
Houston. According to his report to Minnix, he watched as
passengers boarded flights at 1:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m. and 7:25 p.m.
and saw no players.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix said he found Warrick and Dugans in Tallahassee, and both
appeared to have no knowledge they were supposed to travel to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you guys changing your tickets to go somewhere?'
They said, `Go where?''' Minnix said. ``Are they lying or not
lying? I don't know. But there was no indication to me they were
getting ready to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnix said he tracked down Coles in Houston and was told by the
player he was visiting a woman he had met previously in
Tallahassee, Kendra Baines, and was under the assumption she had
purchased his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Baines, 20, grew up in Missouri City and attends Clark Atlanta
University.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baines told Minnix she had paid for Coles' ticket, her
story was laced with inconsistencies. Coles' fare was one generally
unavailable to the average traveler _ a 21-day advance purchase
price for a ticket issued eight days before departure _ and his
ticket had been issued through a travel agency in Boca Raton, Fla.,
400 miles from Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix said Baines told him her father travels frequently and
had recommended she use the Boca Raton travel agency, Travel by
Squires.
</P>
<P>
   Records provided to Florida State by Travel by Squires included
a note, purportedly written by Steffer, indicating Baines had been
designated to pay for tickets that would be used by Coles, Warrick,
Dugans and Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendra Baines _ send money by Tuesday,'' the note read. ``OK
to (ticket) Warrick, Coles, Dugans, Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State held Coles out of the Louisiana Tech game Aug. 28
as a precautionary measure and ruled him ineligible Sept. 9, seven
days after FSU police and state investigators had questioned
Steffer under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's report to the NCAA, prepared by Minnix and made
available to the Chronicle by the university, noted Steffer's
testimony linking Knox to Coles' ticket but made no mention of
Warrick or Dugans being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Steffer declined to be interviewed for this article, but sources
provided the Chronicle with details of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Steffer told investigators she had handled the PSP account for
about two months when the company provided her with a list of
clients who would require airline tickets to attend the party in
Houston. About the same time, she told investigators, Knox gave her
the names of Warrick, Coles, Dugans and Vegas and asked that she
book flights to Houston for them as well.
</P>
<P>
   The group was booked on a flight that left Tallahassee at 10:10
a.m. July 8, she told investigators, and their tickets were charged
to her account at the travel agency and issued electronically.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the group was to depart, Steffer told investigators,
she was asked by a PSP secretary to shift Warrick, Dugans and Vegas
to a different flight because the 10:10 a.m. flight conflicted with
their workout schedule. After making the change, she testified, she
received a call from a Delta employee in Tallahassee demanding to
know who had paid for the players' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Steffer said she told the Delta employee she could not give out
information regarding a customer's method of payment. She said she
then informed Knox of the call. Knox initially did not seem
concerned, she testified, but he called back and directed her to
void the three remaining tickets.
</P>
<P>
   When Minnix and others at Florida State began seeking
information, she told investigators, Knox instructed her to say the
tickets had been purchased by Baines. According to Steffer's
testimony, she went so far as to prepare handwritten notes to make
it appear Baines had been responsible for the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Steffer told investigators she was willing to cover for Knox
initially because she felt an obligation to help a client, but she
was not going to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix said the FSU police and state investigators had sought to
subpoena Baines' testimony but had encountered difficulty in doing
so because of resistance from Georgia authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Handley, the FSU police spokesman, declined comment on that
issue, citing his policy about discussing open investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the Chronicle to contact Baines through her father,
Ken Baines, were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Baines said he was not aware his daughter had invited a
Florida State football player to visit her during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is a customer of Travel by Squires in Boca Raton,
Fla., he shook his head and said he rarely travels and never uses a
travel agency when he does.

 GENENTECH RIDES MOMENTUM OF ITS HIGH-FLYING STOCK INTO 2000  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street seems bent on sending Genentech Inc. into the new
year in style. Shares in the South San Francisco biotech giant
gained another $11.38 Friday (December 17) to close at a dizzying
$125.06.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock has soared 158 percent since it returned to the stock
market in July, after its Swiss parent firm, Roche Holdings, spun
off part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's momentum is all the more remarkable because Genentech
has taken some lumps along the way. It fought, nearly lost and
finally settled a nasty patent dispute by paying the University of
California $200 million, which should just about wipe out this
year's profit.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street has shrugged that off, to focus instead on the
products set to emerge from Genentech's drug discovery pipeline.
Next year, Genentech expects to launch a version of its Nutropin
growth hormone drug that can be injected once or twice a month
rather than daily.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech also expects Food and Drug Administration approval in
2000 to sell an improved version of its clot-busting drug.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's (December 17) stock surge occurred after Genentech
announced its intent to seek FDA approval for a new asthma remedy,
based on phase III clinical data that will remain partly secret
until the study results are presented to a scientific panel in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The market infatuation with Genentech may have gotten a bit
ahead of itself. FDA approval can never be taken for granted, and
the agency is likely to take an especially long look at Genentech's
proposed drug, which takes an entirely different approach than
previous asthma and hay fever remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Genentech hopes to inject asthma and hay fever
sufferers with antibodies that would inactivate IGE, the chemical
that causes a range of asthma and hay fever symptoms. Other
remedies merely treat the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But investors seem to have discounted the risk of FDA rejection
and focused instead on the potential size of the market, should the
asthma drug win approval. Franklin Berger, senior analyst with J.P.
Morgan Securities, estimates Genentech, which is marketing the drug
in partnership with Novartis, is looking at a $750 million-a-year
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech is not the only biotech stock to find favor on Wall
Street of late. Since early November, when the AMEX biotech stock
index stood at 260, this basket of 15 biotech issues has risen 19
percent to 308.11.
</P>
<P>
   But Genentech has enjoyed a sharper, stronger climb than its
AMEX index brethren, who have had to carry Amgen, the Southern
California biotech giant, which slid 10 percent while the rest of
big biotech was rising.
</P>
<P>
   Unwelcome surprises may still lurk out there for Genentech. The
company is developing its time-release Nutropin in conjunction with
Alkermes in Massachusetts. In September, analysts from Merrill
Lynch questioned whether the Alkermes version would be as big a hit
as is generally expected by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Such naysaying aside, the outlook at Genentech's South San
Francisco headquarters currently seems so rosy, management plans to
shut down between Christmas and New Year's, and give everyone a
paid holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Folks, there may need the break. When the New Year rolls around,
and people stroll back in the doors, their biggest challenge may be
figuring out how to top 1999.
</P>
<P>
   WORK IN PROGRESS: Jamie Court, with Consumers for Quality Care
in Santa Monica, Calif., is one activist health maintenance
organization executives love to hate. After years of gathering HMO
horror stories, Court recently assembled his best (or worst?) cases
into a book, ``Making a Killing: HMOs and the Threat to Your
Health.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content to see his charges in print, Court will open a new
front in his assault on stingy health insurers this week.
</P>
<P>
   With the consent of his publisher, Common Courage Press of
Maine, Court has posted his book on the Web at
www.makingakilling.org.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to letting people read other consumers' complaints,
the site will let visitors add their own tales to Court's growing
database.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site will allow readers to create a living history of HMO
abuses,'' he said _ and doubtless provide him more ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   PRESERVATIONISTS? Okay, so I was sucked in by the e-mail that
directed me to &LR;   &LR; www.SaveYourGenes.com, a Web site in Stockton that
sells $13 kits that allow you to save a copy of your genetic
material.
</P>
<P>
   The kit consists of a stoppered test tube, a label and a wooden
case. To save your DNA for posterity, simply toss a dozen strands
of hair or a few nail clippings into the test tube and insert the
plug.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site even offers several rationales for putting a copy
of your genes into a safety deposit box, suggesting that in case of
a kidnapping or other crime, or even in the diagnosis of a genetic
disease, a clean sample of DNA would come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might accomplish the same purpose at no cost, by
throwing a lock of hair into an envelope, sealing it, and writing a
name on the outside. But then, the Web site points out, you'll miss
out on the smudge-proof label and attractive wooden box.

JETS DAMAGE COWBOYS' PLAYOFF HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ On a day when one-third of their points came on
a fake field-goal play, the Cowboys saved their best work for after
the game when they kicked themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They kicked themselves clean across Texas Stadium, down the
tunnel, through the locker room and out the door, which may be
where their playoff chances have gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys blew a fourth-quarter lead and lost to the New York
Jets, 22-21, yesterday at Texas Stadium. In the process, the
Cowboys managed to suffer their first home loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And the operative word here is suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Because now, even if the 7-7 Cowboys can win their remaining two
games at New Orleans on Friday and against the New York Giants on
Jan. 2, they will still need help to get into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, ``was as meaningful a
loss as far as what it did to our playoff chances as any time in my
11 years. We had a great opportunity today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew it when we walked onto the field, because
Washington, New York \RGiants\S and Detroit all had lost ... and we
knew that if we could get a win, we'd probably get a home-field
playoff game. That's why this was so very disapppointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, trailing 21-19, drove 41 yards in 11 plays to set up
the game-winning field goal by John Hall _ his third of the game _
from 37 yards with 1:35 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys got the ball with one last-gasp chance to
salvage the day, Troy Aikman hit Rocket Ismail for 23 yards to the
Dallas 39, then misfired four times in a row as the Cowboys lost
their first home game since the playoff-elimination loss to Arizona
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't seize the situation,'' said Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey, trying to find the right adjectives to describe his
feelings and coming up with ``hurt ... upset ... mad,'' to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys actually would have moved back into first place in
the NFC East with a win, technically tied with Washington but
holding an edge in the tiebreaker because of head-to-head
competition (2-0) with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   All this is what the Cowboys could have accomplished by beating
the already playoff-eliminated Jets yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Blew a second-half lead of 21-13 after Rocket Ismail's 27-yard
touchdown run on a reverse with 11:18 left in the third quarter.
Ismail, the Cowboys' leading receiver this season, actually wound
up with twice as many carries (two) as receptions (one) yesterday.
His lone catch came on the Cowboys' final drive as the Jets very
effectively rolled a safety to Ismail's side to shut him down for
most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Turned the ball over twice in a span of approximately 7 1/2
minutes in the second half. Both were the result of Troy Aikman
interceptions. The first was Aikman's first in 217 pass attempts
dating to Oct. 18 at Giants Stadium. Then he went one pass attempt
in a row before he was picked off again.
</P>
<P>
   Squandered an early fourth-quarter drive to the Jets' 20 after a
Ray Lucas fumble from the shotgun, when he wasn't ready to receive
Jets center Kevin Mawae's long snap. Cowboys defensive end Kavika
Pittman recovered the loose ball at the New York 36. Four plays and
a penalty later, Aikman lofted a pass to Deion Sanders at the goal
line and it was intercepted by Jets safety Victor Green.
</P>
<P>
   Had four penalties for 35 yards in the pivotal fourth quarter.
For the game, the Cowboys drew eight flags for 92 yards, adding to
their NFL lead in penalties and penalty yardage. Twice in the
fourth quarter, penalties came on punt returns that both times
pinned the Cowboys back inside their own 20.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he can do about the penalties that have dogged
his team all season, Gailey replied, ``You can talk to the players
about them. You can get on them about them. You can't fine them _
it's illegal. So, the best thing is to look at it real closely in
the off-season and evaluate what you have to do so that you don't
have \Rpenalties\S next year. And, meanwhile, try to eliminate them
the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman passed for 242 yards on 40 attempts against Philadelphia
last week. This week, he threw for only 158 yards, completing only
12 of 28 passes _ and five of those were to running backs Emmitt
Smith (team-high three catches for 36 yards and a touchdown) and
Chris Warren (two catches for six yards).
</P>
<P>
   With 110 yards on 19 carries, Smith posted his seventh 100-yard
rushing game of the season, and his fourth since breaking his right
hand Nov. 8 at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine we're 7-7 and can still be a playoff
team,'' Aikman said. ``I think we're trying to do what we can to
win games. We're trying to play to what we feel are our strengths,
which are defense, special teams and the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before penalties and turnovers led to the Cowboys' demise in the
second half, Smith turned a simple swing pass into a 14-yard
touchdown in the first quarter, marking his 146th career touchdown
and moving him ahead of Marcus Allen for second place on the NFL's
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Cowboys holder Eric Bjornson turned what
appeared would-be a 37-yard field-goal attempt by Eddie Murray into
a 20-yard touchdown run on the fake.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Cowboys were doing things right.
</P>
<P>
   But they obviously couldn't stand the prosperity.

 PACIFIC BELL EXPANDING DSL AREA  &HT;     By PETER KUPFER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In recent months Pacific Bell and other local
telephone companies have launched aggressive marketing campaigns
for DSL, the broadband technology that transforms ordinary phone
lines into lightning-fast conduits to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But DSL, or digital subscriber line, is out of reach for
millions of Californians in rural and even some suburban
communities because the technology is distance limited. If you
happen to live or work more than 3-1/2 miles from a phone company
central switching office, you are basically out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. SBC Communications, the Texas-based
parent of Pac Bell, recently announced plans to invest $6 billion
in a program to extend the reach of its DSL service and provide
even faster connection speeds throughout its network. By the time
Project Pronto is completed in three years, Pac Bell says, more
than 80 percent of its customers in California will have access to
DSL, compared with about 50 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In the densely populated Bay Area, DSL is currently available to
more than half of Pac Bell's customers, or about 1.9 million homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still large patches of the San Francisco region _
including sections of Richmond, Berkeley, Hayward, Fremont, Walnut
Creek and Danville _ that are beyond the 3-1/2-mile range of the
technology. Once Project Pronto is completed, Pac Bell says, nearly
everyone in the Bay Area will have access to DSL.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that is enabling Pac Bell and other phone
companies to extend the range of DSL service is a device called a
digital loop carrier. DLCs are essentially mini-switching centers
that compress the signals from hundreds of copper phone lines into
a single fiber-optic pipeline that runs back to the central office.
</P>
<P>
   Although digital loop carriers have been around for years, they
were originally designed only to provide regular phone service to
outlying areas. So the equipment had to be redesigned to handle the
large chunks of data that are forced over the phone lines by DSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology smashes the distance barrier of DSL. It will
allow a whole new universe of customers to have access,'' said a
spokesman for Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment
giant whose Petaluma division is the world's largest manufacturer
of second-generation digital loop carriers and a primary supplier
for Project Pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials say they expect to begin deploying the new
equipment, called neighborhood gateways, by the end of the year,
but they have not yet determined which communities will be first to
receive them.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, residents of communities that are not served by
DSL can, in some cases, obtain high-speed Internet access through
their cable lines. But high-speed cable service provided by
companies such as ExciteAtHome, though more widely available than
DSL, is still not offered in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to extending the reach of DSL, Project Pronto is
also designed to ramp up the connection speeds throughout Pac
Bell's DSL network.
</P>
<P>
   DSL customers are now guaranteed speeds of 384 kilobits a second
for $39 a month ($49 with unlimited access to Pac Bell's own
Internet service). Depending on the distance to the central office
and the condition of the phone lines, customers can get speeds as
fast as 1.5 megabits _ 50 times the speed of a standard 28.8
kilobit dial-up modem and equivalent to the speeds provided by
costly T-1 lines used by many large businesses. Pac Bell's premium
DSL service, which costs $129 a month, guarantees speeds of 1.5
megabits and can provide speeds as high as 6.0 megabits.
</P>
<P>
   Once Project Pronto is completed, Pac Bell says all of its DSL
customers will be guaranteed speeds of 1.5 megabits, and 60 percent
will get speeds of 6.0. Premium customers will be guaranteed 6.0.
</P>
<P>
   The faster connection speeds will enable home computer users to
take advantage of a host of functions that are not available or not
practical at the slower speeds provided by standard modems, such as
video-conferencing, downloading huge audio files and video clips,
and distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest among telecommuters and families
looking for multiple applications,'' said Shawn Dainas, a spokesman
for Pac Bell. Demand for DSL is especially high among college
students, he said, because they depend on the Internet for research
and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pac Bell and other SBC subsidiaries began their DSL
marketing push this summer, the number of customers subscribing to
the service has nearly tripled to more than 100,000, most of them
in California. But that's still a small percentage of the 6 million
Pac Bell customers who currently have access to DSL in the state.
</P>
<P>
   SBC expects to have 200,000 customers signed up for DSL by the
end of the year, and 1 million by the end of 2000, with the
majority of these being in California.
</P>
<P>
   As competition to provide high-speed Internet access heats up
between local phone companies like Pac Bell and cable operators
like AT&AMP;T, most analysts expect the cost of both services will
decline.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ruling by the Federal Communications Commission
requiring Pac Bell and other local phone companies to share their
lines with competing DSL providers is also expected to lead to
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that stand to gain from that ruling are
Northpoint Communications of San Francisco and Covad Communications
of Santa Clara, Calif., both of which specialize in providing DSL
service to businesses but are now rapidly expanding into the
consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has clearly had an impact on Pac Bell's prices. When
it first offered DSL service on a wide-scale basis last May, Pac
Bell charged residential customers a $198 installation fee plus $89
a month for basic service. Pac Bell is now offering free
installation to some customers and has cut the price to $49 a
month, including ISP service.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Leutza, director of the telecommunications division of the
state Public Utilities Commission, said the PUC has received a
``stream of complaints'' from consumers about slow installation by
Pac Bell. But the PUC official said such complaints are not
surprising, considering the complexities of deploying an advanced
technology like DSL. ``You have to remember that this is not plain,
old telephone service,'' he noted. ``You have to send a technician
out to install a modem and connect the line.''

FANS KNEW COWBOYS' OFFENSE WAS GOING NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ So when the Cowboys took the field for the final
time yesterday, trailing the Jets 22-21 with 1:35 to play and
needing just a field goal to win, did anybody actually think they
could pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   The sight of fans streaming out of Texas Stadium before
quarterback Troy Aikman set himself behind center at the Cowboys'
16-yard line spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not about that bogus accusation that Aikman isn't a
comeback quarterback. He laid that to rest in the season opener
against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's lack of faith _ which was supported by the Cowboys'
woeful rally attempt of a teasing 23-yard completion followed by
four incompletions _ was not necessarily about Aikman. It was about
the Cowboys' disappointing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman did not have a good final series or a good game.
Completing 12 of 28 passes for 158 yards with one touchdown and two
interceptions confirms as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I would be able to get us in position to make an
attempt,'' Aikman said. ``I accept responsibility as a quarterback.
That's my job, and I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman also didn't get many opportunities; Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey called just 10 pass plays in the second half. Five came on
the last drive. The boos that rained down after the game were as
much for Gailey's play-calling as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Cowboys' offense _ save for the first
Redskins game and one or two others _ has been a disappointment all
season, even in many of their victories.
</P>
<P>
   Even running back Emmitt Smith wonders how it is that the
Cowboys can look ``so brilliant'' in some games _ like a 41-point
outing in the season opener in which they rallied to victory from a
21-point fourth-quarter deficit _ and so bad in others. Did we
already mention the pathetic final drive against Jets' 25th-ranked
pass defense?
</P>
<P>
   How is it that the Cowboys can execute so well at times, like
the 27-yard run for a touchdown by Raghib Ismail that capped an
81-yard drive to open the third quarter and give the Cowboys a
seemingly controlling 21-13 lead? And how is it they can do nothing
the rest of the way?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, whose two first-half touchdowns were a 14-yard pass
to Smith and a 20-yard run on a fake field-goal attempt by tight
end Eric Bjornson, ended the game with six pitiful drives,
including:
</P>
<P>
   Three plays and a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays and an interception, when Aikman tried to force the
ball into coverage to Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays and a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Five plays and another interception, when Aikman went for the
big play to a well-covered Deion Sanders. Aikman said he tried to
give Sanders a chance to make a play on the ball, which should be a
good thing to anyone who has complained about the Cowboys' throwing
the ball. The bad thing is that this gamble cost the Cowboys when
they were in field-goal range, which might have been the difference
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Six plays and a punt. The drive was lowlighted by a tripping
penalty on center Mark Stepnoski, which forced the Cowboys to punt
from near their own end zone, setting the Jets up with good field
position for a game-winning field-goal drive.
</P>
<P>
   Five plays, game over.
</P>
<P>
   You want reasons for such lack of success? The Cowboys have
them: untimely penalties, turnovers, poor execution and injuries
that have robbed them of experienced players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had too many critical errors that we were not able to
overcome,'' Gailey said. ``We didn't execute when we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   They also have frustrations, said Aikman, who specifically
points to the Cowboys' inability to convert on third downs as their
biggest problem. The Cowboys were 3-of-12 on third down yesterday
and are 65-of-195 for the season (33 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating year,'' Aikman said. ``We are just
trying to fight through it. It doesn't matter how you break it down
or what caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys don't have is answers to their problems, which
is the ultimate disappointment, considering that there two games
left in the season and they are still somehow in the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   But does anybody actually think they'll pull it off with this
offense? Defeat sours a milestone day for Emmitt
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a game goes by that Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith
doesn't surpass a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   That's just part of life when you are 10 years into one of the
greatest careers in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's haul of honors for Smith, who already owns all the
Cowboys' rushing records and is the third all-time leading rusher
in NFL history, included:
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a tie with Marcus Allen and moving into sole possession
of second place on the NFL's all-time touchdown list. Smith's
14-yard reception in the second quarter was his 146th career
touchdown. Jerry Rice holds the NFL record with 178 career
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming the Cowboys' all-time leading scorer. The touchdown
gave him 878 career points, surpassing Rafael Septien's former club
record of 874.
</P>
<P>
   Recording his seventh 100-yard rushing game of the season with
110 yards on 19 carries. It was also the 62nd of his career. The
Jets became the 20th different victim of his century-mark assault.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into eighth place on the NFL's all-time combined net
yardage, just ahead of former Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett.
Smith's 146 combined yards yesterday gives him 16,437 for his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has long stated that he is driven by winning and not
personal achievements, was true to form after yesterday's
devastating 22-21 loss to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything,'' Smith said. ``It doesn't mean
anything when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as notable as his accomplishments was that fact that
Smith even played. He missed almost all of last week's game against
the Eagles with a strained groin and practiced only one day during
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said they worked to loosen the injury before the game, and
he rode a stationary bike during the game to stay loose.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the injury wasn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem Smith had was losing.
\Nsubheds:Inside the Locker Room
So, was Michael Irvin's presence on ESPN's ``NFL Game Day''
yesterday a cameo or an audition? The Cowboys' all-time leading
receiver, who is sidelined for the season with an injured spine,
didn't reveal his future plans during the two-hour television
stint. He said he and owner Jerry Jones will sit down after the
season and make a decision on whether he's going to retire or
continue his career.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Irvin, 33, wants to play. The question
is whether he can convince his wife, Sandi, along with Jones and
the Cowboys doctors, to give him their blessing and, of course, at
what price. Speaking of money, Irvin said he's also rooting for the
Cowboys to get to playoffs and go as far as they can because he
gets a full playoff share. As far as Irvin's skills as an analyst,
let's just say he's already better than Sterling Sharpe. He was
funny. He gave insight and he wasn't afraid to flaunt his Super
Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the Cowboys' running backs and running out of
bounds on pass receptions short of the first down? Chris Warren did
it and cost the Cowboys a score in the loss to the Cardinals four
weeks ago. Emmitt Smith ran out of bounds short of the first down
and cost the Cowboys a chance at points at the end of the first
half yesterday. Smith said he didn't think he could run over two
defenders. His coaches thought otherwise, as he said he was cursed
out for the play.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Deion Sanders-Keyshawn Johnson showdown. Johnson
had a great day, catching six passes for 96 yards. However, none
came when he was locked against Sanders one-on-one. The matchup
occurred 16 times. The Jets didn't attempt one pass in Johnson's
direction when Sanders was covering him. In fact, the Jets called a
running play 12 times when the two were hooked up. Sanders wasn't
surprised, saying, ``Common sense goes a long way.'' Johnson did
most of his damage in slot against reserve cornerbacks and against
safeties in the Cowboy zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jets running back Curtis Martin's 113-yard day was the first
time in seven games that an opposing running back had topped the
century mark against the Cowboys' defense. Martin was most
successful when the Jets spread the Cowboys out with three wide
receivers. The Cowboys were forced to take a linebacker out of the
game for an extra defensive back, and then the Jets would gash them
with Martin on draws. Later in the game, Martin had success on
pitch plays around the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys certainly missed defensive end Greg Ellis, who is
out for the season with a broken leg. Leon Lett moved from tackle
to end and was not a factor. The move also weakened the Cowboys'
tackle rotation of Lett, Alonzo Spellman and Chad Hennings. The end
result was a less effective run defense and a nonexistent pass
rush. Inexperienced Jets quarterback Ray Lucas was not sacked in
the game.
\Nsubheds:Up Next at New Orleans, 2:05 p.m. Friday, KDFW/Ch. 4
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (7-7) travel to New Orleans for a Christmas Eve
battle against the woeful Saints (2-12). What a gift. Not only will
the Cowboys be looking to keep their dimming playoff hopes alive,
but they will also be seeking some Bayou revenge, considering the
humiliating loss against the Saints last season. By the way, the
Cowboys have lost six in a row on the road.

COWBOYS' MIGHT IS JUST A MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Final proof has come. Let there be no more
debate, and no more cross-examination of the witnesses. Clear the
courtroom. Dismiss the jury. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys are guilty as charged, and as of Sunday have
been convicted of heartless, gutless, and disgraceful football
behavior. They are hereby sentenced to join the San Francisco 49ers
in that NFL hell-hole known as Memory Land.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped on one side by the salary cap, and the other side by
overpriced and fading former superstars, there is no known escape
from Memory Land.
</P>
<P>
   Falling from the top to the bottom in one decade is a long way
down. Getting back up again is a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys lost, 22-21, to the New York Jets here Sunday,
it wasn't, of course, exactly the first hint that the end of a
once-great dynasty had arrived. The obvious has been obvious for
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't about Jets backfield coach Maurice Carthon giving
receiver Keyshawn Johnson a playful shove on the way to the
victorious locker room, then telling him, ``I told you so _ they
are all hype.''
</P>
<P>
   In Memory Land, the Cowboys won't be subjected to such verbal
abuse. Time was, they were a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it all came down Sunday to Jets' head coach Bill Parcells'
postgame answer of ``If you like football and you like competition,
you're ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was replying to why his team, far out of the playoff
hunt, had displayed more gumption over 60 minutes than the Cowboys.
The answer is not pretty for the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff, the Cowboys had been rewarded with
divisional riches. The Redskins had lost. The Giants had lost. By
continuing their seasonlong homefield dominance, the Cowboys would
control the NFC East. They already knew the playoffs were assured
by winning out in the final three games, but the early news Sunday
provided even more incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, the competitive juices didn't flow. Or at least
the flow didn't equal that of the Jets. And that tells you
everything you didn't want to know about the demise of the Cowboys.
Now known as the official demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to believe we're better than this, but maybe we're
not,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said of the 7-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   What's this ``maybe'' stuff? They're not. Period. And you could
see that coming weeks ago with those back-to-back losses to the
Eagles and Giants in October. Homefield flashes delayed the
inevitable, until the Jets ended the charade.
</P>
<P>
   When a team with nothing to play for is more competitive than a
team that has had a division handed to it _ even a very weak
division _ then there's nothing else to discuss. Memory Land, here
come the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   They lost Sunday because Aikman threw two senseless second-half
interceptions, the second one eliminating at least a field-goal
opportunity. Seeing Deion Sanders one-on-one at receiver, yet
well-covered, Aikman tried the jump ball gamble in the end zone. It
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way I expected that ball to be intercepted,''
Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me caught up in that mess,'' said Sanders, typically
passing the blame to someone else. But in this case, he's right.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost Sunday because the defense, even as heralded as
it has been, could not make a game-saving stop when necessary. And
didn't again Sunday on the final Jets' drive to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was also beaten by a gutty backup quarterback, Ray
Lucas, and by an offensive line that has two rookies starting.
Curtis Martin went for 113 yards rushing, helping the Lucas case.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys went ahead 21-13 early in the second half, the
defense caved immediately as Lucas brought the Jets right back on a
touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (six catches, 96 yards) was very good, as expected.
Wayne Chrebet, however, was even a bigger factor at receiver (eight
catches, 108 yards.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost because coverage and penalties on special teams
was not acceptable. But as always, penalties (six for 92 yards)
were an overall killer.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the Cowboys lost this one because the offense
was not up to NFL standards. The Cowboys scored the three
touchdowns on a fake field goal, an end-around, and the dreaded
dinkeroo pass to the flat.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the 110 yards rushing by Emmitt Smith, if you
can't throw the ball effectively, there will be no win. Or if you
don't commit to the pass, you also don't win. Chan Gailey called
five pass plays in the second half until the last fruitless series
once the Jets had the lead.
</P>
<P>
   None of these negatives are new _ not the passing game, the
penalties, the defense, the Gailey offensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, they all hit home with an embarrassing thud. Sunday
was the worst of the season for all the obvious reasons. And now
the final sentence has come. The Cowboys will be locked away
forever in Memory Land. nn

EVEN PARCELLS HAS PRAISE FOR LUCAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Much of the talk in the New York Jets' locker
room after their 22-21 victory against the Cowboys yesterday evoked
the continuing improvement of quarterback Ray Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't mistake-free in his sixth consecutive start and
seventh of the season, but the third-year quarterback from Rutgers
kept his poise in leading the Jets on a clock-killing 11-play,
41-yard drive to set up John Hall's 37-yard game-winning field goal
with 1:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little less than perfect, but he's been good enough
to put him over the top as a starter,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' teammates were more liberal with their praise on a day
when he notched his third consecutive 200-yard passing game and
outplayed his counterpart, veteran Troy Aikman. Lucas completed 20
of 34 passes for 229 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``To drive us down the field like that shows what kind of player
he is. He wants to win,'' said receiver Wayne Chrebet, the
recipient of eight passes for 108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he continues to play like that, I don't see why he can't be
Vinny's \RTestaverde\S backup,'' said Keyshawn Johnson, who had six
catches for 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is now 4-3 as the Jets' starter and has helped them win
five of their past seven games. On the game-winning drive, running
back Curtis Martin carried most of the load, rushing nine times for
43 of his game-high 113 yards. Lucas completed his one pass attempt
for eight yards, good for a first down to the Dallas 37. The drive
forced the Cowboys to burn all three of their timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates believe in me, and they let me know it, too,''
Lucas said. ``I looked at their faces and knew we were going to win
the game.''
Keyshawn downplays matchup Keyshawn Johnson, as unusual as it might
sound, had little to say about his day against Deion Sanders,
primarily because the two did not go one-on-one for much of the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a matchup, it's just two players trying to
help their teams win,'' Johnson said. ``It was fun. I had the
opportunity to play against him and run around a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, came up big with six receptions for an average
of 16 yards per catch. His 14-yard reception in the middle of the
field on the first drive of the second half landed the Jets at the
Cowboys' 9-yard line and set up Lucas' second touchdown pass to cut
the Cowboys' lead to 21-19. Stoutmire returns Former Cowboys safety
Omar Stoutmire, cut by the Cowboys during training camp, returned
to Texas Stadium and intercepted Troy Aikman with 4:32 left in the
third quarter, a time when the Cowboys had excellent field position
and were working on a 21-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys faced second-and-six at their 46 when Aikman's pass
split double coverage and bounced off Eric Bjornson's chest and
fell into Stoutmire's hands. He returned it 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold any grudges against them,'' Stoutmire said. ``Any
time you can come up with a pick against a guy like Aikman it feels
good.'' Glenn stalls Rocket Former Texas A&AMP;M defensive back and
Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn broke up a first-down pass from Aikman
to Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail at the Jets' 48-yard line on the
Cowboys' final drive.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Ismail was open and had room to make the catch, but
Glenn made a late read and knocked the ball down from behind
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the play coming,'' said Glenn, who attended Aldine
Nimitz High School.] The defensive line ``put pressure on the
quarterback, and I just reacted.''

MODANO ADDS CAPTAINCY TO ALREADY HEAVY DUTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ A couple of ounces, if that, of additional
weight were added when trainers sewed ``the'' ``C'' onto Mike
Modano's jersey before Saturday's game against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Only, ``the'' ``C'' brings a weight that few can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher had been shouldering all
the responsibilities that come with being the captain of the
defending Stanley Cup champions until a lacerated calf muscle on
Friday sidelined him for six to eight weeks. Now comes Modano's
turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it motivates you,'' Modano said. ``It gives you some
responsibility to come to play every night. And now, you're going
to be a little more under the magnifying glass and people watch and
see how you respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Modano has been playing under such scrutiny all
season.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, Modano hasn't had his best season. He'll be
the first one to tell you that. He, of course, has heard the
criticism that comes with failing to live up to the expectations
that stalk big-name players. The Stars' early-season struggles
became linked with his own.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is, as Modano goes, the team goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has been that way,'' Modano said ruefully. ``It's
the part that kind of eats me apart inside. I've been one not to be
vocal about that over the years. It's just something that has
festered, and it just eats you away. It makes the game unhappy and
tough to come to play knowing that it feels like you have more
doubters than believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the case since Day One that I've been here. But
it's been a tough thing to shake. They figure as I go personally,
the team goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any better evidence for people sharing that opinion
than Saturday night?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were reeling, playing their second game in as many
nights and their first game without their best player in Hatcher
and their hottest hand in Joe Nieuwendyk. Two of the players who
had help to lead them through their first spate of injuries were
now among the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Who would lead them now?
</P>
<P>
   Modano answered with a solid two-way game, scoring two of
Dallas' four goals and assisting on the others. He played almost 24
minutes _ six more than any other Stars forward _ in a 4-2 victory
that brought the Stars to 8-3-1 in their past 11 games and helped
erase some of the doubts that losing a player such as Hatcher
creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Mike Modano that played (against Vancouver) was the
Modano that we need to play every game,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``He wasn't just a good player because he scored. He was a
good player because he impacted every area of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano hasn't been that player for a lot of this season. He'll
tell you that, too. A season that began with talk of 100 points
instead has become an exercise in frustration. He had 22 points in
30 games before Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, along with linemate Brett Hull, will tell you that
Modano didn't do anything Saturday night that he hadn't been doing
all season. It wasn't a case of ``Hatcher's gone, I better start
producing.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Modano has been playing that way all season.
</P>
<P>
   He just finally had some points to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, people try to read so much into Mike,'' Hull said. ``He
plays the same every night. He plays hard, and he tries to do
everything that he's supposed to do. Some nights, it goes in.
Sometimes, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need more of the former now.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup that was designed to blend in a few younger players at
the beginning of the season is now littered with them. A defense
that was supposed to replace only one starter from last season now
has to replace three. A team that had a captain it could always
look to when things got bad is suddenly in need of one.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he considered both Modano and Nieuwendyk, but the
injury to Nieuwendyk made the decision for him. There are few
candidates better than Modano, a 24-minute forward with
game-changing ability. He's a scorer, a passer and a strong
defensive presence all in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a stage right now, where just on roster along, he has
to lead,'' Hitchcock said. ``Right now, I'm hopeful Mike takes the
ball and runs with it and carries other people with him.'' nn

COWBOYS NEED HELP FOR PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ On the heels of their 22-21 loss to the New York
Jets yesterday, the Cowboys know only this about their playoff
hopes: They can win out and still lose out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (7-7) could defeat the Saints in New Orleans on
Friday afternoon and the New York Giants at Texas Stadium on Jan. 2
and still not receive an invitation to the NFL's postseason party.
</P>
<P>
   Nine might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're slim,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said of his
team's playoff hopes. ``At best we're going to get nine wins, and
that's probably going to get into a lot of tie-breaking situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to play better. I don't see how we can be too
disappointed right today about the playoffs when we don't play
better than we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff of their game, the Cowboys knew the
Washington Redskins (8-6) and the New York Giants (7-7) both had
lost. With victories against the Jets and the Saints, combined with
a Washington loss at San Francisco next week, the Cowboys would
have clinched a seventh NFC East title in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys need help to win the division. The Cowboys,
who hold the tiebreaker against the Redskins by sweeping the season
series, need to win their last two games and have Washington lose
once.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, victories in their last two games won't assure the
Cowboys of even a ninth playoff berth in 10 seasons. If the
Redskins win their final two games, the Cowboys will be left to vie
for one of the three NFC wild-card berths. Besides the three
division winners, five NFC teams can reach nine victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we had to do going into the game, and we just
didn't get it done,'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders said.
``We're going to need help now. We're going to have to sit back and
pray for a loss for one of those other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no mulligans in the NFL. No provisionals either. Not
even five Super Bowl rings will buy the Cowboys a free pass into
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real opportunity. We let it go,'' Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said. ``We've dug ourselves a hole. Right now, we're
7-7. It's hard to imagine being 7-7 and thinking you can still be a
playoff team, but we still could be. So until they sit there and
tell us the season is over and we don't get to play any more games,
we're going to keep going out there and giving it our best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' next shot comes in New Orleans, where they lost
22-3 last December. They also haven't won on the road since the
season-opening victory at Washington and in their past two road
games the Cowboys have scored a total of 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very frustrating,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith
said. ``Here we are again after seven losses saying what we could
do and how good we can be. Eventually that's got to stop. That has
to cease. Who are we kidding? In order to be better, you've got to
do better.''

DISCOVERY CREW ON ITS WAY TO REPAIR HUBBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The shuttle Discovery rocketed into space
late Sunday with seven astronauts on a much-delayed mission to
repair the high-flying Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery thundered from its coastal launch pad at NASA's
Kennedy Space Center at 7:50 p.m. EST. The shuttle climbed steeply
into a darkened sky on an easterly trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Discovery settled into a 364-mile-high orbit,
completing the first leg of its Christmas mission to replace
faltering gyroscopes aboard the $4 billion telescope. The
observatory sailed over Africa as Discovery lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   Originally targeted for a mid-October liftoff, Discovery's
launch had been rescheduled a record nine times by equipment
problems and bad weather. NASA considered Sunday night the final
opportunity to lift off this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send a note to the Hubble to get ready because we are on our
way,'' Discovery commander Curt Brown radioed ground controllers as
the final minutes of Sunday's trouble-free countdown ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the launch, managers agreed to trim the mission
from its original 10 days to eight and the number of spacewalks
from four to three in order to satisfy NASA's Y2K computer
constraints. Discovery is scheduled to land Dec. 27. But if there
are landing delays because of poor weather, the space agency wants
the shuttle crew back on Earth no later than Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule enables NASA to re-set mission and launch control
computers before New Year's Eve. Though it has prepared Discovery
and its ground facilities to be Y2K compliant, NASA established the
Dec. 29 deadline as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's crew includes pilot Scott Kelly and Jean Francois
Clervoy of the European Space Agency, the flight engineer and robot
arm operator. Accompanying the flight crew is a four-man spacewalk
repair team, Steve Smith, Mike Foale, John Grunsfeld and European
Space Agency astronaut Claude Nicollier.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of carefully timed orbital maneuvers, Discovery
should overtake the space telescope Tuesday. Using Discovery's
50-foot-long robot arm, Clervoy will snare the 12.5-ton Hubble
shortly before 8 p.m. EST as the spacecraft fly in close formation.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the shuttle's grasp, the 42-foot-long space telescope
will be latched upright onto a rotating work platform in the aft
section of Discovery's open cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld plan to kick off the first of the mission's
lengthy spacewalks Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   During the first excursion, the men plan to replace all six of
the Hubble's gyroscopes, the $400 million mission's highest
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Celestial observations with the space telescope ceased Nov. 13,
when a fourth gyro malfunctioned. Without at least three of the
high-revving devices, the telescope cannot lock on to stellar
objects with precision as it races around the Earth once every 97
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With a successful gyro installation, NASA would consider
Discovery's flight at least a minimal success if the other
spacewalks had to be canceled. With the installation of the new
gyros, the space telescope could resume stellar observations in
January, said NASA's Dave Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, once the gyro task is complete, Smith and
Grunsfeld plan to install voltage meters on each of the
observatory's six batteries. The cell phone-sized devices are
intended to prolong the life of the 9-year-old batteries by keeping
them from overheating as they age. The batteries are continually
discharged by the telescope's instruments and re-charged by its
power-generating solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
   During the second spacewalk Thursday, Foale and Nicollier will
team to replace the telescope's flight computer. The newer computer
has six times the memory and is capable of processing data 20 times
faster than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The two astronauts are also prepared to replace one of the
telescope's three fine guidance sensors, an optical instrument
about the size of a baby grand piano. Like the gyros, the
telescope's three fine guidance sensors are crucial to the accuracy
of Hubble's precision pointing system.
</P>
<P>
   With the first two spacewalks completed, NASA would consider
Discovery's flight a full success. However, the spacewalkers plan
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   During the third spacewalk, Smith and Grunsfeld will install a
new data recorder and transmitter, devices that enable the
telescope to send the imagery it gathers from orbit to ground-based
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   The faster, solid-state recorder with more memory will replace
an older, less reliable model. One of the telescope's two
transmitters has failed, and installation of the new one will
supply a backup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith and Grunsfeld plan to begin patching the
telescope's external insulation. The original material has
deteriorated faster than NASA anticipated from its exposure to
solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Also during that final spacewalk, the two men plan to fasten
3-by-5-foot stainless steel plates over six instrument bays on the
telescope to protect the equipment within from temperature extremes
that range from 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit and 300 degrees
above zero.
</P>
<P>
   During the canceled fourth spacewalk, Foale and Nicollier had
planned to continue the external repairs, a task the astronauts may
try to work into the earlier excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble was launched in 1990, and designed for periodic visits by
spacewalking shuttle crews for repairs and the installation of new
science instruments. The successful strategy recently enabled NASA
to extend its plans to operate the observatory from 2005 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   On their first service call six years ago, shuttle astronauts
corrected an optical flaw that escaped NASA's attention before the
Hubble was launched. The work enabled the space telescope to emerge
as one of the premier astronomical observatories in the world,
allowing astronomers to confirm the existence of massive black
holes and refine their estimates for the age of the universe to
about 12 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   During the shuttle's second visit to the telescope in 1997,
astronauts installed two new cameras.
</P>
<P>
   NASA announced plans for Discovery's flight in March in response
to the telescope's third gyro failure.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a mid-October launching were disrupted in late July
when the shuttle Columbia experienced an electrical short moments
after liftoff with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Once the short
was traced to frayed insulation of electrical wiring in Columbia's
fuselage, shuttle managers suspended future missions so the wiring
on Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis could be inspected and
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Though first to emerge from the wiring repairs, Discovery then
experienced a succession of other equipment problems that caused
delays. Rainy weather forced NASA to postpone launch opportunities
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble visit joins a select few human spaceflights conducted
by NASA over Christmas. Those include the Apollo 8 moon mission of
1968, a 1973 mission aboard NASA's Skylab space station and visits
to Russia's Mir space station in 1996 and 1997 by American
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's is the third shuttle mission of 1999, the fewest
since 1988, which marked NASA's recovery from the fatal Challenger
accident of two years earlier. The extensive wiring problems forced
it to postpone two 1999 missions until next year.

TRICKERY WORKS FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TRACEY MYERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It all came down to timing, and when the Cowboys
attempted a little trickery, the timing couldn't have been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys set up for a 39-yard field goal in the second
quarter, but Eric Bjornson instead ran for a 20-yard touchdown off
a fake. Bjornson, the holder, waited until the moment was just
right before scampering down the right sideline to give the Cowboys
a 14-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be patient and let them really run on \Rtheir\S
right side,'' Bjornson said. ``It's real easy to get antsy and run
out of there too quick, and if you do that you're going to be
stopped for nothing. You just have to stay composed and we executed
well and it was a perfect situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in his career Bjornson had run for a
touchdown off a fake field goal. It also took some of the heat off
the Cowboys, who were booed loudly following a 1-yard run by Chris
Warren on a third-and-six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd worked on it,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
``\RSpecial teams coach\S Joe Avezzano's done a great job. He could
see we had an opportunity for that, and we had worked on that all
week.'' Making the rounds Wide receiver Chris Brazzell, who had
been picked up, cut and finally signed by the Cowboys, got to show
his former team what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Brazzell, who was cut by the New York Jets early this season,
caught two passes for 62 yards, including a 53-yard breakaway catch
in the second quarter. With the Jets focusing on Raghib Ismail,
Brazzell got some opportunities yesterday, his second game with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team doesn't think receivers are good enough then they
can double Rocket and force me and Jason Tucker and Jeff \ROgden\S
to make plays,'' Brazzell said. ``If teams don't think we can make
plays they'll double Rocket all day.'' Costly call The Cowboys have
had their penalty problems this year, and a big one came in the
second quarter. Kevin Smith was flagged for interfering with the
Jets' Dedric Ward, who couldn't come up with a 34-yard throw from
quarterback Ray Lucas. The penalty, which Smith argued, moved the
Jets from the Cowboys' 35-yard line to the 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any other way to play it,'' Smith said. ``The
rule is, if you look back for the ball and you're not impeding the
receiver, it's just as much my ball as it is his. Not to knock the
officiating, but I thought it was a decent play. If anything, no
flag should've been thrown.'' See Robert run Robert Thomas, who
switched from linebacker to fullback during training camp, got his
first rushing opportunities. Thomas, who became starting fullback
when the Cowboys released Tim Lester on Oct. 27, rushed four times
for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to make the best of the opportunities I get,''
Thomas said. ``Sometimes I did good, sometimes I didn't. But I was
100 percent, giving it all I got.'' Briefly When Troy Aikman threw
the first of two interceptions in the third quarter, it was the
first one he'd thrown in a club-record 216 pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's touchdown pass to Emmitt Smith in the second quarter
was his 154th, moving him to second behind Danny White, who has
155, on the Cowboys' all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was the first time since Oct. 24 Raghib Ismail has not
tied or led the team in receiving yards. He finished with one catch
for 23 yards but now has a career-high 70 receptions.

 WEB SITES PROVIDE A NEW WAY TO GIVE  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the Larkin Street Youth Center, where
runaways and other homeless kids turn for a safe bed and a warm
meal, a penny earned means a young person helped. But raising funds
is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a whole lot of money and time trying to raise money
for the work that we do,'' said Executive Director Anne Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, a Web site called iGive.com started sending
checks to the San Francisco emergency shelter, with no strings
attached. The money came from sales commissions on items bought at
iGive.com, one of the many ``charity malls'' that have emerged
online in the past year or so. Larkin Street Youth Center paid no
fees to get involved. Enough of the Web site's shoppers selected
the Larkin Street Youth Center as their beneficiary in the past
year to send about $1,000 to the shelter so far, in monthly checks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the center's regular fund raising, getting donations
through iGive is almost effortless, Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations and schools all over &LR;   &LR; the country are
embracing the emerging breed of for-profit Web sites like
iGive.com, which promise to help individuals benefit their favorite
groups by doing things they'd do online anyway, like shop and
browse the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the potential promises of the Internet is that it can
create a low-cost method of raising money,'' said Bennett Weiner,
the director of the Better Business Bureau's philanthropic arm. The
potential of these sites is especially exciting to small nonprofits
without the resources to advertise or set up their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, Weiner pointed out, the field is so new and developing so
quickly that regulators (usually state attorneys general) are
struggling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that is less regulated at the moment than
other charity areas,'' Weiner said. For now, the burden is on the
user to make sure a Web site is delivering on its promises, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling suburb's worth of shopping mall sites _ close to a
dozen _ send visitors to online stores in exchange for a sales
commission. The charity mall then splits the commission with the
buyer's chosen nonprofit. The nonprofit ends up getting from 0.5 to
30 percent of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping sites have been a big hit with schools; in fact, there
are several charity malls that specialize in schools and
school-related groups.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to labor-intensive alternatives such as bake sales and
car washes, charity malls seem like money for nothing, explained
Susan von Felten, principal of Daves Avenue School in Los Gatos,
Calif., a public elementary school that has participated in a
shopping site called Schoolpop since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the easiest way for schools to reach their
fund-raising goals,'' von Felten said. ``I basically do nothing,
and my teachers and parents do nothing; we just all shop there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daves Avenue School bought two printers with the $500 it has
received from Schoolpop so far.
</P>
<P>
   While charity malls are the dominant form of Internet fund
raising now, they may lose favor or even disappear as the field
evolves, said Mark Rovner, who heads the online division of
Cravers, Mathews, Smith and Co., an Arlington, Va., consulting firm
that helps nonprofits raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole business model is based on kickbacks,'' Rovner
said, referring to the commissions that individual stores give the
malls for sending Web shoppers their way. While e-commerce is in
its infancy, online merchants are willing to pay commissions to
acquire new customers. But ``no one knows if that will be a
permanent process,'' he said. ``If the kickbacks go away, the
shopping sites will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Web companies trying to facilitate Internet fund
raising are shopping sites. Some, such as Working Assets'
GiveForChange, collect credit card donations and deliver them to
nonprofits, usually keeping a percentage as a commission. Others
conduct auctions of donated goods. Some players, such as
CharityCounts.com, combine shopping, auctions, donations and
charity-related content with the aim of becoming a clearinghouse
for all charitable online activities.
</P>
<P>
   KickStart.com, a Denver-based startup, gives nonprofits their
own easy-to-create online portals. KickStart.com splits advertising
and e-commerce revenues from the page with the nonprofit, after
deducting an annual fee of $100.
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of, say, the local kids soccer league can log on to
a start page that contains news about the soccer club, as well as
standard portal features such as weather and stock updates. On that
page, supporters can earn money for the group by viewing ads,
conducting Web searches and shopping, with a percent of each
purchase going to the soccer league. KickStart.com sells targeted
advertising banners on these personalized sites, operating on a
similar concept as programs that pay Web surfers for viewing ads.
</P>
<P>
   A few sites, such as the AOL Foundation's Helping.org and the
Hunger Site, which was created by a computer programmer as a good
deed, are operated on a not-for-profit basis.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of charity sites could lead to problems as
these companies struggle to compete, said Daniel Moore, vice
president of the National Association of State Charity Officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always seen that businesses under financial stress are
areas where cutting corners is more likely,'' Moore said. ``Whether
those financial pressures cause new sites to breach the donors'
trust and fail to pass that money through to the charities, that's
what's going to give regulators concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ami Kassar, founder of Shop2Give in Los Angeles, said that
proving his company is trustworthy is vital to its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want this field to go away because state charity
regulators get really concerned about fraud and put down
regulations to cripple the industry,'' Kassar said.
</P>
<P>
   IGive.com prominently displays the total amount it has raised
for charity since its founding in 1997: over $500,000. It provides
a statistics page where shoppers can track their history of
purchases. It also posts the check numbers and dates of all past
disbursements to each nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know exactly how much money is going to your cause,'' said
Robert Grosshandler, iGive.com's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But in the absence of government regulations, the practices of
charity Web sites vary, and not all of them are so open. Some newer
sites, such as CharityCounts.com, lack the tracking infrastructure
to show users where their money goes and when it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Association of State Charity Officials spent
much of this year's conference discussing online charity, they
haven't come up with any guidelines for it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping to benefit a cause isn't a new idea, but e-giving
presents a new business model that is outside current regulations,
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional fund-raising companies offer their services to
nonprofits, while most of the new Web sites offer their services
directly to individuals, to benefit the charity of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites sign agreements with nonprofits before listing them
as potential beneficiaries, while others simply list all 620,000
nonprofit organizations registered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latter approach ruffles the feathers of some nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like that, and it's illegal,'' said Nancy Brady,
national director of strategic marketing for the March of Dimes.
Using an organization's name without permission is considered by
many to be a breach of trademark. ``Ask us, and if we want to be
involved, we'll say yes,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the large number of Web sites soliciting donations,
purchases and click throughs, online charity has a long way to go
before it can rival the $174.5 billion that nonprofits collected by
traditional methods in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing, but the numbers are still very low,''
Shop2Give's Kassar acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``All online fund raising should be considered experimental
right now, with one or two exceptions,'' said Rovner, the
consultant to nonprofits. One exception he noted was the American
Red Cross's online efforts during the Kosovo crisis, which raised
$1.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Online or offline, the most effective way to help a charity is
to give the money directly to the group, Rovner said.

disclosures that indicate the portion of the purchase price that
will go to charity. Watch out for vague references such as ``a
portion of our profits will go to charitable organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   When will the charity receive the funds? Some sites donate to
charities on a quarterly or other periodic basis or may require a
cumulative charity donation to reach a certain level (for example,
$10) before a check is sent to the designated group.
</P>
<P>
   Is any part of the purchase deductible as a charitable gift?
Generally, no portion of online purchases is deductible since items
are being sold at their ``fair market value.''
</P>
<P>
   Online charity auction cautions. Is there a disclosure as to
what portion of the winning bid will go to the benefiting charity?
Do not assume that the designated charity has given any approval or
is formally involved with the auction sale.
</P>
<P>
   Online charity chain mail. You might receive an e-mail message
that claims a few cents will go to a specified charity each time
the message is sent to another person. Such claims are invariably
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Will the charity see the donor's personal information? Before
making online donations, see if the charity has an announced
privacy policy concerning the use of your name, e-mail address or
other personal facts. For example, does it ask donors for
permission to share this information with other charities or
companies?
</P>
<P>
   Is there security for online donations? Verify that the charity
site is using encryption technology to secure online credit card
donations. Look for visual alerts through your browser that inform
you when you are entering a secure area.
</P>
<P>
   Verify that the organization is a charity. Don't assume a Web
site is affiliated with a nonprofit organization just because .org
appears at the end of the Internet address. In addition, there are
many different types of nonprofit organizations; only some of them
are eligible to receive contributions that are deductible as
charitable gifts. To verify if a group is tax-exempt as a charity,
visit www.irs.gov/prod/search/eosearch.html.
</P>
<P>
   Research charities online. The Internet offers donors an
opportunity to get more detailed information from the charity's Web
site. Contact the charity via e-mail with any questions and/or go
to outside trusted sources, such as the Better Business Bureau
(www.bbb.org), for additional facts and to find out if a national
charity meets BBB charity standards.

   &UR; MILLIONS EAT BECAUSE PEOPLE CLICK A BUTTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARRIE KIRBY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hunger Site's premise is so simple, it seems
too good to be true: All visitors have to do is click a button to
donate food to hungry people millions of miles away. No purchase
required. No filling in forms or typing in credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that many skeptics have a hard time
believing in it. John Breen, the 42-year-old computer programmer
who created the site, has a stock answer for people who e-mail him
asking if his site is just another hoax: Go to the United Nations
World Food Program's Web page, www.wfp.org/prelease/1999/
991216.htm, where the organization &LR;   &LR; confirms receiving more than
$200,000 so far from the Hunger Site.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from advertisers who sign up to sponsor the page
for 24 hours at a time. During that day, the sponsors' ads appear
when someone clicks a button labeled ``Donate Free Food.'' For
every sponsor signed up, a half-cent is added to the donation,
which the World Food Program uses to buy 1/4 cup of rice or another
staple. The food goes to any of the 80 nations the World Food
Program serves.
</P>
<P>
   Each individual's donations are limited to one a day. It takes
the visitor about three seconds to complete the process.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Breen pretty much all of his time to administer the
site, however. The Indiana resident had to stop working and rely on
his wife's income as a college professor when response to the site
became overwhelming. He operates without any loans or grants.
</P>
<P>
   Breen started working on the site in January as a personal
project. ``I thought I'd just set up this simple little site and it
would run itself,'' he said. ``I wasn't planning on the massive
volumes of e-mail. It ended up taking up gobs and gobs of time.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Breen wanted his Web page to work as a bulletin board
where people could find out about Third World schools that needed
educational materials. His sister had worked in Africa and told him
that children were in dire need of pencils and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I learned that hunger was a really big deal in these
developing countries,'' he said. According to statistics on the
page, 800 million people suffer from hunger worldwide. Instead of
asking for paper and pencils, he realized, many Third World
teachers who managed to access his site would be asking for food.
</P>
<P>
   So he launched his project June 1 as the Hunger Site. On June
10, Yahoo featured it as a Daily Pick, and the site's popularity
snowballed &LR;  as Web surfers everywhere e-mailed the URL around &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In June, visitors sent close to 200,000 donations &LR; ; in July,
there were more than a million &LR; . November saw donation totals
approach 7 million. Now, people from about 175 countries click to
donate a million cups of food each day. Donations are tallied by
country at www.thehungersite.com/donationstodate.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite is the Vatican City,'' Breen said, scrolling down
the list. ``Usually I get two to six hits every day from the
Vatican City. I always imagine the pope sitting there clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hunger Site's URL is &LR;   &LR; www.thehungersite.com.

 NEW SUPERCOMPUTER PACKS POWERFUL PUNCH  &HT;     By STAN BUNGER and JAN BOYD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like who-knows-how-many other information system
managers in Silicon Valley, Don Davis is busy planning a new
computer installation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anyone else, Davis is putting together a new installation
that will fill a building and come with an electrical substation
capable of supplying enough power for a small town.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is in charge of a facility being completed at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. That facility,
part of the Energy Department's Accelerated Supercomputer
Initiative, will house Lawrence Livermore's new ASCI White
supercomputer, due to be delivered by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The supercomputer's future home is a vast room large enough to
hold two full-size basketball courts. An enormous air-conditioning
system keeps the place chilled to 61 degrees Fahrenheit. The
electrical substation, capable of providing enough power for 11,000
homes, hums outside.

PORTUGAL LOWERS ITS FLAG, HANDING MACAU TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 6th graf updating with arrival of Chinese troops;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ With the solemn lowering of one flag and the triumphant
raising of another, China claimed sovereignty over Macau on Monday,
ending 442 years of Portuguese rule and shaking off the last
vestiges of European colonial involvement in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, at the stroke of midnight, had all the pomp and
ritual of another handover ceremony, in nearby Hong Kong two and a
half years ago. But while the British and Chinese leaders conducted
their exercise there with icy formality, the leaders here Monday
seemed much more at ease.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech moments after the handover, President Jiang Zemin of
China praised the smooth transfer. ``The friendship between the two
peoples and the amicable cooperation between the two countries will
develop from a new starting point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also said the successful return of Macau _ following that
of Hong Kong _ demonstrates that China is ``confident and capable''
of an early reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal greeted Jiang warmly on the
dais and chatted amiably with him just before parting. But he
reminded China that Portugal will remain committed to a Macau,
where, he said, ``democracy and freedom are an irreplaceable
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Monday, the first contingent of 700 troops from the
Chinese army rolled across the border in trucks and armored
personnel carriers. China's deployment of soldiers here had been a
bone of contention with Portugal in recent months. But on Monday,
thousands of people _ many in red track suits _lined the streets to
welcome the troops, cheering and waving Chinese flags.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clash on troops, Portugal negotiated guarantees of
relative autonomy for Macau similar to those that Britain won for
Hong Kong. But high-flown discussions of democracy and the rule of
law seem less relevant in this tiny enclave of 430,000 people,
where the main business is gambling and the biggest local concern
is curbing Chinese gangs, whose violent battles have stained the
last days of the Portuguese administration.
</P>
<P>
   In Macau's casinos, a smaller than usual crowd wagered through
the handover without a pause. A young man playing Chinese dominoes
in the casino at the Hotel Lisboa glanced at a clock on the wall
and prayed aloud for good fortune at midnight. He won the next
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's carefully planned day got off to a chaotic start when
the police broke up a gathering of members of the Falun Gong
spiritual movement in front of the Lisboa. The police detained 40
of the group's members as they did their morning exercises,
dragging some away by force. Falun Gong has been outlawed in
mainland China, where the government has condemned it as an evil
cult.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's authorities had warned the group not to protest here. On
Friday, the police detained several Falun Gong members trying to
enter the territory. Monday, the group assembled in a traffic
circle, hoping to confront Jiang, wtorcade was scheduled to
pass by later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   China may also have been put off by two of the most notable
guests at the ceremony. Christopher Patten, the last governor of
Hong Kong, was there as a guest of the Portuguese, despite being
reviled by Beijing for his strenuous advocacy of democracy in the
years before the Hong Kong handover. Portugal also invited Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, a top leader of newly independent East Timor.
China maintains relations with Indonesia, which invaded East Timor
in 1975 and jailed Gusmao for his pro-independence activities until
earlier this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The transfer of sovereignty capped a day laden with symbolism,
as Portugal gently reasserted its legacy in Macau one last time. At
a Mass on Monday morning in the Macau Cathedral, worshipers
presented as an offering a bound copy of the Basic Law, the
constitution negotiated between Portugal and China, which allows
Macau to keep its own government and laws as a special region of
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the offer given to us by the Chinese,'' said Luis
M.F. Sequeira, a Jesuit priest and one of the celebrants of the
Mass. ``It is a challenge for them to uphold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's formal renunciation of control began Monday
afternoon, as senior officials of the colonial administration
gathered in the courtyard of the Government Palace to lower the
Portuguese flag. The governor, Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira, emerged
from the salmon pink building at 5 p.m. to polite applause from a
crowd, mostly Chinese, on the sidewalk outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor took his place next to an honor guard of
police officers and firefighters in dress uniforms, a marching band
struck up the Portuguese anthem and an officer slowly lowered the
old green and red flag from its place on the peaked roof. The
officer folded the flag and presented it to Vieira, who placed it
over his heart and gazed at a coat of arms above the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then turned and strode through the gate, his
expression stoic as he and his wife climbed into a black Mercedes
limousine and were driven away. When the motorcade had gone, the
crowd pushed past a cordon of police officers and spilled gleefully
into the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go in and take a look,'' said one man to his wife, as
they made for the front steps, where a lone guard stood somewhat
nervously behind the glass doors. After a few giddy moments, the
police cleared out the courtyard and the palace stood empty in the
gathering dusk, soft lights illuminating its white columns.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the rituals, the atmosphere on this handover day was
festive, despite brisk weather and blustery winds that forced the
cancellation of evening fireworks. Christmas bells and Chinese
lanterns swung from lampposts in Largo de Senado, the picturesque
brick square in the historic center of Macau. Local people and
visitors milled about, taking pictures to commemorate the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud because China is becoming bigger and more
powerful,'' said Cheong Iom Wang, who arrived here from Cambodia as
a refugee in 1970. Cheong, 37, said he would not miss the departing
Portuguese. ``They've been here for a long time,'' he said. ``Their
time is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Portuguese seemed determined to savor their last day of
occupancy here. Many people traveled from Portugal on package tours
to witness the handover. They strolled through the streets, their
hats and fur coats a contrast to the more casual Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see the end of a long period in our country's
history,'' said Isabel Roque Cunha, who is from Aveiro, in central
Portugal. Mrs. Roque Cunha, 56, said she had never been to Macau,
though she had vivid images from pictures as a child. ``I expected
it to be more grand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such ambivalence at a Buddhist temple in the old
Chinese quarter of Macau, where people turned up to worship on this
auspicious occasion. The temple, dedicated to the Chinese goddess
A-Ma, is where Portuguese seafarers first made landfall in 1557.
Monday, people hung long lines of firecrackers from a pole next to
the entrance and set them off in a cacophonous celebration.

 COMIC BOOK POKES FUN AT VENTURE CAPITALISTS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's nothing funnier than pitching your
life's work to a callous executive who has the power to turn your
startup into the Next Big Thing _ or steal your idea and hand it to
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Have trouble seeing the humor in venture capital?
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley venture capitalist and his wife, an
illustrator, manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the subject in
their comic book, ``The VC _ The Surreal World of Silicon Valley
Venture Capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The book collects 33 comic strips that Robert von Goeben and
Kathryn Siegler created for their Web site, &LR;   &LR; www.thevc.com.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario has a venture capitalist determining a company's
fate by consulting a Magic 8 Ball. Another shows a hopeful CEO
getting shot down between slides one and two of his PowerPoint
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Von Goeben was a partner in a VC firm in Saratoga, Calif.,
Redleaf Venture Management, when he began writing the strips in
1997. He's currently working on a new capital project and taking a
break from writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunt for money in Silicon Valley is a world of its own,''
von Goeben said. People in that world recognize the truisms in the
comic immediately, while outsiders sometimes just don't get it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strip started as a joke with some people I know, but then
it just exploded.'' Soon Upside magazine began running it. Since
then, he's had whole boardrooms break into applause when he's
identified as the author of ``The VC.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Goeben and Siegler plan to create more strips for their Web
site in early 2000.

SECURITY TIGHTENED ALONG U.S.-CANADIAN BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service tightened security Sunday along a
Canadian border that an expert on terrorism says has been porous
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, arrested by Customs agents as he allegedly tried
to smuggle explosives into Port Angeles last week, wasn't the first
suspected terrorist to be caught crossing from Canada into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are two-fold:
</P>
<P>
   Canada's lax laws have made it a magnet for extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   And members of those organizations have had little trouble
crossing one of the longest and friendliest borders in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, it's happened more and more
frequently,'' Vincent Cannistraro, former counter-terrorism chief
for the CIA, told the Post-Intelligencer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, for example, authorities arrested Gazi Ibrahim
Abu Mezer three times for trying to cross the border from British
Columbia into Washington. Mezer was later charged with plotting to
bomb New York subways.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's arrest, coupled with fears that he may have had
accomplices who remain free, prompted the Customs Service to
announce Sunday that it will add 150 agents at the Canadian border
and work them longer hours to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
   But there's been no indication yet of an increase in the number
of field agents who patrol the unguarded territory between the
ports of entry, said Keith Olson, president of the National Border
Patrol Council Local 2913, which represents about 200 agents in
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service is responsible for those coming into the
U.S. at formal entry points while the Border Patrol has primary
responsibility for the vast boundary stretches in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have 24-hour coverage and we still don't have
any more people,'' Olson said Sunday. ``If they're tightening up
the border, I don't see it, and I work there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stretches in between ports of entry are notorious for being
easy to cross, he said. ``If this guy (Ressam) had driven in at 2
(in the morning,) there would've been no one there to catch him. I
guess he didn't do his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the borders now is like closing the gate after the
horse is already out, he said. ``Whoever is here is here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol has about 33 agents in the field patrolling
the stretch from the Pacific beaches to the Cascades and only 289
agents along the entire U.S.-Canada border, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The southern boundary between the U.S. and Mexico has about
8,200 Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials haven't been overly concerned about the Canadian
border until recently because most terrorist threats were perceived
to be aimed outside the United States, Cannistraro said.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance arrest of Ressam last Tuesday has altered that
perception, he said. Ressam was arrested after Customs officials
found bomb-making materials in his car when he tried to cross by
ferry from Victoria, B.C., to Port Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure luck, the unravelling of this in Port Angeles,''
Cannistraro said. ``Now that this has happened, they're worried.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian law enforcement mounted a massive manhunt
Sunday for a man who had been staying with Ressam outside Vancouver
in the weeks before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam reportedly had two ferry ticket stubs in his possession
when he was stopped crossing into Port Angeles, suggesting a
companion may have walked off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam lived in Montreal before flying to Vancouver a month ago.
Newsweek, citing unnamed Canadian police sources, reported that
Ressam lived for a time there with Said Atmani, who was extradited
from Canada to France in connection with the 1995 Paris subway
bombing that killed four people and injured 86. The bombing was
attributed to the Algerian radical Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro said Ressam also has suspected ties to Osama bin
Laden, the man U.S. officials believe heads a terrorist network
involved in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, police in Montreal searched a van belonging to
Ressam for signs of explosives, said Cpl. Leo Monbourquette, a
spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro said Canada has become a magnet for terrorist
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of terrorist groups find Canada a benign area in
terms of fund-raising, organizing and presence,'' he said.
``Terrorist groups naturally gravitate to Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian intelligence officers, there are at least
50 known terrorist groups in Canada, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has strict laws against fund-raising by
terrorist groups or front groups for terrorist organizations, he
said. In contrast, Canadian laws are more lax.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian intelligence is concerned about the terrorist presence,
he said. ``But the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is limited in what
it can do,'' he said. ``Until they break the law, (authorities)
can't move against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Ressam, however, has catalyzed an increase in
security along the U.S.-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 150 additional customs agents were being moved into
position at remote ports of entry along the U.S.-Canadian border,
said U.S. Customs spokesman Bill Anthony in Washington, D.C. In
addition, agents were allowed to work 12 and 13 hour days and were
joined by employees reassigned from desk jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is look at as many suspicious vehicles as
possible,'' Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents expected most travellers to be cooperative because of
publicity surrounding Ressam's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the border into the United States wasn't a problem at
the Blaine crossing Sunday night. The wait was only about an hour,
normal for the holiday season, a Customs Service spokesman said.
