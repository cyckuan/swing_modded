<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Agent Sought in Soybean / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	URBANA, Ill. (AP) -- University of Illinois researcher Michael  
Plewa has heard the talk about lifesaving drugs that might found in 
the exotic plants and trees of the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plewa would rather do his research on the common plants  
found in the farmers' fields that surround his university. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sitting on 2.5 billion bushels of soybeans and 10  
billion bushels of corn in the United States,'' said Plewa, a 
genetics professor. ``I think there should be a thorough analysis 
to look for anti-mutagenic properties in those plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plewa's work centers on finding compounds in soybeans that could  
help prevent cancerous tumors. He also is looking for compounds 
that could fight tumors, which could be a great help in 
chemotherapy treatment. His hope is to find something that could be 
incorporated into food. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case of ``waste not, want not'' research, Plewa is looking  
at the parts of the soybean left over after products like soybean 
oil or soybean meal are produced. 
</P>
<P>
	He's finding some promising results, although he cautions that  
much work remains to be done and his findings are a long way from 
being applied to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	In his cancer prevention research, agribusiness giant Archer  
Daniels Midland Co. provides the soybean byproducts. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture fractures them into compounds that are 
applied one-by-one to the ovary cells of hamsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells then are blasted with a carcinogen, or cancer-causing  
substance, and Plewa uses a new technique to determine whether the 
soybean compound protected the cell's DNA from being damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for an agent that can stop this process or put  
up roadblocks to this process of mutagenic activity -- in which DNA 
is damaged, a cell loses its shape, becomes a tumor and then 
metastasizes to other tumors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much attention has been paid in the last few years to  
isoflavones -- estrogen-like compounds in soy protein that appear to 
somehow protect health. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plewa has found that so far, other compounds called saponins  
seem to do the best job of protecting cells from cancer-starting 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another aspect of Plewa's work is determining whether certain  
soybean compounds could slow the growth rate of cancerous tumor 
cells while leaving healthy cells alone. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, he has found isoflavones to be the most helpful.  
</P>
<P>
	``Although there is a lot of work to be done, we clearly have  
found a treasure trove of promising compounds in soybean 
products,'' Plewa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Anderson of the University of Kentucky, a leading  
nutrition researcher, said he is pleased that more research is 
being done into soybean compounds and their effects on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much up in the air, though, Anderson said he now advises  
his patients to incorporate more whole grains and soy into their 
diets, instead of trying to eat certain compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole hope of a lot of people is that we can identify what  
inside the soybean is the most protective element and give that in 
a capsule,'' he said. ``But right now it is a fuzzy area.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As quickly as you can say 4th-and-2, No. 3 Penn  
State turned a soggy Saturday into a victory celebration at the 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Nittany Lions stopped No. 8 Miami a yard short of a  
first down. Then, on the next play, Kevin Thompson threw a 79-yard 
touchdown pass to Chafie Fields with 1:41 left and Penn State had a 
27-23 victory over the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's games like these that are the reason I stay in the  
game,'' Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno, drenched but smiling, 
said. ``We were a little lucky today. You got to feel great for 
these kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Fields shook off two tacklers and raced into the end zone,  
Penn State players ran onto the field, jumping and thrusting their 
helmets into the air. The rain-soaked crowd of 74,427 was stunned. 
Just seconds earlier, they were cheering what they thought would be 
Miami's biggest win since coach Butch Davis took over five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the taste in our mouths,'' Miami cornerback Leonard  
Myers said, ``and then it was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington, who had another shoving  
incident with a punter, said he thought his team could lose but 
when the game turned, ``it was the greatest feeling in the world. I 
love Miami!'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was a game, played in a steady rain, the Hurricanes (2-1)  
hoped would mark their return to college football's elite. It 
looked that way after Miami roared back from a 17-3 deficit and led 
23-20 on James Jackson's 39-yard TD run with 7:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Miami's Edward Reed intercepted a pass by Rashard  
Casey, who alternated at quarterback with Thompson, it looked like 
Penn State (4-0) was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jackson, who carried 33 times for 129 yards and two TDs, was  
stuffed by linebacker Maurice Daniels on fourth-and-2 at the Penn 
State 21 after a 1-yard gain. A measurement was called for, but the 
ball was a yard short. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourth and two was a big thing,'' Paterno said. ``They make a  
first down and it's over. But I thought we did stop them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, questioned about not going for a field goal and a  
six-point lead instead, said: ``A field goal would not have won it. 
... We thought we would make the first down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson wasted no time when the Lions took over. He dropped  
back and found Fields, who had five catches for 177 yards, near the 
40-yard line. Fields shook off the attempted tackle of Mike Rumph 
at the 50, and headed toward the end zone. Reed lunged to reach 
Fields, but was left face down on the wet grass as the flanker 
raced into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say that every time I get the ball I've got a chance to make  
big play,'' said Fields, who also caught a 49-yard TD pass from 
Casey on the final play of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami got the ball back twice more, but each time Kenny Kelly  
threw interceptions. The final one was by Bhawoh Jue with 35 
seconds left, and the Lions ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disappointing outcome to this game,'' Davis said.  
``You can't go into this type of game against a quality opponent 
like Penn State and make the fundamental mistakes we made and 
expect to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who started, was 9-of-15 for 147 yards and a TD, while  
Casey was 7-of-9 for 99 yards and a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	For Miami, Kelly was 11-of-21 for 160 yards and a TD, but had  
four interceptions and lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State moved to a 17-3 lead to open the third quarter. Kenny  
Watson's 52-yard kickoff return gave the Lions the ball on the 
Miami 46 and Eric McCoo capped the short drive with a 2-yard TD 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which got its initial first down with 4:37 left in the  
first half, struck back late in the third quarter. Jackson took a 
pitchout from Kelly and ran 18 yards for a TD to make it 17-10 with 
3:56 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State was on its way for another score, but Casey's 74-yard  
run to the Miami 6 was called back when tight end Tony Stewart was 
called for clipping. The Lions punted, and on the first play of the 
fourth quarter, the game was tied 17-all on Kelly's 40-yard TD pass 
to Santana Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State moved ahead 20-17 on Travis Forney's 26-yard field  
goal with 10:40 left, but Jackson's second TD -- thanks to a 
crushing block by guard Richard Mercier -- put Miami ahead by three 
points. Andy Crosland, who kicked a 29-yard field goal late in the 
first half, was wide left with the extra point, and Miami led 
23-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 10-0, Miami was unable to take advantage of a fumbled  
punt by Watson at the Lions 34. The Hurricanes blew another scoring 
chance when Kelly fumbled after running 23 yards to the Lions 8. 
Arrington recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington stirred things up on Miami's first series. He fought  
off a block and collided with punter Crosland, who retaliated by 
pushing the linebacker away. Both players were called for personal 
fouls -- offsetting penalties -- and the Nittany Lions took 
possession after the 40-yard punt. 
</P>
<P>
	The play wasn't as damaging as the stunt Arrington pulled last  
week, when he was hit with two penalties for wrestling with the 
Pittsburgh punter.

<HEADLINE> Skydiving Plane Crash Kills Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- The three men on board the plane were close  
friends with a passion for skydiving. The two women were planning 
their first jumps, one to celebrate her 27th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the Cessna 182 carrying the five took off Saturday  
from the Ags Over Texas skydiving club, it appeared to stall, then 
banked right and nosedived into a field, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot James Robert Puryear, 22, instructors Jonathan Wayne  
Warden, 25, and Mark Woodings, 28, and Rebecca Miller, 18, died on 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses pulled 27-year-old Lela Futch from the wreckage. She  
died at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodings' girlfriend, Allison Roderick, witnessed the crash. She  
was working in the offices of the skydiving school and waiting to 
see the jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark loved teaching people about skydiving and how to skydive,  
that was his favorite thing,'' she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first accident in the 17-year history of the club,  
often used by Texas A&AMP;M University students and alumni, Ms. 
Roderick said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the 1958 Cessna never had serious mechanical problems  
and received regular maintenance, and she couldn't speculate on 
what could have caused it to go down. Like other witnesses, she saw 
nothing more than a puff of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation  
Administration officials began sifting through the wreckage Sunday 
to determine a cause.

<HEADLINE>  Mark McGwire Hits Nos. 57 and 58 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 57th and 58th home runs in  
consecutive at-bats Sunday, pulling three behind major league 
leader Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	After striking out in the first, McGwire hit a 1-2 fastball from  
Houston Astros right-hander Chris Holt in the fourth, a two-run 
shot that put the St. Louis Cardinals ahead 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire cleared the bullpen in left center on Holt's first pitch  
of the sixth, a drive estimated at 423 feet that again gave the 
Cardinals the lead at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has three homers in three games, including a grand slam  
on Friday night, and 515 for his career. This was his ninth 
multi-homer game of the season and the 62nd of his career, tying 
him Hank Aaron for third on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth is first with 72 multi-homer games and Willie Mays had  
63. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also has 500 home runs as a first baseman, extending his  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his 61st earlier Sunday for the Chicago Cubs. On  
Saturday, Sosa became the first player to hit 60 homers in 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has 128 homers the last two years, one more than Sosa  
over the same period. That number also ties his two-season record 
set in 1997 and '98.

<HEADLINE> Barak Warns About Mideast Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Middle East violence could flare if peace talks  
between Israel and the Palestinians fail, Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak was quoted Sunday as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative to peacemaking would be ``a situation like  
Kosovo, or a march into a dead end with unilateral steps on each 
side,'' Barak told Der Spiegel magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would start the countdown to a new round of violence.''  
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians signed a new West Bank  
land-for-security deal this month that also sets a September 2000 
target for a final peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed diplomacy followed three years of deadlock under  
Barak's hawkish predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak is due to begin a visit to Germany on Tuesday, the first  
state guest since the government returned to Berlin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying the Nazi past ``cannot be erased,'' he praised  
Germany's postwar democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the German people's decision that Berlin should  
once again be the capital despite the evil that emanated from 
there,'' he told Der Spiegel. ``I think no one today is seriously 
afraid of German manipulative power games.''

<HEADLINE> China Starting Telecommunication Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will launch its third major  
telecommunications company next month in its attempts to bring 
competition to a sector long dominated by a government monopoly, 
the official China Daily reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	China Netcom Corp. is using $50 million in government funds to  
offer high-speed data services for big businesses and Internet 
service companies in 15 cities, the newspaper reported in its 
Business Weekly edition. 
</P>
<P>
	China Netcom will use Internet Protocol technology, which helps  
networks run faster and more efficiently, the newspaper said. Its 
network will initially rely on fiber-optic lines owned by two of 
its four government founders, the Ministry of Railways and the 
agency that regulates broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the government's desire to use limited liberalization to  
spur innovation in telecommunications, China Netcom will face stiff 
competition from China Telecom, the dominant phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	China Telecom enjoys strong backing from its former owner, the  
Ministry of Information Industry, which regulates the sector. It 
has used those ties to try to keep the country's second telephone 
company, China Unicom, from developing into a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry backing, however, has not fully protected China  
Telecom. Consumer complaints and government eagerness to tap the 
Internet for economic growth have forced China Telecom to reduce 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another round of price cuts is likely later this year, following  
reductions in March for Internet and phone services, China Daily 
reported, quoting Zhang Cunjiang, a telecommunications regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Zhang did not provide details, the China Daily cited  
unidentified sources as saying that Internet charges will drop by 
half from the current 50 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	March's price cuts spurred consumption. According to Ministry of  
Information Industry statistics, in the first eight months of the 
year fixed-line customers rose 14 million to more than 100 million 
and mobile phone users increased nearly 11 million to 36.2 million, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use in the first half of the year nearly doubled, from  
2.1 million users in the end of 1998 to 4 million, China Daily 
said.

<HEADLINE> Academics Accused As E.German Spies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Newspapers on Sunday named two British academics  
as spies for communist East Germany's Stasi secret police, the 
latest additions to a gallery of Cold War agents identified in the 
past 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired economics professor Victor Allen, 77, a former  
bricklayer who was a prominent member of Britain's once-influential 
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and Gwynneth Edwards, a lecturer 
in modern languages, worked in the 1980s for a Stasi-recruited 
ring, the news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, like 87-year-old great-grandmother Melita Norwood who was  
publicly identified last week as a former spy for the Soviet Union, 
expressed no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The some half-dozen alleged agents so far identified are  
featured in a book based on KGB archives that was published last 
week, in a television documentary on the book being aired Sunday, 
and in newspaper reports of Stasi documents. The Stasi operated 
until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The seriousness of the agents' activities appears to vary widely  
-- from Mrs. Norwood, a former secretary, allegedly passing British 
atomic secrets to Moscow, to the academics reportedly providing 
information about fellow students, colleagues or antinuclear 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators opposed to the Labor Party government called for a  
judicial inquiry -- including into why no prosecutions were 
initiated by Britain's MI5 intelligence agency against agents named 
in the KGB documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers were smuggled out by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin  
who defected in 1992 and lives in Britain under an assumed name. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``The Mitrokhin Archive,'' is by a Cambridge historian  
Christopher Andrew who was officially given access to the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts of the British Broadcasting Corp.'s documentary, ``The  
Spying Game,'' were released in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Office, the government department responsible for  
dmoestic security, rejected calls for an inquiry and vigorously 
defended MI5. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Home Office said to routinely publicize  
investigations into alleged spies ``could very seriously compromise 
the work of the (intelligence) agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who taught at Leeds University in north England,  
acknowledged supplying information to East Germany, and said in the 
BBC documentary, ``It was perfectly legitimate that I should do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London's Sunday Telegraph said that, according to Stasi files,  
Allen provided information on Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 
activists during the 1980s and visited the East German embassy in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	The antinuclear movement was split between advocates of total  
abolition of nuclear weapons and those who, like Allen, advocated 
America and Britain disarming, but not the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-80s the movement had 400,000 members, and  
organized huge protests in London and marches on British bases for 
U.S. cruise nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, a lecturer at Loughborough University in central  
England, was named in another British weekly, The Independent on 
Sunday, as a member of a 20-strong Stasi spy ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said her duties included reporting to the East  
Germans on any anti-Communist comments by visiting German 
academics. It gave no other details about her, and said she could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another academic, Robin Pearson, an economics lecturer at Hull  
University in northern England, is identified in the BBC program as 
a Stasi agent for 12 years starting in the mid-1970s. The Home 
Office said Friday that the security services interviewed Pearson 
in 1994 by decided there was ``no usable evidence against him.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs 26, Broncos 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The deeper Denver goes into the  
post-John Elway Era, the worse it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Converting points off a Terrell Davis fumble and two turnovers  
by Elway's replacement, the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Broncos 
26-10 on Sunday and dropped the two-time defending Super Bowl 
champions to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Griese, who threw just three passes last year in his  
rookie season, was 11-of-16 for 107 yards, with one interception 
and one fumble, before being replaced by Bubby Brister with 9:17 
left in the game. Brister didn't fare any better, throwing an 
interception that led to Pete Stoyanovich's fourth field goal, a 
27-yarder with 2:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most embarrassed was Dale Carter, Kansas City's former  
Pro Bowl cornerback who was making his first appearance in 
Arrowhead Stadium after signing a free-agent contract with the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter got beat twice on deep patterns by Derrick Alexander, who  
totaled 117 yards on six catches. He also nullified a 15-yard sack 
of Elvis Grbac when he was called for illegal contact on the 
Chiefs' last touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimble Anders, who injured his ankle late in the fourth quarter,  
carried 22 times for a career-high 142 yards as the Chiefs (1-1) 
handed Gunther Cunningham his first victory as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos cut the lead to 16-10 on the first play of the  
fourth on Davis' 1-yard leap following a Kansas City turnover deep 
in its own territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Grbac, who had appeared to be injured in the previous  
series, moved the Chiefs 66 yards on 9 plays, aided by Carter's 
penalty and capped by Bam Morris' 5-yard run with 9:25 to play for 
a 23-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who also went over 100 yards in the opener in  
Chicago, beat Carter for 30 yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
	After a scoreless first quarter, Jason Elam put the Broncos on  
top 3-0 with a 50-yard field goal early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Griese, who did not throw an interception in Denver's 38-21  
loss to Miami last Monday night, was picked off by safety Jerome 
Woods on the Chiefs 43. A few minutes later, Stoyanovich made it 
3-3 with a 19-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	As the last second ticked off the clock in the first half,  
Stoyanovich kicked a 42-yarder for a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the third quarter, Cris Dishman recovered Davis' fumble  
and Alexander immediately beat Carter on a 49-yard gain to the 6, 
setting up Tony Richardso's 1-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Thomas sacked Griese, stripped him of the ball and  
recovered the fumble on the Denver 27 late in the third, and 
Stoyanovich converted a 44-yarder for a 16-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 61 yards against Miami, gained 79 yards on 21  
carries against a Chiefs' defense that was specially geared to stop 
him.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Hits 61st Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa isn't slowing down after becoming the  
first player to reach 60 homers twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs star outfielder hit No. 61 in his first at-bat  
Sunday, connecting off Milwaukee's Hideo Nomo in the first inning. 
With a wind blowing out at 16 mph, Sosa's drive landed well out of 
Wrigley Field and went rolling down a side street as fans went 
scrambling for the ball. The homer was estimated at 485 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer leaves Sosa nine shy of Mark McGwire's record 70 last  
season with 13 games to play after Sunday. Last season when he hit 
66, Sosa connected for his 61st in Chicago's 150th game. The Cubs 
were playing their 149th game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Sosa hit No. 60 off Milwaukee's Jason Bere. He now  
has 18 homers off Brewers pitchers over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's 61st ties him with Roger Maris for the third most homers  
in one season. Maris hit 61 in 1961, a record that stood until 
McGwire and Sosa topped it last season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Newspaper Publisher's Body Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNAPPA, Ore. (AP) -- A former newspaper publisher who had been  
missing since a solo helicopter ride last month was found dead 
Saturday in the wreckage of his aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Ted Natt, 58, who was publisher of The Daily News of  
Longview, Wash., for more than two decades, was still strapped into 
the battered cockpit of the Sweitzer 300 chopper when bow hunters 
looking for elk happened onto the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieces of glass, metal, gray vinyl, a flight manual and Natt's  
pilot's license were strewn over a large area. The rotors, folded 
together like a knife, lay about 50 feet from the cockpit, The 
Daily News reported in Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt had gotten barely halfway home from Oysterville, Wash.,  
where he attended a memorial service for writer Willard R. Espy on 
Aug. 7. The program from the service was found in a pocket of his 
powder-blue sports jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been living the last six weeks in a state of unreality,  
hoping he'd be found yet wishing that this wasn't the ending, even 
though there wasn't anything else to expect,'' his daughter, Lori 
Sue Mattson, told The Daily News from her home in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to pretend he was away on a trip and that I'd see him  
again. I'm grateful that he's been found so that we can mourn him 
properly, but I'm still just devastated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathryn M. Kurtz, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector  
who visited the crash site, told the paper that Natt apparently 
followed U.S. 30 along the Columbia River in stormy weather. The 
chopper went down in a heavily wooded area just west of Bradley 
Wayside State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Valdez, one of the bow hunters, said the rotor blade  
apparently clipped the tops of two hemlock trees about 100 feet off 
the ground and hit the side of another tree on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating to  
try to determine the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt was heading for the airport in Kelso, next to Longview, on  
a 60-mile flight in the two-seat helicopter. He had flown 
fixed-wing planes aircraft for more than 20 years but had gotten 
his helicopter pilot's license only three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhaustive air and ground search over the Pacific coast and  
the lower Columbia River ended Aug. 16. No signal from the 
emergency locater beacon aboard the helicopter was ever detected. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt became publisher of The Daily News in 1977. The paper won a  
Pulitzer Prize, journalism's most prestigious award, for its 
coverage of the eruption of nearby Mount St. Helens on May 18, 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt left the post in June after Westmedia Corp., owned by the  
Natt family and employees of The Daily News, sold the Longview 
paper and three weeklies to Indiana-based Howard Publications Inc.

<HEADLINE> Five Parachutists Die in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Five members of a skydiving club were killed  
Saturday when their skydiving airplane crashed and burned shortly 
after takeoff, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were aboard a 1958 Cessna 182 belonging to Ags Over  
Texas that crashed about 7 p.m. near Coulter Field, said Brian 
Dismukes, a trooper with the Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Witnesses said the plane appeared to stall, banked to the  
right and then nosed down into a field from about 400 feet,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people, including the pilot, were pronounced dead at the  
scene. A fifth person died a short time later at St. Joseph 
Regional Health Center in Bryan, Dismukes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims ranged in age from 22 to 27.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board will  
survey the wreckage Sunday morning and investigate what may have 
caused the crash, Dismukes said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Digs for FALN Clemency Motives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans plan to apply legislative pressure  
to learn why President Clinton offered clemency to 16 imprisoned 
Puerto Rican nationalists, but at least one GOP lawmaker says he 
already knows the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost anybody with any brains would conclude'' that Clinton  
issued the order to boost Hillary Rodham Clinton's electoral 
prospects for the Senate in New York, Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Orrin Hatch, a contender for the GOP presidential 
nomination, said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like you did it to help your wife's Senate race,''  
the Utah Republican said, addressing his remarks to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that the president is too politically savvy  
to take such an action purely to help his wife in a state with 1.3 
million people of Puerto Rican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who remains officially uncommitted to a 2000  
Senate race, opposed the deal after it began to draw criticism from 
law enforcement officials and others; she then was criticized by 
some Puerto Rican leaders in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States could not have done  
anything this dumb thinking that he was trying to help a candidate 
running for office in New York,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said 
on Fox. ``The Puerto Rican vote, as important as it may be, 
certainly when you look at the New York state vote would be 
infinitesimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said the political ramifications for his wife played  
``absolutely'' no role in his decision and that she was not aware 
of his offer until one of her aides asked her to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The president offered clemency last month to 16 imprisoned Armed  
Forces of National Liberation members if they would renounce 
violence and agree to other conditions. The president said he acted 
in response to human rights officials who argued the sentences for 
bombing-related acts, ranging from 15 to 90 years, were too harsh. 
All but two members accepted the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress contend the offer was politically  
motivated and are beginning a round of investigations. The White 
House and Justice Department, citing executive privilege, have 
rejected GOP requests for documents and testimony related to the 
clemency offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's Judiciary Committee plans to issue subpoenas Thursday  
for such material. Hatch said he might subpoena Attorney General 
Janet Reno, but did not expect much cooperation from her. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has said he is prepared to take the administration to  
court for the documents and if that failed, try to withhold money 
from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House side, the Government Reform Committee is scheduled  
to hear Tuesday from victims of the bombings along with officials 
from the FBI, the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a serious investigation,'' Committee chairman Dan  
Burton, R-Ind., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press. ``The president has 
a moral responsibility to tell the American people why he did 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials in New York decried Clinton's offer as  
an insult to victims of the 130 bomb attacks on U.S. civilian and 
military targets that members of the Puerto Rican group, known by 
its Spanish initials FALN, staged from 1974 to 1983. Six people 
were killed and dozens wounded in the attacks, but none of those 
offered clemency was involved in incidents in which people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the House and Senate overwhelmingly approved  
nonbinding resolutions condemning Clinton's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have demanded -- and last week, Burton's committee  
subpoenaed -- documents Clinton used in deciding to make the deal. 
But the president followed Reno's advice and invoked executive 
privilege on many of them. It was the fourth time he has invoked 
the privilege to refuse a request by Congress.

<HEADLINE> Rebuilt Reef Welcomes Marine Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOOE KEY NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY, Fla. (AP) -- Over thousands  
of years, coral species can build waving forests of sea whips or 
form boulders the size of an adult human. 
</P>
<P>
	But what takes nature centuries to create -- coral grows as  
little as a centimeter a year -- man can destroy in a span of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A research ship ran aground in 1994, crushing a portion of Looe  
Key the size of a tennis court and killing or displacing sea fans, 
fish, sponges and other marine life. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, biologists, engineers and construction crews  
tried to give nature a head start in its healing process. They 
replaced the natural foundation of the reef with boulders, then 
cemented them in place to create a new home for live coral. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Looe Key restoration was completed last month, corals  
and other reef-dwelling animals have been returning to their 
reconstructed habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Boaters, snorkelers and divers forced to stay away during nearly  
two months of construction also are returning to get a glimpse of 
the newly repaired reef along the shallow mile stretch of Looe Key. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average person is probably not going to notice the tiny  
transplanted coral for years and years,'' said Ed Lotkowictz, a 
boat captain from Underseas, a dive shop on Big Pine Key five miles 
from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be the same as walking into a house that was  
restored, and seeing new paint, new walls and new carpet,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida reef tract is the most extensive living coral reef  
system in North American waters, stretching about 200 miles from 
Fowey Rocks off Miami's Biscayne Bay down to the Dry Tortugas. It's 
the third largest system in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an environment protected by the Florida Keys National  
Marine Sanctuary, which is visited by more than 1.68 million people 
a year, many of whom enjoy fishing and diving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus Iselin from the University of Miami smashed into  
the reef in Looe Key while on a voyage to study the currents in the 
Florida Straits and gather information to help clean up oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
	The 155-foot ship sat on the reef, which provides habitats for  
hundreds of species of marine organisms, and rocked on its keel for 
two days. The vessel devastated coral across four spurs, or 
fingers, of the reef, displacing coral heads and fish and 
destroying the reef's physical structure. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Looe Key's worst grounding since 1981, when it was  
designated as a national marine sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	``For two days the reef literally bled carbonate into the  
environment, said Harold Hudson, a regional sanctuary biologist who 
headed the restoration project. ``When you've got steel against 
carbonate, steel always wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a reef can build itself a calcium carbonate-hardened  
exterior, similar to a human skeleton or a snail's shell, the 
inside is a porous structure of soft living tissue that is 
vulnerable to impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Causey, sanctuary superintendent, said after the initial  
impact, subsequent erosion occurred from loose rubble washing away, 
and storms including Hurricane Georges a year ago passed over Looe 
Key, doubling the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	To repair the damage, workers lowered carefully selected 3- to  
5-ton limestone boulders into the water, filling the gaps in the 
spurs to construct a framework that would mimic the surrounding 
reef and resemble the reef's natural construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarried limestone boulders were a near-perfect substitute for  
natural reef formation, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers poured a special type of cement using a tube that allowed  
the concrete to displace the water and fill the crevices in the 
boulders and prevent it from flowing into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Horizontal and vertical steel bars, resembling lattice, held the  
layers of concrete together, providing additional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survival of any reef is based on stability,'' said Hudson.  
``If you stabilize and elevate it above the sediment, you're on 
your way to building a reef.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The desired effect was an area that would be habitable for  
transplanted coral from other grounding sites, or loose coral that 
simply would be otherwise lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson, nicknamed the ``reef doctor,'' developed the restoration  
strategy after more than 15 years of studying coral reef 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
	His repair design was based on techniques developed during the  
successful restorations of two other large grounding sites off Key 
Largo in 1989. Ships ran hard aground on shallow sanctuary reefs in 
unrelated accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Looe Key restoration, paid for out of a $3.76 million  
settlement with the university, was a model for settling 
environmental disasters and avoiding litigation, said Sharon 
Sutler, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lawyer 
who negotiated the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	At the restoration site, mooring buoys have been reinstalled for  
boaters to tie up. Dive shops and boat captains warn people not to 
touch the coral so the new marine life can grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept true to the form of the coral fingers,'' said Hunter  
Donaldson, a boat captain who ferries snorkelers and divers to the 
site. ``There was no spillage of concrete. I just hope the coral 
will take root and continue to grow.''

<HEADLINE> Rightist Party Gains in Austria Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A rightist party led by a man notorious  
for past praise of the Hitler regime registered big gains in 
Sunday's regional voting -- a closely watched ballot because it fell 
just two weeks before Austria's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Joerg Haider's Freedom Party increased its popularity by more  
than a third in voting for parliament in Vorarlberg, Austria's 
westernmost province, according to preliminary results after polls 
closed. It shot up to more than 27 percent, from 18 percent in the 
last Vorarlberg vote five years ago, the results showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major parties -- the Socialists and the conservative  
People's Party -- both slipped. The Socialists lost almost four 
percentage points to end up with just over 46 percent, and the 
People's Party fell from 16 to 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were further indication that the Freedom Party could  
do well in the Oct. 3 elections for federal parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialists and People's Party form a governing coalition on  
the national level. But the last federal elections in 1995 left the 
Freedom Party nearly even with the People's Party, Austria's No. 2 
political force. 
</P>
<P>
	If Haider's party overtakes the People's Party next month, he is  
expected to push to become part of the next government through a 
coalition with one of the other main parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party has been making gains for more than a decade  
under the leadership of Haider, 49, the governor of Carinthia 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider's popularity rests on anti-foreigner rhetoric, flashes of  
pro-Nazi sentiment and flamboyant revelations of corruption in 
other parties. He has also used keen political judgment to attract 
voters who do not share his views -- recruiting leading 
personalities from sports and industry who do not publicly espouse 
the rightist sentiments of his old-time party colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider has moved away from past praise of Hitler's ``decent  
employment policies'' and descriptions of the Nazi dictator's 
black-uniformed Waffen SS troops as ``men of character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his party exploits Austrian suspicions of foreigners. In  
Vienna, Freedom Party posters promise to stop 
``overforeignization'' and ``misuse of asylum'' -- both buzzwords 
for a compete stop to immigration in a country some residents fear 
is being inundated by cheap workers, crooks and other undesirables 
from Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> La. Tech Coach Majors in Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Jack Bicknell knows a thing or two about  
dramatic endings. 
</P>
<P>
	His Louisiana Tech team shocked Alabama on Saturday, winning  
29-28 on a last-second touchdown thrown by the backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bicknell, son of former Boston College coach Jack Bicknell,  
Jr., it was the second astounding finish of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Bicknell was the Boston College center who snapped the  
ball to Doug Flutie in one of college football's great games. 
Flutie completed a desperation pass that beat Miami with no time 
remaining, sealing his Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicknell relived the moment Saturday, but as a coach.  
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Brian Stallworth, in two plays earlier when  
star Tim Rattay left the game with an ankle injury, converted a 
fourth-and-26 with two seconds left, throwing a 28-yard touchdown 
pass to Sean Cangelosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's, like, exactly the same,'' Bicknell said. ``I looked out  
into the end zone, and it's almost like disbelief. You just don't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the same way it was with Flutie, except I was on my  
butt worried that I had held. Thank God it wasn't called or I'd be 
hiding out in Europe somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Alabama, it was deja vu for Bicknell.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a guy wrote this script for a movie, no one would believe  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama (2-1) was knocked out of the Top 25 after the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	Tech (2-2) was trailing 28-22 and backed against the wall.  
Rattay, the 1998 national leader in total offense, was on his way 
to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	In goes Stallworth, who didn't even get a chance to warm up. He  
gets sacked on his first play. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his next, Stallworth throws into the end zone to the  
triple-covered Cangelosi, who pulls down the catch and ties the 
game 28-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't hear the crowd,'' Stallworth said. ``I knew in my  
heart I had to get the ball in the end zone. That's why I prepare 
all week, why Tim Rattay prepares me all week, why the coaches 
prepare me all week . . . just for possibly one or two plays. 
That's why I have to be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kicker Kevin Pond, who had already missed two extra points,  
wobbled through the winning extra point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the prettiest in the world,'' Pond said. ``But if we  
got it in the end zone, I knew I was going to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first game-winner Stallworth has ever thrown, the  
first Cangelosi has ever caught and the first Pond has ever kicked. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bicknell, it was just another memory to add to his  
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like who do you love more, your son and your daughter,''  
Bicknell said when asked to pick his favorite. ``Right now, this 
one feels pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Thailand To Stop Drawing IMF Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand will stop withdrawing funds  
from the International Monetary Fund since foreign reserves have 
risen to a comfortable level of $32.2 billion, a newspaper said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would signal the first step towards withdrawal from a  
rescue program instituted by the IMF to help Thailand cope with an 
economic crisis which erupted mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation newspaper, quoting an unidentified source, said  
Thailand's partial economic recovery and growing reserves made it 
unnecessary to draw more IMF funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand has withdrawn $14 billion from the total rescue package  
of $17.2 billion, and halting further borrowing would ease its 
interest rate payments to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand and the IMF signed the first letter of intent in August  
1997 after the devaluation of the Thai baht currency, and the 
program is scheduled to end August next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is hopeful that an expected boost in exports and  
increased fiscal spending will further strengthen economic 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Such spending is part of the $22 billion government budget  
approved Saturday by the House of Representatives for the fiscal 
year 1999 which begins Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Raising Giant Moths Is Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- They're sleeping quietly now: two dozen  
giant caterpillars, snug in silk cocoons. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't quiet a few weeks ago. Their jaws made an audible  
ticking noise as they stripped leaves from branches. After six 
weeks of gorging, the big green eating machines were the size of a 
man's finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathering cherry branches for them was a twice-daily chore -- my  
chore. The defoliated branches had to be promptly replaced, even if 
it meant going out with flashlight and pruners on a rainy night. If 
I neglected the chore, I'd have to pluck foraging caterpillars from 
the bookcase, the floor, the dog's bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the summer-long labor of larvae-rearing is over. The reward  
for all this work won't come until springtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The caterpillars, offspring of a cecropia moth I found on a  
sidewalk, will emerge from 25 cocoons next June -- transformed into 
magnificent moths as big as my hand. My two children will take the 
cocoons to school to watch the emergence with their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	With a six-inch wingspan, the cecropia is the largest moth in  
North America. Its wings are charcoal gray with prominent ``eye 
spots'' and bands of orange and white. It has feathery antennae and 
a furry orange-striped body as big as a baby mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecropias are seldom seen, since they emerge but once a year,  
only fly at night and live about a week. They hatch from silk 
cocoons, mate, lay a few hundred eggs and die. They don't eat; they 
don't even have a mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The moths are impressive creatures, even in the larval stage.  
The caterpillars have smooth, green skin, studded with spiny 
tubercles -- red ones on their shoulders, yellow on their backs and 
blue down their sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising them is an engaging, if time-consuming, pastime. For  
some people, it's a hobby that has grown into a business. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several butterfly and moth breeders who sell eggs,  
cocoons and adult specimens over the Internet. Cecropia cocoons 
sell for $3.50 to $10 apiece on various Web sites. A dozen eggs 
usually cost about the same as one cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Breeders who raise moths and butterflies for sale to zoos,  
scientific researchers, schools and private collectors typically 
keep the caterpillars outdoors, on branches or entire trees 
enclosed in sleeves of lightweight fabric. Larvae not protected by 
such an enclosure are likely to fall prey to birds, spiders, stink 
bugs or parasitic wasps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Saroka of Hatboro, Pa., sells cocoons of cecropia, luna,  
and other giant silkmoths at his ``Mike's Magic Moths'' Web site 
(http://members.aol.com/mothsrus/mikemot1.htm). To protect his 
thousands of caterpillars from squirrels, he built a 12-foot-long, 
8-foot-high cage in his half-acre yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The caterpillars feed on 10 to 15 bouquets of 6-foot-long oak  
branches in water buckets inside the cage. Each bouquet is enclosed 
in a net bag. When the leaves are gone in one of the bouquets, it 
takes about 40 minutes to transfer 100-200 caterpillars to fresh 
branches and replace the bag, Saroka said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When 1,000 caterpillars need to be fed, I have to get up at 5  
a.m.,'' said Saroka, a pharmacist whose moth-rearing hobby grew 
into a business four years ago. He hopes to sell 2,000 cocoons this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's scary, the amount of work involved,'' Saroka  
said. ``Right now, I have 1,600 polyphemus caterpillars just 
starting their heavy eating. Every year, it gets to be more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Oehlke, a school administrator on Prince Edward Island,  
Canada, breeds seven species of giant silkmoths, including 
cecropia, as well as other moths and butterflies. He sells cocoons 
and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Oehlke's Web site (www3.pei.sympatico.ca/oehlkew/) gives  
detailed instructions on indoor and outdoor caterpillar culture. 
For instance, if you have a female cecropia moth you'd like to 
breed, he describes how to put her outside in a cage or tethered to 
a branch with a string in order to lure any male in a five-mile 
radius. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Oehlke sold 4,500 moth and butterfly cocoons,  
chrysalids and larvae, he said. Sixty percent went to researchers 
and zoos, the rest to hobbyists. He sells cocoons for $2.50 to $5 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Oehlke has a three-year contract to provide German scientists  
with cocoons of polyphemus moths, a giant silkmoth similar to the 
cecropia. The researchers are studying pheromones, or 
sex-attractant chemicals, and the function of the male's antennae. 
They pay a premium price for male cocoons, which can be identified 
by their smaller size, Oehlke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecropia moths have been used in many research projects,  
including cancer research and studies of juvenile growth hormone, 
blood lymph and rapid cell development enzymes, Oehlke said. 
Entomologists use the cecropia in studies of behavior and 
hybridization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy rearing, but it is very hard labor,'' said Oehlke, who  
takes summers off to raise moths on trees and plants enclosed in 
mesh sleeves. He is often in the field tending them from 7 a.m. 
until sundown. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard work pays off, though. ``The project has helped to put  
my two oldest children through university, and will probably help 
the younger two in a few years,'' Oehlke said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Saroka, the biggest payoff is receiving enthusiastic letters  
from customers, often with photos of smiling children holding giant 
moths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know just how they feel,'' Saroka said. ``It's such a  
satisfying experience, when out of this ratty old cocoon comes a 
delicate, elegant moth. And they're not flitty like butterflies. 
They'll sit right on your finger.''

<HEADLINE> Five New Teams Crack AP Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A whole lotta shakin' went on in this week's Top 25, with  
Tennessee and Wisconsin taking the biggest tumbles and five new 
teams moving into the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, though, didn't move at all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles retained the No. 1 ranking in The Associated  
Press' Top 25 college football poll, but Penn State and Florida, 
after dramatic wins on Saturday, each moved up a spot and are 2-3 
this week. The Volunteers fell five places to No. 7 after their 
23-21 loss to the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was stunned by Cincinnati 17-12 and took the biggest  
hit, sinking 11 spots to No. 20 in balloting by the 70 sports 
writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame is out after losing its third straight, and Marshall  
is in -- for the first time since the AP poll began in 1936. The 
Thundering Herd (3-0) moved in at No. 21, joining newcomers No. 19 
Michigan State, No. 22 Texas, No. 23 Mississippi State and No. 24 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (3-0), a 42-11 winner over NC State, had 59  
first-place votes and 1,738 points, while Penn State (4-0) had 
seven first-place votes and 1,658 points and Florida (3-0) three 
first-place votes and 1,628 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions beat Miami 27-23, with the Hurricanes (2-1)  
falling only one spot to No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Florida is No. 4 Michigan, No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 6  
Nebraska, No. 7 Tennessee, No. 8 Virginia Tech (one first-place 
vote), No. 9 Miami and No. 10 Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (3-0) moved up two spots after its 18-13 win at  
Syracuse, while Nebraska (3-0) fell two places with a 20-13 win 
over Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Ohio State, No. 13  
Purdue, No. 14 Arkansas, No. 15 Kansas State, No. 16 Southern 
California, No. 17 BYU (up eight places), No. 18 UCLA, No. 19 
Michigan State and No. 20 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall (3-0) is followed by Texas, Mississippi State, Air  
Force and NC State, which fell five place to No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the Top 5 are: Florida  
State, Penn State, Florida, Michigan and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State's 23-13 win at Notre Dame put the Spartans (3-0)  
into the AP poll for the first time since the 1998 preseason 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Notre Dame on the Top 25 sidelines are Alabama, Colorado  
State, Arizona and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech upset Alabama 29-28; BYU beat Colorado State  
34-13; Stanford downed Arizona 50-22 and New Mexico State defeated

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises Money for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is raising millions of  
dollars for a general election he's not assured of running in, a 
practice that federal regulators are trying to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore raised $2 million through June 30 for a special type of  
legal fund used by presidential nominees. This fund allows him to 
solicit a second contribution of $1,000 from supporters limited to 
giving a maximum of $1,000 to Gore's Democratic primary campaign. 
It also allows him to bill half of the fund-raising costs to his 
general election fund rather than his campaign account for the 
presidential primaries, which has spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a legal way of allocating certain expenditures to that  
account rather than crediting those expenditures against his 
overall spending limit,'' said Herbert Alexander, professor 
emeritus of political science at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous candidates have used these general election funds to  
skirt federal limits on spending during the primaries. That was one 
reason the Federal Election Commission cited last month when it 
voted to ban fund raising for the general election account until 
June 1 of a presidential election year. 
</P>
<P>
	The change has not taken effect, meaning Gore can continue to  
seek contributions for the 2000 general election. Congress also 
could block the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Al Gore will be the Democratic Party nominee and  
the participant in the general election,'' Gore campaign 
spokeswoman Kiki Moore said. If he does not win the nomination, FCC 
rules require that the money be refunded to the donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's opponent for the Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill  
Bradley, has not set up a general election account. ``The Bradley 
campaign is not raising general election accounting money or 
looking for other so-called legal loopholes to exploit during this 
campaign,'' spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Months before receiving the 1996 Republican presidential  
nomination, Bob Dole reached into his general election fund to pay 
for campaign events and staff salaries and travel. The move helped 
keep him on the campaign trail when his primary campaign had spent 
virtually all it could under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC auditors later said Dole's general election fund improperly  
spent $377,186 that should have been paid for by his primary 
campaign. That was one of the issues raised when the commission 
voted to require Dole's primary and general election campaigns to 
repay $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the FEC said Bill Clinton's primary campaign could  
borrow money from his general election fund while waiting for some 
reimbursements it was due. The Clinton-Gore campaign also raised 
general election money early for the 1996 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates must agree to spending limits if they accept partial  
federal funding of their primary campaigns. In the general 
election, candidates can receive full federal funding for their 
campaigns by agreeing not to raise any private money, except to pay 
the costs of complying with the election rules. For this, they set 
up the special legal funds. Individual contributions are limited to 
$1,000, just as they are for primary and congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have expressed concern that Gore, facing a well-financed  
primary challenge from Bradley, could push up against the spending 
limits -- expected to be around $40 million -- next spring. That is 
what happened to Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican front-runner George W. Bush, who is not  
accepting federal funds for the primaries, can spend as much money 
as he can raise, unencumbered by spending limits. Bush had $30 
million in the bank as of June 30. Gore had $9.4 million, Bradley 
$7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recently used a single fund-raising letter to make a plea  
for donations to both of his funds. Seeking money for the general 
election fund, the letter said that if his primary campaign has to 
cover legal costs, ``we have less to invest in the necessary 
political work necessary to ensure victory in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three other presidential candidates -- Republicans Bush,  
John McCain and Dan Quayle -- have set up these special accounts so 
far, FEC records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised $37,410 through June 30 and Quayle collected $4,117,  
but both candidates simply accepted excess money from donors who 
exceeded the $1,000 contribution limit to their primary campaigns. 
McCain's fund raised nothing.

<HEADLINE> 23 Dead in Thai Factory Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN PA THONG, Thailand (AP) -- A fruit processing factory  
exploded in two huge blasts in Thailand on Sunday, sending debris 
flying more than a mile, killing at least 23 people, and injuring 
more than 120, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast was believed to have been caused by chemicals at the  
factory. TV reports said about 10 tons of ammonium nitrate, a 
chemical used as fertilizer and in some explosives, may have 
exploded. How the chemical was ignited was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	A later ITV television report said potassium chlorate, also used  
in the manufacture of explosives, was found at the site. This 
chemical is not normally used for fertilizer, but farmers in the 
area reportedly found it had speeded up fruit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Police speculated that gas used in drying and preserving fruit  
at the Hong Thai Factory near the northern city of Chiang Mai may 
have caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the factory owner, Chankaew Panyoyai, on charges  
of importing the ammonium nitrate without a permit from the 
Ministry of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	People as far as a mile away were injured by flying debris,  
which also damaged scores of houses. Police feared that all 30 
people working in the factory at the time were killed, but the 
remains of only 23 people were found and identified by sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	ITV reported that 104 people had been admitted to hospitals and  
129 had filed injury reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't happen to my son. I still don't believe it,'' said  
a grieving Buakham Boonma, who lost her only son, 22-year-old Deaw 
Boonma, in the accident. Her son volunteered to work on Sunday to 
earn double pay, about $6. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast left a 50-foot-wide crater near the center of the  
factory, which the explosion reduced to chunks of metal, brick and 
concrete scattered around a four-acre area. 
</P>
<P>
	A large number of structures, including a Buddhist temple and a  
hospital, were badly damaged, and vehicles were destroyed. The roof 
of the temple was torn off by the blast, and houses as far away as 
a mile and a half were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live two kilometers (1.2 miles) from this place and when I  
heard the big bang, windows and other glass in my house were 
shattered,'' said villager Somkuam Chitman. 
</P>
<P>
	ITV reported that a Taiwanese man identified as Lee Hong Tien  
also was in police custody being questioned about the cause of the 
explosion. The station identified Lee as the factory owner, but 
police said that the owner was Chankaew, a Thai citizen, and that 
Lee was an investor in the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee reportedly told police that he was storing 10 tons of  
ammonium nitrate in the factory to distribute to farmers who sell 
him fruit. The factory, about 12 miles south of Chiang Mai, dried 
fruit and packaged it for export. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the factory carried no insurance for its workers.  
They said the government would provide some relief -- the equivalent 
of $641 to the families of victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue teams were initially reluctant to scour the blasted area  
for fear that two large, still intact gas tanks might explode. The 
stench of gas hung in the air at the site hours after the 
explosion.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Fighter jets belonging to  
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia bombed a northern town Sunday, 
killing at least four people, including two children, an opposition 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban fighter plane dropped two bombs, both in civilian  
areas of Taloqan, the capital of northern Takhar province, 150 
miles from the capital Kabul, said Mohammad Abil, an opposition 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.  
</P>
<P>
	Taliban jets have pounded Taloqan in recent weeks killing dozens  
of people, mostly civilians, say the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as people hear the sound of the jets, they try to  
hide,'' Abil said. ``During the last two weeks, the Taliban have 
bombed the city four times killing several civilians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, including Kabul, and  
are fighting the opposition on several fronts in a bid to extend 
their rule over the entire country.

<HEADLINE> McNair's Ruptured Disc Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The ruptured disc in Steve McNair's back  
was found to be worse than expected during surgery Sunday, but the 
Tennessee Titans quarterback is still on target to return for an 
Oct. 31 game against the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Watkins operated on McNair in Los Angeles at the  
University of Southern California, and Dr. Burton Elrod, the 
Titans' team physician, said Watkins found that the disc was 
fragmented larger than they had thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a fragment that big, I'm told it's like putting  
(6-foot-7, 320-pound Titans tackle) Jon Runyan in a Beetle bug,'' 
Elrod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins, who also has operated on the backs of Troy Aikman and  
Joe Montana, repaired the disc, and McNair was resting comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Fisher tried to reach McNair by telephone after the  
Titans beat the Cleveland Browns 26-9, only to get a busy signal. 
McNair, who had started 34 consecutive games before Sunday, will 
start his rehabilitation in Los Angeles before returning to 
Nashville on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his back during training camp and wound up missing  
two weeks of practice and two exhibition games with back spasms and 
stiffness. McNair started the Titans' final exhibition and their 
season opener in which he threw for a career-high 341 yards, but he 
apparently reinjured his back in practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we'd get Steve by without surgery, ... but he was  
in too much pain and we couldn't treat him conservatively,'' Elrod 
said.

<HEADLINE> Brits Can't Block Jets to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Labor Party government said Sunday it is  
powerless to block the delivery to Indonesia of three British-made 
Hawk warplanes now in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawk-209 jets left for Indonesia before the arms embargo was  
imposed by Britain and the rest of the 15-nation European Union on 
Sept. 11 in protest over the crisis in East Timor, Armed Forces 
Minister John Spellar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delivery was taken by the Indonesians before the embargo,  
indeed before the current crisis,'' Spellar said in an interview 
with Sky television. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are in fact in Thailand, they are actually in the  
ownership of the Indonesians, but obviously in the spirit of the 
embargo we would prefer that they did not go to Indonesia,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Sunday Times, which broke the story, said it was told  
that the warplanes were stranded in Bangkok, the Thai capital just 
hours from Jakarta, because one of the pilots fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper also quoted unidentified sources in the  
Indonesian military and at the manufacturers, British Aerospace 
PLC, as saying that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had demanded the 
Hawks stay in Thailand ``although he had no authority to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The planes are part of a $480 million arms order, including 16  
Hawks, approved in 1996 by Britain's Conservative Party government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor government, which says it has a more discriminating  
``ethical'' foreign policy about arms sales, has maintained since 
taking power in 1997 that it could not stop the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	According to recent news reports, last year the Labor government  
used export credit guarantees to keep the sale on track when 
Indonesia threatened to default on payments. 
</P>
<P>
	As the crisis grew in East Timor, the government maintained the  
sale would go ahead, but changed its mind when the United States 
and the EU imposed arms embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellar acknowledged that Hawks had been spotted flying over  
East Timor, wrecked by pro-Indonesia militias following a vote for 
independence. But he said the fighters played no role in the 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death and devastation that's taken place in East Timor is  
very much with old-fashioned technology ... What we are seeing is 
mobs running amok using machetes and small arms,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Guard Retrieves Ball for Sosa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa got the ball from his 60th homer  
Saturday, and he's not giving it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to frame it and put it my trophy room, so when I'm  
retired and invite my friends to my house, I can say that was No. 
60,'' Sosa said after becoming the first player to reach 60 twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's homer off Milwaukee's Jason Bere barely cleared the  
center-field fence and went into a basket just above the 
ivy-covered wall. Security guard Tim Lampa retrieved the ball for 
Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	What if the Hall of Fame asks for the ball?  
</P>
<P>
	``I gave everything I had last year to them. I got the right to

ball during a postgame news conference.

	INABE, Japan (AP) -- South Korean Lee Young-me finished with a  
final round 5-under 67 Sunday to capture the $570,000 Yukijirushi 
Ladies Tokai Classic by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who entered the round four shots back, birdied the first  
two holes to start the round and added five more birdies for the 
day's best round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her first victory of the season and eighth overall on  
tour in Japan. Lee earned $102,000 for the win. 
</P>

on the par-4 15th, and took the lead with another birdie on the 
final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	A demoralizing bogey with three putts on the par-3 16th knocked  
Sakagami out of her share of the lead before Lee birdied the par-5

	With her final round of 75, Sakagami ended up tied for fourth at

<HEADLINE> Hosokawa Wins ANA Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITAHIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- Kazuhiko Hosokawa finished with an  
even-par 72 Sunday for a one-stroke victory over Katsuyoshi Tomori 
and Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki in the $950,000 ANA Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Hosokawa, who entered the final round leading by one shot, never  
trailed on his way to an 11-under 277 total. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 28-year-old Hosokawa, looking for his first triumph in  
two years and fifth overall, had to hold off late charges by 
Tomori, who is playing on the European tour, and Ozaki, Hosokawa's 
golfing mentor and a regular on the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring birdies on two par-5 holes, Nos. 5 and 12,  
Hosokawa bogeyed two of the next three holes to remain at 11-under. 
</P>
<P>
	With a few more holes to go, Hosokawa found his lead cut to just  
one stroke over Tomori, who shot a 66 that featured an eagle on the 
12th and three straight birdies from the 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe'' Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on tour in  
Japan, also finished strong for a 70 with an eagle on the 12th and 
birdies on the final two holes. He was in contention for his third 
title this season and 28th overall on the tour in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	With the winner's check of $190,000, Hosokawa moved past  
previous leader Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki and three others to the top 
of this season's money list with $684,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jumbo,'' the eldest of the Ozaki brothers, retired during  
Friday's second round complaining of lower back pain.

<HEADLINE> Battle Rages at Gettysburg War Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A nasty fight is going on at Gettysburg.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress is threatening to shoot down the National Park  
Service's $40 million plan to build a new visitor's center and 
retail stores inside Gettysburg National Military Park, even though 
taxpayers would not spend one cent on construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute could leave a collection of Civil War uniforms and  
other artifacts vulnerable to further deterioration. It also could 
halt plans to broaden the scope of exhibits and restore the main 
site of the July 1863 battle that is generally considered the 
turning point of the Civil War in favor of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The park will essentially stand still and not be able to  
improve anything,'' Assistant Park Superintendent John McKenna said 
as he walked along the former Union battle line, now topped with 
asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials, business owners, historians, preservationists  
and Civil War buffs have argued over details of the new center for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service wants to replace antiquated quarters with a  
center that could hold more visitors and offer a better environment 
for artifacts. With three times the exhibit space, the park also 
could devote more attention to telling the story of the entire war, 
not just the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy centers on the inclusion of a Civil War movie  
theater, a restaurant and retail stores to help the developer pay 
for construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the commercial areas would cheapen the  
significance of hallowed ground and could draw tourists away from 
restaurants, gift shops and other businesses near the current 
center. The new structures would be a half-mile away, on grassy and 
wooded lands largely untouched since the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the potential for what amounts to a  
commercial mall in the middle of the battlefield,'' said Walter 
Powell, president of the Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after holding 54 public meetings and receiving some 4,000  
letters and other comments from the public, the Park Service stood 
firm in its concept for a new, privately funded center. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency released final plans in June, angering opponents.  
</P>
<P>
	``From the very onset, this plan for the visitors center was ...  
forced down the throats of the citizens,'' said Eric Uberman, whose 
wax museum is near the current center. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding sympathizers in Congress, opponents persuaded the House  
to vote 220-206 this summer to block any spending on the Park 
Service plan. A version of the bill in the Senate does not include 
the provision, and the two chambers will have to resolve the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials say the government-commercial partnership is the  
only way to get around the agency's $5 billion backlog of repairs 
and maintenance projects nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The main visitor's center building, built as a residence in 1921  
and acquired by the Park Service in 1971, was never meant to be 
permanent. It was designed for fewer than half of the 1.8 million 
tourists the park gets each year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to replacing that building and one next door, park  
officials also want to restore Ziegler's Grove and the rest of the 
Union battle line by adding fences, planting orchards and 
eliminating trees from once-grassy fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has dropped plans for a large-screen IMAX theater in  
favor of a traditional theater and cut in half the size of a 
planned cafeteria. Critics say the Park Service did not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., who has  
tried to broker peace in the nearby community of 7,000. ``It 
doesn't matter how many hearings you have, there's going to be an 
element that, no matter where you go with it, is going to be 
dissatisfied.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd's Aftermath: Floods, Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- The power is intermittent, much of the  
county is completely under water, roads are closed, grocery store 
shelves are empty and there's little gasoline available. 
</P>
<P>
	Can it get worse? Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenville, a city of 44,000, faces still worse flooding when  
the Tar River crests Monday. And more rain could fall Monday and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is figuring out their own survival,'' Carl Campbell  
said Sunday as the river inched closer to his home and neighbors 
tried to save their belongings from their flooded homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd saturated eastern North Carolina with 20 inches  
of rain last week on its way up the East Coast and flooding has 
virtually shut down the coastal plain east of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters were used to search for stranded  
people and to shuttle food to stricken towns where grocery shelves 
are bare. Drinkable water had to be rushed to several counties 
where wastewater treatment systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 roads, including parts of Interstates 95 and 40, were  
still closed Sunday, and 6,400 people remained in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people in North Carolina are confirmed dead,  
including a Pinetops family lost when they tried to escape their 
flooded home in a boat early Thursday. Others are unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among the at least 49 people killed from the Bahamas  
into New England. And beyond North Carolina, thousands of people 
were still without electricity and phone service in parts of 
Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had declared the eastern two-thirds of North  
Carolina a disaster area and planned to tour flooded areas Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the magnitude of it,'' Tom Ditt, a state emergency  
management spokesman, said Sunday. ``You have people who live in 
areas that have never flooded, and now their houses are 
underwater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River at Tarboro, about 20 miles northwest of  
Greenville, was already estimated at 43 feet and still rising. The 
old record for the city was just 34 feet, set back in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
	Ominously, a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico slogged  
northward Sunday, with a possibility of strengthening into Tropical 
Storm Harvey. However, forecasters were optimistic it would bring 
only a half-inch or less of rain to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``More rain on top of what they've already experienced just  
compounds the problems and misery they've already been through,'' 
said state emergency management spokesman Tom Hegele. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tarboro High School in Edgecombe County, where about 3,000  
people took shelter, volunteer Hattie Stocks called the situation 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no (running) water at all, and the water's still  
rising some. And I can't tell you how many dead we have. They're 
still finding bodies floating,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pitt County, where Greenville is located, and nearby  
Edgecombe, all water was undrinkable. Some shelters had low 
supplies of food and water and no running water or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery stores in Nash, Edgecombe, Bertie and Pitt counties were  
running low, and a Berlin-style airlift was set up to deliver food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenville was flooded along a 3-mile-long stretch of the Tar  
River. Only the roofs of some two-story, riverside apartment 
buildings showed above the water. One apartment roof had a sign 
painted on a sheet: ``Send beer. Hi Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also flooded was the city's Town Commons park, where water stood  
almost to the top of the amphitheater and street lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``People throw the Frisbee on a normal day, drink beer. Have a  
happy life,'' said Sgt. Conley Mangum of the state Wildlife 
Resources Commission. ``Not today.''

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Film 'Streaks' Into First / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a matchup of debut films, the Martin  
Lawrence comedy ``Blue Streak'' beat Kevin Costner's latest 
baseball movie to win the weekend box-office pennant, according to 
industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blue Streak'' took in $19.2 million and Costner's ``For Love  
of the Game'' opened in second place with $14 million, according to 
figures released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruce Willis ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' was third with  
$11.2 million. It climbed past ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged 
Me'' as the year's No. 2 box office draw behind ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' ``Sixth Sense'' has grossed 
$213.2 million since opening Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top movie, the supernatural thriller  
``Stigmata,'' slipped to No. 4 with $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blue Streak,'' about a jewel thief posing as a cop to retrieve  
a diamond stashed in a police station, was Lawrence's first solo 
triumph at the box office. He previously had No. 1 openings as a 
co-star with Eddie Murphy in ``Life'' and with Will Smith in ``Bad 
Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner plays an aging pitcher in ``For Love of the Game,'' his  
third baseball movie after ``Bull Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For Love of the Game'' may have been hurt by Costner's  
reluctance to help publicize the film, said Robert Bucksbaum, a 
film analyst with Reel Source Inc. Costner did some media 
interviews but devoted much of his time to criticizing Universal 
for editing scenes to get the movie down from an R rating to PG-13. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reminds me of a baseball player making $10 million,''  
Bucksbaum said. ``He should take some time to sign some autographs 
once in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The critically acclaimed ``American Beauty,'' playing in just 16  
theaters, was No. 11 with $841,000 for the weekend, upping its 
total to $1 million since opening Wednesday. The movie averaged a 
phenomenal $52,563 a theater, compared with a $7,020 average in 
2,735 theaters for ``Blue Streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in a dark satire  
of suburban life. 
</P>

	The movie so far is playing only in bigger cities. Its  
disturbing examination of marital fidelity, parental violence, 
homophobia and drug use ``could be problematic in other parts of 
the country,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Inc., which tracks movie ticket sales. ``Then again, you 
can't underestimate audiences in the Midwest or wherever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers for ``American Beauty'' rivaled those of ``The Blair  
Witch Project,'' which averaged $63,812 per theater while playing 
on 31 screens in July the weekend before wide release. ``Blair 
Witch'' has grossed $137.6 million.

	``American Beauty'' distributor DreamWorks is expanding the  
movie to about 500 theaters next weekend and 1,200 to 1,400 the 
following Friday, said Jim Tharp, the studio's distribution chief.

<HEADLINE> Bills Defeat Jets 17-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde often seems to be  
watching when Doug Flutie does his one-man gang act. 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly was watching Sunday night as the Buffalo Bills'  
36-year-old quarterback beat the New York Jets 17-3 with his arms, 
his legs, and even his 179-pound body, sacrificed in a crushing 
block that sprang Antowain Smith on a 12-yard run that set up the 
game's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's a player. He makes plays,'' Bills coach Wade Phillips  
said in something of an understatement. ``He made them throughout 
the game, even blocking. We don't expect him to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure Flutie had help against a team that was missing six  
starters, including Testaverde, the quarterback who also was on the 
sidelines as a redshirt for Miami when Flutie threw the ``Hail 
Mary'' that beat the Hurricanes for Boston College in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, held to 7 yards on six carries by Indianapolis last week,  
gained 113 on 30 carries Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills nose tackle Ted Washington and linebacker Sam Cowart  
stuffed Jerald Sowell on fourth-and-inches at the goal line when 
the game was scoreless in the second quarter. Overall, the Bills 
gained 224 yards on the ground against a New York defense missing 
nose tackle Jason Ferguson after being held to 47 in a 31-14 loss 
at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells of the Jets (0-2) didn't blame injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I've been disappointed in the team,''  
said Parcells, who also was angry after the second exhibition game 
with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't injuries. I wouldn't use that as an excuse. Poor  
playing. That's what we needed to overcome. We had a nose tackle 
out but they did a good job running and I give them credit for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie credited the running and the defense.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we're running the ball well, it opens up other things,''  
Flutie said. ``It creates an attitude and temper. The offensive 
line came in with the attitude that we're going to show you, we're 
going to show the league that we can run. We hammer the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Phillips pointed to the fourth-down play that set the Bills  
off on a 99-yard drive the other way for the first score. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fourth-down play was a big play for us. To take it all the  
way down the field really changed the game for us,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was when Flutie first shined as the Bills broke open a  
lethargic game and giving Buffalo (1-1) all the points it would 
need. 
</P>
<P>
	First he ran for 14 and 24 yards on the 99-yard drive that came  
after Washington and Cowart's play. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on a third-and-1 from the Jets' 13, Smith ran right, then  
broke left, pursued by Mo Lewis, New York's 257-pound Pro Bowl 
linebacker. As Lewis lunged for Smith, Flutie leveled him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for a defensive back,'' Flutie said. ``But then  
I saw Mo behind me so I headed for him. I didn't think he saw me, 
so I was going to hit him high. But then I chickened out and just 
cut him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Flutie: ``A couple of linemen came over to congratulate  
me. I expect that attitude from everyone on the field. I don't 
block all the time but sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself and 
your body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith got to the 1 and scored on the next play to make it 7-0.,  
</P>
<P>
	Then, on the first possession of the third quarter, Flutie took  
the Bills on a 57-yard, 8-play drive, that he capped with a 24-yard 
scoring run on which he rolled right, zigged left and then went 
straight up the middle for the score that made it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mirer, replacing Testaverde who tore his Achilles' tendon  
in the opener, was 13-of-28 for 121 yards for an offense that never 
really got going. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as we went along, I got comfortable with what we were  
doing,'' Mirer said. ``But we couldn't put any drives back to 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, meanwhile, was 15-of-25 for 160 yards, and rushed five  
times for 69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for history's sake, add one block on a 257-pound  
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* The Jets have opened four of the last five seasons 0-2. But  
last season they came back to win the AFC East at 12-4. ... Ed 
Abramoski, who spent 35 years as the Bills' trainer, was honored 
before the game by having his name placed on the team's wall of 
fame. ... Flutie is now 11-1 as a starter at home. ... Flutie's two 
24-yard runs in the second quarter were his longest in the NFL and 
his 67 yards on the ground were the most in his NFL career. ... The 
three points the Bills allowed were the fewest since Sept. 20, 
1992, when they shut out Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Sehorn Not Ready To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The much-anticipated return of  
Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn was put off yet another week when 
New York did not dress him for Sunday's home opener against the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn, who has been plagued by a hamstring injury since late  
July, has not played in a game since suffering a season-ending knee 
injury in an exhibition game against the Jets in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year veteran missed all of training camp with the  
hamstring problem. After practicing this week, Sehorn felt so good, 
he said his chances of playing were 85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel obviously didn't feel the same way on  
Sunday.

Garden, where she sang ``Happy Birthday,'' is valued at up to about 
$15,000, the auctioneers, Christie's, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's license, issued in Los Angeles in February 1956  
when she was 29, includes the information: ``Eyes -- blue, hair -- 
blonde.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clothes, movie scripts and books are also in the London  
exhibition, which runs until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will never grow old and will always look fabulous,'' said  
Christie's director Meredith Etherington-Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items on display included a sleeveless cocktail dress from  
Monroe's 1961 movie ``The Misfits,'' and a prompt book for the film 
``Let's Make Love.''

<HEADLINE>  Cardinals Plan To Challenge Sosa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Home run leader Sammy Sosa should get his cuts  
in the six games left against the St. Louis Cardinals and his 
closest challenger, Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa complained last season when teams wouldn't  
pitch to McGwire, who hit his 57th and 58th homers and trails Sosa 
by three heading into a three-game series Monday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to pitch him like he's dangerous,'' La Russa said.  
``That means you don't go four balls and over to first. But you 
don't say, `Here's a room-service fastball and have some fun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said the only time Sosa would be intentionally walked  
is if there was an open base in a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pitch him tough, you expand his strike zone,'' La Russa  
said. ``That's what they do to McGwire, except he's got patience to 
take the walk. So, we're going to work him over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa and McGwire each have four homers against each other's  
team. Sosa is 9-for-22 with 10 RBIs and McGwire is 7-for-21 with 11 
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept To Test Experimental Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government engineers soon will get to test a  
family-sized experimental car from Ford Motor Co. that is powered 
by a diesel-electric engine and can run for 60 miles on a gallon of 
fuel -- double the distance of a typical car. 
</P>
<P>
	The P2000 LSR, which is expected to be delivered next month to  
the Energy Department for testing, was developed as part of a 
program intended to foster development of technologies for a 
mass-produced family car with improved fuel efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is the first company to deliver a full-size hybrid-powered  
car that engineers can drive daily and test its engineering. Other 
automakers are working on similar fuel-efficient hybrid cars or 
have produced working models. 
</P>
<P>
	The P2000 has the passenger room, trunk space and acceleration  
of a Taurus, with 40 percent less weight. The car is made mostly of 
aluminum and other lightweight materials, and weights about 2,000 
pounds, Ford engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has not said it would put the car into production in the  
future. Domestic automakers are struggling with the cost of such a 
vehicle and have kept their research costs confidential. For 
instance, aluminum is three to five times as expensive to use as 
steel, pound for pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not some sort of high-expense low-volume small vehicle  
we're working on. We want to hit the mainstream of the market with 
a family sedan. That's a little bit of a tougher order,'' said Mike 
Tamor, Ford's project leader of hybrid electric vehicle design. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine has an important advantage over the hydrogen fuel  
cell future cars some other automakers are designing: It can be 
refueled at a gas station that also sells diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's significant is that we have a full-size family sedan  
that gets double the mileage of today's typical automobile and is a 
practical car for today's needs,'' said Dan Reicher, the Energy 
Department's assistant secretary of the office of energy efficiency 
and renewable energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota already has a hybrid gas-electric vehicle on the road in  
Japan, called the Prius. The four-seat compact car gets 66 mpg, and 
Toyota expects to introduce it into the U.S. market next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Energy Department officials are excited about other  
high-mileage hybrids, they say the P2000 is different because it 
aims for the mass market with a full-size car that seats five 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the knowledge we have developed in this hybrid program is  
definitely going very heavily toward supporting product 
development'' for the mass market, Tamor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and General Motors Corp. have said they do not plan to have  
a hybrid car in production until the next century. One hurdle left 
is making sure a mass-marketed, fuel-efficient family car is about 
as affordable as today's cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to be out there in large numbers, it has to be at a  
price that the customers are willing to pay,'' Tamor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is delivering the car under the Hybrid Propulsion Systems  
Development Program, a joint program with the Energy Department 
that domestic automakers undertook to double the fuel economy of a 
midsize sedan in city driving -- or to around 50 mpg, department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department since has set its sights on a more ambitious goal  
of a family car that gets 80 mpg. But Reicher calls the 60 mpg car 
``a major step'' toward that goal, demonstrating practical 
technologies that can be used in mainstream cars in the coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG is expected to have a hybrid car ready for  
the Energy Department to look at in December, Energy officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford hybrid power system involves a small diesel engine that  
does most of the low-speed driving while an electric battery is 
used to help with climbing hills and sudden acceleration. The 
battery also recaptures about half of the energy used in braking. 
</P>
<P>
	To conserve even more power, the engine turns off while the car  
is idling at traffic lights. When a driver steps on the 
accelerator, the car restarts in less than a third of a second, or 
about the blink of an eye, Tamor said.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens' Malakhov Out 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Canadiens defenseman Vladimir Malakhov  
will miss four months after tearing a ligament in his right knee in 
an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Malakhov was injured Friday night against Edmonton and the team  
made the announcement about the seriousness of the injury Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Malakhov, who led Montreal defensemen in scoring last season  
with 34 points in 62 games, is to have surgery Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked me about the worst-case scenario, this  
would have to have been right up there,'' Montreal coach Alain 
Vigneault said. ``At the beginning of the season, you know you're 
going to get injuries, but you just hope that they're not serious 
and that they are not to key people. It's an enormous loss. When 
Vladimir is on his game, he's dominant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malakhov was hurt when Edmonton enforcer Georges Laraque fell on  
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens are also missing veteran defenseman Patrice  
Brisebois, who has a back injury. Versatile forward Benoit Brunet 
is out of action for at least two months with a back injury and 
center Saku Koivu has only begun skating after undergoing knee 
surgery in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be hard to replace Vladimir,'' defenseman Igor Ulanov  
said. ``He was a total player on the team. He can play both 
offensive and defensive. Not many players in the league can do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> China Arrests More in Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Members of a popular meditation group are defying  
a two-month-old ban by China's communist government, prompting a 
renewed wave of arrests, state media and a human rights group 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in nine cities have detained at least 300 practitioners  
of Falun Gong in the past week, ten of them on Sunday in a park in 
Changsha, a southern provincial capital, the Hong Kong-based 
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While most are being held for 5 to 15 days as detention  
regulations allow, police are beating and mistreating those Falun 
Gong followers who insist on continuing their banned practice in 
prison, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	One follower -- Zhang Chunqing -- claimed guards bound her arms  
and legs with a 22-pound rusty chain, taped her mouth shut and 
would not let her eat or go to the bathroom for 48 hours, the group 
said. It added that by the time she was released recently from the 
Nanguanling detention center in the northeastern port city of 
Dalian, sores on her wrists and legs were infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Information Center's account could not be independently  
confirmed. Falun Gong followers overseas have frequently reported 
accounts of police mistreatment. But since the crackdown began in 
mid-July, thousands if not tens of thousands of Falun Gong members 
have been detained and forced into meetings to recant their 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong teaches a blend of Buddhist and Taoist ideals and  
slow-motion exercises that are supposed to promote health and 
morality. It has drawn 2 million to 70 million followers -- 
according to different government estimates -- since being founded 
by an ex-government grain clerk seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders banned Falun Gong, fearing that the group's  
popularity and high level of organization could challenge the 
ruling Communist Party's claim to be the legitimate representative 
of China's people. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't thoroughly destroy the organizational setup of  
'Falun Gong' and instead allow it to develop and expand, this will 
severely interfere with the wholehearted efforts to modernize by 
all leading organs and people nationwide,'' the Communist Party's 
authoritative newspaper, People's Daily, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreover, they will ultimately become an organized force that  
will publicly contend with our party and government in politics,'' 
People's Daily said in an editorial that called for a ``complete 
victory'' over Falun Gong. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying the editorial, a brief news report said that police  
in the southern city of Nanchang on Thursday acted on a tip and 
broke up a meeting of 20 Falun Gong followers. They were plotting 
acts of protest, People's Daily said.

<HEADLINE> E.Timor Rebel Leader Leaves Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor rebel leader Jose Alexandre  
``Xanana'' Gusmao has left Indonesia for Darwin, Australia, 
officials said Sunday, raising speculation he would return soon to 
his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, widely expected to become the first president of  
independent East Timor, left Jakarta late Saturday night and headed 
for Darwin, Australia, said Peter Norris, first secretary of the 
chancery at the British Embassy in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern Australian city has become the staging area for  
peacekeeping troops heading to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The charismatic leader had been staying at the British Embassy  
since the Indonesian government released him from house arrest 
earlier this month. He had served nearly seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Jakarta militiamen and Indonesian military troops have  
terrorized the half-island since its people voted for independence 
in a U.N.-sponsored referendum Aug. 30. An unknown number of people 
have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have fled the looting, 
burning and rioting in East Timor's towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao will lead a meeting in Darwin next week on East Timor's  
transition from a province of Indonesia to a sovereign nation, 
Indonesia's Antara news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	His Indonesian lawyer said he left his British sanctuary because  
he was worried about his security if he remained in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could endanger his life if he stayed longer in the British  
Embassy compound. The compound is inside Indonesian territory,'' 
said Hendardi, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Protest marchers in Jakarta in the past week have angrily  
denounced Gusmao, calling for him to be hanged and pasting the 
front of the British Embassy with anti-Gusmao posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendardi said Gusmao would likely not go until peacekeeping  
forces had quelled violence there. ``It would be good if (Gusmao) 
can finally go to East Timor to help with reconciliation,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his arrest, Gusmao led a two-decade guerrilla war against  
the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Indonesia invaded the 
former Portuguese colony in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Infoseek Exec Accused of Soliciting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An executive of the Web portal site Infoseek  
was arrested for investigation of soliciting sex with a teen-ager 
over the Internet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick J. Naughton was arrested Thursday by FBI agents at the  
Santa Monica Pier, U.S. Attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit filed in federal court accused Naughton, an  
executive vice president of Infoseek, of interstate travel with the 
intent of having sex with a minor, Mrozek said. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleged that Naughton, who oversees the Walt Disney Co.'s Go  
Network Internet sites, sent lewd messages in an Internet chat room 
to a male FBI agent posing as a 13-year-old girl, the Los Angeles 
Times said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Naughton, 34, of Seattle, was released Friday pending an Oct. 12  
arraignment, Mrozek said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from Naughton. A message left for a Patrick  
J. Naughton in Seattle wasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply shocked and disturbed by this. We're looking  
into the matter,'' Infoseek spokeswoman Terrie Prosper told the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from Buena Vista Internet Group in Burbank  
and the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney acquired a stake in Infoseek last year and worked with it  
to create the Go Network, which competes with other portal sites to 
offer Web searches, entertainment and personalized news. In July, 
Disney said it was acquiring all of Infoseek.

<HEADLINE> Commander: Troops Set for E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- International troops are to be sent to  
East Timor imminently and will be prepared to respond to violence 
from pro-Jakarta militias, the force's commander said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove was speaking before flying to Dili to  
meet with local commanders of the Indonesian army to discuss 
deployment plans for the U.N. approved peacekeeper force in East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The force will go in prepared,'' Cosgrove said. ``Prepared for  
illegal, undisciplined groups to use violence but hoping that we do 
not ourselves have to react that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the first troops, made up mainly of Australians, was  
ready to leave ``very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said the force would have 3,200 troops on the ground in  
East Timor within a week. He said the mission would likely last 
several months before making way for a likely follow-up United 
Nations peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-vessel fleet set sail from Darwin, Australia, on Saturday  
for East Timor, the vanguard of the peacekeeping force, which is 
eventually expected to number around 8,000 troops from a score of 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove did not specify when the bulk of the force was to start  
for East Timor. After his advance team arrives there Sunday, troops 
are expected to start pouring in on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations approved the peacekeeping force to bring  
peace to the half-island territory, where pro-Jakarta militiamen 
have been on a rampage since the East Timorese chose independence 
from Indonesia in an Aug. 30 referendum.

<HEADLINE> Parade Audit Shows $60K Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An annual audit of the organization that  
puts on the Rose Bowl and New Year's Day Rose Parade has found 
$60,000 missing from the coffers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament of Roses officials declined comment, but confirmed  
that chief financial officer Richard Quattropane resigned on July 
30, after the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they did the audit this year, they discovered a lot of  
money was missing, and there were a lot of inconsistencies in what 
he was writing down or ledgering,'' police Lt. Keith Jones said 
Friday. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors have now begun taking another look at previous years'  
records to see if there are other discrepancies, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quattropane is not listed in directory assistance and could not  
be located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament spends about $6.5 million to put on the annual  
football game and parade of colorful floats covered in flowers and 
other plants. The organization made a $263,000 profit in 1998, but 
lost money in the two previous years.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Didn't Consult Army on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley said Sunday he did not consult  
with military officials prior to telling a gay and lesbian magazine 
that homosexuals should be permitted to serve openly in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a statement of my personal views, my personal belief  
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military,'' the 
Democratic presidential candidate said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Advocate, released last week, the  
former New Jersey senator said gays also should be protected under 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also said he would not support a California ballot  
question that seeks to outlaw same-sex marriages, although he said 
he remains opposed to such unions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked in the wide-ranging ABC interview whether he  
consulted with senior military officials about why they view the 
armed services differently from other areas of government where 
gays serve openly. Bradley said he did not and did not see a need 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said that gay Americans should be allowed to serve in  
the military if they can serve the country as policemen, nuclear 
scientists, doctors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been gays in the military as long as there's been a  
military. They've only had to hide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the  
Democratic nomination, described the Clinton's administration 
``don't ask, don't tell,'' policy on gays in the military as a near 
failure. The 1993 policy allows homosexuals to serve in the 
military as long as they do not discuss their sexual orientation 
openly. Military superiors also cannot inquire about the sexual 
orientation of their troops. 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, Bradley said:  
</P>
<P>
	--Illegal drug use by a presidential candidate mattered. ``I do  
think that if someone violated the law, they should state whether 
they did or not,'' said Bradley, who has used marijuana ``but never 
cocaine.'' Questions about possible past illegal drug use hounded 
GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush last month until he 
acknowledged -- without further elaboration -- that he had not used 
illegal drugs within the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The booming economy was more responsible for substantial drops  
in the number of people on welfare than a 1996 reform law. Bradley 
said he would suggest further improvements to the system later on 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	--He would have voted against the two articles of impeachment  
against President Clinton stemming from the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation. ``I didn't think that the punishment was 
proportionate with ... what he did.''

<HEADLINE> Deck Collapses at Wedding Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, Ore. (AP) -- A wooden deck packed with guests at a wedding  
collapsed shortly after the ceremony, killing a California woman 
and injuring 25 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims in the accident at the bride's home Saturday  
plunged about 40 feet to the bottom of a bluff near the Little 
North Santiam River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went down in the blink of an eye,'' said Holly Williams,  
who had played her flute during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Orleta Larue, 70, of Crescent City, Calif., died in the fall,  
officials said. The most seriously injured -- Agnes Mink, 84, and 
Merle Neufeld, 81, both of Salem -- were both in critical condition 
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three other people, including the bride and groom, were  
treated at two local hospitals for injuries ranging from a broken 
collarbone to cuts. Most were reported in fair or good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Hansen of Boise, the bride's daughter, said she and other  
family members were getting ready to pose for photos when she 
gathered her children on steps near the deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said guys, stay over here,'' Hansen recalled. Seconds later,  
the deck gave way, and she and her children jumped back to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I turned back around, the deck was gone,'' she  
said. ``I saw some legs flying but the rest of the people were 
already down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said her mother had the deck built about five years ago  
and that it had passed a recent inspection. The cause was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons is about 25 miles southeast of Salem.

<HEADLINE> Pope Denounces Extreme Nationalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, journeying to the  
Balkans Sunday to honor a bishop who preached patriotism and 
tolerance, decried the dangers, past and present, of nationalism 
gone extreme and prayed that horrors such as mass revenge killings 
never again occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year after his last trip to the Balkans, the pope  
was back, this time visiting a corner of Slovenia near the Austrian 
and Hungarian borders to beatify Anton Martin Slomsek, a 
19th-century bishop who promoted Slovenes' language and sense of 
identity during Austrian domination. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's last trip to the Balkans took him to Croatia in  
October, and he first came to Slovenia in 1996. Slomsek is a 
national hero in this former Yugoslav republic, where more than 80 
percent of the people are Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 79-year-old pope has difficulty walking, and travel  
often tires him, Sunday's day trip underscored his desire to be 
with his flock when he can and to personally press his message of 
peace and reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving from Rome, the pontiff walked gingerly down the stairs  
of his aircraft, one hand on the railing, his cane in the other, 
and was driven to the Mass site on a grassy expanse near a 
15th-century castle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun burned through foggy skies and a stiff breeze three times  
ripped off the pope's skullcap. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff lamented that the Balkans have been ``marked  
unfortunately in these years by struggles and violence, by extreme 
nationalism, by savage ethnic cleansing and wars among peoples and 
cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slomsek, who died in 1862, showed it was ``possible to be  
sincere patriots and with equal sincerity live together and work 
with peoples of other nationalities, of other cultures, of other 
religions,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, just a few miles away from the castle, highway workers  
digging a trench discovered thousands of skeletons, believed to be 
those of Croats killed by vengeful antifascists in the convulsive 
aftermath of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	During the war, Croats sided with occupying German Nazis and  
perhaps hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and 
antifascist Croats were killed in Croat-run concentration camps. At 
war's end, thousands of pro-fascist Croats were killed by avenging 
Communist partisans. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the many Croat Catholics at the ceremony, John Paul  
recalled ``the innocent victims of wars and of totalitarian 
regimes, and in a particular way, those who were heaped into the 
common graves recently discovered near Maribor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May such dramatic events never ever repeat themselves,'' John  
Paul said to the applause of the crowd of more than 100,000 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope only mentioned Maribor by name, but his words clearly  
referred to the ethnic cleansing this decade that bloodied Croatia, 
Bosnia, and, most recently, Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians were 
targeted by Yugoslav Serbs, then blamed for revenge killings of 
Serbs after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``His words should reach Kosovo, but above all the Serbs,'' said  
Ana Milavec, a 17-year-old Slovene attending the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	When Slovenia proclaimed independence from Yugoslavia, religion  
-- suppressed under communists -- was legal again and the church 
sought to regain land and buildings, such as Betnava castle near 
the Mass site, which had been seized by the Communists after World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1992 law, the castle is to be returned, but the transfer  
appears bogged down in bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the briefest of the 88 trips abroad the pope has made  
in his 20-year papacy, excluding a five-hour visit in 1982 to San 
Marino, a tiny republic inside Italy. At 12 hours, 35 minutes, the 
Slovenia pilgrimage was officially 15 minutes shorter than a day 
trip to Tunisia in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope plans to visit India and the former Soviet republic of  
Georgia in November, and the Vatican is also trying to arrange a 
trip to Iraq, possibly in December.

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad's Puerto Rican Fans Go Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A deafening roar punctuated by wolf  
whistles and high-pitched screams from young women shook the 
airwaves as the decision was announced: Felix Trinidad, King of the 
Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito! Tito!'' the refrain carried over the roofs of the  
historic colonial city and was taken up on the streets where people 
paraded in hooting cars and bands of youngsters waving Puerto 
Rico's single Star and Stripes celebrated their native son's 
victory early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On highways outside the old city, miles of traffic stalled with  
people hanging out of cars, waving flags and fists and screaming 
for their hero: ``Tito is our champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unbelievable for Puerto Rico!'' shouted Carlos Colon  
at Coaches sports bar in San Juan, where young men mounted the bar 
and started dancing on tables. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend sat glumly, possibly the only person in the bar  
who supported Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many, Colon viewed Trinidad's majority decision over the  
Mexican American as a nationalist victory for this U.S. Caribbean 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro Rossello wants to make us Americans. But Tito shows  
we're Puerto Ricans,'' said an older man referring to the bid by 
the governor to make Puerto Rico the 51st state of the union. 
``Trinidad won because he's Puerto Rican and Puerto Ricans are 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Borincua! Borincua!'' people yelled, using the Taino Indian  
name for the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people crowded into standing-room only bars that  
charged $15 to watch the fight on big screens. At the Capitol, the 
government paid $72,000 to mount 16 giant screens and gave away 
tickets to 8,000 people who watched it in the open, cooled by 
breezes off the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The fervor and yells for Trinidad became more subdued after the  
opening, when De La Hoya, the WBC champion, got in more and more 
jabs and seemed assured of victory over the Puerto Rican IBF 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Trinidad landed a punch, people shouted: ``Tito!  
Tito!'' and waved their flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time De La Hoya landed a punch there was sorrowful silence  
or boos. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood picked up as Trinidad landed some crashing rights to  
the head in the final rounds. `Hit him! Hit him! Knock his head 
off,'' fans yelled, willing Trinidad to perform one of the 
knockouts for which he is famous on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory announcement brought a roar of approval. People  
kissed and hugged each other. It was the signal for a big fiesta. 
People skateboarded down Ashford Avenue in Condado, waving flags.

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad's Puerto Rican Fans Go Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A deafening roar punctuated by wolf  
whistles and high-pitched screams from young women shook the 
airwaves as the decision was announced: Felix Trinidad, King of the 
Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito! Tito!'' the refrain carried over the roofs of the  
historic colonial city and was taken up on the streets where people 
paraded in hooting cars and bands of youngsters waving Puerto 
Rico's single Star and Stripes celebrated their native son's 
victory early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On highways outside the old city, miles of traffic stalled with  
people hanging out of cars, waving flags and fists and screaming 
for their hero: ``Tito is our champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unbelievable for Puerto Rico!'' shouted Carlos Colon  
at Coaches sports bar in San Juan, where young men mounted the bar 
and started dancing on tables. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend sat glumly, possibly the only person in the bar  
who supported Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many, Colon viewed Trinidad's majority decision over the  
Mexican American as a nationalist victory for this U.S. Caribbean 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro Rossello wants to make us Americans. But Tito shows  
we're Puerto Ricans,'' said an older man referring to the bid by 
the governor to make Puerto Rico the 51st state of the union. 
``Trinidad won because he's Puerto Rican and Puerto Ricans are 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Borincua! Borincua!'' people yelled, using the Taino Indian  
name for the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people crowded into standing-room only bars that  
charged $15 to watch the fight on big screens. At the Capitol, the 
government paid $72,000 to mount 16 giant screens and gave away 
tickets to 8,000 people who watched it in the open, cooled by 
breezes off the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The fervor and yells for Trinidad became more subdued after the  
opening, when De La Hoya, the WBC champion, got in more and more 
jabs and seemed assured of victory over the Puerto Rican IBF 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Trinidad landed a punch, people shouted: ``Tito!  
Tito!'' and waved their flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time De La Hoya landed a punch there was sorrowful silence  
or boos. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood picked up as Trinidad landed some crashing rights to  
the head in the final rounds. `Hit him! Hit him! Knock his head 
off,'' fans yelled, willing Trinidad to perform one of the 
knockouts for which he is famous on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory announcement brought a roar of approval. People  
kissed and hugged each other. It was the signal for a big fiesta. 
People skateboarded down Ashford Avenue in Condado, waving flags. 
Traffic came to a standstill. In bars, music blasted and people 
rocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans tore down posters and waved around the pictures of the two  
fighters that advertised: ``The Match of Destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the best thing that's happened this millennium as we go,  
go, go with Tito!'' declared Monica Irrizary, 22.

<HEADLINE> Associates of Saudi Prince Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Five associates of Saudi Prince Turki bin  
Abdel Aziz were sentenced to prison Sunday for attacking an 
off-duty policeman in a Cairo hotel, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cairo court sentenced the prince's brother-in-law, Fahd  
Mohammed al-Fassi, his Syrian driver and a friend to six months in 
prison with labor, the officials said. The three are in police 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Turki Mohammed al-Fassi, another brother-in-law of Prince Turki,  
was sentenced in absentia to one year in prison. An Austrian 
bodyguard, whose name was not available, was sentenced in absentia 
to two years in prison and a fine of $1,450. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were tried after a complaint by off-duty police officer  
First Lt. Emad Mohamed Abaza, in which he said the five assaulted 
him in the cafeteria of Ramses Hilton hotel in downtown Cairo in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also ordered each of the accused to pay $145 to Abaza,  
said the officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been numerous complaints against Prince Turki's  
family and his bodyguards since they moved into the upper floors of 
the hotel in 1983 after a dispute with his brother, King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
	Former employees have accused the prince of mistreatment and  
withholding pay. In 1997, one of the prince's American bodyguards 
was arrested for punching two men who objected to his blocking a 
Cairo street with his car. Three other bodyguards were deported 
after similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Cairo court sentenced in absentia an  
American bodyguard of Prince Turki to one year in prison and handed 
him a $1,450 fine for assaulting an Egyptian cook.

<HEADLINE> Shannon Lucid Yearns To Fly Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- She's spent more time in space than  
any other woman or any other American. Yet three years after her 
record-breaking, patience-testing stay on Mir, Shannon Lucid yearns 
to fly again. 
</P>
<P>
	Any space shuttle trip will do -- but a long stint aboard the new  
international space station would be even better. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has her newly retired husband's OK, if and when NASA  
asks. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her three grown children, ``They say, `It's about time.  
We're getting tired of having you hang around the house all the 
time just thinking about wanting to fly in space,'' Lucid says, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	The good humor and grace that got the 56-year-old biochemist  
through her six-month Mir mission and endeared her to the world are 
as apparent as ever as she waits to be assigned to her sixth space 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to Earth three years ago next week, on Sept. 26,  
1996, after 188 consecutive days in orbit. She should have been 
back 48 days earlier, but was stuck on the Russian space station 
because of booster-rocket problems with shuttle Atlantis, her ride 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was the high point, she says, of her career.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from her delayed homecoming, Lucid's Mir stay was  
relatively uneventful. A highly publicized fire erupted a half-year 
after she left, and its collision with a cargo ship nearly a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in her first four space shuttle flights and her time aloft  
soars to 223 days. No other NASA astronaut comes close. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucid says she feels absolutely no ill effects from being  
exposed to so much weightlessness and cosmic radiation. Indeed, 
NASA's top doctor says nothing's preventing her from flying again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been back, what? Three years now. And I've not even had a  
headache since I've been back. I haven't had a cold,'' Lucid says. 
``My bones are in really good shape. I lost some calcium, then 
built back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not by running, that's for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	After exercising on Mir's treadmill twice a day per doctor's  
orders -- that's more than 370 workouts -- Lucid swore she'd never 
get on a treadmill again. She's kept her word. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucid says she's the same person she was before flying to Mir in  
March 1996, unlike many astronauts who come back from long or 
particularly trying missions claiming to have changed -- more 
philosophical, more religious, more whatever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. It would make a much more dramatic story for you,''  
says Lucid, a shy, religious woman who grew up in Oklahoma the 
daughter of Baptist missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	She seldom gives news interviews and, in fact, is surprised that  
so many people still find her intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, you just can't spend all your life talking about one  
episode in your life,'' explains Lucid, an astronaut since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she was only the second American to live on the Russian  
space station, and the only American woman. 
</P>
<P>
	While reluctant to single out any of Mir's seven U.S. occupants,  
NASA officials can't help but agree Lucid stands out. Her laugh 
aboard Mir was infectious, and her Russian male crewmates genuinely 
enjoyed her company. Lucid sees them on occasion and considers them 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Van Laak, a NASA manager who worked on the shuttle-Mir  
program and now is assigned to the international space station, 
calls Lucid extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her total love of space flight and her willingness to commit  
herself is something we're all very proud of,'' Van Laak says. 
</P>
<P>
	Until she flies again, Lucid is drawing on her Mir experience to  
help prepare future crews for the space station. She urges them to 
find a hobby to keep themselves occupied in orbit and make sure 
it's the right time in their lives for such a difficult endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very, very difficult if I'd had small  
children at home,'' she says. ``My youngest was in college, so they 
certainly didn't think they needed a full-time mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reading is what kept Lucid going, day after day aboard Mir.  
</P>
<P>
	Lucid had her daughters send nearly 100 books to Mir while she  
was there. Unfortunately, her library was inside the Spektr lab 
module, which was ruptured by an out-of-control cargo ship in June 
1997 and sealed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucid says she'll miss the 13 1/2-year-old space station once it's  
gone. The Russians plan to send the abandoned outpost on a fiery 
dive through the atmosphere next February or March, in order to 
devote their scarce resources to the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	When that day comes, Lucid will be thinking about her beloved  
books on board: ``The ultimate book burning.''

<HEADLINE> Raiders 22, Vikings 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Forget the eagerly awaited matchup between  
Randy Moss and Charles Woodson. Russell Maryland knew the key to 
the Vikings-Raiders game was the amount of pressure he'd get on 
Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a lot and led Oakland to a 22-17 upset of Minnesota, an  
offensive powerhouse suddenly struggling to score. 
</P>
<P>
	``As good of a quarterback as he is and has been, nothing beats  
putting pressure on him,'' Maryland said. ``You get him on the 
ground and you start to get to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the football world anxiously awaiting receiver Moss vs.  
cornerback Woodson, who both had spectacular rookie seasons last 
year, Maryland recovered a fumble, picked off a pass and led a 
relentless rush Sunday. The Raiders got six sacks and held the 
Vikings to 34 yards rushing, including minus-1 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after blowing a 10-point fourth-quarter lead at Green  
Bay, Oakland survived the Vikings' comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Raiders ahead 22-10 midway through the second half,  
Cunningham completed a third-and-8 pass to Jake Reed and defensive 
end Tony Bryant was assessed a personal foul for driving the 
quarterback to the turf. The penalty moved the ball to the Oakland 
45. 
</P>
<P>
	Then safety Eric Turner drew another 15-yard penalty for spiking  
the ball he picked off out of bounds near the end zone. That led to 
Cunningham's 28-yard TD pass to Jake Reed that pulled Minnesota to 
22-17 with 14 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders were flagged 10 times, all in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
	But after pulling to within five points, the Vikings went  
three-and-out twice, turned the ball over on downs and threw an 
interception at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings (1-1) have needed two games to score 34 points,  
which was about their average output last year, when they set an 
NFL record with 556 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I didn't expect that because I know the sky's always the  
limit,'' Cunningham said. ``It's going to be a tough year for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So frustrated was Vikings coach Dennis Green that he went for  
it, but came up short, on fourth-and-10 from the Raiders 39 with 7 1/2 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt like we had to try to make something happen,''  
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley fumbled at the Vikings 31 with 3:40 left, but  
Minnesota failed to gain a first down and punted. Wheatley secured 
the victory with a 25-yard run with two minutes left. He rushed 12 
times for 67 yards in the second half and finished with 83 yards on 
18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders (1-1) trailed 10-6 at the half, but Rich Gannon hit  
James Jett with a 9-yard touchdown pass to give Oakland its first 
lead, 13-10 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland, who recovered a Cunningham fumble at the Oakland 25 in  
the first half, intercepted Cunningham's tipped pass at the Vikings 
30 two plays later. The Raiders settled for Michael Husted's 
42-yard field goal for a 16-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon's draw from the 5 with 1:08 left in the third quarter  
made it 22-10, but the 2-point conversion pass fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings managed just 15 yards on eight plays in the third  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cunningham was 23-of-39 passes for 364 yards, including  
five passes to Reed for 100 yards, the Vikings' running game was 
nearly nonexistent. Robert Smith gained 24 yards on 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, Cunningham threw a 31-yard touchdown pass  
to Carlester Crumpler, but Minnesota blew three scoring 
opportunities and stumbled into halftime with just a four-point 
lead despite outgaining the Raiders 256 yards to 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Anderson, the first perfect kicker in NFL history last  
season, was short on a 50-yarder and his 43-yard attempt was 
blocked, giving him four misses this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was good from 37 yards in the second quarter for a 10-3  
lead, but that came after the Vikings failed to take advantage of 
Moss's spectacular one-handed, 24-yard catch over Charles at the 
Oakland 5. 
</P>
<P>
	For what it was worth, Moss called his matchup with Woodson a  
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I won. I wouldn't say he won. I didn't do  
nothing and he didn't do nothing,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Anderson's 43-yard attempt was blocked by Woodson and 
recovered by Oakland linebacker K.D. Williams at midfield, leading 
to Husted's 37-yard field goal just before the half. He also was 
good from 36 yards. ... Nine players caught a pass for Oakland, led 
by Tim Brown's nine receptions for 86 yards. ... Vikings tackle 
Korey Stringer injured his left knee in the second quarter and 
didn't play much in the second half. Linebacker Kailee Wong pulled 
a hamstring and his replacement, Rob Holmberg, sprained an ankle.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Affirms 'Black' Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton agrees with author Toni  
Morrison: he is -- unofficially -- the nation's first black 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton jokingly claimed that distinction for himself Saturday  
night at the Congressional Black Caucus' annual awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	He said comedian Chris Tucker told him he'd like to see the Oval  
Office to prepare for an upcoming movie role as the nation's first 
black president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the heart to tell him that I've already taken  
the position,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an October 1998 essay in The New Yorker magazine, Morrison  
said black Americans tended to be sympathetic to Clinton because 
his impoverished childhood and personal struggles seemed to mirror 
many of their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, in the middle of the Whitewater investigation, one  
heard the first murmurs: white skin notwithstanding, this is our 
first black president,'' she wrote. ``Blacker than any actual 
person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Executive Questioned in Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A senior executive from the Hyundai  
group was questioned by prosecutors Sunday in a major stock price 
manipulation case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they had no plans to arrest Chung Mong-hun,  
chairman of Hyundai Electronics Co., because there was no evidence 
to prove that he knew about the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Hyundai officials were arrested and dozens of others have  
been investigated in the alleged stock price manipulation of the 
electronics firm, the world's leading memory chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lee Ik-chi, head of Hyundai Securities Co., led  
the six-month scheme last year by diverting $183 million in company 
funds from two other Hyundai subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the operation raised Hyundai Electronics stock prices  
by almost 2.5 times, enabling the conglomerate to make at least 
$416 million. Lee was arrested earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The case received wide attention, partly because Lee was  
credited with reviving the nation's depressed stock market with his 
successful launch of a fund in March that has drawn $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has brought calls for greater efforts to restructure  
South Korea's conglomerates, which are known as chaebol. The 
government is pushing them to reform their business practices and 
shed money-losing subsidiaries, thus lowering debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock price manipulation is punishable by a prison term of up to  
10 years or a fine of up to three times the profit gained.

<HEADLINE> Unicom, PECO Said in Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Unicom Corp. and PECO Energy Co., reportedly are  
in talks to merge to form an $11.8 billion company controlling as 
much as 20 percent of the country's nuclear generating capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Unicom's board of directors were to meet today to  
discuss a ``merger of equals'' with PECO Energy Co., Crain's 
Chicago Business reported in today's issue, citing sources that it 
did not name. The new company would have 5.3 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom, the parent company of Commonwealth Edison, and  
Philadelphia-based PECO operate nuclear reactors and charge some of 
the country's highest electric rates. The two companies also are 
about the same size, with Unicom's market capitalization at $8.4 
billion and PECO's at $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known if the Unicom board will vote on a deal today,  
but Crain's cited sources who said any agreement would be announced 
within a week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom officials declined to talk to Crain's and The Associated  
Press about the merger. PECO officials did not return a phone call 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger is approved, the new company probably would be  
based in Chicago, and management shared by Unicom chairman and 
chief executive officer John W. Rowe and PECO chairman and CEO 
Corbin A. McNeil, Jr., Crain's reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a merger could face several hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania regulators have the authority to approve or reject  
the merger, but the 1997 Illinois deregulation law allows utility 
mergers and acquisitions without Illinois Commerce Commission 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of losing a major corporation from Pennsylvania  
combined with ComEd's recent spate of power outages in the Chicago 
area could influence the Pennsylvania panel's decision, the 
business magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are not going to want to call Chicago to get the  
squirrel out of the transformer on Broad Street,'' said Sonny 
Popowsky, Pennsylvania's consumer advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the proposed merger left many analysts confused,  
partly because Rowe has been working to reduce the company's role 
in running power plants and has sought to buy Midwestern companies 
specializing in distributing electricity and natural gas, Crain's 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	PECO's growth strategy is to acquire troubled nuclear plants at  
bargain prices and refurbish them. Unicom recently began operating 
its 10 nuclear units simultaneously for the first time in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also are far apart geographically, offering little  
advantage to combining power lines, analysts told Crain's.

<HEADLINE> Hair Designer Can Design Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILTON, Pa. (AP) -- Gini Feigles made up her mind. After 20 years  
of raising a son and styling other women's hair, she wanted 
something for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	So the hairdresser decided to become an engineer.  
</P>
<P>
	But first things first: She had to learn high-school algebra.  
That took about a week, with help from a friend. Graduating from 
Bucknell's civil engineering program took four years, and in June, 
at age 47, Ms. Feigles started her new career at the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	To those astonished by her improbable career change, well, she's  
pretty amazed herself. ``I can't tell you how many times I thought, 
`What have I done?' Well, I did it. I don't know if I ever thought 
I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would is the right word. Everybody knew this smart, savvy woman  
could do it. But she wasn't quite sure she would be willing to make 
the sacrifice. Four years of studying with kids less than half her 
age; heck, of listening to professors 10 years her junior. Four 
years without time for TV or movies, tennis or biking, or much of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	So as students headed back to Bucknell last month, she is  
developing a business plan for the DOT's district office. She has 
no longing to be back in class. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my god, I thought I'd die,'' she says of those first scary  
months of college. ``I mean, I'd never even seen calculus before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feigles, raised by a single mother who worked in a thread  
factory, always planned to go to college. But she was married at 17 
and pregnant at 18. One divorce and a remarriage later, she became 
a hairdresser. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later she volunteered with the planning commission, then  
worked as a secretary at the Chamber of Commerce. All the while, 
she grew envious of the engineers around her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought, `This is stupid. Why am I on the wrong end of  
this?''' she recalls. ```Why don't I just go to school to get the 
credentials to do this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second divorce also led her to rethink her life. She ended up  
at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, in a four-year program that 
often stretches to five or six years elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she arrived, I told her that life was about to get  
hard,'' Trudy Cunningham, the associate dean of engineering, 
recalls. ``She's an adult who has a life, an apartment, a car, and 
she was competing with kids who were living in dorms and having 
their meals cooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feigles quickly discovered how right her adviser was.  
Scholarships covered most of her tuition, but she worked nights and 
weekends at the beauty salon to cover living expenses. Her free 
time slipped away, devoted to studying in class and at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Swindler, then just an 18-year-old freshman, became Ms.  
Feigles' closest friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rough for all of us,'' she recalls. ``But it was so  
much rougher for her. We were like, `She has to work, and she has 
an apartment. She has to do her dishes.' She had done so much more 
than we'd done in life, so it was like, `What are you doing here, 
doing homework?' The students really admired her for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feigles remembers getting her first physics test back. She  
got a 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``What're you going to do?'' another student asked, gasping.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm not going to commit suicide,'' she said with the  
wisdom of a woman who had been through tougher times. With 
tutoring, she finished the class with a C. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she'd inspire others with a poem she wrote about how  
``these trials were the gifts of the path.'' Ms. Cunningham copied 
it on 3-by-5-inch cards for students threatening to drop out. 
``Then I'd tell them Virginia's story, and almost to a person 
they'd say, `Well, gee, if she can do this, I can do it.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Ms. Feigles didn't consider quitting dozens of times.  
The last time was just weeks before graduation in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, I just laughed at her,'' Ms. Cunningham  
recalls. ``I said, `Take a deep breath, get some sleep and finish 
the program.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Now she's an engineer. She's also newly remarried, to a longtime  
friend in Milton. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's not giving up hairdressing. Three days a month, she'll  
be back styling hair. 
</P>
<P>
	As her boss, Molly Hardy of M.L. Hardy's Hair Studio, explains:  
``Your customers become your friends. It's kinda hard to desert 
them. I told her they would understand. But I think she kind of 
wants to hold on to what she's secure with. And we're that.''

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported in Ford-CAW Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Ford of Canada presented an offer to the Canadian  
Auto Workers union on Sunday that reduces the chance of a strike by 
``50 percent,'' union president Buzz Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW boss said Sunday the offer, which he declined to detail,  
rekindled negotiations between the company and the union -- less 
than two days before the strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty percent is a long way away from where we were on Monday  
this past week,'' Hargrove said. ``We were all very optimistic we 
could put together a good agreement here. Fifty percent means there 
really is a possibility this can be done without a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Ford offered the union a 1 percent pay increase each  
year for three years, a $500 signing bonus and minor improvements 
to the cost-of-living allowance for CAW's 12,900 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said Friday the deal had a one-in-1,000 chance of  
settlement before the Tuesday 11:59 p.m. deadline, calling the deal 
a ``recipe for a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first offer was poor judgment,'' Hargrove said. ``It  
didn't accomplish anything and, in fact, it dug a hole'' between 
the two sides, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Although negotiations made considerable strides this weekend,  
Hargrove said the company's offer is being treated as a starting 
point for serious talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still enough major issues between us that could end up  
with a strike here, but we sure feel a lot better after viewing 
this morning's proposal than we did a few days ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW struck General Motors Corp.'s Oshawa, Ontario, assembly  
plant during 1996 contract talks, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike at Ford could affect production of some of the  
company's most profitable vehicles. Its Windsor, Ontario, plant 
makes engines for the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator sport 
utility vehicles, the Ford Windstar minivan and other trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove and his American counterparts have said that  
autoworkers were entitled to a share of the industry's record 
profits. On Thursday, the United Auto Workers reached a tentative 
deal with DaimlerChrysler AG that provides a 3 percent raise for 
each year of a four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the union will not disclose wage increase amounts  
or any other numbers offered by the company until they reach a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The average production line worker earns a base wage of $23.88  
an hour. Those with special skills earn $28.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has selected Ford as the so-called target company --  
the lead company in contract talks -- three times in the last three 
decades -- 1973, 1976 and 1990. In each case, there was a strike, 
lasting an average of 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were expected to continue Monday.
