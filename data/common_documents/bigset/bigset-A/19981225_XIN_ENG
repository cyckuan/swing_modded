<HEADLINE> Possible Earliest Manuscript Found in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A German archaeologist has
announced that he has found what could be the earliest Manuscript
of mankind, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The writing recorded linen and oil cargo delivery made about
5,300 years ago during the reign of a king named Scorpion in
southern Egypt, Gunter Dreyer, head of the German Archaeological
Institute in Cairo, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper did not say when the discovery was made.
</P>
<P>
The findings opened the way for a debate on a widely held
belief among historians that the first people to write were
Sumerians of the Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 B.C., or
5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
While the exact date of Sumerian writing remains in doubt, the
Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with certainty to between
3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., Dreyer said.
</P>
<P>
The writings in the form of line drawings of animals, plants
and mountains are the first proof that hieroglyphics used by the
ancient Egyptians did not emerge overnight but was developed
gradually, he said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made from the tomb of King Scorpion in a
cemetery in the Suhag governorate, 400 kilometers south of Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Consult with Greek Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides is flying to Athens next Monday for consultations on
Cyprus issue with Greek Premier Costas Simitis, Government
Spokesman Christos Stylianides said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a National Council meeting over recent
developments in the Cyprus issue in view of two new U.N. Security
Council resolutions, Stylianides said Clerides will meet Simitis
next Tuesday to brief him on the views of political party
leaders in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed resolution 1217 renewing the
mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus and resolution
1218 on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's good offices mission
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said there will be no new National Council meeting
when President Clerides returns to Cyprus, saying that "the
discussion has been concluded and all parties have expressed their
views".
</P>
<P>
He refused to answer any questions posed by journalists, while
no statements were made by party leaders and representatives
taking part in the National Council, the top advisory body to the
President on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's National Council meeting had been described by
political leaders as "crucial" and "important" and was expected
to deal with the question of deployment of the S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense,
a move rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch a
preemptive strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions were described as positive by Nicosia and
satisfactory by Athens, while they were also welcomed by the
U.S., Britain and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on the
other hand, rejected them and repeated their demands for a
confederation of two states on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka City Council Urged to Improve Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Thursday called upon the Lusaka City Council LCC) to put
the roads under a systematic road maintenance program so as to
save them from deteriorating to poorer condition.
</P>
<P>
The lack of proper drainage systems on roads in the capital
and other parts of the country have made many roads damaged by
rains, the president said here at the hand-over ceremony of a
Lusaka road rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the accelerated urban roads rehabilitation
of Lusaka priority roads covers 54.2 kilometers, Zambia News
Agency ZANA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba further urged the LCC to provide street lighting, road
signs and good water drainage systems on the newly-constructed
roads.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted him as saying that the government recognized the
importance of roads as major backbone infrastructure for social
and economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also said good road networks play an important role in
the economic activities because they attract investment
opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past years, limited resources were
allocated to the road sector and to the upkeep of the road
networks, resulting in a backlog of road rehabilitation and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
This has over a long period escalated road repair costs,
vehicle operating costs as well as road safety problems. Due to
bad roads, a number of road accidents have taken place resulting
in many deaths, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president assured Zambians that what had been done in
Lusaka would be replicated to the cooperating partners to support
the program.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully convinced that this program will provide a
conducive environment in our major urban areas to promote social
and economic activities, thereby reducing the high levels of
poverty in our communities," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Local Government and Housing Ministry, the
first phase of the roads rehabilitation which covered 47 roads
was over and the second phase has been started which would cover
49.4 kilometers involving 48 roads and sites for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Lusaka mayor and city council officials showed
President Chiluba around the new roads.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal income
picked up 0.5 percent in November, the largest gain since
February, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The last month increase in personal income followed respectable
gains of 0.4 percent in October and 0.3 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
With the holiday shopping season coming, personal spending
crept up just 0.1 percent and personal savings rate was only 0.1
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
However, the savings figures were not as bleak as they
appeared, the Department said. They indicated people were spending
some of the wealth they had accumulated in the stock market and
cashing in a portion of their home equity. At present, consumer
spending is powering the U.S. economy at a brisk growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The most important component of income--wages and salaries rose
0.6 percent last month, while income in manufacturing were flat,
reflecting U.S. trade problems. But it rose 0.9 percent in
services, which is less affected by international competition.

<HEADLINE> Canada's GDP Up 0.2 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada's gross domestic product
(GDP) edged up 0.2 percent in October, Statistics Canada reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight monthly increase in the country's GDP
following a four-month stretch of weakness.
</P>
<P>
The October growth was sustained in large part by post-strike
recoveries in auto manufacturing, air transportation and
education, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Excluding these three industries, activity in the rest of the
economy fell 0.3 percent" in October, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, Canada's GDP was up 2.0 percent over the
same month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in 1998, while generally maintaining an upward trend,
has slackened considerably from 1997's steeper pace," the agency
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness so far this year has been concentrated in the
goods-producing sector of the economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
In October, the country's manufacturing production posted a 0.7
percent gain for a third consecutive month. But when auto sector is
excluded, the remaining manufacturing output fell 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The end to strike by Air Canada pilots led a 2.8 percent
increase in the transportation and storage services in October.
Activity in the air transport industry soared by 21.5 percent,
surpassing the pre-strike level by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, education services rose 1.6 percent after
striking teachers returned to work in the country's most populous
province of Ontario.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) - The Russian Atomic Energy
Ministry announced Thursday the completion of five non-nuclear
tests at the Novaya Zemlya test site in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Lev Ryabev said all the
experiments were conducted in strict compliance with the nuclear
test ban treaty, although military-grade plutonium and
highly-enriched uranium were used in underground tests, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
The tests, carried out between September 14 and December 13,
are designed to check the safety level of the nuclear potential
and the efficiency of new efforts to increase the reliability and
security of nuclear weapons and also to study the possibility of
extending the warrantied age of nuclear arms, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
There was no nuclear emission, Ryabev said, noting that the
tests were conducted in special sealed containers and that no
damage was done to the environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the Atomic Energy and Defense Ministries will conduct
more such experiments in the future.
</P>
<P>
The experiments also are intended to study how the components
of the weapons may change over long periods of storage, Ryabev
said, adding that the United States has conducted similar
research.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
on Thursday warned Americans not to travel to the west African
country of Sierra Leone where fighting between rebel forces and
Nigerian-led intervention troops intensified this week.
</P>
<P>
The State Department also ordered all U.S. government personnel
to leave the country after suspending operations at its embassy.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement that travel to Sierra
Leone was extremely hazardous because of possible attacks by
deposed military and rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. citizens in Sierra Leone should review their personal
security situation and are urged to depart the country," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to power in March by
West African forces after the ruling military junta that deposed
him was ousted. But that could not end the fighting between them.
</P>
<P>
The ousted junta forces rallying rebels, who had been fighting
since 1991, have remained active outside the capital of Freetown

<HEADLINE> Romania: Program to Restructure Army Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A program-framework has been
finalized this week regarding the reform process of Romanian army
during the next period of time. The document was forwarded to the
Supreme Council of Defense to be discussed and endorsed during its
January 1999 session.
</P>
<P>
The framework program includes short- (1999-2000), medium-
(2001-2005) and long-term (2006-2010) objectives of this process,
the missions and the structure of forces, the main provisions of
the programs to train troops and headquarters, to modernize the
capacity of equipments so as to provide normal conditions for
activities intended to assure Romania's defense and military
security and gradual integration within the North Atlantic
Alliance's military structures.
</P>
<P>
According to provisions in this project, the process of
reducing the forces, the number of headquarters and big units will
continue, to create smaller army forces but with a higher mobility
and better trained and equipped, able to fight against new risks
and threats.
</P>
<P>
The framework-program will assure the concentration of human
material and financial resources in a smaller number of units
while increasing their degree of efficiency, both for missions
specific for the defense of Romania's territory and for
participation in humanitarian missions or to support peace, in
conformity with international agreements.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Urged to Accept Peace Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry Thursday called on the international community to put
pressure on Eritrea to accept the peace proposals endorsed by the
recent summit of Central Organ of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
said: "Proposals have now been endorsed by the Central Organ
of the OAU at a summit level on December 18, 1998 in Ouagadougou
which also called for its speedy implementation."
</P>
<P>
The press release said the core elements of the proposals are
to request that Eritrea pull out its troops from all occupied
Ethiopian territory and demand for the restoration of the
Ethiopian administration with all its law enforcement organs.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the "OAU effort requires the effective support
of the international community which no doubt continues to bear
great responsibility for giving diplomacy a chance or for making
diplomacy lose all momentum with all its consequences."
</P>
<P>
"It is time for those with real and genuine commitment for
peace in our sub-region to stand up and be counted," the press
release urged.
</P>
<P>
The Ouagadougou summit endorsed the proposals for a framework
agreement, submitted by the OAU High Level Delegation, for a
peaceful settlement of the dispute between Eritrean and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The 11-point proposals include immediate cessation of
hostilities, creation of conditions conducive to a comprehensive
and lasting settlement of the conflict, withdrawal of Eritrean
troops from Badme Town and its environs to positions they held
before May 6, 1998, redeployment of a group of military observers
and delimitation and demarcation of the border between the two
countries within a time frame of six months.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Condemns Israeli Killing of Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Thursday condemned the killing of Lebanese civilians by
Israeli troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent Israeli atrocity, Moussa underlined that
the life of a Lebanese or Palestinian civilian is not in any way
less important than that of an Israeli.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's apology for what it termed as
"accidental" killing of Lebanese civilians, Moussa slammed the
Israeli logic as setting a precedent that the "aggressor would
kill civilians before saying sorry."
</P>
<P>
He poured scorn on Israel's apology, saying that the Jewish
state will "always have to remember" that it has destroyed an
entire Lebanese family.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops launched a sustained air raid last Tuesday in
south Lebanon, claiming the lives of eight Lebanese civilians,
including a woman and her six children.
</P>
<P>
International laws and conventions prohibit targeting
civilians in times of war, he said, demanding Israel's respect for
the international laws.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed the killing of the family a "mistake," which
was refuted by the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.N. force had said that the house in which
the family was living is hundreds of kilometers away from the
Israeli border and no military actions have been taken in its
vicinity.

<HEADLINE> North Pole Once as Hot as Modern Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists say the
North Pole, one of the coldest places in the world, was as warm as
today's Florida some 90 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Science, fossil findings from
the far north confirm that the Arctic once enjoyed roughly the
same climate as modern Florida.
</P>
<P>
Geophysicist John Tarduna and his colleagues wrote in Science
that the warming was part of a global spike in temperatures that
was apparently caused by a dinosaur-era version of the "greenhouse
effect."
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists have long known that the Arctic was much warmer
during the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 144 million to 65
million years ago. The discovery of the remains of a
crocodile-like carnivore with a long snout could not survive if
temperatures dipped below freezing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists say the warming was attributed to the extreme
volcanic activity that spewed prodigious amounts of heat-trapping
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Shokhin, chairman of
the Our Home Is Russia (NDR) faction in the State Duma, was ousted
Thursday in a secret meeting over differences over the movement's
future strategy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, was chaired by NDR leader Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
former prime minister, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Boris Kuznetsov, Shokhin's deputy in the NDR faction, was to
act as the interim leader.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin, who opened the meeting, said he increasingly disagrees
with Chernomyrdin's views on the prospects of the movement and
ways to rejuvenate it.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that the issue of a new leader of the faction
will be tackled after the New Year holidays when the State Duma
starts its Spring session, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our Home Is Russia must become the chief party of the Russian
provinces," Shokhin wrote in a document prepared for discussion.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a motto describing "the NDR of yesterday as the
party of power, the NDR of today - the party of regions and the
NDR of tomorrow as the party of regional authorities," Interfax
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Tuesday that Nikita Mikhalov, a filmmaker
heading the Russian Cinematographic Workers Union, might replace
Shokhin as chairman of the NDR faction.

ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association for the
Blind of Ethiopia Thursday urged higher educational institutions
in the country to respect rights of students with visual
impairment.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day meeting here on problems encountered by the
blind, Kassahun Tibeltal, chairman of the Association, said
that visually impaired students learning at higher educational
institutions in the country are enduring several hardships.
</P>
<P>
Some higher educational institutions refuse to
enroll blind students, Kassahun was quoted by the Ethiopia News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said those who have been enrolled would be forced to drop
out due to lack of necessary support.
</P>
<P>
According to Kassahun, the decision made by the Oromiya
regional educational bureau this year to prohibit the blind and
disabled persons from studying at the Jimma Teachers Training
College contravenes the country's policy and constitution.
</P>
<P>
Six visually impaired students who had been prevented from
joining the college because of the decision of the bureau are
sitting idle, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 150 visually impaired students at the Addis Ababa
University and Kotebe Teachers Training College, he said, adding
that "they face a lot of problems."
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized to find solutions to the problems
blind students are faced with.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
evacuating about a third of its 116 staff from Sierra Leone but
leaving the rest of its workers in the West African nation where
rebel forces have strengthened military offensives, a U.N.
spokesman announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference that some 40 employees, mainly civilians, were being
sent to neighboring Guinea, while others in outlying regions were
moved to Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has a 60-member peacekeeping operation of
troops, military observers, police and medical staff, known as the
U.N. Observation Mission in Sierra Leone. It also has civilian
humanitarian staff and administrators.
</P>
<P>
Rebel infiltrators attacked villages around Freetown earlier
this week in hit-and-run raids, which were the closest to the city
since a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force, called the
ECOMOG, restored President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to power in March.
</P>
<P>
Renegade soldiers toppled Kabbah in May 1997, and rebels, who
had been fighting since 1991, rallied to their coup.
</P>
<P>
The rebels and the coup loyalists have remained active outside
the capital since Kabbah's return to power in a notorious campaign
against thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday issued a presidential
statement, calling for an end to the foreign support and
participation of the rebel's attacks and to atrocities on
civilians.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Forms 11-Member Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala, who was sworn in Thursday, formed Friday an
11-member cabinet which is responsible for conducting free, fair
and impartial elections by March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra, on the recommendation of Koirala, appointed
Friday 10 ministers including one from the Upper House of
Parliament nominated by himself, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala holds concurrently the portfolios of
foreign and defense affairs, royal palace affairs, agriculture,
labor, forest and soil conservation, land reform and management,
works and transport, supplies and housing and physical planning.
</P>
<P>
His Nepali Congress (NC) also holds the posts of home affairs,
education, information and communications and youth, sports and
culture while its major partner Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) gets the key ministries of finance,
local development, water resources and tourism and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Sadbhavana Party, the minor partner in the
tri-partite government, was offered the post of industry minister
held by its President Gajendra Narayan Singh.
</P>
<P>
Ramesh Nath Pandey, minister for environment and population,
became the first member of Upper House to be nominated by King
Birendra into the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Sunday between the NC and the
CPN-UML, the cabinet shall be small for the elections. But it is
expected to be expanded later for the induction of other parties
in parliament willing to join the coalition government, the sixth
since the mid-term polls in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of political turmoil erupted when the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) pulled out of
the coalition government with the NC on December 10.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML alleged that the NC had failed to implement the
agreements reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML, from which the CPN-ML broke away
in March this year, threw its weight behind Koirala after his
party agreed to form an all-party government for conducting new
elections.
</P>
<P>
Koirala resigned Monday to make way for the formation of such a
government. He was reappointed prime minister Wednesday by King
Birendra.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML now becomes the main opposition party in parliament.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday expressed
hope that the United Nations (UN) will agree with any efforts to
form a new UN Special Commission to resolve the problem in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Friday he
was told that France would take the initiative to set up the new
commission to replace the existing one which had failed to gain
the confidence of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is prepared to discuss the matter in New York if it
was raised, he said in Kepala Batas, northern state of Pulau
Pinang, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia would urge the UN to organize peaceful
discussion on the situation in Iraq which was recently under
U.S.-British air and missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Military aggression is not the way to resolve problems because
it could lead to hatred among the people against the countries
which attack them," Abdullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's stance was to avoid any form of military
action to force another country to accept a directive.

DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Bangladesh and
India will start joint monitoring of the Ganges waters at Farakka
Barrage in India and Hardinge Bridge point in Bangladesh's
Ishwardi from January 1, the beginning of five-month lean period,
Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The joint-monitoring of the flow of waters of the Ganges,

during the lean period has been envisaged in the 30-year water
sharing treaty signed between them on December 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
A two-member expert team from Bangladesh left here for India
last Saturday for observing the flow of the Ganges at the Farakka
Barrage point.
</P>
<P>
Under the water-sharing formula, Bangladesh is to get 67,516
cubic feet per second of water during the first 10-day cycle from
January 1.
</P>
<P>
The flow of the Padma is presently over 100,000 cubic feet per

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Having to Do With Lusaka Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government denied
that the Lusaka summit was postponed because it was not happy
with a proposed cease-fire between Congolese President Laurent
Kabila and the rebels, Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have been preparing ourselves to attend the Lusaka
meeting, we were ready to go there but were told on Thursday that
it was postponed," RNA quoted Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Cooperation Anastase Gasana as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gasana said this in response to media reports that the summit
was put off because Rwanda was not happy about some clauses of
the content of the cease-fire which was expected to be signed in
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The reports had quoted diplomatic sources at the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), alleging that the Lusaka summit was
adjourned because the facilitator could not secure sufficient
agreements.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been not any reaction from the Zambian
authorities who were supposed to host the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It has been alleged that Rwanda and Uganda who are backing the
rebels are split on whether they should sign the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the OAU headquarters have been quoted as saying
that while Uganda would like to see the end of the war, Rwanda
reportedly was unhappy with the cease-fire deal.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are just lies," Gasana told RNA, "because
even in Ouagadougou I was ready to sign the deal on behalf of the
Rwandan government had it been concluded."
</P>
<P>
"Our position on the Congolese conflict was made known to the
OAU secretary general, and we could not have changed our mind
ever since," Gasana underscored.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Kigali said the Lusaka summit was not
well prepared, and that the dates were chosen without considering
that the meeting was following between two important holidays,
Christmas and the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan foreign minister disclosed that a number of
countries, notably Tanzania and Burkina Faso had expressed
dissatisfaction with the choice of the dates, which would have
implied that delegations would have started to travel to Zambia
on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"The summit was simply postponed because the facilitator
feared to get a poor attendance, for some delegations had
indicated that they might not be able to come," said Gasana.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Rwanda will always support any peace deal
reached by President Kabila and the rebels. This deal would be
followed by a more comprehensive one which would address the
concern of the neighbors of Congo involved in the war, notably
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese government may have supporters, the rebels may
have supporters too, but once they strike a deal to end the war,
everybody should follow suit," Rwandan Minister in President's
Office Patrick Mazimhaka insisted.
</P>
<P>
"It is mainly their own war, not ours," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Study Sea-Farming Capacity in Bays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An international project, to
be done by more than 40 scientists from France, Britain, Portugal
and China, will start next year to study the sea-farming capacity
in Chinese bays.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be funded by the European Union, will also
study the impact of aquiculture to the marine environment and help
China sustainably develop its aquiculture industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the death rate of Chinese sea farms is growing
and their production and economic efficiency is dropping, said an
expert from the Institute of Oceanology of the State Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The study will be conducted in Sanggou Bay and Jiaozhou Bay in
east China's Shandong Province, which are totally different in
environment and varieties of products.
</P>
<P>
Through analysis to the ecological system in the sea farms,
scientists want to find the balance between sea-farming capacity
and environment, which means to keep the largest production scale
and pose no harm to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the scientific achievements can also be
applied in other coastal countries.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Message to Taiwan Compatriots Marked in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars specializing
in Taiwan studies said here today that the peaceful reunification
of the motherland has become an irresistible historical trend and
called for efforts to overcome obstacles inside and outside the
Taiwan island to the realization of the reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
At a forum held by the Taiwan Studies Society to mark the 20th
anniversary of the issuing of the Message to Compatriots in
Taiwan, participants reviewed the cross-straits exchanges in the
past two decades in the fields of politics, culture, economy,
trade and transportation.
</P>
<P>
They held the Chinese mainland has adopted active measures in
boosting the cross-straits ties since the issuing of the
message.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 1997 cross-straits trade volume
amounted to 19.84 billion U.S. dollars, which is 256.6 times the
1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 13 million Taiwan compatriots have visited the
mainland, with over 70,000 people in the mainland touring the
island.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wanxin, vice-chairman of the Taiwan Studies Society, said
the historic message has brought significant effect on the
relations across the Taiwan Straits, and both sides have come to
political dialogues from the past military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association also held a
forum today in Beijing to mark this event.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges U.S. to Lift Military Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Friday urged the United States to lift military
sanctions against Pakistan in the face of the recently-signed
India-Russia defense pact.
</P>
<P>
"We will take up this issue with the United States in the
forthcoming talks and press for lifting the military sanctions as
there is greater urgency for that in the face of India-Russia
agreement," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Islamabad would also take up the issue with New Delhi
during their scheduled talks on issues of peace and security and
the Kashmir dispute in February next year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is already disparity in the
conventional arms between Pakistan and India and with New Delhi
getting more arms from Russia under the pact, it will further
affect the balance of power in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister noted that during his recent visit to the
United States, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had expressed concern
that such a pact was in the offing and now that it has actually
taken place. Washington should remove military sanctions against
Pakistan, said Aziz .
</P>
<P>
He questioned the purpose of the India-Russia pact which
provides for massive arm purchases by India from Russia worth 16
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This unusual addition in defense purchases by India and the
pact are not in spirit of reconciliation in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Aziz said, is for restraint but with this agreement
India has introduced a new element of threat in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Declines UAE Aid Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has
returned a shipment of aid from the United Arab Emirates and
called on Arab countries to play an effective role in removing
U.N. sanctions, the Gulf News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities have returned a ship carrying donations,
including food, medicine, blankets and clothes, according to
Mohammed Abdullah Al Sheibah of the Needy Muslims Committee which
sent the ship.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has said that aid ships from Arab countries are not of
any help to the 20 million people in the country who have been
suffering because of the sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Iraqi authorities, the only way to help the
people would be for the Arab countries to take a unified stand and
intensify efforts to press the international community to remove
sanctions, and not just send aid and donations," said Al Sheibah.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government took the decision not to accept aid about
six months ago, but Al Sheibah said the committee continued to
send aid, by road, via Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This time, while sending back the ship carrying aid, the Iraqi
government said an added reason for doing so was that the Umm Qasr
port had been badly damaged in the recent joint air strikes
carried out by U.S. and British forces.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Debate Citizens Chance To Appeal Official Decrees (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens should be
entitled to appeal against government violations of their
interests and also against "illegal" government decrees and
regulations, Chinese lawmaker Yang Zhenhuai said today.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a member of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, made the proposal when reviewing the draft law on
administrative appeals at the ongoing legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The existing draft originally submitted by the State Council
provided that the law shall cover "specific administrative
activities" that citizens claim infringe upon their rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the word "specific" should be deleted, and
most of the lawmakers shared his opinion.
</P>
<P>
If such a clause is incorporated, it means that the public
will be able to appeal against certain government rules and
regulations that may be contrary to the Constitution and the Law.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out to his colleagues that the most common
complaints of the public, such as what are the essentially illegal
collections of exorbitant fees by local governments, directly
derive from "illegal" and unreasonable government orders and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes these law-breaking activities of certain government
employees are following written government orders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers at the legislative session commented that the
existing 8-year old law on administrative procedures does not
encourage or support lawsuits against such "unofficial" government
activities. If a clause ensuring this could become a part of that
law it would, they say, be a major breakthrough in China's
legislative system.
</P>
<P>
However, the NPC LAW Committee explained that the current draft
does not yet cover this "unofficial" subject, because it is a very
important and complicated issue and needs to be further discussed
by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Yet another lawmaker, Ruan Chongwu, said that the public should
be allowed such a channel to air their complaints and have them
redressed, otherwise social disturbance will ensue.
</P>
<P>
"Some of today's government regulations are really factors
towards instability," he said.

<HEADLINE> 8 Die of Cholera in Northwest Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Cholera outbreak has claimed
the lives of eight persons in northwestern Gisenyi prefecture
bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo, state-run radio
Rwanda reported late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The first cholera cases were registered in the area on
December 3. ''Up to now, eight people have died of the epidemic,
while 109 others are in critical conditions at Kigufi Hospital,''
Director of Health Services in Gisenyi Erasme Sarambuye told
Rwanda News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
He said that most affected is Nyamyumba commune on the shores
of Lake Kivu, especially in the villages of Busoro, Rubona and
Kiraga. Two more cases of cholera have been identified in the
town of Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
Sarambuye told RNA that emergency measures have been taken to
check he spread of the epidemic, including reinforcing a medical
team at Kigufi, and sensitizing the local population about
boiling the lake water before its consumption.
</P>
<P>
Cholera had seriously hit southwestern Cyangugu District, also
bordering Lake Kivu. Health officials in that prefecture say that
from March to August this year, 1990 cases of cholera had been
registered, with 48 deaths. However, the epidemic is under
control at present, the officials told RNA.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Debate on Whether Citizens Can Appeal Government Decrees (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairperson of the NPC Standing Committee,
rejected the possibility that such "illegal" government rules and
activities could be investigated and redress made if necessary,
because the task would be tremendous.
</P>
<P>
She agreed, however, that giving the public the right to appeal
against government orders is an effective way to strengthen the
public's monitoring of government and over the implementation of
the law.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers also suggested that the draft law should make
the State Council, or China's Cabinet, responsible for handling
such appeals instead of the highest authority being at provincial
government and ministry levels.
</P>
<P>
But opponents said that they could see no reason to involve the
State Council in these matters because provincial and ministerial
organisations can be relied on to correct their own mistakes, if
any are found.
</P>
<P>
However, non-voting delegate Xu Bingzhong declared that there
was a need and quoted statistics to back up his claim.
</P>
<P>
"In the past seven years following the introduction of a set
of government regulation on administrative appeals, an annual
average of 1,500 complaints was brought to provincial-level
governments and ministries under the cabinet." he revealed.
</P>
<P>
"This is a considerably large number and it is inappropriate to
solely rely on those bodies to redress their own wrongdoings." he
added.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee vice-chairwoman Peng Peiyun said that
the State Council would be able to toughen up its own rules and
guidance on these issues of major significance if it is charged
with handling appeals against provincial governments and
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers commented that after previous discussions and
revisions, the draft law is now basically acceptable except that
further changes need to be made on the two issues mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
They advocated passing the law as soon as possible after such
changes had been made.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Unity of Political Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday urged rival political factions
in the country to set aside their disputes and get united.
</P>
<P>
A nation will suffer misery if the differences among its
people are aggravated, Khamenei addressed the Friday prayer
congregation on Tehran University campus.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was not referring to differences of taste or
policy, but political confrontation between rival factions "which
will cause tension," the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The hearts of the people will be broken to see there are
differences among high level officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the press not to exaggerate the existing
differences, but to work to bring the political factions closer to
each other.
</P>
<P>
The moderates, headed by President Mohammad Khatami, and the
conservatives, who control most of the powers in the country,
engaged in a fierce power struggle this year due to sharp
differences over domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Billing himself a strong advocate of freedom of expression,
Khamenei warned that some people are "taking advantage of this
freedom to create tension in society."
</P>
<P>
In October, Khamenei warned the press against overstepping the
freedom of expression. The warning was followed by a series of
crackdown on moderate and liberal publications by the
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Toughest Year Ever For Chinese Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) --Chinese Red Cross workers have
had the toughest year in their history as the country was hit by
natural disasters that affected at least 230 million people as
earthquakes, blizzards and floods raged.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the arduous relief work caused by successive
disasters the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) says it managed to
cope with almost every eventuality.
</P>
<P>
It raised 770 million yuan (about 96 million U.S. dollars ) in
relief cash and materials and most of the donations reached the
disaster hit areas, according to RCSC spokesman Wu Qiusha.
</P>
<P>
Across China and throughout the year, more than 4,000 people
died during earthquakes, snow storms and floods, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of manpower and material resources deployed for
disaster relief this year was the biggest in the 94-year history
of the RCSC," Wu Qiusha said.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC and its local branches raised about 90 million yuan,
10 million yuan and 670 million yuan respectively for quake-hit
Hebei Province, Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province
stricken by blizzards and for flooded areas along the Yangtze and
Nenjiang rivers.
</P>
<P>
Among the donations, more than 70 million yuan came from
foreign Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, as well as a number
of other international relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross societies in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan also
provided 142.32 million yuan in relief funds, Wu added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary:Who Are Japanese Courts Defending? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A Tokyo high court's
rejection of World War II Japanese soldier Shiro Azuma's appeal
challenging a district court ruling on his personal diary is
politically motivated and the verdict will only further inflate
the arrogance of Japan's right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Tokyo ruled Tuesday that the Japanese
soldiers who were accused by Shiro Azuma in his war-time diary of
participating in the 1937 Nanking Massacre cannot be brought to
trial.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma, 86, who took part in the attack on Nanjing
(formerly known as Nanking) in 1937, witnessed and kept a diary
on the hair-raising killings of Chinese servicemen and civilians.
The killings are known historically as the "Nanking Massacre."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, a handful of Japanese right-wingers have
tried hard to whitewash Japan's history of aggression and flatly
denied the Nanking Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma published the personal diary he kept during the
war in which he recorded the atrocities committed by the Japanese
soldiers and mentioned by name some of those who perpetrated the
bloody deeds.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1993, Koji Hashimoto, one of the soldiers
mentioned in the diary, sued Azuma for "damaging his reputation,"
with the intention of discrediting the Nanking Massacre.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1994, the Tokyo District Court ruled that the
Azuma diary "was judged as being unnatural by common sense" and
that Azuma pay the plaintiff 500,000 Japanese yen "in
compensation for damage to his reputation."
</P>
<P>
Azuma appealed to the High Court of Tokyo. However, his appeal
was rejected for the same reason on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For years, right-wing political forces in Japan have been
trying to deny Japan's hostilities toward China. This denial of
the facts contained in the Azuma diary regarding the massacre
clearly demonstrates this tendency.
</P>
<P>
It is not merely a matter of how to interpret history
correctly, but also an issue of principle in Sino-Japanese
relations. If allowed to continue, such a tendency will seriously
weaken the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Nanking Massacre was far more cruel than Azuma
described in his diary. Nevertheless, the value of Azuma's diary
lies in its truthful presentation of the bloodshed and it serves
as a good textbook for more Japanese people to see a more
accurate picture of the Japanese war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The rulings, which have always been favorable to the Japanese
right-wingers, are a distortion of history.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, right-wingers led by Koji Hashimoto, o
penly displayed a streamer, which read, "We won in the hearings
on the fabricated Nanking Massacre!"
</P>
<P>
Although 50 years have passed since the war, some Japanese
still possess a biased view of history and many of them hold
posts in key offices in the government and other prestigious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A recent example is that the granddaughter of Hideki Tojo, the
Number-One war criminal of World War II, has tried to reverse the
international verdict on her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
Only when Japan uses history as a mirror, rightly interprets
it and draws a correct lesson from it, can Japan stay on the
track of peaceful development. This is what Japan needs to think
about on the threshold of a new century.

<HEADLINE> Phased Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) - A senior Israeli official on
Friday denied a report that Israel's cabinet would soon discuss a
plan for a phased pullout of Israeli troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, top advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, stressed that if there is no security guarantees from
the Lebanese government, the prime minister will not go ahead with
any withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Maariv reported on Friday that Netanyahu and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon would submit a plan over phased
withdrawal from south Lebanon for cabinet discussion on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the withdrawal would start before the
expected early elections, which might be held in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
The report came two days after 12 Israeli civilians living
along the Israeli-Lebanese border were wounded Wednesday during a
rocket attack launched by the pro-Iranian resistance group
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The attack was a retaliation for an Israeli air strike that
killed a Lebanese woman and six of her seven children on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985
after two invasions, there have been frequent clashes between
Israeli soldiers and guerrilla groups, who fight to oust Israeli
troops from Lebanon.

<P>
LAGOS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has been named among those who shaped the
year 1998 by the Time magazine in its current special edition.
</P>
<P>
In picking General Abubakar as one of the men of the year
1998, the magazine recalled the many years of suffering by the
Nigerians, corruption of unimaginable proportions, intimidation
and harassment of dissidents and ethnic rivalry among major

several billions of Dollars in ill-gotten gains, largely from the
petroleum industry," said the magazine, adding that "yet Abubakar
has not made one false step."
</P>
<P>
He released political prisoners including 20 Ogonis whose
cases were widely seen as a test of sincerity, he has gone after

is finding cause for celebration at last," the American magazine

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution in Dhaka Reaches High Level: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution in Dhaka, capital
of Bangladesh, has reached a very high level due to emission of
suspended particulate materials (SPM) by pollution vehicles at an
increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
The level of SPM has reached 2,600 micrograms per cubic meter,
The Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper Friday quoted a recent
survey conducted by the Department of Environment on the air
quality in the city as saying.
</P>
<P>
The present level of microgram in the air quality is much
higher than the acceptable level of 200 per cubic meter, the
survey noted.
</P>
<P>
Air pollutant materials are normally emitted from petrol,
diesel used in the vehicles as well as dust which create SPM
sulphur di-oxide and nitrogen di-oxide in the air.
</P>
<P>
The range of sulphur di-oxide in Dhaka city air is about 100
micrograms against the acceptable level of 80 microgram per cubic
meter, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution has been causing serious health hazards to
the dwellers in the city with a population of over nine million.
</P>
<P>
More and more pedestrians, especially on-duty-policemen put on
gauze marks for preventing themselves from inhaling hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 160,000 motorized vehicles operate in Dhaka
metropolitan area, with about one-third of them having no fitness
certificates, and these vehicles are constantly emitting black
smoke and fumes polluting the air, according to Bangladesh Road
Transport Authority.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Revenue Fall Calls for Action: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A "monumental" fall in Nigerian
government's revenue "calls for a very tough and drastic
decision," The Post Express Friday quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Information and Culture Minister John Nwodo said Thursday in
Nigerian capital Abuja that the fall in oil price from 17 U.S.
Dollars per barrel to less than 10 Dollars at the international
market had caused a "monumental" fall in government's revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Executive Council (FEC) met for two days this week
and approved a draft 1999 budget which was passed on to the joint
meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council and the National
Council of State which could not reach a decision on it after two
days of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties of the nation's two highest ruling bodies at
putting a final seal on the budget were conveyed by the minister
after the joint meeting was adjourned till next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that "we have a substantial and monumental
fall in revenue for factors totally outside the control of the
Federal Government of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you can have a fall in revenue of 42 percent
without its effect being felt in the country," Nwodo said, adding
that Nigerians would appreciate the tough budgetary process.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the two bodies would conclude deliberations
on next year's budget next Tuesday, which would be announced in
the broadcast to the country by the head of state.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source said Thursday that the Nigerian government
may have canceled the controversial 5,200 Naira (about 60
Dollars) minimum wage decision which had caused unprecedented
protests throughout the country demanding its implementation of
300 percent wage increase.
</P>
<P>
A consensus reached at a meeting by government officials in
Abuja this week favored the scrapping of the package and
recommended that salaries of civil servants be doubled to meet
with the escalating cost of living.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the newly endorsed wage would reflect in
a statement which would be issued by the presidency soon.

<HEADLINE> Upper-Air Weather Forecast Stations Expected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) - The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) aims to establish at least one functioning
upper-air weather station in each African country.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Tanzania Directorate of Meteorology
Mohammed Mhita said that the office of the WMO Regional
Association for Africa (RAI) has planned to assist upgrading 21
upper-air weather stations in Africa to fully operational,
newspapers published here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mhita, who was elected president of the RAI in its 12th
session held in Tanzanian northern town of Arusha in October,
said that the objective of the association is to mobilize
resources from donor countries to assist the upper-air stations
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The main obstacle facing the meteorology is communication
because it often becomes difficult to disseminate information of
adverse weather reports to remote areas in time to warn people of
pending natural disasters," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out the need for efficient workers in
departments of meteorology in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Mhita said that at the Arusha session, which was attended by
41 African member states of RAI, various issues including the
floods caused by the El-Nino weather phenomenon in East Africa as
well as the drought experienced in the Southern Africa region
this year were discussed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania expects to construct an ultra-modern
upper-air station early next year in Dar es Salaam, where the RAI
office has been shifted to, but the running costs are as high as
100 U.S. Dollars a day.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Reiterates No Relations with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said here Friday that Iran would not resume
relations with the U.S. if Washington has not changed its policies
towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Friday prayers at Tehran University, Khamenei said
that Iranians and the government would not reconcile with the
U.S. as long as it continues its "ill-intentions" against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem with the U.S. is not a resumption of relations,"
he said, "the U.S. wants to dictate its policies to other
governments, particularly the weak countries in the region, they
want to plunder rather than have an exchange (with Iran)."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the aim of the U.S. is hegemony, not
relations." "They want to again enjoy the political, economic and
security benefits they had for 30 years under the former regime,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The late shah's regime, which had had close ties with the U.S.,
collapsed in the Islamic revolution in 1979 that brought about the
rule of Islamic clerics.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader is omnipotent in both domestic and foreign
affairs of Iran. Seen as leaning toward political conservatives,
Khamenei reportedly disliked reformist President Mohammad
Khatami's milder approach toward the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is wrongly assuming that the Iranian people have
turned their back to the Islamic revolution and their ideals,
Khamenei said. "Don't ever think that our nation will give in to
your pressure and bullying."
</P>
<P>
He told Washington: "As long as this nation stands by Islam,
they would not come to terms with you."
</P>
<P>
The two countries cut off diplomatic relations in 1980,
following the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by radical
students in the heyday of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
But Khamenei said Iran has no enmity toward the American
people, and it only does not trust the American government.
</P>
<P>
Iran is eager to have normal relations with the entire world
and is improving ties with Europe, Russia, Asia, Africa and all
other countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the recent U.S.-British military strikes
against Iraq on "false excuses" and slammed the U.S. for its
interventions in all spots of crisis in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there is a problem in Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf,
the Middle East, Europe, etc. the U.S. interferes," he added.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Chairs Joint Meeting on U.S.-British Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
chaired a joint meeting of the Iraqi leadership Thursday night to
discuss the recent U.S.-British air strikes and the stances of
Arab states, the Iraqi news Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and the
ruling Baath Party "reviewed the recent showdown against the
American and British aggressors," INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has criticized some Arab countries for not supporting it
in the dispute with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler accused Iraq of not cooperating
fully in U.N. weapons inspections, triggering the December 16-19
punitive strikes staged by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged that the formal Arab stance should harmonize
with the slogans uttered by the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting regarded those killed in the bombardments as
martyrs similar to those in the 1991 Gulf War, which in Baghdad's
point of view is a U.S-led aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War was set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lauded the Russian parliament for having adopted an
unbinding resolution on unilateral lifting of U.N. sanctions
against Iraq, which have been in place for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British military attack on Iraq last week in
"Operation Desert Fox" caused huge civilian casualties, according
to Iraqi officials. But no exact figure has been given.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China has now become the
world's largest leather and leather products producer following
twenty years' rapid development, the China Leather Industry
Association announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the association show that China currently
has 2,100 tanneries, 6,200 leather shoes factories and 1,500
leather clothing manufacturers, capable of producing more than 100
million pieces of hide, 2.4 billion pairs of shoes and some 80
million items leather clothes a year.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, those figures are expected to double,
with three to five international brands emerging, said an
association official.
</P>
<P>
It is only after 1990 when the leather industry, as a
labor-intensive industry, was transferred from developed
countries to developing ones that China become an international
leather processing and marketing center.
</P>
<P>
However, insiders pointed out that a number of problems still
remain unsettled in the industry, such as a limited capacity of
processing high-grade leather products, difficulties in absorbing new
techniques and the pollution.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian police has
arrested 15 people suspected to be key members of a network of
international car robberies, media here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer, quoted by the media, said Thursday
that the suspects are in connection with the theft of 165
vehicles from the southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Criminal Investigation of the Home Affairs
Ministry, Adadi Rajabu, revealed that in a swoop in late August
which involved police detectives from all SADC member states, 89
vehicles were established to have been stolen in Tanzania while
76 were stolen from South Africa, Malawi and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said that 50 vehicles have so far been released by the
police, but others have not been recovered since they do not meet
conditions for their clearance.
</P>
<P>
"We want the owners to come themselves personally to claim
their vehicles by producing original motor vehicle cards plus
ignition keys instead of sending insurance agents," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said that the special operation, started in Malawi, has
also netted 27 guns and eight bullets in a bid to curb illegal
ownership of firearms as well as drug-related incidences.

<P>
GUIYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province expects an annual GDP growth of 8.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Fangren, secretary of the provincial committee
of the Communist Party of China, this is the second consecutive
year that Guizhou has had an annual growth rate that is higher
than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou achieved a nine percent growth last year. Prior to
that, it had experienced tens years' economic development slower
than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
Official projection expects the financial revenue of the
province to reach 11.7 billion yuan, a 9 percent increase over
last year, despite a 400- million-yuan revenue reduction in
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Economists say China's sustainable growth needs a more balanced
picture, where the gap between the more developed coastal regions
and the less developed inland regions that cover the vast central
and western part come closer to each other, or at least the two
parts of the country grow at the same pace.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Economic and Trade Commission, China's
economic growth this year will be close to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fixed asset investments of Guizhou are expected to be 31.5
billion yuan, or 22.6 percent more than last year. A number of
infrastructure projects were started early this year, with the
focus on transportation.

MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong-based Cathay
Pacific Airways and the U.S.-based Northwest Airlines are still
holding separate talks with the Philippine Airlines (PAL) on a
possible major stake in the ailing national carrier, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a Radio interview Friday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said that aside from Cathay and Northwest, a number
of prospective investors have also expressed interest in a
possible buy-in deal that would keep the debt-saddled PAL on air.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, these separate talks are being held in
private to avoid hitches.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions are still going on, but these are not being
made public for the moment to avoid snags. They're talking in
private," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
That is why PAL is still hopeful that its talks with either
Cathay Pacific or Northwest would produce positive results, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also reiterated the position of President Joseph Estrada
that the government will always be prepared to help out but not to
take over PAL.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu warned Thursday that PAL
would be closed again if it fails to find new investors.
</P>
<P>
The financially-troubled airline was closed in September but
resumed operation in October after the government helped in
resolving a labor dispute.

Dam area, half of which falls far below the national sewage
discharge standards.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges dam is the world's largest hydropower
facility under construction.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage of the environmental protection program,
Chongqing will clean up garbage piled on river banks and floating
in the water as well as other pollutants in about one year.
</P>
<P>
The second stage project, hopefully starting the end of 1999,
will be focused on the disposal of residential wastes and
protection of drinking water sources at a cost of more than four
billion yuan, including loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the final stage, 12 billion yuan is expected to be
channeled to build 35 sewage disposal plants with a combined
daily handling capacity of 2.87 million tons and 34 garbage disp
osal plants with a total daily capacity of 8,900 tons. These
projects are expected to be completed around the year 2010.

GUANGZHOU December 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province plans to spend 30 million yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars)
over the next three years to fight a disastrous blight that is
killing pine trees.
</P>
<P>
The blight, which appeared in Guangdong nine years ago, is
caused by a worm that burrows into the pines and can kill them in
a short period of time. It is reported to be spreading fast.
</P>
<P>
The provincial forestry department has committed itself to the
pest control work, but the disease is still there. So, the
Ministries of Forestry and Finance are now paying close attention,
and the pine disease control has been listed among state-level
forest programs this year.
</P>
<P>
A special fund of 10 million yuan will also be allocated
annually by the central and provincial governments to pay for the
project for the next three years, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will have a number of measures to
block off diseased areas, cut down infected trees, and sterilize
diseased forests, local officials say.

<HEADLINE> Gauze Masks Help People Of Lanzhou Deal With Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- It's not uncommon this winter
to see the people of Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province in
northwestern China, walking around wearing a sort of gauze mask
over their nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
This is how they try to stop the assault of dust in the air and
the worsening pollution in this industrial center, where breathing
fresh and clean air, even in the early morning, is a luxury.
</P>
<P>
Liu Lan, a worker who recently was laid-off by her textile
factory, now peddles gauze masks in the downtown area, and says
she can sell more than 50 of them every morning. She complains
that it has not rained since September, and the air is unbearably
dirty.
</P>
<P>
The city is flanked by mountains to the north and south, so it
has poor ventilation. And, fast economic growth and the use of
large amounts of coal for heating in the winter have caused the
further deterioration of air quality.
</P>
<P>
When seen from above, the city is shrouded in a thick dark
cloud. In fact, the city's air quality has been at level 5 since
late September, the worst level in air quality. The main
pollutants are dust and sluphur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
For years, the city government has tried to curb pollution by
planting trees, improving boilers, and closing down polluting
factories, but doesn't seem to have got very far.

<HEADLINE> Private Chinese Firms Vie for Import, Export Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's new policy to grant
import and export authority to some private manufacturers have
been well received as the policy will take effect within a week.
</P>
<P>
A dozen firms including China's largest animal feed producer,
the Xiwang (Hope) Group in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
have applied for the authority with the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), an official with the Foreign
Trade Policy and Development Department of MOFTEC said.
</P>
<P>
Most applicants come from Sichuan, south China's Guangdong
Province, east China's Jiangxi Province and Tianjin Municipality
in northern China. Many other private enterprises have called the
MOFTEC for detailed information.
</P>
<P>
The applicants are engaged in such industries as animal feed,
wood and mineral processing, foodstuffs, chemicals, agricultural
development, construction materials, textiles, electronics and
machinery, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that those who have passed qualification examinations
will begin to receive permits as of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must have a registered capital of at least 8.50
million yuan (about 1.03 million US dollars), and an annual
turnover of 50 million yuan (about 6.04 million US dollars). The
annual turnover of electronic companies must reach 30 million yuan
and that of machinery companies, 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade business was monopolized by state-owned
trade companies for a long time. State-owned large and
medium-sized companies were granted the authority in the
1980s. Private companies had to rely on trade companies for their
import and export business.
</P>
<P>
The new move to grant import and export authority to private
manufacturers is part of MOFTEC efforts to boost China's foreign
trade next year, experts said, citing China's declining exports
this year as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In so doing, we encourage the efficient companies to break
into the international market and set a good image for the
international community," Sun Zhenyu, MOFTEC vice-minister, said
in a meeting earlier this week. "They have great potential in the
international market from a long-term perspective."
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that there will be no ceiling to the
number of private manufacturing companies permitted to handle
imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises have been becoming an increasingly
important force in China's economic growth. By the end of June of
1998, more than 1.04 million private firms, with a total
registered capital of 65.5 million US dollars, had been set up in
China.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, China's
foreign trade volume only accounted for 8.8 percent of the
country's gross national product (GNP), but now it made up
more than one third of China's GNP.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China's foreign trade amounted to 325.06
billion US dollars last year, pushing China into the top 10
largest traders in the world. However, China only ranked 32nd
with a total trade volume of 20.6 billion US dollars in 1978.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed rapid development of foreign trade over the
past two decades, Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng commented
in a recent signed article.
</P>
<P>
After China adopted the policy of reform and opening-up in
1978, foreign trade has been expanded, and become a crucial part
in the growth of national economy and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1997, China's foreign trade increased at an
average annual rate of 15.6 percent, eight percent higher than the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
China now has 227 trade partners all over the world, while in
1978 it traded with only dozens of countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Shi contributed the achievements to sustained development of
the national economy, a socialist market economy and the rise in
China's international status.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the Long-Range
Objective through the Year 2010 have set the target of China's
foreign trade at 400 billion US dollars in 2000, and at 800
billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Shi vows to expand the scale of foreign trade
to gain more economic returns to meet the above goals. He said
China will continue the structural reform of its foreign trade
sector, explore new international markets, and forge bilateral and
multilateral trade ties.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credits to Push Forward Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Consumer credits are expected
to play a significant role in expanding China's domestic demand,
which has been listed by the Chinese government as a key task for
next year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned commercial banks have recently opened
automobile consumption credit business with approval of the
People's Bank of China, indicating that the Chinese government has
begun to tap the potential of consumer credits to further push
forward the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit refers to loans extended by commercial banks to
consumers for buying durable goods. In many countries consumer
credit constitutes a considerable ratio of bank loans, while
in China it is still at a fairly low level.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has been picking up over the past months,
largely due to increased government spending. Experts agreed that
a sustained and healthy national economic development can not rely
solely on investment. Instead it needs to stimulate residents'
consumption demand to ensure a coordinated growth of both
consumption and investment.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the expansion of consumer credits can help
change consumers' traditional consumption concept and make it
possible to tap consumption potential, so as to effectively
propel economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to investment and export, consumption demand has
been playing an increasingly significant role in stimulating
China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that consumption contributed 55 percent to
China's economic growth in 1997, while up to 80 percent of the
total consumption came from consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the outstanding amount of China's
residents' savings deposits in financial institutions reached 5.29
trillion yuan, up 18 percent from the same period last year, which
laid a solid foundation for the development of consumer credits.
</P>
<P>
As an emerging banking business, consumer credits are currently
available mainly in automobile and housing consumption. With the
deepening of the housing reform and an increasing number
of private cars, consumer credits are expected to have vigorous
development in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said that the government should provide more
policy support for the development of consumer credits, and that
commercial banks should also offer more banking services to
individuals.

GUIYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China has increased
investments in railway construction in the southwest from 3.6
billion yuan (434 million US dollars) to 4.9 billion yuan during
1998, up four-fold on the 1997 figure, according to the Chengdu

<P>
ZAGREB, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's border with southern
Yugoslavia in the Prevalka area has been opened after having been
closed for seven years, the Croatian News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral agreement, the common border between Croatia
and the Montenegro Republic of Yugoslavia in this disputed area
will stay open until January 15,1999 for people there to visit
each other in New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the two countries opened this section
of border since the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in
1991, after months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In the former Yugoslavia, the Prevalka peninsula belonged to
Croatia, but Belgrade now claims sovereignty over it, saying that
it is a vital access to sea for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. Security Council resolution placed the region under the
control of U.N. observers to prevent possible border conflicts
and led to the closure of the border.
</P>
<P>
Because of the border closure, the two countries incurred
enormous economic losses so they now wish to settle the dispute
through negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Expand Job Matching System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will expand its
computerized job matching system to include its embassies in
countries where there is a huge concentration of overseas Filipino
workers (OFWs).
</P>
<P>
With the initial success of the Phil-Jobnet system, the
government and its partners want to extend their services to OFWs,
the Philippine News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
When the Phil-Jobnet is connected with Philippine embassies,
the agency said, embassy officials can help OFWs find jobs in the
Philippines once they decide to return home for good.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 4.5 million OFWs working in Asia,
the Middle East and other regions. The OFWs earn more than 6
billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
With Phil-Jobnet, the agency said, job vacancies will be
announced from time to time to allow job-seekers to choose
positions they deem suitable to their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Phil-Jobnet is a free job matching system that provides data on
available jobs nationwide on the Internet, the global depository
of information in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
The system is presently available at Public Employment Service
Offices (PESOs) in municipal town halls in Metro Manila. The
government expects other provinces and cities to link up with the
job-matching system as soon as their respective Internet
connections are operational.

<HEADLINE> Large Petro-Chem Venture Suggests Early Investment in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- "You can't be too picky about a
place like Ningbo. It's best you make your investment here now
instead of waiting too long," said Raymond Wang, a general manager
of the local subsidiary of a large international petro-chemical
company, in a recent interview here.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo is a coastal city in east China's Zhejiang Province. Its
Beilun port is China's largest deep-water international port.
</P>
<P>
Wang's company, Esso SinoChem (Ningbo) Petroleum and
Petrochemicals Supply Co., Ltd. is the first investment in
Zhejiang by Exxon, the largest petroleum company of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction is in full swing in China, which is
a great business opportunity for international companies, Wang
said. And overseas investors should have a keener business sense,
and work out a long-term plan for the China business.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the investment environment in Ningbo and in
China as a whole is not perfect right now, but pointed out that
"when everything is perfect, business will be more costly and the
opportunity left for you will be smaller."
</P>
<P>
Esso SinoChem is building a 50,000-ton dock at Beilun, and runs
a lubricant manufacturer with a production capacity of 35,000
tons. In addition to Esso SinoChem, Exxon has set up three other
subsidiaries in Ningbo. The total investments stand at 85 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exxon does not expect short-term return from its facilities in
Ningbo, according to Wang. "It won't be easy to make money out of
the 50,000-ton dock in a decade, but you have to count on the
future, because Ningbo is getting better day by day."
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo government has implemented a set of rules to
encourage overseas investment to involve in high technology, and
airport, port, highway, power, energy, water conservancy and
environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors in the above-mentioned areas are exempt from
corporate income tax for different periods of time and will get
partial or full tax refunds after the exemption periods are over.

<P>
BELGRADE, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament
Thursday voted to reject a prime minister nominee forwarded by
President Nikola Poplasen, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
A resolution endorsed at the parliamentary session said that
the parliament decided to nominate incumbent Prime Minister
Milorad Dodik for another term since Poplasen's nominee Dragan
Kolinic has failed to win a majority of votes in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Serbian Radical Party and Serbian Democratic
Party withdrew in protest in the middle of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen, leader of the Serbian Radical Party, replaced
Biljana Plavsic, a moderate backed by U.S.-led Western countries,
to become president of the Serbs' Republic of Bosnia in September.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Poplasen nominated Kolinic, leader of the
hard-line Serbian Democratic Party, as prime minister, which
added to displeasure of the West.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westerndorp, High Representative of Peace
Implementation Council of Bosnia, repeatedly claimed that Dodik
was the ideal candidate for premiership.
</P>
<P>
He even threatened that the international community would
suspend all aids to the republic unless Dodik continues to be
prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Turn to Long-Term Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A new trend is emerging in
south China's economic center of Guangzhou where an increasing
number of local residents regard investment for the future as
more important than consumption for the present.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 10,000 households conducted by the city
government shows that Guangzhou residents are now more
investment-conscious.
</P>
<P>
Investment modes such as bank deposits, education, insurance,
real estate, and stocks and bonds now account for the majority of
surplus household income, with home redecorating, interior
remodeling, travel, electrical appliances and cars a close second.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this is a result of the steady increase in income
for the people of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
About 94.9 percent of those surveyed choose to save some
surplus income in the bank, with 70 percent of them saying this
is their first choice.
</P>
<P>
Despite reduced interest rates for savings accounts in recent
years, the bank is still attractive because of the continuing
slow rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, experts predict that individual investments will
become more diversified as insurance and real estate purchases
become more attractive.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that different income levels lead to
divergent spending and saving habits. Households with higher
incomes tend to invest more in securities, and spend more on
travel.
</P>
<P>
Families with lower incomes put their money first in
insurance, education and household furnishings.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Considers Incentives for Garment Back-Linkage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering some incentives for the back-linkage industries of
garment sector which faces the problem for changes in the GSP
(generalized system of preference) rule for apparel export to
European countries, according to Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofael Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Although the new GSP facility based on two-stage derogation
would help garment export grow substantially, the back-linkage
industries of the sector would be in serious problem, the minister
was quoted Friday by The New Nation newspaper as saying Thursday
after the 5th meeting of the National Committee on Export.
</P>
<P>
"The back-linkage industries will face problem due to the new
GSP facility and we will have to find ways to minimize the
problems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under a unilateral decision, the European Union (EU) will
concede two-stage derogation to knitwear and one-stage to woven
garments from January 1, 1999 for the least developed countries,
instead of previous provision for three and two stages, according
to the changed GSP rules.
</P>
<P>
He and the finance minister would meet with the industrial
owners who would be harmed by the new rules and assess the extent
of probable damages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would surely extend some sort of incentives to
them, but the modes of incentive are yet to be decided, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Bangladeshi Commerce Ministry had requested the EU
to continue the previous GSP along with the derogation facilities
until necessary back-linkage industries were set up in the country
to feed the apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
The EU rejected Bangladesh's appeal for continuing previous GSP
for the country, and the re-defined GSP comes into effect in next
January.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector, which has over 2,700 registered apparel
manufacturers and exporters employing some 1.5 million workers, is
the country's biggest foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
It earned about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal
year ending on June 30, 1998, contributing about 70 percent to the
country's foreign currency earnings. Its export target this year
is about 4.5 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's three major sugar
producers have decided to apply regulated sugar prices suggested
by the State Development Planning Commission to avoid price war.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producing Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong
and Yunnan provinces in southern China have reached consensus on
the new prices with a view to stabilizing the market, according
to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan produce six million tons of
sugar a year, accounting for 90 percent of China's total, with
five million tons sold to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The price of sugar has been declining in China for years
mainly due to the cut-throat price war.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its regulation of the sugar market, China will
also continue to crack down hard on sugar smuggling and exert
control over the production and sales of saccharin, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Guangxi regional government
official said that the purchasing price of sugar cane in the
region has been set at 180 yuan per ton for the new sugar
pressing season, but a margin of 10 percent is allowed.

MEXICO CITY, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has taken various
measures to protect rare sea turtles, on both national and local
levels, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Fishing Research Center of Tamaulipas state, bordering

October to the first days of November.
</P>
<P>
The turtle protection programs, being extended to all the
beaches where the species goes to lay eggs, are under the
administration of Mexico's Navy Ministry and the Environment,
Natural Resources and Fishing Ministry, the center said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Health Officials Dislike Giving Gifts to Seniors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Christmas is the time for
gift-giving, but officials from the Public Health Ministry of
Thailand dislike the practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the result of an opinion poll available Friday,
most health officials disagree with the norm of providing
expensive gifts to their administrators during the new year, which
has become a traditional practice among health officials in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by a doctor and his team of doctors, who
are vocal about the health ministry's corruption.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 65 percent of the health officials felt
that this practice had a 60-100 percent chance of benefiting the
person's working status. Out of the 4,041 questionnaires
distributed to health officials in eight provinces and Bangkok,
2,536, or 62 percent, were returned to the Public Health
Conservation and Protection Network.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of the officials disagreed with purchasing
expensive gifts for their bosses and 79 percent felt that state
officials should not receive sponsorship from private companies.

GUANGZHOU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded commercial
enterprises in the southern city of Guangzhou reported a total
retail sales of 4.82 billion yuan in the first 10 months this
year, up 18.8 percent from the same year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the overseas-funded retailers led those of

10.6 percent, 7.3 percent and 3.14 percent, respectively,
according to the latest report from Guangzhou's Statistics Bureau.

foreign-funded commercial enterprises to 496.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of more foreign enterprises, a number of
convenient supermarkets, chain stores and other modern shops have

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Rejects Premier Nominee by President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament
Thursday voted to reject a prime minister nominee forwarded by
President Nikola Poplasen, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
A resolution endorsed at the parliamentary session said that
the parliament decided to nominate incumbent Prime Minister
Milorad Dodik for another term since Poplasen's nominee Dragan
Kolinic has failed to win a majority of votes in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Serbian Radical Party and Serbian Democratic
Party withdrew in protest in the middle of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen, leader of the Serbian Radical Party, replaced
Biljana Plavsic, a moderate backed by U.S.-led western countries,
to become president of the Serbs' Republic of Bosnia in September.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Poplasen nominated Kolinic, leader of the
hard-line Serbian Democratic party, as prime minister, which
added to displeasure of the West.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westerndorp, High Representative of Peace
Implementation Council of Bosnia, repeatedly claimed that Dodik
was the ideal candidate for premiership.
</P>
<P>
He even threatened that the international community would
suspend all aids to the Republic unless Dodik continues to be
prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Many Chinese Don't Know Who Is Christ on Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese people
are celebrating Christmas, but a survey found that over 60 percent
of them don't know the meaning of Christmas and who on earth Jesus
Christ is.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Morning Post questioned in Jinan, capital of East
China's Shandong Province, nearly 50 people who bought cakes for
Christmas on their knowledge about Christmas and Jesus Christ, and
was startled to find that 34 of them responded "I don't know,"
"I'm not quite clear" or simply retorted, "Who cares?"
</P>
<P>
An accountant, identified as Mr. Li from "Orient Company," said
that he's celebrated Christmas since he was ten, believing
"Christmas is an elegant upper-class activity in the West, a day
for civilized people only and those who don't celebrate Christmas
are definitely dropouts of the society."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper found that this attitude and knowledge about
Christmas also exist among government staff members, businessmen
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Reporters of the Beijing newspaper stopped a
fashionably-dressed young man and a young woman on the way. They
had just bought a bag of small candles and claimed them as
students.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it is fun to celebrate Christmas, the woman answered,
"Sure, every western festival is fun and exotic."
</P>
<P>
Liu Long, a middle school student, suggested to Beijing Morning
Post reporters that China should abolish the Spring Festival, the
most important Chinese festival, and let all Chinese celebrate
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The reason he dislikes the Spring Festival is that the festival
is too provincial.
</P>
<P>
A retired professor, who asked to be named as Guo, was adamant
about preserving Chinese festivals while showing a liberal stand
toward Western festivals.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese should take the quintessence of Western festivals
and discard the waste and rough things," he said. "We shouldn't
celebrate a Western festival in a distorted way."

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Negative Growth of Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Electricity generation and
consumption in many parts of China declined this year for the
first time in two decades, according to today's Economic
Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the first eleven months, electricity generation and
consumption in Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, Chongqing and
Shanghai municipalities, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region dropped
markably, by 10 percent in the worst case.
</P>
<P>
Northeast Electric Power Group, a leading electricity supplier
in northeastern China, generated 87.6 billion kwh of electricity
in the first ten months this year, 2.4 billion kwh less than the
same period last year, and its sales fell by three billion kwh to
83 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the shrinking electricity market in
northeast China to the insufficient operations of industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This summer's destructive flooding is another major factor.
Electricity consumption of farmers in Jilin and Liaoning provinces
has dropped by 28 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia Pursues Active Engagement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- For Australia, the Asia
financial crisis is a touchstone, which tests the nation both
economically and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Australia's relations with Asia, Minister for
Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer has noted that "the fact is, and
will always remain, that the same seas that wash our shore wash
yours, that the majority of our trade routes pass this way, and
that our future is irrevocably bound up with that of the region
that surrounds us", "in both security and economic terms there is
no region where more significant Australian interests are
engaged."
</P>
<P>
In view of this fact, the Australian government pursues a
foreign policy of active engagement with Asia, attaches a top
priority to Asian affairs, and is committed to making a lasting
contribution to the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial turmoil surfaced in Southeast Asia last
year, Australia has contributed, through the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), three billion U.S. dollars to the hard-hit
nations of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. It also offered
humanitarian assistance to help Indonesia alleviate the combined
impact of economic crisis and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Australia has also committed to continuing
bilateral assistance programs with a number of economies including
the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Mongolia,
with a total amount of more than 400 million Australian dollars
(260 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Australia also played a key role in lobbying and coordinating
international community raising funds to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's views, Asia, particularly East Asia, has been
and remains one of the most important engines for global economic
growth. Australia has deeply integrated itself with the Asian
market. Its!!exports to East Asia increased at a rate of 60
percent in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
During last month's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Australia tried its best to
push the APEC in accelerating the process of trade liberalization,
and to persuade the participants of the meeting to reaffirm the
commitment to the Bogor agreement on introducing free trade by
2010 for developed economies and 2020 for other APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC program for accelerated liberalization of 15 sectors
is crucial to maintaining that momentum. These sectors worth over
900 billion U.S. dollars, or more than half, of intra-APEC trade
include areas of substantial interest to Australia, such as autos,
food, energy, chemicals, fish, environmental products, gems and
precious metals.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization, as Australians see it, is not only an
issue for its own trade, but also serves its strategic aims. And
it is clear, the regional security environment is, to a great
extent, determined by the changing relationship among major
powers, while a desirable peaceful and stable relationship among
the major powers emerges only from a background where all the
economies become increasingly interdependent economically and
strategically. A free trade environment without tariff barrier
just serves this purpose.
</P>
<P>
And over the years, Australia has evolved its own way of
dealing with state-to-state affairs in Asia. Australia underlines
the importance of peaceful resolution of differences and fosters a
sense of common interest and shared responsibility for the
region's future. In Prime Minister John Howard's words, different
countries have varying views and cultures about their system of
government and no foreign countries should be seen to be lecturing
other countries on how to run their government.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Industrial Zone to Add Golf Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A world-class golf course and
golf club and an advanced housing estate will be set up in
Myanmar's developing Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone in the northwest
of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The Hlaingtharya zone is one of the five of its kind being
established in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed here Thursday between the Human
Settlement and Housing Development Department of the Myanmar
Ministry of Construction and the Yangon Nominees Co. Ltd., a
subsidiary of the FMI Group of local companies, the entire project
will be implemented on a 264-hectare plot at a cost of over 23
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 453-hectare Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone was initially
developed by local entrepreneurs who set up such industries as
food processing, textile, engineering, electrical goods,
chemicals, forest products and animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The development of the zone was later joined by multi-national
foreign firms including those from Britain, France, Japan,
Singapore and Thailand, as well as Myanmar-foreign joint ventures,
by leasing land and running dairy products, galvanized iron sheet,
and sanitary and garment factories.
</P>
<P>
After Thailand's Rojana Industrial Park Co. Ltd. joined the
infrastructure development of the zone in April 1997 with an
investment of 14 million dollars, the zone became the third
foreign-invested one after the Mingaladon developed by Japan's
Mitsui and the Thanlyin-Kyauktan established by Singapore's
Sinmardev and Malaysia's Genting Sayen Berhad. The remaining two
are entirely locally-invested.

the government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Seek More Loans for School Dropouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Education Ministry of
Thailand is to seek an additional 500 million baht (13.9 million
U.S. dollars) from state coffers to bring the dropouts back to
school, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also provide loans to needy students, the

</P>
<P>
Sa-ngob Laksana, deputy permanent secretary for education, said
a 1,000-million baht (27.8 million dollar) loan was insufficient
to meet the rising number of loan seekers.
</P>
<P>
The loan, granted by the Asian Development Bank, is aimed at
helping 215,722 dropouts and poor students from primary and
secondary schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 313,211 students and dropouts have applied
for the loans, according to Sa-ngob, who is the deputy chairman of
the ministry's loan scheme.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked schools in all provinces to submit lists

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister
Pandeli Majko said Thursday his government supports
self-determination by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of
the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary session on the Kosovo issue, Majko
said the Albanian government "favors the respect of the will of
the Albanian people in Kosovo as well as the international
principles and rules."
</P>
<P>
As the situation in Kosovo "continues to be grave," he told
legislators, the intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will play a decisive role in resolving the
year-long crisis.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta told the
parliament session that the rivalry between the Albanian
political factors in Kosovo is becoming one of the main obstacles
for a quick end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said neither the Albanian government nor any of the
Albanian parties will support such internal rivalry for power.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, with the absence of the Democratic Party --
the major opposition party, the Albanian parliament discussed a
draft resolution calling on the world community to take measures
to prevent genocide in Kosovo and all the political factors in
Albania and Kosovo to take an identical stand in tackling the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to be approved on December 28.
Deputies of all parliamentary groups called on the Democratic
Party to return to the parliament to approve the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Government Hopes to Resume Talks With Rebels in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
will step up efforts in the coming year to resume peace talks
with the country's armed rebels, chief government negotiator
Emilio Rabasa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The leftist Zapatist Army of National Liberation (EZLN) took
up arms in southeastern Chiapas state on the New Year's Day in
1994, demanding greater democracy and rights for impoverished
Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people were killed in the conflicts before the
Zapatistas retreated into jungles to become a guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue between the government and the EZLN has been on and
off in the past four years, with the last round of peace talks
suspended in September 1996 due to disagreement over indigenous
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Rabasa said in a communique that the government is open for
discussion of any plan to remove obstacles in the talks,
including even the establishment of a mediation group, which, he
said, should be "national and professional."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of an international mediation to
solve the problem, saying "it is not necessary, not justified,
and the matter does not merit it."

<HEADLINE> Panama to Resume Tuna Fishing, Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Panama would restart tuna
fishing in the Pacific Ocean next February following the United
States' lift of its embargo on tuna fishing and marketing, an
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move, said Marine Resources Administration director
Arnulfo Franco, would help Panama recover losses amounting to 150
billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tuna embargo was initially applied to Mexico in 1991
and later extended to Southern Pacific nations in response to
environmentalists' allegation that tuna capture kills dolphins as
the imperiled species often get snared in tuna nets.
</P>
<P>
Now a limited tuna capture is allowed, Franco said. Panama,
Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela have jointly ratified the Panama
Declaration to protect the dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The lift of embargo would ensure a resumption of tuna fishing
and marketing activities as well as promote the development of
Vacamonte Port on the Pacific coasts, where there are 322 tuna
ships and 56 cargo ships, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Reports Record High Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An upturn in economic growth
in Liaoning Province, which saw a record high of 8.6 percent in
November, is attributed to the impact of the state's positive
financial and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
One of China's traditional industrial bases in the northeast,
the province's growth had dipped from 7.7 percent in March to 5.1
percent in August, partly due to the Asian financial crisis and
the devastating summer floods.
</P>
<P>
Pundits noted, however, that since September the economy has
begun to bottom out.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial government official the state policy
to stimulate and increase domestic demand has yielded positive
results in Liaoning. The province invested 59.77 billion yuan
(about 7.47 billion U.S. dollars) in fixed assets in the
January-November period this year, an increase of 4.7 percent on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the real estate sector has become a new popular
investment hot-spot in the province after the State Council
launched a reform in the housing distribution system this year.
</P>
<P>
The province injected a total of 10.84 billion yuan into the
sector in the 11 months, accounting for 18.1 percent of the
province's total investment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to other state policies which ban the artificial cutting
of prices for industrial products in order to improve competition,
the prices of 13 major products has remained stable and even
increased in November, compared to October.
</P>
<P>
The consumer market is brisk, with total retail sales of
consumer goods topping 140 billion yuan in the January-November
period, up 11.1 percent in real terms over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Thus by taking full advantage of the state's macroeconomic
policies, Liaoning will be pushing forward its reform of
state-owned enterprises, improving competition and market share,
so as to ensure its objective of an eight percent economic growth
for the year.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Its Cotton Circulation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Council of China has
decided to reform the country's cotton circulation system in 1999
to make the sector fully market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The reform includes cancellation of traditional government-set
cotton purchase prices and allowing textile companies and other
related economies to buy cotton directly from farmers, rather
than the monopoly held by the All-China Federation of Supply and
Marketing Co-operatives.
</P>
<P>
The government will only issue the reference price before the
purchasing season, which is estimated to be around 500 yuan (60.3)
per 50 kilograms, or 10 yuan a kilogram, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The current cotton purchasing price was set at the
government-fixed rate of 700 yuan per kilogram, a radical
difference.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that nearly 2 million tons of cotton have been
stockpiled across the country. In order to balance the stockpile
of domestic cotton, the government for the first time introduced
market mechanisms to this long-protected sector in April by
allowing the purchase price to float between five percent on a
basis of 650 yuan per 50 kg.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the exemption of cotton price control is also
part of government measures to save costs for textile companies,
most of which are running at loss.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Agriculture predicted that the
purchasing price will see a big plunge next year while the
cotton-planting areas will also be reduced.

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A latest State Administration
of Internal Trade report predicts that China will accelerate the
pace of economic growth by the second quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumer demand is expected to increase, but the
current situation of oversupply of some consumer goods, especially
medium- and low-grade ones, is not likely to improve much.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the negative impact of sluggish domestic demand
and weak exports caused by the Asian financial crisis, the Chinese
government has taken a number of policies this year, with three
consecutive interest rates cuts, increased spending on
infrastructure, and increased bank loans and export tax rebates.
</P>
<P>
The positive effects of these policies on the national economy
will become more apparent in the second quarter next year, and
capital goods producers are likely to benefit from state policies
more than enterprises focusing on consumer goods, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Spend More on Posts and Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of posts
and telecommunications services has meant more convenient methods
for Chinese people to communicate with each other, and raised
their expenditure in this sector as a result.
</P>
<P>
Per capita expenditures in the sector have amounted to 96 yuan
monthly in 1998 compared to 1.72 yuan in 1980, according to a
survey carried out in 12 Chinese cities by the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the number of people writing letters
has dropped from 87 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 1998; the
number of telegrams has fallen to 3 percent from 12 percent; and
that telephone users have increased by some 90 percent from the
former 8 percent eighteen years ago.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 50 telephones for every 100
persons in most Chinese cities, and there are 60 to 90 phones per
100 citizens in the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
And the numbers of electronic beeper users and Internet
browsers have also increased markedly. There were only an
estimated four beepers per thousand people in 1980, while in 1998
the figure stands at 26 percent per hundred.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls on Filipinos to Meet New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has called for unity, hard work and perseverance to enable
Filipinos to meet the challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In his Christmas message published here Friday, Estrada urged
Filipinos to "seize the moment and shun negative traits that have
hampered our progress as a nation."
</P>
<P>
He said that in spite of the extreme economic crisis that has
gripped Asia since last year, the country was able to escape a
recession and will be able to register a slight positive growth
next year, unlike other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, in the course of his recent official visit to
other Southeast Asian countries, he had noticed that the
Philippines appears to be lagging behind its neighbors, despite
its "almost boundless capacity in natural and manpower resources."
</P>
<P>
"Now, the time has come for us to stand up and make things
happen. I know that we, as a people, have the inner strength and
resiliency, as proven by our ability to rise from one grave
challenge after another, in the course of our proud and glorious
history," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have passed the darkest hour and weathered the eye of the
storm. Let us seize the moment -- to move forward, never looking
back, over our divisiveness, over our negative attitudes, so that
we can concretize our centerpiece programs geared to achieve
economic and social equality for the poor, peace and order, and
food security for all," President Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said unity among Filipinos should be the bedrock of their
progress and their capital to face the challenge and opportunities
of globalization in the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Sue to Get out of Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Three players filed suit
in Houston seeking unconditional release from their NBA contracts
to play in Europe for the rest of the FIBA season, a press report
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Denver Nuggets guard NickVan Exel, New York Knicks forward
Marcus Camby and Toronto Raptors forward Reggie Slater asked for
a court hearing seeking an injunction in the suit directed
against USA Basketball - the bridge between the NBA and FIBA,
basketball's interantioanl governing body.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is set for Deceber 30. European rosters are set
for the playoffs by January 1.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is there is no basketball season, no salary
being paid and no prospect for talks," attorney James Bryant
said. "Based on that, we believe this year's contract is moot."
</P>
<P>
A favorable ruling would not only fee the players to play in
the Euroeap but possibly make them free agents, which could have
repercussions for all locked-out NBA players under contract. All
three are in the final year of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
"All three want to be with their NBA teams, " Bryant said.
"But they need a job."
</P>
<P>
Russ Granik, USA Basketball President and also deputy
commissioner of the NBA, said: "We don't understand what USA
Basektball has to do with this. We don't pass judgment on the
validity of NBA contracts. In terms of eligibility with NBA
players, that's between the NBA and FIBA."
</P>
<P>
FIBA requires that players get unconditional release from
their NBA contracts before signing with European teams. Once a
player is released, USA Basketball processes the clearance with
FIBA.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern has said NBA players are free to
play for FIBA teams, but those under contract must return to the
league if the lockout ends.

WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of applications
for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week to the lowest
level in 17 months, the U.S. Labor Department reported on
Thursday.
</P>

complete eight years of continued growth next March from the last
recession in 1990-1991.
