KHARTOUM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al
Bashir has reiterated his government's willingness to cooperate
with the OAU on investigation of the three men wanted in the
attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's life last June.
</P>
<P>
The investigation involves the attempt by gunmen to assassinate
Mubarak on June 26, 1995 when he arrived in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa for an OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Egypt have accused Sudan of complicity in the
attack and have complained to the OAU and the U.N. Security
Council that Sudan is not cooperating in bringing the men to
justice.
</P>
<P>
Meeting today with an Organization of African Unity (OAU)
delegation led by OAU Assistant Secretary General for Political
Affairs Daniel Antonio, President Bashir affirmed his country's
interest in maintaining the Unity of the OAU, the Sudan News

</P>
<P>
Louis Farrakhan is the leader of the Nation of Islam from the

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saleh reviewed his ministry's plan to offer
best serves to worshippers in mosques and churches in his country.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan said that "Iraq has been a force challenging hegemony

control over the Middle East region."

<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak also met with the
black American leader and his accompanying delegation.
</P>

He said during the meeting that more that than five years of

and the elderly.

<HEADLINE> New Patriotism Powerful Among People, Says S. African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua)-- The new patriotism of
South Africa was not something the government or politicians
could create or wish into existence, it was a powerful feeling
among the people and communities in all walks of life, President
Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the three-day debate in parliament on his
opening-of-parliament speech, Mandela said an increasing pride in
being South Africans was closely bound up with progress the
country had made in overcoming the enforced divisions of the
past.
</P>
<P>
"It nurtures the conviction that by working together we can
overcome the problems we face," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the elected representatives of the
people had to justify the trust put in them to oversee South
Africa's transformation.
</P>
<P>
"It means asking ourselves, not just as individuals, but as
political parties: what are we doing to advance nation-building
and reconciliation, growth and development, safety and security,
justice and human rights."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela urged South Africans to dispel the
notion that when the majority of people coalesced around the
common perspectives articulated by any given party, this became a
threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
In his state-of-the-nation speech at the 1996 session of
parliament on February 9, Mandela said South Africa needed a new
patriotism to create a new society and deal with crime, violence
and corruption. enditem

<HEADLINE> (updated) Freight Train Slams into Office Building in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A runaway freight train
slammed into a railroad office building in northern U.S. just
before midnight Wednesday, injuring nine people.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said sabotage was suspected in the midnight crash
in a switching yard in St. Paul, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to have been some tampering with the train,"
said Dick Russack, a spokesman for the train company Burlington
Northern. "As a result we have called in the FBI."
</P>
<P>
The train, carrying lumber, grain, chemicals and other cargo,
lost its brakes before hitting six parked Canadian Pacific
locomotives and crashing into a office building in the switching
yard.
</P>
<P>
Two train engineers and seven people in the building were hurt,
including a man who was pinned for three hours under a car holding
15 tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
Burlington Northern officials did not elaborate on why sabotage
was suspected in the crash.
</P>
<P>
A passenger train derailment that killed one person and injured
78 others in Arizona last October was also blamed on sabotage.

Apostolos Kaklamanis arrived here today for a four-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis, who is visiting Cyprus at the invitation of the
President of the House of Representatives Alexis Galanos, said on
arrival that during his stay he will discuss with the island's
leadership the current phase of the Cyprus problem and the
prospects of the national issues.

He said he was conveying "a message of continued support

Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis noted that the pact agreed upon by the two
governments in November 1993 should be strengthened to face what
he called "Turkish expansionist threats" against Greece and even
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Greece was actually protecting the southeastern frontiers of
Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus House President Galanos described Kaklamanis' visit to
the island as "historic," which manifests close cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela would donate to the state all the gifts he had
received as President of the African National Congress (ANC) and
head of government, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, the condition of the donation was that they would not be
housed in the country's major urban centers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ANC's weekly caucus meeting yesterday in Cape
Town, Mandela said there was no space in his home as the gifts
already filled two rooms.
</P>
<P>
Although the total value of the gifts was unknown, a necklace
given to the president on a visit to Qatar was worth 500,000 US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Enough to retire on," Mandela told the caucus.
</P>
<P>
The gifts would not sold, but would probably be housed in a
rural museum, which would probably boost tourism in the area,
said ANC Chief Whip Bulelani Ncguka. enditem

MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
left his hometown of Yekaterinburg this evening for neighboring
city of Chelyabinsk to continue his Urals trip, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Yekaterinburg, some 1,440 kilometers south-east

afternoon that he will run for his second term of office in June.
</P>
<P>
In Yekateringburg, administrative center of the Sveldlovsk

region will offer support to the president in running for
re-election.
</P>

Home Is Russia" faction in the State Duma (the lower house of the
Russian Parliament), told reporters that "Yeltsin's decision to
run for the second term did not come as a surprise for 'Our Home
Is Russia,' we fully support it."
</P>
<P>
While left-wing forces consolidate behind Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who also was nominated by his party a
candidate today to run for the presidency, the "democrats" must
unite behind Yeltsin, Belyayev noted.
</P>
<P>
In Chelyabinsk, Yeltsin is expected to hold a number of
meetings and visit several industrial enterprises. He will return
to Moscow on Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> 12 Injured in Building Collapse in Central Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 were injured when a
four-floor building collapsed in central Beirut today, and some
politicians hurried to use the incident to launch a new attack on
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and his government.
</P>
<P>
Local Red Cross sources reported that at least 12 were injured
in the building collapse which took place in the Wadi Abu Jamil
neighborhood in central Beirut this morning.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work was still going on this afternoon. Officials of the
Lebanese Red Cross Committee believed that there were some victims
still buried under the rubbles.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the building collapsed when more than 10
workers of SOLIDERE, the Lebanese Company for the Development and
Reconstruction of Beirut Central District, were dismantling
pavement lights and windows preparing for a destruction.
</P>
<P>
They said that SOLIDERE, which was masterminded by the
multi-billionaire prime minister as part of his ambitious
blueprint to rebuild the war-devastated country, ordered the
dismantlement despite the existence of a family comprising four
persons inside.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Aiad, his wife and two children refused to evacuate,
waiting for a "fair compensation" from SOLIDERE. The family,
living on the first floor, is one of the owners of the building.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the members of the family, some Syrian and Egyptian
laborers of the SOLIDERE company were also injured.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident, ambulances and rescuers rushed
to the site, helped by SOLIDERE's cranes and bulldozers, to save
the injured and look for victims under the ruins.
</P>
<P>
Police blocked the neighborhood at once, preventing journalists
and civilians from approaching.
</P>
<P>
After informed about the accident, House Speaker Nabih Berri
had a telephone call with Prime Minister Hariri "to make all the
institutions ready for the rescue of the residents," the state-run
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Berri also called Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister
Michel Al Murr and asked him to arrest those responsible
"immediately" and open "complete and full" investigations into
the incident, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers pointed out that today's accident
would unavoidably provide more ammunition to the opposition of the
prime minister and his government at a time when the government is
pressured by a series of strikes and threats of demonstrations of
labors unions, demanding higher salaries and improvement of living
conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece is experiencing one of
the wettest winter with a record amount of rain falling throughout
the country since last November, according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
"This winter is widely considered to be one of the wettest on
record, and January has been the winter month with the heaviest
rainfall," the country's associate professor of meteorology Yannis
Theocharatos said.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, alone, the amount of rain which fell last month was
double the average amount recorded in recent years. In fact, the
rainfall recorded in only half an hour on one January day exceeded
the average total amount for the entire month.
</P>
<P>
Theocharatos, who predicted much more rain in the run-up to
Spring, said the Mediterranean zone, between the 30th and 40th
parallels north latitude, will experience an increase in rainfall.
Greece falls within this zone.
</P>
<P>
According to Athens water and sewerage company, the amount of
drinking water through rainfall collected by three reservoirs near
Athens has surpassed 589 million cubic metres, enough to sustain
the capital for a year. And if the rain continues to come down as
heavily in March and April, there will be enough water for two
years, the company added.

ATHENS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Greek economy is recovering
at a faster rate than expected, with inflation and the public
deficit dropping steadily, National Economy Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the minister said, private investments increased by
6.1 percent, compared to 3.5 percent foreseen by the economic
convergence program. The investments in the public sector was up
18.6 percent, against a program target of 9.5 percent, Papantoniou
said.
</P>
<P>
For 1996, he added, the government would stick to its policy of
monetary stabilization. The drop in interest rates would be
proportional to the drop in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou predicted a further drop in inflation in 1996 of 3
percentage points and indirectly therefore, a 3 percent drop in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in January stood at around 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Joint Syrian-Iraqi Water Committee Ends Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Syrian-Iraqi
Technical Committee on Water concluded here today its five-day
meetings on coordinating stances of the two countries with regard
to sharing the waters of Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua following today's closing
session, Abdul Sattar Salman Hussein, Iraqi Undersecretary of
State for Irrigation and leader of the Iraqi delegation, said that
"the meetings were held in a cordial atmosphere and there has been
identity of views on all points discussed."
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq and Syria have agreed on maintaining the
coordination meetings, and Baghdad will be the venue of the next
session of the joint technical committee.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether sanctions will be imposed on those European
companies that help Turkey in building a dam across the Euphrates
River, Abdul Sattar said that should those companies which
finance and carry out the construction work of the Turkish dam
disregard the rights of Iraq and Syria, the least sanctions would
be to deny them the right to operating in Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Arab League had sent a note of protest
to Turkey and would meet at Arab foreign ministers' level on March
19 to discuss the water issue. Both Iraq and Syria will demand a
fair and reasonable division of the Euphrates River waters among
Iraq, Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, an agreement was reached among Syria, Iraq and Turkey,
stipulating that Turkey would allow the flow of 500 cubic meters
of water per second to Syria and Iraq. Accordingly, Iraq's share
stands at 58 percent and Syria's at 42 percent of the total
quantity of water.
</P>
<P>
With regard to pollution of the Euphrates waters, the leader of
the Iraqi delegation said the Euphrates water was polluted with
saline and chemical matters, rendering it harmful to health as
drinking or irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his statements, he said that Iraq and Syria had
called for a tripartite meeting, comprising Iraq, Syria and
Turkey, but Turkey had not so far responded to the invitation
which still stands.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation will be leaving Damascus Friday.

BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today accused Israel of
refusing to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and
open its nuclear facilities for inspection, which have posed a
threat to the peace and security in the Middle East and the world.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman made the accusations while
commenting on a statement by Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
following his meeting with Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all Arab and international parties,
particularly officials of the U.N. and the International Atomic
Energy Agency are aware that Israel is the only party in the
Middle East which owns all kinds of massive destruction weapons
and long-range missiles that threaten peace and security in the
region and the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel refuses to join the Non-Proliferation
Treaty and to open its nuclear facilities for an inspection while
Iraq and other Arab countries joined NPT a long time ago and are
committed to its conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that Ekeus will work away from attempts to
misuse the UNSCOM by those who harbor aggressive intentions.

called the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia to a Balkan
summit in Rome over weekend in an effort to secure the full and
smooth implementation of the Bosnian peace agreement, U.S.
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be chaired by representatives of the European
Union, Russia and the United States and hosted by current rotating

</P>

U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
on Wednesday that the message to be delivered at the Rome meeting
is that "parties (to the peace treaty) will not be allowed by the
United States, the European Union and the Russian federation to
decide which parts of the accord they are going to implement. They
are going to implement all of it."

Richard, U.S. mediator for the Bosnian peace treaty signed last
December, called the problems over alleged war criminals, war
prisoners and other issues such as the divided city of Mostar a
"bump in the road" to the peace in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The United States hammered out the peace agreement between
presidents Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia
and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia during three weeks of intense
"proximity talks" at an air force base in Dayton, Ohio, last
November.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has taken a risk by sending
some 17,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of the 60,000-strong
NATO peace implementation force, could see his chances of winning
a second term in the White House badly damaged before November's
presidential elections if the Bosnian peace treaty failed to be
fully implemented.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Iran's Contacts with Iraqi Rebel Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denounced the
contacts between the Iranian government and the rebel Kurds held
in northern Iraq as an interference in its internal affairs and
warned the contacts could severely damage bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, quoted by the Iraqi
News Agency, said in a statement that Iraq has in the past
stressed that such a persistent behavior of the Iranian
government represents interference in the internal affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian action also encourages Kurdish groups
to spread a state of instability in northern Iraq and that the
Kurds are held responsible for the abnormal and tragic situation
in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Iranian government has recently
invited a Kurdish delegation to attend celebrations of the
anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with Iranian officials and the Iranian
authorities gave a wide media coverage to the visit, stressing the
role Iran has played in allegedly restoring peace in northern Iraq
and ensuring the safety of Iraqi Kurds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman concluded that while the Iraqi government
reiterates its denunciation of such contacts it calls upon the
Iranian government to steer away from twisted paths that would
inflict severe damage on the relations between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government would
make earnest efforts to remove landmines laid across the country,
Minister of Social Resettlement Albino Malungo said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the Technical Commission of
Demining here, Malungo said the government's objective is to make
Angola a landmine-free country as soon as possible. The operation
would be supported by the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the countries where landmines have been
densely planted in the 30 years of anti-colonialist war and civil
war. It is estimated that nearly eight million landmines have yet
to be removed in Angola.
</P>
<P>
About 200 people have been killed and 400 others injured by
landmines since the Lusaka Protocol was signed in November, 1994,
to end nearly two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Commission comprises representatives of the
United Nations agencies in Angola, Non-Governmental Organizations
and the National Institute of Removal of Obstacles and
Explosives.

<HEADLINE> PFLP Leaders Request to Return to Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Popular
Front for Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) have expressed their
desire to return to Palestine from their exiled headquarters in
Damascus, to attend a special session of the Palestine National
Council (PNC), reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The PNC office in Amman has sent to the Palestinian Authority
(PA) a list of 25 PFLP members, who want to attend the
session. Among the 25 people are PFLP General Secretary George
Habash and his deputy Abu Ali Mustafa.
</P>
<P>
PFLP, founded in December 1967, is second to the Palestine
National liberation Movement (Fatah) in the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO). Known for its hard-line policy, the PFLP has
been sharply opposed to the peace deal between the PLO and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has returned to PA an initial list of 193 PNC
members requesting permission to return for the projected
session. Israel is demanding more details about the people on the
list.
</P>
<P>
A special PNC meeting is supposed to be convened two months
after Palestinian elections to discuss the removal from the
Palestinian Covenant of clauses that call for the destruction of
Israel. To this end, the Israeli cabinet agreed that all PNC
members are allowed to be back for the meeting.

HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Any preferential trade
agreement entered into by South Africa and its counterparts in
southern Africa will contravene rules of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a top South African economic researcher said
today.
</P>
<P>
But delegates to a three-day southern Africa economic
integration conference in Zimbabwe's northern resort town of
Victoria Falls were not amused by the remarks made by Professor
Gavin Maasdorp from the University of Natal, given South Africa's
reluctance to renew its outdated 1964 trade pact with Zimbabwe,
the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Maasdorp said pressure being exerted on South Africa by
Zimbabwe for a bilateral trade agreement and other pacts with
other members of the South African Customs Union (SACU) was not
compatible with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that southern Africa should seriously consider
north-south integration. "There are no particular benefits to be
derived from entering into trade agreements only with neighbors,"
he said.

JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
has phoned Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi to invite him to pay a
state visit to South Africa, the president's office confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said in Cape Town that
dates for the visit had yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi apparently phoned Mandela earlier this week and the
president had issued the invitation when he returned the call two
days later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Libyan news reports quoted Mandela as saying, "the
South African people, loyal to the friends who supported its
struggle, is eager to welcome him (Gaddafi to come) to express
its gratitude."
</P>
<P>
During a tour to Robben Island together with visiting
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland on Sunday, Mandela
announced that he was considering inviting Gaddafi to visit the
country despite the pressure from the west.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela's intention to invite Gaddafi caused a
political stir among the main parties. The opposition claimed
that the invitation was not in South Africa's national interest.

NEW YORK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Visa International and the
Microsoft Corporation said that they had agreed to join hands to
offer a complete system for home banking and bill-paying services.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the electronic banking service provider
and the computer software giant will pose a threat to the Intuit
Inc., which competes for the market, according to a report of the
"New York Times" today.
</P>
<P>
Intuit is working on a popular personal financial program
called "Quicken". The system under the cooperation plan would be
based on Microsoft's Money software and Visa's extensive financial
processing systems, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"It means Microsoft Money is going to have a much stronger
presence than Quicken," said Pheobe Simpson, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Microsoft's personal finance
products, the company's alliance with Visa was to give banks a
choice for choosing processing mode of transaction.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said home banking should first win the trust and
support of clients and banks, and is subject to investigations of
legal authorities.

<HEADLINE> 6 Bangladeshis Killed in Elections: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Six Bangladeshis were killed
today in the country's parliamentary elections, according to
Information Minister M. Shamsul Islam.
</P>
<P>
The minister told foreign journalists after the elections that
besides the six killed in poll-violence at different parts of the
country, elections in 306 out of the nationwide 20,914 polling
centers had been suspended due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
But the elections in other polling stations were held
peacefully and smoothly, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Professor A.Q.M. Badruddoza Chowdhury,
standing committee member of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), noted that "we are very happy that a great number of
people turned up at the polling stations for exercising their
franchise defying intimidation and threats by the opposition
parties."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia issued a statement
to congratulate her countrymen on their vote casting in the polls
peacefully and spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
Because of this right step of the people, the democratic march
can be further strengthened, she said.
</P>
<P>
As a boycott action, the country's mainstream opposition
parties started a 48-hour nationwide strike on Wednesday morning
to resist what they called the "one-party farcical" elections.
</P>
<P>
The oppositions have boycotted the election process due to the
dispute over the formation of a neutral caretaker government to
conduct the polls with the BNP and its government.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that although the elections were held at a
peaceful atmosphere generally, the turnout of voters was very
thin.

<HEADLINE> Extra British Soldiers Arrive in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- 500 extra British soldiers
arrived in Northern Ireland today to take up duties, according to
reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The first battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment will be used to
support Ulster's police, as fears mount that more attacks will be
launched by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) following its bombing
in east London last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Northern Ireland were quoted as saying that
these soldiers would be sent mainly to areas bordering the Irish
Republic because many ambushes on security forces had been made
there by the IRA during the 25 years of violence campaign before
1994.
</P>
<P>
The security sources described the deployment as a prudent
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that two other
relocated units are also on standby to return to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Before the ceasefire 17 months ago, Britain had kept 17,000
troops in the conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Since the ceasefire, the British government has withdrawn 1,600
men from Ulster and now it is ready to bring back the troop level
to 17,000 again.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka's Parliament Poll with poor turnout (by Tian Fan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite the opposition's strong
boycott, Bangladesh today smoothly finished its 6th parliamentary
election with the strict safeguard of armed forces, also with a
poor polling turnout.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 8 a.m. (local time), more than 20,000 polling
centers were open to greet the long-waiting voters. But most
voters chose to stay at home or go about their own business.
</P>
<P>
The turnout of polling was very thin and a good number of
election officials even did not turn up in the centers, according
to BSS, the state-owned news agency of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
A polling officer in the Dhaka Law College center said that
only 70 votes were cast out of the total 5,300 till 10 a.m. (local
time), BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said a lot of votes were fraudulently cast but
the Election Commission denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Only the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and some
fringe parties joining the election race fueled voters' apathy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three mainstream opposition, Awami League,
Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, and other like-minded small
parties have urged the people to obey a 48-hour nationwide
"people's curfew" ended today.
</P>
<P>
At least, 14 people have been killed, hundreds others injured
and a considerable number of cars and rickshaws damaged in the
opposition's anti-polls movement in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
BNP officials criticized the opposition for disrupting people
to franchise with death threat.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth election, dozens of police and soldiers were
deployed at each polling center and the army trucks were
patrolling the streets nearby.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Dhaka, besides some scattered cracker
bursts, polling was held amid peaceful atmosphere, the Election
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
However, at least six people had been killed in election
violence at different parts of the country, Information Minister
Shamsul Islam disclosed later today.
</P>
<P>
More than 47 million people are registered as voters in the
country, but the actual polling number will be much less than this
figure, according to some election observers.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said the final results will be
published in a few days after the polling ended at 4 p.m. (local
time).
</P>
<P>
Although the election had been finished smoothly, the poor
turnout is still a triumph to the opposition. The opposition have
announced that they will not recognize the election and demanded a
new general poll under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the resumption of talks between BNP and
opposition parties is the only way to solve the nearly
two-year-old political crisis, political analysts said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Rome Summit Aims to Defuse Bosnia Crisis  (By Jiang Yaping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- It is only two months after
the signing of the peace agreement in Paris that the three
presidents of the ex-Yugoslavia will have to meet again to defuse
a looming crisis in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the United States, Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, Bosnian President Alija Izertbegovic and Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman will meet in Rome on Friday and Saturday
with the representatives of the five-nation Contact Group
participating.
</P>
<P>
Italy will also attend the meeting as the host-country and an
informal member of the Contact Group -- the United States, Russia,
France, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The special conference in Rome indicates that the United
States and other major western countries which were involved in
brokering the peace accord are seriously worried that the peace
process is about to derail," said a Yugoslav diplomat who asked
not to be named.
</P>
<P>
A western diplomat in Belgrade said, "The three presidents, who
signed the peace agreement in Paris on December 14 of last year,
were expected to face stern warnings to settle their differences
or face punitive sanctions,"
</P>
<P>
Tension is mounting in Bosnia these days over the issue of war
criminals and the Mostar dispute, though the military aspects of
the peace accord are mostly observed by the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two senior Serb officers, a general and a colonel,
were extradited to the Hague war crimes tribunal for further
investigation, a move which has enraged the Serbs and prompted
them to break top-level contact with the NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities earlier suspended all contacts and
meetings with the Muslim-Croat federation to protest against the
arrests of several Serb officers and soldiers in the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The arrests and extradition of the Serb officers, Serb
parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik warned Wednesday, "is a
direct violation of the peace agreement and might cause war
tension in the country."
</P>
<P>
The Croat authorities in Mostar were also angered last week
when the EU-appointed administrator for Mostar, Hans Koschnick,
decided to divide the city into seven districts: three Muslim,
three Croatian and one joint. The Croats' anger later turned into
violent protests which almost culminated in a lynch of the EU
official.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Dayton accord now faces a severe test, and
the United States has been trying to defuse the mounting tension.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke visited the
Balkan region last weekend and held meetings with the three
presidents over the crisis. But indications are that he failed to
get what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
At the Rome summit, Milosevic is expected to be under strong
pressure to cooperate in war crime investigations. "He must help
bring the war criminals indicted by the Hague-based international
war crimes tribunal to justice," a diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
Arrest and trial of war criminals in former Yugoslavia is a
difficult but key issue in the Bosnian peace process. A total of
52 war criminals in Bosnia, 45 Serbs and seven Croats, have been
publicly indicted by the Hague tribunal. But only one of them, a
Serb, is under custody for trial. The recently extradited two Serb
officers were not on the war criminal list.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tudjman and Izertbegovic will have to
reaffirm that the Muslim-Croat federation will not split and the
tension in Mostar between Muslims and Croats is manageable.
</P>
<P>
"What worries the international community is that the whole
Bosnia will turn into a giant Mostar, united in papers and divided
in reality," a diplomat noted. "In that case, more political
crises are certain to erupt time and again, putting western
countries into an embarrassed situation."

<HEADLINE> Government Agrees to Hike Employees' Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The government today finally
agreed to implement the industrial relations court's ruling on a
45-percent pay increase for public service employees with effect
from December 1, last year.
</P>
<P>
An a statement released here today, chief government spokesman
Amussa Mwanamwamba said the government had computed the 45
percent salary increase on the basis of the pay figures which
existed at the time the dispute was taken to the industrial
relations court in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government had taken the new stand on the issue to lighten
the burden of the current economic hardships on the affected
public service employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial relations court clarified last month that its
ruling on the 45 percent salary increase last November was
separated from the 30 percent pay increment which the government
awarded to public service employees in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government argued that the 30 percent pay
increment should be included in the 45 percent increase ruled by
the court last November.
</P>
<P>
After the government's new decision, the public service
employees' salary and wage will be increased by 75 percent from
the early 1995 level.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Pledges to Work for Russian Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Gennady Zyuganov, leader of
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) and nominee
of the party for presidential elections, said today he will work
for boosting Russia in the future.
</P>
<P>
At its fourth conference held here earlier today, the KPRF
decided to nominate its leader Zyuganov as a presidential
candidate to challenge president Boris Yeltsin, who declared on
the same day that he will run for his second term of office in
June.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted at the meeting calls on Zyuganov "to unite
around himself leaders of political parties and movements as well
as public organizations, which announced the backing of the single
candidate of left forces."
</P>
<P>
Briefly Outlining his electoral program at the meeting,
Zyuganov promised to the electorates "restoration of Russia's
potential for development, a comeback of civil and ethnic accord,
efficient law and order enforcement and a stop to extinction of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
He also called for "restriction of the president's autocracy."
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement which
declared the collapse of the Soviet Union and the founding of the
Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991, Zyuganov stressed
that "the right and duty to cancel" the document does not mean
that "tomorrow someone will forcibly have someone re-united."
</P>
<P>
The communist party leader said that the presidential
candidate of the leftist camp cannot win single-handed and needs
a well-composed team.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Ryzhkov, leader of the Power to the People bloc, said
at the meeting that the key task was to forge a "broad popular
patriotic" coalition, whose sole candidate should be Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Vasily Starodubtsev of "hardline agrarians" voiced his party's
support to Zyuganov, as did Oman Tuleyev, a vociferous critic of
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Working Russia pro-communist (radical)
movement, Viktor Anpilov, backed Zyuganov, noting that he should
be "a bit more radical."
</P>
<P>
According to the Deputy Chairman of the KPRF Central
Committee, Valentin Kuptsov, more than 90 percent of the primary
organizations of the party have seconded Zyuganov's candidacy.
As many as 2.2 million signatures have already been collected in
his support, Kuptsov told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 40 presidential candidates, Zyuganov is
seen here as the most strong rival for Yeltsin in the presidential
elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
The KPRF won 157 seats in the State Duma (the lower house of
the Russian Parliament) in last December's parliamentary
elections. It also controls some 60 seats shared by its friendly
groups in the lower chamber. One of its leaders, Gennady
Seleznyov became chairman of the Duma in January.

<HEADLINE> Formation of Financial Services Center Urged in Southern African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A top Zimbabwean banker today
suggested the formation of an international financial services
center (ifsc) to further regional economic integration in
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of National Merchant Bank of Zimbabwe Julias
Makoni told a regional economic integration conference in
Zimbabwe's northern resort town of Victoria Falls that a well
developed financial services sector will be one of the key issues
to cooperation in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This assumes a high degree of liberalization, sound
communications infrastructure, and aligning of interest rates,
taxes and other macro-economic factors with global trends and
flexible regulatory and supervisory provisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said an ifsc could include, among others, fund
administration of international business companies,
administration of international trusts and specialized risk
management schemes.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate financial sector development, he added, it was
also crucial to have common goals and objectives, a stable
macro-economic environment combined with carefully crafted
regulatory measures and incentives.

LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
reaffirmed today that its 17-month ceasefire in Northern Ireland
is over and it blamed British Prime Minister John Major for his
"cynical betrayal of the historic opportunity", according to
reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with its political wing Sinn Fein's newspaper
"An Phoblacht", a spokesman for the IRA's "general headquarters
staff" said that the IRA will continue to assert Irish national
rights in the face of British denial for as long as is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also criticized Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
for his handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he still called for all-party negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland, and stressed that it is Britain that has tried
to subvert peace efforts so as to secure an IRA surrender.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied division within the republican movement
which seeks eventual reunification of the whole island of Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will send fewer
athletes to the Olympic Games in Atlanta than in Barcelona for
lacking of money but expect them to show better performance.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Slavkov, President of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee
(BOC) said on Thursday that they would limit the number of members
in the Bulgarian Olympic team to a reasonable minimum and would
select only sportsmen who can represent Bulgaria better than in
Barcelona. He added that the team will comprise up to 110 athletes.

<P>
Some 400 million levs (5.4 million U.S. dollars) have been

CHIANG RAI, Thailand, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese

understanding and cooperation between Asia and Europe will be
beneficial to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the informal meeting of Asian economic ministers,
Shi Guangsheng, who is also head of the Chinese delegation, noted

<HEADLINE> Computer Chip Industry at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The answer for the growth of
computer chip industry is far from certain when major chip related
companies in the States have shown divergent performance.
</P>
<P>
According to previous reports, world-wide orders for computer
chips in January dropped to the lowest in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The "New York Time" reported today that Cirrus Logic Inc.
forecast a net loss for its fourth quarter, which ends on March
30, and revenue lower than that in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Applied Materials Inc., the leading producer
or equipment for making semiconductors, posted record results late
on Tuesday for its first quarter, ended on January 28, and said
that orders remained strong.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of these two major companies also went away in
opposite directions, with Cirrus's plunging 15.6 percent and
Applied Materials' gaining 3 percent on Tuesday when the stocks
retreated for the first day on the bull market.
</P>
<P>
Applied Materials said that its first-quarter net income rose
161 percent to 172 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Semiconductor Industry Association said the book-to-bill
ratio of chips, declined to 0.93 -- that is, for every 100 U.S.
dollar worth of chips shipped, only 93 U.S. dollar worth was
ordered, indicating a slowdown in sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the conflict between the earnings reports was not
significant, because the two are in such different businesses.
Applied Materials supplies the equipment to make chips, which it
sells far in advance of the chip production and is thus less
influenced by short-term cycles.
</P>
<P>
Slower PC sales in the final quarter of last year led to excess
inventory. Some analysts said the market will recover soon but
chip producing companies are worrying about their inventories and
wonder when and how to reduce the stocks.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 and 1986, the paper said, Japanese chip makers slashed
prices on commodity chips in an effort to gain market share.
Though the United States imposed sanctions against Japan for
"dumping" their products, it had a devastating effect on U.S. chip
makers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Cabinet
Committee on Privatization today approved the privatization of
"The Pakistan Times" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's plant, machinery and other tangible assets were
sold to the United News Network (UNN) at 46.1 million rupees
(about 1.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
UNN Director Shaheen Qureshi said that UNN consists of leading
professional journalists.
</P>
<P>
When the company gets the possession of "The Pakistan Times",
the newspapers' equipment will be dismantled and shifted to new
venues in Lahore and Islamabad, Qureshi added.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946, "The Pakistan Times" has been an influential
national newspaper with the circulation of about 50,000. The
English-language newspaper was owned by the state-run National
Press Trust before the privatization.
</P>
<P>
Serious efforts for privatization in Pakistan began in 1988
when the privatization process was initiated by floating shares of
the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines corporation.
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of banks, industrial units and infrastructure
enterprises have been privatized.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to privatize eight major state-run
enterprises by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Pledges to Continue Reform If Re-elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he will run for a second term of office in June
"to safeguard the ongoing reforms in Russia," according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In his one-hour address at the Youth Palace in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg, Yeltsin said: "I am certain that I shall be able to
lead the country through this time of trouble, alarm and
uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I have decided to contest the presidency and I am
declaring my decision to you and all people of Russia in my
hometown, in this conference hall so dear to me," he stated,
adding that "I am prepared to account for everything done over the
past five years and I will soon make public my election platform."
</P>
<P>
He stated that he decided to run for re-election "in order to
ensure the continuation of the course of reforms." He believes
that he has all chances to defeat the opposition candidates at the
upcoming elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he has made the decision on running for
re-election after having analyzed the situation in the country and
acquainted himself with the list of contenders to the presidential
post.
</P>
<P>
The president said: "I am in favor of reforms, but not at any
cost. I am in favor of adjusting government policies, and not for
a return to the past. I want Russian policies to rely not on
utopias nor dogmas, but on common sense."
</P>
<P>
In his words, the economic reforms in Russia have entered a
third and final stage, which will involve a growth in production
and the influx of investments.
</P>
<P>
"I want all Russians to live decent lives the way normal people
live in normal countries," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "we are stronger than those who for years
put spokes in our wheel and hindered our movement towards a great
and free Russia and a decent life for its people. We are stronger
than our own disappointments and doubts. True, we are tired, but
if we are united, we shall win."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his rule in the past five years, Yeltsin said the
Russian economy has radically changed and the reforms, which began
in conditions of the collapse of the old state and the
construction of a new one, are progressing and yielding
considerable fruit.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the mass media has become freer and a new
system of the political structure has been formed.
</P>
<P>
The main challenge facing Yeltsin is the war in Chechnya, which
he said should be finished as soon as possible, "not within years
but within months, probably before the elections."
</P>
<P>
He rejected extreme solutions to the war, noting that both an
immediate troop withdrawal and a "scorched earth tactics" are
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on financial policy, the president pledged to adhere
to a tough policy and refrain from money printing to pay back
wages and pensions. "I give my word that we shall not print a
single 'wooden' rouble," the president said using the Russian
definition for the devaluated national currency.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government "Our Home Is Russia" bloc has declared its
support to Yeltsin in his running for his second term of office.

<P>
FREETOWN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Rebels said to be from the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) on Wednesday attacked Gbemdembu
Town in the northern Bombali District, killing two civilians,
state radio said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This occurred four days after a national consultative
conference voted for presidential and parliamentary elections to
go ahead as planned on February 26,
</P>
<P>
Gbemdembu Town is the hometown of Chief of Defense Staff
Brigadier Joy Turay, army sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the houses in the town were reported to
have been looted and partly damaged, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
"Some 50 rebels, eight of them in military fatigues, entered
the town about 10 am," it said. One of the dead was burnt to
death as petrol was thrown into his car and then set ablaze while
the other was shot dead near a church.
</P>
<P>
Ten teenage girls were abducted. Correspondents predicted that
civil war will now intensify as delegates to the consultative
conference voted for elections before peace, while
RUF leader Foday Sankoh asked for postponement of elections.
</P>
<P>
The military government and Sankoh agreed to meet in Cote
d'Ivoire on February 28 for peace talks in a bid to end the civil
war. Nobody now knows whether the February 28 talks will be
maintained or not.
</P>
<P>
The elections were pledged by former Sierra Leonean leader
Valentine Strasser as a way to end the nearly five-year-old civil
war. Strasser was ousted by the incumbent Head of State Julius
Maada Bio in a bloodless coup in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Motherland Party
(ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yimaz said here today that he and the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan had
reached agreement on many aspects for the formation of a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remarks after his second talks with Erbakan on
the formation of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The RP finished first in the December 24 elections, but fell
far short of a majority to allow it to govern alone.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
government on February 3 when True Path Party (DYP) chairperson
and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller returned her mandate for
a government formation following her failure in her attempts to
convince Yilmaz to enter a coalition partnership with the DYP.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP leader told reporters that he would visit Demirel
Friday afternoon and inform the president about the results of
the two talks between ANAP and RP leaders.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and Erbakan are expected to hold their third talks on
the formation of the coalition government on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish reliable sources said Yilmaz insisted that he become
prime minister first in a coalition with Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and ANAP executives rejected Ciller's proposals for a
coalition between the ANAP and DYP in which each party leader
shares the premiership on a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's proposal had floundered on her insistence that she
become premier first under this formula.

achieved self-sufficiency in grain, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
There is a marked improvement in such basic facilities as
power, transportation and telecommunications. The local economy is
growing rapidly and the people's standard of living has been
improved markedly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that this progress has laid a good foundation for
further economic development.
</P>
<P>
He urged the tropical province to make full use of its
geographical advantages and provide other parts of the country
with quality vegetables and fine crops seeds.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Hainan to take advantage of its rich tourism
resources and pay attention to less-luxurious tourism services
that Chinese tourists can afford.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, which is rich in natural gas, should set up a large
chemical fertilizer production center so as to help satisfy the
country's demand in this sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier also talked about the improvement in basic
facilities in the Yangpu Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
With a relatively better investment environment, Hainan should
introduce hi-tech projects with high added value and promising
markets, li said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that local governments in the island would pay
great attention to the construction of advanced culture, which has
a bearing on long-term social stability and future generations.
</P>
<P>
Economic development should never be achieved at the expense of
advanced cultural construction, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged the province to give priority to poverty
reduction.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Contingency Scheme for Unlucky Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong travelers, in case
of being killed or injured in accidents while touring abroad,
might get financial assistance under a contingency fund scheme,
which will be launched tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Financed by the Hong Kong Travel Industry Compensation Fund
(TICF), the scheme is to provide ex-gratia payments to outbound
travelers on package tours which, unfortunately, lead to death or
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The compensation will cover expenses for medical care, trip of
victims' representatives and cremation or returning of the dead
body or ashes. The maximum payments amount to 180,000 HK dollars
(23,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The contingency plan is expected to complement, but not replace
insurance coverage for both outbound travelers and travel agents.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January this year, the TICF had accumulated 192
million HK dollars (24.6 million US dollars) worth of assets.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Launch Anti-Settlement Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip today took to the street protesting
against expansion of Jewish settlements and confiscation of Arab
land.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, according to the arrangements of the
Nationalist Islamist Anti-Settlement Committee, demonstrations
took place at noon simultaneously in Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem,
Qalqilya, Tulkarm and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The campaign came after Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer told settlement leaders Tuesday that some 6,000
housing units will be built in settlements just beyond the Green
Line.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has decided to call upon
countries supporting peace process to intervene and put to stop
the settlement expansion and land confiscation.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Abed Rabbo, former PA information minister, sharply
criticized the policy of the current Israeli government for
practicing racism and stealing Arab land. He added that the
Israeli government's aim is to create new expulsion of
Palestinians in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new housing plan has also aroused opposition from a number
of ministers of the government. Yossi Beilin, minister at the
Prime minister's Office, is opposed to expanding the settlements
now, even though he has come out in favor of retaining
settlements in the "Greater Jerusalem" area as part of a
settlement bloc.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said that the plan, if not
stopped, would destroy the peace process.

been and are still being helped and supported by the Chinese
government and people. The Cambodian people will forever stand
side by side with the Chinese people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited Li's last visit to Cambodia as an important event in
the history of bilateral ties, which spurred the development of
Cambodian-Chinese friendly relations.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Communist
Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF), was nominated as a
candidate for presidential elections by a conference of the
party today.
</P>
<P>
The other Communist parties or movements have practically
agreed to back the nominee of the KPRF, the sources of the KPRF
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by the party conference today proposes
Zyuganov to "unite around himself the leaders of parties and
movements who declared support to a single candidate of the
leftist forces."
</P>
<P>
Among over 40 possible candidates, Zyuganov is seen here as
the most strong rival for president Boris Yeltsin in running for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Yeltsin declared in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg that he will run for his second term of office in
June.
</P>
<P>
The KPRF won 157 seats in the State Duma (the lower house
of the Russian Parliament) in last December's parliamentary
elections. It also controls some 60 seats shared by its friendly
groups in the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, one of the KPRF leaders, was elected
chairman of the new Duma in January. He told visiting French
Prime Minister Alain Juppe today that the win of communists in

CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen killed two
policemen and one bystander in a crowded marketplace in southern
Egypt early today, a government source said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency quoted the source in the Interior

some 260 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen killed two policemen and then shot dead a bystander

The attack is believed to have been carried out by Moslem
fundamentalist militants, who have waged a violent campaign since
1992 to topple the secular government and install strict Islamic
rule.
</P>
<P>
The government security forces have fiercely cracked down on
the militants, whose sporadic attacks have been confined to some
villages in the south, especially in the province of Minya.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police shot dead two wanted militants in the
southern province of Sohag.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Recruiting Overseas Personnel: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to attach
importance to and strengthen the work of importing overseas
intelligence and personnel while expanding personnel exchanges and
co-operation with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
Vice-Premier of the State Council, made the statement here today
at a meeting with some foreign experts working in China.
</P>
<P>
The recruiting of overseas personnel and intelligence, and the
expanding of international personnel exchanges and co-operation
constitute an important component of the Chinese government's
policies of reform and opening to the outside world and are
important measures for the country's modernization drive, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China will not change its basic policy of recruiting overseas
personnel, Zhu said, adding that more overseas experts are welcome
to come to China no matter for how long.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,
Zhu extended his regards to overseas experts working in China at a
time when the traditional Spring Festival is approaching. He also
thanked all those experts working in China for their contribution
to the victory of the Chinese revolution and to China's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, the Chinese people and history will not forget
those who have made outstanding contributions to China in all
historical periods, Zhu said. "They are staunch friends and
comrades of the Chinese people," he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 520,000 overseas experts have worked in China since
1949, of whom about 490,000 came to China in the past 17 years
since China instituted the policy of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the 60 overseas experts from more than a dozen
countries who were present at the meeting on China's domestic
situation, Zhu said China's economic growth in the past 17 years
has been one rarely seen anywhere in the world. At present, he
stressed, China enjoys political stability, sustained economic
development, good social order and unity among all
nationalities. The Chinese people are confident of their bright
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen, State Councillors Li Guixian and Luo Gan (who is also
secretary general of the State Council), and leaders of relevant
departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian defense
headquarters has warned that any neighboring country that
supports terrorism against Nigeria would have itself to blame.
</P>
<P>
Such unfriendly behavior would negate the principle of
collective peace being propagated within the West African
sub-region by Nigeria, the director of defense information,
Brigadier-General Fred Chijuka said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman, who did not identify which neighbors,
noted that such acts would not be viewed lightly.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Nigeria's commitment to the promotion of peace
and understanding not only within West Africa but Africa in
general, adding that Nigeria would appreciate reciprocal
treatment from other countries.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS)
has ordered extra-surveillance at Nigeria's borders to check
possible smuggling of arms and other dangerous weapons into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The measure is coming in the wake of incidences of bomb blasts
and explosion in the populated northern cities of Kaduna, Kano
and Zaria. And security reports that materials for the
manufacture of the bombs may have either been imported or
smuggled into Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the customs headquarters at capital Abuja
said that the NCS sole administrator, Brigadier-General S. O.
Ango, ordered the acting assistant Comptroller-General Alhaji
Lawal Bagiwa to tour the customs formations in the northern and
eastern zones to assess surveillance strategies at the borders in
those areas.

<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain has developed an
inhaler that can tell asthma sufferers when to replace the device
and advise them to seek treatment if they take an unusually large
dosage.
</P>
<P>
The new device solves the problem that an inhaler might
unexpectedly run short of doses.
</P>
<P>
The Ventolin Accuhaler shows how many of the 60 measures are
left, with the last five shown in red as a signal for replacement.
</P>
<P>
By counting the doses that a patient uses, the inhaler could
alert him in case of overdosage, which usually means his disease
has become worse and he needs to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
If patients are taking twice as many puffs a day as normal, the
device can act as an early warning that their asthma is unstable
and they should do something about it.

<HEADLINE> Riley Likely Takes "Headache Tablet" to Mask Steroids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian swimmer
Samantha Riley who failed a doping test last year could have
masked the use of performance enhancing steroids with what she had
claimed "a headache tablet," a drug testing expert said in Sydney
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The painkiller Di-Gesic detected in Riley's sample produces a
distinctive peak pattern in testing, this was picked up by a
separate procedure to that used to detect steroids, said Ray
Kazlauskas, Director of Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Kazlauskas said athletes usually take masking drugs to produce
large peaks in drug test results to cover up smaller peaks
produced by steroids.
</P>
<P>
Riley, a world breaststroke record holder, tested positive for
banned dextropropoxyphene, a non-performance enhancing drug, at
the world short-course championships in Brazil last December.
</P>
<P>
Riley said earlier that she took the headache tablet containing
the drug given by her coach Scott Volkers two days before the
tournament, in which she set two world records.
</P>
<P>
World swimming ruling body FINA was expected to decide later
this month whether Riley should be banned for up to two years and
force her out of the Atlanta Olympics in July.

MOGADISHU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- J. Mohamed Ghalib, faction
leader Mohamed Farah Aideed's foreign minister, and two other
senior officials have been sentenced to death by a court in the
breakaway Republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced I. Mohamed Hurre Buubaa, Aideed's
disarmament minister, to life imprisonment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Hargeisa which supports Somaliland
President Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, all the four were convicted
for charges of treason and masterminding an armed campaign to
topple Egal's self-styled government. They had been tried in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
The four had been members of parliament of Somaliland before
they joined the rebel group fighting for what they called the
unity of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict, Buubaa was given life sentence
because he was not sworn in for parliament while the others were
fully committed. They are all famous politicians in Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Somaliland, the northwestern regions of Somalia, declared
independence from the rest of the country in May 1991 but enjoys
no international recognition.
</P>
<P>
It has been a battlefield between those insisting on the
secessionist policy led by Egal and those aligned with Aideed
fighting for the integrity of Somalia as they claim.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Quell Speculative Attack vs Pesos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
today it will not hesitate to use all the powers of the Central
Bank to quell any speculative attack against the Philippine
currency.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson admitted today that
"panic and speculative buying" hit the foreign exchange market
Wednesday following the Makati grenade explosions.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred shortly after 12:00 at noon, damaging
the shell house building and injuring four people.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Central Bank's "quick and decisive"
action prevented the further decline of the foreign exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Central Bank was able to mop up about 4.2
billion pesos (168 million US dollars) Wednesday after it sold
163.55 million US dollars at 26.225 pesos to 1 US dollar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that banks that had speculated and bought at 26.225
pesos to 1 US dollar have lost money since they had to sell the
next day at 26.13 pesos to 1 US dollar when the rate stabilized.
</P>
<P>
As of 2 p.m. today, the Central Bank bought 44 million US
dollars at 26.13 pesos to 1 US dollar out of total transactions of
97 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank also increased overnight borrowing
rates by 1.5 percentage points to quell the panic buying of US
dollars following the Makati blast.
</P>
<P>
Singson indicated, "We will always respond quickly and
decisively to quell any speculative attack against our currency
and even the US dollar."

<HEADLINE> WHO Announces New Annual Influenza Vaccine Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has announced a new composition of influenza vaccine for the
1996-1997 season, which is slightly different from last year's
formula.
</P>
<P>
WHO said in a press release that the formula is designed to
combat the three major influenza viruses of A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and
B, which have been affecting many countries in Europe, North
America and Asia since last October.
</P>
<P>
Influenza experts are constantly challenged to identify major
newly emerged strains of influenza viruses and work out revised
formula against them. The results are announced every February.
</P>
<P>
Influenza causes epidemics worldwide every year. The world
health body strongly advises the use of vaccine as a sound
preventive measure against this potentially fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that up to 80 percent of recipients will be
protected from the disease when there is a good match between the
vaccine and the circulating strains," said Dr. Daniel Lavanchy,
who is in charge of WHO's influenza program. "The severity of
illness and the frequency of serious complications will be reduced
among the remaining 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
WHO also advised that for adults one dose of the vaccine should
be adequate, while previously unimmunized children in these
categories should receive two doses of vaccine with an interval of
at least four weeks in between.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov are likely to kick off
their campaigns for the June presidential election today by
announcing their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who flew to his hometown Ekaterinburg on Wednesday,
has sent strong signals that he would seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue the reform. We must conclude what we've
started," Yeltsin told reporters on his arrival at Ekaterinburg,
some 1,440 kilometers southeast of Moscow. "Will the reform not
stop with the departure of President Yeltsin and the arrival of
another?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the impression that he is already a candidate,
Yeltsin arrived with his wife, Naina, and several celebrities
including film directors, a TV star and two cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he would announce today whether to run for a
second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Closely after his official announcement, he will start a series
of visits to the various regions of the country, in a bid to woo
voters.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Communist Party of the Russian
Federation (KPRF) is likely to approve Zyuganov's candidacy at its
Central Committee plenary meeting in Moscow today.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov has been winning mounting support since the December
parliamentary elections. The KPRF holds 157 of the 450 seats in
the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) and controls
another 60 seats distributed among several friendly groups.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center shows that some
20 percent voters will vote for Zyuganov. In addition, his
supporters have already collected the signatures of one million
voters required to make him as an official candidate.
</P>
<P>
In a comment on the forthcoming presidential election earlier
this week, former acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar urged Yeltsin
not to seek re-election, warning that he will give communists a
certain victory if he enters the ring.
</P>
<P>
Gaidar has called on Russia's Democratic Choice bloc, Grigory
Yavlinsky's Yabloko bloc and the pro-government "Our Home Is
Russia" bloc to present a common candidate for the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the most logical nominees for the post are Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Nizhny Novgorod Governor Boris
Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
Both have repeatedly declared not to compete. But Gaidar hopes
that one of the two can change his mind before April 16, the
deadline for submitting the one million signatures necessary for
becoming a candidate.
</P>
<P>
In the democratic camp, the failure of various blocs to unite
around a single candidate is recognized as the most damaging
aspect of their electoral prospects, following their dismal
performance in the parliamentary elections last December.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko has pledged to back its leader, Yavlinsky, while
"Our Home Is Russia" led by Chernomyrdin will support Yeltsin.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- As the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland approaches, Red Cross societies in both the
mainland and Hong Kong are forging closer links.
</P>
<P>
Many effective ways of cooperation, including disaster relief,
medical rescue work and blood donations, have been conducted in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
After the recent strong earthquake in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, the first donation of money, a sum of 500,000 Hong Kong
dollars, was sent to Red Cross Society of China from its Hong Kong
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Red Cross Society of Hong Kong also went to
the earthquake-striken area to express sympathy and give aid to
victims.
</P>
<P>
The first large-scale disaster relief operation in which the
Red Cross Society of Hong Kong participated in the mainland was in
the enormous floods of 1991 which hit seven provinces in the south
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, whenever a disaster happens in the mainland, Hong
Kong has donated money and sent relief goods and materials. Their
donations so far have reached more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
By taking part in meetings and holding symposiums, the Red
Cross Society of Hong Kong has also helped to promote blood
donations in the mainland, and given medical equipment to mainland
health bodies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, camping holidays between mainland and Hong Kong
youngsters and mutual visits of Red Cross leaders from the two
sides have also been successfully conducted, enhancing the
friendly links.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, Red Cross Society of Hong Kong will join
the Red Cross Society of China according to the Basic Law, said Gu

<HEADLINE> HK Revelers Warned Against "Silly Spray" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Lunar New Year
revelers who spay cans of festive foam in crowded areas could be
arrested and charged with disorderly conducts, according to local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
But the police clamp down on the use of "Silly Spray" was a
surprise to local shopkeepers who have just received fresh stock.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a dry form, how can it be dangerous?" asked a gift
shop proprietor.
</P>
<P>
But police believe the spray could cause footpaths and roads to
become slippery, leading to accidents in crowds.
</P>
<P>
"We will not confiscate the cans but we will ask users to leave
them with us for safekeeping until they leave," said Wan Chai
Deputy District Commander, Superintendent Gordon Yeung Ying-wai.
</P>
<P>
And the cans would not be allowed into the more crowded areas
and police "would not tolerate" any troublemakers, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
During the Christmas celebrations, youths who sprayed the
festive form in crowded areas were detained for questioning by
police.
</P>
<P>
And some of the downtown areas will be closed occasionally to
vehicles during the Lunar New Year celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Going for Gold in Shanghai, Despite Price Leap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A price rise today for gold
ornaments and jewelry in Shanghai has failed to deter gold lovers
in Shanghai, China's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The sudden increase in the city was greeted with a calm
reaction, and has not yet affected sales of gold items in shops.
</P>
<P>
The price for gold rose from 137.5 yuan per gram yesterday to
140.5 yuan per gram today.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the Laomiao Gold Shop in downtown Shanghai
received its usual streams of visitors. Some customers talked
about the matter, but most of them said they could accept the
price rise.
</P>
<P>
Admiring a newly purchased necklace, a 27-year old lady said,
"It is important to buy the things I like and not worry about the
price. It doesn't matter if it means it is costing a few dozen
extra yuan to buy the item I like, as our wages have increased."
</P>
<P>
Experts here agreed that the price rise will not have a big
affect on the marketing of gold ornaments.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shanghai Municipal Gold Ornament Pricing
Group, said the price rise was a quick reaction to a change on the
international gold market.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Safety in Coal Production During Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China is calling for increased
attention to be paid to safety in coal production during the
Spring Festival, the traditional Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
"Mines nationwide must pay greater efforts to guarantee the
safe production of coal so that workers and their relatives can
spend a happy and auspicious Spring Festival, " Zhao Baoming, vice
minister of coal industry, told a national conference today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that coal production during the Spring
Festival has always been a weak link, with great losses occuring
in coal mines every year.
</P>
<P>
"We must be highly vigilant about this, " he added.
</P>
<P>
In January the number of deaths in coal mines nationwide was
reduced by 66 people compared with the same period last year, but
accidents still happened frequently.
</P>
<P>
In the first one and a half months of 1996, fatal accidents
have happened in coal mines in Hegang, Beijing, Xinwen and Datong,
due to the negligence of some departments.
</P>
<P>
The senior official urged other mines to draw on lessons from
them and exercise stricter management and checks.
</P>
<P>
China produced 1.28 billion tons of coal in 1995. The state key
mines have turned losses into profits for three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
"Overally speaking, the country's coal production situation is
developing in a good direction, " he said.

HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong equity funds have
topped the fund performance table for the first time since March
1993, according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association's
performance survey at the end of January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong equity funds sector posted a median return of
54.75 percent in 1995, in line with the gains registered by the
Hang Seng Index within the period.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, chairman of the association, said that the Hong Kong
stock market was one of the best performing Asian markets in the
fourth quarter of 1995 and the rally continued into the first
month in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strength of the US dollar and the cut in US
interest rates in the past months have triggered fund flows into
the Asian stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong stock market is one of the most liquid markets in
the region and it has good earnings potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, most Asian funds fell out of the top 15 sectors. Hong
Kong equity funds were one of the few Asian sectors which managed
to maintain a presence in the top 15 places.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January 1996, Asian funds took up 10 slots in the
top 15 places.

all posted an annual return of 20 to 25 percent, including
Singapore and Malaysian, Thai and Indonesian equity funds.

<HEADLINE> India to File Sensitive Documents in Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A designated court today
directed India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to procure
and file before February 27 the "sensitive" documents in the
Hawala case which are in the custody of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a bribery scandal in which some leading
politicians in the country were accused of receiving money from
illegal foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
Additional sessions judge V.B. Gupta, granting the time
requested by the CBI, asked the investigative agency to move the
Supreme Court in this regard to get hold of the sealed documents
for the purpose of filing it before the trial court.
</P>
<P>
The sealed documents consist of two files, a note pad, three
slip note pads and three loose sheets of paper, which would
support the CBI charge sheets against former cabinet ministers
V.C. Shukla, Madhavrao Scindia and Balram Jakhar.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers resigned after the investigative agency
sought permission of the president to prosecute them for allegedly
receiving huge pay-offs from the Jain brothers, the king-pins in
the 65 crore rupees (18 million US dollars) Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
In view of CBI's application seeking extra time to file the
documents, the special judge deferred taking cognizance of
evidence against all the accused persons till February 27.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the three ministers, the CBI has also filed charge
sheets against seven top politicians, including Bharatiya Janata
Party President L.K. Advani and all India Indira Congress Working
President Arjun Singh.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on China's Nuclear Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman said today that China, a responsible state, has never
transferred equipment or technology for producing nuclear weapons
to any other country.
</P>
<P>
Nor, as a responsible state, will China do so in the future,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remark in Beijing this
afternoon at a press conference when asked to comment on a report
that the CIA had obtained evidence that China sold Pakistan a ring
magnet which can be used to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Shen was also asked to comment on reports that the US
Government is considering imposing sanctions against China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, as a signatory state of the NPT (Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty), has international legal obligations for
nuclear non-proliferation, and it does not advocate, encourage, or
engage in nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that while China conducted some co-operation
programs in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with other
countries, it strictly observes the three principles guiding
China's nuclear export and accepts the safeguard of the IAEA
(International Atomic Energy Agency).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Sino-US relationship is showing a momentum
of gradual improvement, which, in Shen's words, is not easy to
come by, adding that a healthy, stable bilateral relationship
serves the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that if the US side imposes unjustifiable
sanctions against China, that would lead to serious harm in
Sino-US relationships. Shen added that he hopes the US side will
not use rumors as the basis for making decisions.

BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry today

</P>
<P>
Lee reiterated once again that Taiwan still intends to expand
its international space for survival and the only way of Taiwan is
to head towards the international community.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the criticism in
Beijing this afternoon at a press conference when asked to comment

Voicing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory, a fact recognized by the international community, Shen
called on the Taiwan authorities to be conscious of the righteous
cause of Chinese people. And he urged Taiwan authorities to give
up creating "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" or pursuing
"Taiwan's independence", which, in Shen's words, is 'the only way
of Taiwan'.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if the Taiwan authorities continue with
activities that try to split the motherland, they must take all
the consequences that arise as a result.

ISLAMABAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Gul Hanif today Denied that Foreign Secretary Najmuddin
Sheikh would talk with Afghan officials during his visit to Tehran
from February 17 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of talking with the Kabul regime in
Tehran," Hanif said at a weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistan foreign secretary is visiting Iran in a
bid to continue its efforts to promote peace in Afghanistan as the
two countries are in constant touch on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Iran could advise or consult with Afghanistan on
the issue, but it was Afghans themselves who were able to solve
their own problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the intra-Afghan talks in Islamabad, the spokesman said that
"it seems" the Afghan leaders were able to iron out some
differences.
</P>
<P>
He said former interim president Sibghatullah Mojaddedi agreed
to rejoin the Supreme Coordination Council, a four-party
anti-government alliance comprising the National Islamic Movement
of Uzbek leader Rashid Dostum, the Hezb-i-Islami of Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, the Hezb-i-Wahdat of Karim Khalili and Mojaddedi's
National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-government alliance agreed that if any attack
was launched by the Kabul regime on any group, it would be
considered an attack on all the groups.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Afghan opposition leaders intended to talk with
President Burhanuddin Rabbani even without his prior resignation,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Afghan leaders held talks in Islamabad
on their own and Pakistan did not play a role in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Stop Depending On Japan For Car Components,  Says Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that it is time for the local
automobile industry to stop depending on Japan for car components.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said with the local automobile manufacturing
giant Proton's ability to produce almost 200,000 cars a year,
dependence on Japan could be reduced and the components sourced
locally.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although many products were already made in
Malaysia they were still imported, especially from Japan. "We want
these components to be produced by Malaysia because we now have
reached the required number of cars to make the parts making
industry profitable."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Mahathir said
continued dependence on Japan for car components had pushed up
Malaysia's import bill, which in turn contributed to the country's
balance of payment deficit, which stood at 18.1 billion Malaysian
ringgit (about 7.24 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, Mahathir said, the government frequently had
to approve Proton's application to increase the price of the
national car each time the Japanese currency appreciated.
</P>
<P>
"We want to lessen the effects of yen fluctuation," Mahathir
added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who will make an unofficial visit to Japan from
February 25 to 27, said he would take the opportunity to view the
facilities and methods of producing components required by
Malaysia's automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Malaysians were capable of making
components that were still imported.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was satisfied with the level of Japanese
technology transfer in the local automobile industry, Mahathir
said no country would impart all its experience to other
countries, adding: "For example, we do not give all our technology
on rubber and oil palm clones to others."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A worker in northeast China's
Liaoning Province has collected more than 40,000 badges, all
dedicated to Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhiyan, an ordinary worker in Zhuanghe city, began to save
the badges when he was a young student.
</P>
<P>
He travelled the country to search for the badges which were
mass manufactured in honor of Chairman Mao Zedong (1893-1976)
during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
It cost him 5,000 yuan (about 602 US dollars) to buy the
badges, a large amount compared with an ordinary worker's monthly
income of only 100-200 yuan (about 12-24 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
After buying the badges, he washed and cleaned them, then
classified and registered every one. He has amassed over 1,500
different varities of badges. He uses the only two rooms of his
home to store his massive collection.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Liu exhibited the collection in his hometown, using
16,000 of the badges to form sentences such as "Serve the People"
and "Marking the 100th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birthday".

countries. It also sponsored 36 performances, exhibitions, and
other activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Chinese and foreign cities became sister cities
with CPAFFC's help, bringing the total number of such cities to
more than 670 pairs.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC organized a series of activities last year, marking the
50th anniversary of the victory in the anti-fascist war and in
China's war against Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
Such activities help increase people's understanding of
traditional Sino-Japanese friendship, and expose the attempt to
deny the Japanese invasion by a few Japanese.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC also played a role in supporting the convention of the
UN Fourth World Conference on Women, in foiling the Taiwanese
authorities' "dollar diplomacy" schemes, improving Sino-US
relations, and in coordinating China's relations with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
An official with the association said that CPAFFC will have
more extensive exchanges with people of various countries this
year, especially with major companies and foundations and try to
help bring more foreign investment and technologies to China.
</P>
<P>
The association will also stress on exchanges and cooperation

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Trade Deficit Exceeds 10 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit
surpassed 10 billion U.S. dollars last year for the first time in
the nation's history, the Korea Customs Administration said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The country's customs-cleared trade deficit amounted to 10.06
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, recording a 58.7 percent increase
from the 6.34 billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent to 125.06 billion U.S. dollars,
the fastest yearly growth pace in nine years.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew even faster at 32 percent to 135.12 billion U.S.
dollars, the highest since they shot up 35.8 percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Leading export items from South Korea are automobiles,
chemicals and electronics while steel products, machinery and
electric and electronic equipment led the growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
The International Trade and Industry Ministry predicted earlier
that South Korea's exports growth rate for 1996 will decline to
13.4 percent with the total volume standing at 142 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports are likely to rise 10.3 percent to 149 billion
U.S. dollars this year as international prices of raw materials
have been stabilized and facility investment in South Korea is
expected to slow down, according to the ministry.

</P>
<P>
They also made 15.9 billion yuan in net profits in 1995, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The national high-tech development zones and
province-level high-tech development zones have become a driving
force behind optimizing local industrial structures and
invigorating local economies."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to take high-tech
development as a major measure to invigorate China's economy and
increase its comprehensive national strength, he said.

<HEADLINE> PM: Lebanon Needs Syrian military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al Hariri has said that Lebanon "urgently needs" a Syrian military
presence in this country even after an peace agreement is signed
with Israel, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is the only country which has helped us in building our
national army," the prime minister was quoted as saying by
Ad-Diyar, a pro-government daily, as saying. "And a presence of
the Syrian army in Lebanon is part of the national stability and
peace (in this country)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the 35,000-strong Syrian troops in Lebanon is a
main cause the opposition uses to attack policies of Hariri's
government.
</P>
<P>
With the next parliamentary elections approaching, the
government is going all out to pacify the opposition to
weaken the possibility of a boycott similar to that in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some Christian parties boycotted the 1992 elections on the
grounds that there could not be a just and neutral election
with a presence of foreign troops in this country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of an Al-Iftar (breakfast in the Moslem
fasting month of Ramadan) held in his Beirut residence Wednesday
night in honor of hundreds of university students, Hariri said
that Lebanon needs the Syrian army to help the Lebanese army
in safeguarding the security in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the syrian troops will carry out this mission
after the Lebanese army is sent to the South to keep the
stability on the border in accordance with the would-be
peace agreement with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"In the next stage, we urgently need someone who help us
in safeguarding the interior security, especially if the peace
negotiations with Israel achieve positive results and a peace
agreement is reached between us and Israel," said the prime
minister.
</P>

"The most important item of the peace agreement," he said, "is
a withdrawal of the Israeli army from the South and a deployment
of the Lebanese army there to keep the security and consolidate
it," he said.

He pointed out that the Lebanese army has not reached a

<HEADLINE> Malaysia in No Hurry to Send Bosnian Refugees Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said here today
that it was in no hurry to send home some 200 Bosnian refugees
currently staying in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We know the situation is still very bad, even after the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord," Foreign Ministry
Secretary General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar told the press after a brief
discussion with Bosnia-Herzegovina's Minister for Refugees and
Immigration Nudzeim Recica.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave it to the Bosnian people here to decide when
they wish to go home, but there is no hurry for them to leave this
country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamil said that he discussed with Recica the continued
role of the Assistance Mobilization Group (AMG) under the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) in its efforts to help
the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Recica said that his main task was to assist the return of
Bosnian refugees with the cooperation of international
organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"What is most important now is to start rebuilding our country
with proper accommodation and shelter and employment before these
people can go home. Over the past one year, about 60,000 Bosnians
taking refuge overseas have returned home," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recica said that one million Bosnian refugees are spreading
over 100 countries while another one million are displaced within
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> China to Harness Soil Erosion in Yellow River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Large areas of land in the
middle reaches of China's Yellow River have been brought to life
with ambitious conservation schemes.
</P>
<P>
Now China plans to harness 12,500-square-km soil eroded areas
in the middle reaches of the river annually starting this year.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, areas totalling 210,000 square kilometers
will have been brought under control, it was reported at the third
meeting on water and soil conservation in the middle reaches of
the Yellow River, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The middle reaches cover more than 600,000 square kilometers in
Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Shanxi and Qinghai provinces and Inner
Mongolia and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Years of afforestation have led to one third of the 450,000
square kilometers of area suffering from soil erosion being turned
into farming, forest and livestock-breeding land.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lian'an, director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission
under the Ministry of Water Resources, has encouraged localities
to organize labor forces to tackle soil erosion during slack
seasons in a planned way.

WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's goalkeeper Oscar
Perez scored a dramatic equalizer in the 90th minute to lift his
team to a 1-1 draw with South Korea in an under-23 soccer friendly
in Santa Ana, California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were deadlocked at 0-0 before the 88th minute
when South Korea's Yong Su Choi opened the scoring with a header
after receiving a pass from teammate Jong Su Go.
</P>
<P>
The seemingly hopeless Mexico was awarded a corner kick in the
final minute, and Perez ran from his net and positioned himself
near the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
The ball flew over two South Korean defenders and fell right to
Perez, who fired home with a left-footed high shot from 11 meters
away after it passed over the right shoulder of South Korean
goalie.
</P>
<P>
The goal was the first ever for a Mexican goalkeeper in
under-23 competition.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to Produce Military Equipment Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
today urged local manufacturers to diversify their products to
include components and spare parts of defense equipment to ensure
the country's independence from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters here today
that the government has realized the need to set up Malaysia's own
facilities for producing components and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Defense Chief Ismail Omar confirmed recently that the Royal
Malaysian Air Force was facing problems with the Hawk jet
fighters, whose avionic components were prone to breakdown and the
spare parts were slow in coming from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expressed unhappiness with the after-sale services
of the Britain Aerospace, the manufacturer of the Hawk jets.
</P>
<P>
"To make sure that we are not dependent on foreign sources for
components and parts, one of the areas that we must develop and
succeed in is the manufacturing of components and spare parts,"
said Syed Hamid.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Malaysia's private sector to get involved in
this industry.
</P>
<P>
Syed added that the public need not worry about the hawk jet
fighters of the Royal Malaysian Air Force because the country's
defense and security were in good hands and good shape.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM: Labor Party Should Oppose Creation of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak has said that the Labor Party should not change its
November 1991 policy which opposes the creation of a Palestinian
State.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Barak, a member of the Labor Party,
as saying here Wednesday night that "I think we should leave our
platform the way it is, which calls for opposition to a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no additional state between Israel and the
Jordan River" was a clause included in the 1991 platform.
</P>
<P>
Barak's remarks came as voices within the Labor Party have been
on the rise calling for the clause to be stricken.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Ora Namir, also a member of
the Labor Party, said Wednesday that She would support the
establishment of a Palestinian state, so long as the Israel's
security is secured.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he expected his views to prevail, saying a struggle
over these issues could hurt the party.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the Labor platform to include an
"overwhelming majority" of settlers who live in settlements in the
 West Bank that would remain under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, Israel would remain sovereignty over
"united Jerusalem, full stop."
</P>
<P>
Barak called his views "an extended Allon Plan," referring
to former Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, who favored partition
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the Labor platform remain different
from the Likud's, because "we would make clear that we want
to separate" from the Palestinians, while the Likud "still
wants to use variety of levers to control their lives."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the document he favors is not
designed to win over floating voters who voted Likud in the
past. "Everything we put in the platform must stand
up not only with the voters, but also in negotiations," he added.

LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
sold 70 percent of shares of Lusaka's leading Pamodzi Hotel worth
6 million US dollars to India-funded Tata Zambia group of
companies under an agreement signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) Valentine
Chitalu announced the sale of the shares at a cocktail party last

The purchase of the country's only five-star hotel by the Tata
group came at a critical time for the hotel industry in Zambia,
which had been experiencing a decline in room occupancy rates and
increased competition, Chitalu indicated.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 30 percent shares the hotel would be offered to
the public through a ZPA controlled public floatation at later
date, he added.
</P>
<P>
The privatization is part of the economic restructuring program

TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite opposition of the
United States, French President Jacques Chirac's close aide will
soon lead a delegation to visit Iran, a local press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by Minister of Urban Planning
Bernard Pons, the English-language daily Iran News quoted Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the trend of Iran's ties with
European countries, Velayati said that Iran's relations with
France, Germany, Italy and Spain were positive.
</P>
<P>
"To have ties with Iran is in the interest of both Europe and
the Islamic Republic," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that not all analyses on Iranian-European relations
are correct, Velayati emphasized that Tehran's relations with
Europe are not limited to just words.

The newspaper said that the French minister will meet a number
of Iranian officials including Velayati and Abbas Akhundi,

NANJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
is using the law to protect the area's limited farmland. It will
mean the recovery of 6,660 hectares of farmland, ensuring grain
production this year.
</P>
<P>
The province will employ pricing and administrative means to
guide farmers to ensure that areas for grain crops will reach to
69,330 hectares this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our effort to guarantee the province, with
cultivated areas averaging less than 0.06 hectares per capita, to
gain self-sufficient in grain," said Jiang Yongrong, vice governor
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu plans to build a number of irrigation projects and
raise more funds to subsidize the production of chemical
fertilizers this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is known as China's largest economic province.
</P>
<P>
To ensure sufficient grain production, the provincial
government has made contracts on production responsibility with
top leaders in provincial, city and county governments, and
designated farmland protection zones.
</P>
<P>
It also has used science to raise per unit yield and the output
of livestock and poultry.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 32.863 million tons of grain last year,
up 5.2 percent over the previous year, 561,000 tons of cotton, up
22.8 percent, and 1.596 million tons of oil-bearing crops, up 18.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Reviews Zimbabwe's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will send a high-powered mission to Zimbabwe soon
after the next month's presidential elections to review the
country's economic reform programme.
</P>
<P>
An IMF spokesman said in Washington yesterday that the
discussions would focus on the formulation of the second phase of
the economic structural adjustment programme launched in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first phase offilcially ended last December.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe called for a
review of some aspects of the structural adjustment program,
saying the program was causing a lot of suffering among the
people.
</P>
<P>
"We have been urged to cut down on expenditure so that we do
not borrow from banks and leave little money for business. That
policy has failed because things have really gone down," the
president complained.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "starting to doubt some of these international
monetary fund ideas and" his government could "not take
everything".

<HEADLINE> Work On Industrial Park Starts In Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- infrastructure work for
the first Palestinian industrial parks is under way and expected
to be completed within six months.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Karni site in the Gaza Strip has already
started, and work on sites at Muqeibla outside Jenin and
Kedouri near Kalkilya will begin in upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Uri Savir and
Palestinian Industry Minister Abu Ala, who met Wednesday to discuss
details of the infrastructure, agreed that while construction is
going on, preparation will be made to absorb new enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres strongly advocates the
establishment of industrial parks to create jobs for Palestinians
so as to alleviate the burden of high unemployment in the
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also been in favor of the idea and promised to
finance all infrastructure work related to the establishment of
the parks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat was opposed to the plan until recently since it
involves a high degree of cooperation with the Israeli business
sector. Another aspect is that taxation and security within the
zone will be the responsibility of the companies running them.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the meeting between Savir and Ala
reflected a change in Arafat's attitude toward the parks.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources denied that the U.S. had exerted pressure
on the Palestinians, saying that it merely served as "a
go-between" to promote the issue of industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and Japan have also expressed
interest in financing the establishment of industrial parks, but
they prefer to do so only after the first parks actually
begin to operate.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite opposition of the
United States, French President Jacques Chirac's close aide will
soon lead a delegation to visit Iran, a local press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by Minister of Urban Planning
Bernard Pons, the English-language daily Iran News quoted Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the trend of Iran's ties with
European countries, Velayati said that Iran's relations with
France, Germany, Italy and Spain were positive.
</P>
<P>
"To have ties with Iran is in the interest of both Europe and
the Islamic Republic," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that not all analyses on Iranian-European relations
are correct, Velayati emphasized that Tehran's relations with
Europe are not limited to just words.

The newspaper said that the French minister will meet a number
of Iranian officials including Velayati and Abbas Akhundi,
Minister of Housing and Urban Development.

Velayati visited Paris last month to attend a memorial
ceremony held for the late French president Francois Mitterand.

following the Gulf war.

condolences on the passing away of President Mitterrand, expressed
hope that French-Iranian ties would improve.

HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe on Wednesday called for a speedy economic development in
the country.
</P>
<P>
At a rally for the next month's presidential elections in
northern Zimbabwe, Mugabe said although Zimbabwe had attained
political independence, the people had no control of the economy
as it was still in the hands of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He stressed agriculture as the backbone of the economy, saying
all industries would come to a halt if agriculture performed
badly.
</P>
<P>
The president took the possession of land as a key to the
country's economic development and believed without adequate land
there was no control of the economy.
</P>
<P>
A new land apportionment exercise is needed to speedily
acquire more farms for resettlement, Mugabe said, urging the
legislature to grant the government more powers to ensure the
resettlement of thousands of landless Zimbabweans.

<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China's economy started the
new year with higher industrial output and a drop in consumer and
retail prices.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued today showed that China enjoyed a normal
situation in January, with industrial output rising steadily,
retail markets amply supplied and price hikes further brought down.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistical Bureau issued a report today revealing
that China produced 129.9 billion yuan worth of industrial goods
last month, a real increase of 16.9 percent over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial efficiency was lower last month, the report
added. The sales rate was also lower than that for the same month
last year.
</P>

China's domestic market enjoyed ample supplies last month, the
report said, adding that China's traditional festival, the Spring
Festival, which falls on February 19, boosted the sales volume.
</P>
<P>
A total of 190.9 billion yuan worth of goods were sold on the
retail markets, 10.7 percent in real terms over the same month

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bangladesh's Lackluster National Election (by Tian Fan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Almost no traffic can be seen on
the usually busy streets of the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka today
as the election of the country's sixth parliament is going on.
</P>
<P>
There are no queues of voters at polling stations as most
voters choose to stay at home or go about their own business
instead of casting their votes.
</P>
<P>
"Election? No," said one of the few rickshaw-pullers on the
street. "I have to work, to earn money to feed my family."
</P>
<P>
Oman Faruque, a businessman strolling near his house, said: "I
won't cast my vote, nor will my family, because the polling is
meaningless. The results are known before the vote."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and some fringe
parties are in the election race while the three mainstream
opposition parties -- the Awami League, Jatiya Party and
Jamaat-e-Islami -- and like-minded small parties have been urging
people to observe a nationwide "people's curfew" today to resist
the "farcical one-party" polls.
</P>
<P>
At a polling center in Banani town, only a few voters show up
and some election officials and guarding police are chatting
casually.
</P>
<P>
"I back the BNP, so I come here to vote. If the opposition
parties seize the power, there may be more corruption. Who
knows?" said Ataur Chowdhury, a lawyer, after casting his vote.
</P>
<P>
"The turnout will be high although some people are too scared
to go out because of the opposition's threat to disrupt the
polls," an election official claimed.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people have been killed, hundreds injured and a
considerable number of cars and rickshaws damaged in the
opposition's anti-election movement in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has deployed dozens of policemen at
each polling center to ensure a smooth election. Soldiers are
patrolling the streets nearby.
</P>
<P>
Alam Ahmed, a student of Dhaka University, criticized the BNP
for rejecting the opposition's demand for a neutral caretaker
government to oversee the polls.
</P>
<P>
"The BNP government is corrupt, autocratic and discreditable.
Most of the Bangladeshi people have lost faith in Khaleda Zia," he
said, adding that most of his classmates would not go to the
polling station.
</P>
<P>
More than 47 million voters are expected to vote at 20,914
polling centers in 250 constituencies, according to the Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the actual polling number would be
much lower than this figure.
</P>
<P>
The final results will be published in two or three days after
the polling ends at 4 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have announced that they will not
recognize the government that snatches power through a "farcical
and illegal election."
</P>
<P>
An Asian diplomat here said that he did not believe the
election could put an end to the country's political crisis of
nearly two years and that the BNP had no alternative but to
continue talks with the opposition parties.

SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading metropolis
had already seen some 3.6 million passengers coming home by land,
air and water for the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, by

</P>
<P>
The traditional lunar new year festival, which falls on Feb. 19
this year, is the most important time for family gatherings in
many Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Railway Station handled 188,000 passengers on
Feb. 12, and more than 194,000 on Feb. 13 and 14, the season's
peak.
</P>

<P>
Authorities expect some 7.76 million passengers to pass through
the metropolis during the holidays, a rise of 3.2 percent. This
year's holidays will be the longest possible, with seven days.
</P>
<P>
Rural migrant workers are expected to account for one million
of the passengers. Many work units have persuaded about 60 percent
of the rural laborers working in Shanghai to stay for the
holidays, in a move to lessen the burden on the transportation
system.

<HEADLINE> The Family is Shanghai Husbands' Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- As one of the managers of a
Shanghai television station, Mr Zhu is always busy, but, he is
always careful to avoid unnecessary social intercourses, returning
home as early as possible to help his wife with the household
chores.
</P>
<P>
With his family's high income, it would be fairly easy for Mr
Zhu to hire a housekeeper. But, "The problem is that it's hard to
find a good one. And living with an outsider under one roof would
be a bit inconvenient for us," he explained.
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for husbands now to do most of the household
chores in Shanghai. A number of surveys have shown that husbands
do more of the chores than the wives in most three-member families.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents are finding that, bit by bit, husbands are
losing control of the purse strings, and more fathers are
attending parent-teacher meetings at school, something that used
to be the mother's task. At the same time, wives are seen less in
the market doing the shopping and more often at social activities.
</P>
<P>
People like to refer to men like Zhu as "apron husbands". A
recent survey showed that 57 percent of the women interviewed and
55 percent of the men, like such husbands. "A man should be proud
of being called an 'apron husband'," one woman commented.
</P>
<P>
When talk turns to the husbands' shortcomings however, people
often find fault with their lack of courage or their cowardliness.
</P>
<P>
Others criticize the loss of self-respect by men, to which Yang
Dongping, a sociologist, replies, "Although such husbands lose
some freedom and power in their families, they are compensated
with the wives' greater love and better care in their daily
lives."

QINHUANGDAO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Qinhuangdao
Development Zone, one of 16 national zones approved by the State
Council, will concentrate on developing new and high technology
and its export-oriented economy in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, this development zone in north
China's Hebei Province will develop 10 sq km of land, five sq km
of which will be used for various projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so, the development zone has approved
239 foreign-funded projects, involving a total investment of 900
million US dollars, from 24 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Three sq km of the land has already been leveled and is open
for business use, and a fairly complete industrial structure,
comprising metallurgy, machinery, electronics, building materials,
and light and fine chemical industries has taken shape in the zone.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sales of the Lian Bang
Software Store, in northwest Beijing's Zhongguancun, has had
monthly increases of over 50 percent over the past half year,
thanks to the government's anti-piracy efforts.
</P>
<P>
The store, part of a chain, is the biggest software store in
China, and sells more than 300 pieces of computer software each
day, amounting to 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 US dollars). "These
days, we are selling at least 100 sets of computer software a
day," a clerk at the store told Xinhua reporter.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tie, vice-president of the Lian Bang Industrial Co.,
attributed the business boom to the government's crackdown on
piracy and its efforts to increase public awareness of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"Most people didn't know what the definition of piracy was only
a year ago, and they had no idea about the 'original version' of
computer software," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Changing sales strategies have also contributed to increased
sales, however. Prices of software used to be more than
individuals could afford, but they now usually are separated into
component parts to reduce the cost.
</P>
<P>
With the Spring Festival (Lunar New Year) coming up, more than
20 domestic computer companies will put thousands of types of new
software on the shelves, pushing up the sales volume of
software.

COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's postal services
will be restructured in order to enter the arena of development in
the 21st century, according to postal sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Postmistress General Soma Kotakadeniya said that the postal
service had remained stagnant in the last two decades while other
sectors had developed using open economic policies to achieve
social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The private sector which had seen potential in the postal
services had introduced their own mailing system and were well
patronized because they were efficient, she added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's postal department did not have a computer even to
do its accounting. Under such circumstances one could not expect
much from the postal service.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, she would be able to provide a
streamlined postal service throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
She hoped to introduce a market oriented administration soon
which will help officers to perform their duties better.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Arrested at Nepal-India Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 300 Bhutanese
refugees staging a sit-in protest at Nepal's eastern border with
India for three weeks were arrested Wednesday by Indian police
after they crossed the border, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Bhutanese peace marchers to Thimbu, capital
of Bhutan, were intercepted by Indian police Wednesday afternoon
when they proceeded into the Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
They were later taken to a prison in eastern India, said
Nepal's official news agency RSS.
</P>
<P>
These refugee marchers had been held up at the eastern
Nepal-India border for more than three weeks after they began a
sit-in protest late last month.
</P>
<P>
They were demanding the release of 150 Bhutanese arrested
earlier by India and free entry into India on their way to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, 150 Bhutanese refugees were arrested by the
Indian authorities at the same border place when they tried to
enter India on a peace march towards Thimbu.
</P>
<P>
There are now an estimated 100,000 Bhutanese refugees living in
eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal after those of Nepalese
origin were forced to flee Bhutan in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has asked for India's help in solving the
problem of the Bhutanese refugees but the Indian government
insists that the issue should be settled only through bilateral
talks between Nepal and Bhutan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced plans to launch its first
ever global bond issue.
</P>
<P>
The 1 billion U.S. dollar issue is expected to come to market
in the near future, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bank said the IDB sees the global issue as
part of the continuing evolution in diversifying the ways in which
the bank raised funds for its increasing borrowing activities.
</P>
<P>
The bank continues to regard the European market as an
important source of funds and plans to tap the European market
when warranted by investor demand and by the needs of the
institution. Similarly, the IDB continues to have an interest in
the Yankee market, especially for long-dated securities.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the launch of the issue, the bank is undertaking a
number of brief roadshows to target specific investor communities
in Asia, Europe, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has been a regular borrower in capital markets for a
long time, and it has borrowed actively in yen, U.S. dollar,
German mark, Swiss franc and Dutch guilder markets. It has also
been present recently in the South African rand, Hong Kong dollar,
Spanish peseta and Italian lira markets.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Hopes Talks With Iraq Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council hopes that the talks between the U.N. and Iraq on
oil-for-food plan will be serious and successful, council
president Madeleine Albright said here today.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that U.N. Under Secretary General Hans
Corell, head of the U.N. team in the negotiations, had briefed the
Security Council on the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
In keeping confidentiality, which is essential for the success
of the talks, Corell dwelled on mainly the procedures and
atmosphere instead of specific items and substance of the talks,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have been detailed, business-like and fruitful,
though they have not covered all the areas that must be discussed
and resolved before an agreement is possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
"All members of the council remain hopeful that the talks will
be serious and successful and proceed in the atmosphere of
confidentiality necessary to ensure the success," she said.
</P>
<P>
There is no question of mending Resolution 986 and the Iraqi
side has made no such suggestion, she quoted Corell as saying. The
talks are continuing, she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has imposed economic sanctions, including banning oil
export, on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The
economic sanctions have crippled the Iraqi economy and one-fifth
of its people suffered from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 last April, which
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars of oil for six months to
import food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had refused to accept the offer until mid-January. Talks
between U.N. and Iraqi officials started in New York on February
6.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Proposes Asian-European Trade Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will propose trade
and investment liberalization between Asia and Europe at the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in early March, according to The Nation
today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is seeking to set the year 2010 for the easing of
conditions for developed countries and 2020 for less developed
ones, a highly-placed Thai source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan said that he believed
"the European Union (EU) should commit itself to liberalizing
trade and investment by the year 2010, because their members are
all developed countries."
</P>
<P>
He added that any ASEM timeframe liberalization should be
similar to and run parallel with that of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization between Asia and the EU will help promote open
regionalism or the multilateral trade system under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) banner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said, "What APEC agreed on concerning the trade and
investment liberalization will be extended to outside members
including the EU. Therefore the EU should do the same."
</P>
<P>
APEC has agreed that its developed members liberalize trade by
the year 2010 and its developing members by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Economic ministers of the ten Asian countries that are to
attend the ASEM on March 1-2 in Bangkok began a two-day meeting
today in Chiang Rai, north Thailand, to work out a common Asian
stance and finalize the ASEM agenda on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic ministers are expected to discuss some
specific issues that have hindered the flow of trade and
investment between the two continents, such as anti-dumping
measures, tariff barriers and import quotas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at examining if those measures are
appropriate practices or are tools for trade and investment
discrimination, and to encourage the EU to open its market to
countries outside the region.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Plans to Increase Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will increase aid to
developing countries to one percent of GDP as soon as its
financial conditions permit, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs
Lena Hjelm-Wallen told parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
She said that Swedish aid to international development projects
would remain unchanged for three years and, finances permitting,
would then be increased to one percent of GDP, which exceeds the
U.N.'s requirement of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to parliament, the minister also stressed the
importance the Swedish government placed on promoting
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid spread of information technology, the transfer of
capital, environmental changes and population growth, the word
"cooperation" had taken on more meaning than ever before, she said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that the United Nations Security Council should be
enlarged, the U.N.'s financial situation improved and its role in
the global economy and conflict-prevention be extended.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Sweden's defense policy will remain
unchanged but will be adapted to a changing world. Sweden would
not take part in any military alliances in order to retain its
neutrality in wartime, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok city
administration will launch an extensive campaign to control the
growing number of stray dogs to keep the Thai capital free of
rabies, the Bangkok Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Deputy Bangkok Governor Chaiyant
Kampanartsenyakorn as saying that the campaign would be introduced
at temples around Bangkok, where most stray dogs stay.
</P>
<P>
Sterilization of stray dogs will be carried out throughout the
year. Chaiyant said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok city administration had earlier planned to declare
this year a "rabies-free year" but the plan was hampered after the
number of rabies patients in the city rose to five in 1995 as
compared to only one the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The city will also launch a campaign to implant microchips in
dogs to prevent dogs with owners from being inadvertently killed
by dog-control workers. It will also help prevent sterilized
stray dogs from being repeatedly sterilized.
</P>
<P>
The number of stray dogs in Bangkok was 47,897 in 1994 and the
number of dogs with owners was 277,382, according to the latest
figures.

<HEADLINE> Export Inspections Helping Jiangsu's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Exports in east China's
Jiangsu Province have become increasingly popular on international
markets thanks to strict inspections.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, 98 percent of the exports have been
found to be complying with standards. Commodities inspections have
been the reason, according to a local foreign trade official.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, provincial
imports and exports grew at an annual rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, imports and exports were worth 16 billion yuan (nearly
two billion US dollars), more than 10 billion of that from exports.
</P>
<P>
The official said that export-oriented enterprises in the
province have been paying greater attention to quality, and 3,915
of them have passed quality and quarantine checks by commodity
inspection agencies.
</P>
<P>
A number of enterprises are preparing to apply for
international certification to stimulate their companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yangzhou Feida Electrical Engineering and Meters Company,
the largest table drill manufacturer in the province, has paid
greater attention to quality, and exports have gone up by a large
margin in recent years. The company now has international
certification under the GS, CE, EMC, UL and CSA labels.
</P>
<P>
To improve its inspection level, the province has set up nine
category one, 17 category two, and six category three
laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Xie Jun Draws with Zsuzsa Polgar in 10th Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World champion Xie
Jun of China drew anew with Hungarian challenger Zsuzsa Polgar in
the 10th game of the Women's Chess World Championship here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With white pieces, Xie made the offer, the fifth draw of the
scheduled 16-game championship, after 46 moves which lasted nearly
five hours.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 games, the defending champion scored only 3.5
points against Polgar's 6.5 points by winning merely one game with
five drawn and four lost.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the 26-year-old Chinese can only keep her crown, won
in 1991 from Georgian Maya Chiburdanidze, by winning at least four
out of the six games remained.
</P>
<P>
In the day's action, both Xie and Polgar unleashed their Ruy
Lopez opening in a quick manner and gave up their queens in the
14th move before a string of tit-for-tat exchanges.
</P>
<P>
By centering her king in the 23rd move, Xie enjoyed the space
advantage until the 41st move when Polgar sidelined her rook to
halt Xie' attacks of pawns after a hiatus of 31-minute
brain-racked consideration.
</P>
<P>
Seeing no way to solve the dilemma, Xie offered the draw, which
Polgar accepted promptly since she was only 2 points away from the
title.
</P>
<P>
As a challenger, Polgar needs eight and a half points to become
the new champion.

MEXICO CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican rebel

its members agreed to seek just and dignified peace in the
southeastern state of Chiapas with the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Indian peasant army is open to continued negotiations with
the government, said a press release issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez,
capital of Chiapas, by rebel commander Tacho.
</P>
<P>
But the release said there will be some disagreements over
land ownership.

The rebels asked for land and autonomy in native Indian areas
and set these as the conditions for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The army rose in rebellion against the government in early
1994. The two sides held several rounds of talks in the past year
but have not arrived at agreement.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-funded Enterprises Contribute More Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded enterprises in
China are helping the country's economy by paying millions of yuan
in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
levied more than 93 million yuan in industrial and commercial
taxes from foreign-funded enterprises, a rise of almost 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,
foreign-related taxed surged by 62 percent to 760 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-related taxes ballooned because the number of
overseas-funded enterprises increased.
</P>
<P>
A total of 393 foreign-funded enterprises have been established
in Ningxia. By the end of 1995, Nanjing had opened its doors to
2,882 foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises have expanded from labor-intensive sectors,
such as services, to technology and knowledge-intensive ones.
</P>
<P>
In Ningxia, 60 percent of the enterprises are found in such
fields as energy, development and process of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, 77 percent of foreign-funded enterprises have
started to pay taxes. Those in the electronics, machinery and
chemical industries contributed as much as 400 million yuan in
taxes, and four of them each paid taxes worth more than 10 million
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe arrived here today for a three-day official visit aiming to
expand economic cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
During his first trip to Moscow as chief of the French
government, Juppe is expected to hold talks with his Russian
counterpart, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
One of the major topics will be the establishment of a
Russian-French Commission for Economic and Technological
Cooperation, as suggested by the two countries' presidents during
their meeting in Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the so-called Chernomyrdin-Juppe
commission which is to be held during Juppe's visit, a memorandum
on the creation of the commission and three other agreements on
developing cooperation in the fields of energy, ecology and
information will be signed by the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss an agreement on France's
granting of a 170-million-U.S.-dollar loan to Russia for the
reconstruction of four Russian agricultural products processing
factories, according to Chernomyrdin's aide, Mikhail Tarasov.
</P>
<P>
France is one of Russia's leading trading partners, accounting
for more than three percent of Russia's foreign trade. The
Russian-French trade turnover in 1995 amounted to 2.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the relations between Russia and
the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
G-7 industrialized countries are also among the topics of the two
prime ministers' meeting.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Strengthening Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Tibet has made great efforts to
protect its environment in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "roof of the world", China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has spared no effort in protecting its environment during
the past three years, with a total of 50 million yuan (Six million
US dollars) having been spent on pollution treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the region's industrial waste water is now
treated prior to discharge and 80 percent of its industrial waste
gas undergoes treatment before being discharged.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the world",
the region attaches great importance to environmental protection
because of its fragile ecology.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), over 6,700 ha of
land was planted with trees, helping provide shelter from the
wind, conserve water and prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Figures show the region has also cracked down on the illegal
hunting of rare wild animals, with more than 500 cases reported
and penalties imposed on 800 offenders. The crackdown also led to
the recovery of three million yuan in potential losses.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's law enforcement authorities have recently given
priority to the safeguarding of the region's mineral resources and
have revoked mining rights permits from a dozen of enterprises
that had not obtained the proper authorization.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region is also encouraging people to invest in
geothermal resources, solar energy and wind energy, which do not
pollute the environment.

<HEADLINE> Poland's GDP Up 7 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Poland's gross domestic product
increased by seven percent last year to register the highest
growth in four years, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Industry and agriculture both posted increases in 1995 to
contribute toward the overall growth.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth, particularly in the processing industry, was
led by the private sector which posted a 26-percent increase,
while output by state-owned enterprises dropped 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The processing industry increased 11.4 percent, approaching its
1989 level prior to the start of the privatization drive which
slowed economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite growth of 13 percent, agricultural output was still one
tenth lower than the 1989 level.
</P>
<P>
The official statistics also showed that Poland's exports
increased by 38.4 percent in the first 10 months of last year, but
the foreign trade account was still in the red by 4.339 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though the economy is on an upward trend, the country is still
troubled by unemployment and high inflation.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.62 million people, or 14.9 percent of the labor
force, remained jobless in 1995 while the inflation rate averaged
a high 27.8 percent.

Dalian, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Dalian in
northeast China has launched a drive to attract more than 600
million US dollars to expand its Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
The city, in Liaoning Province, wants the multi-million dollar
foreign investment for its Dalian High and New Technology
Industrial Park in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The park in the southwestern part of the city has become home
to over 10,000 professors and engineers.
</P>
<P>
They mostly work in the 11 colleges and universities, 40
research institutes, 51 scientific research centers and 256
laboratories, among which are Dalian Engineering University and
Dalian Chemistry and Physics Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
So far the park has attracted 244 enterprises engaged in high
and new technology, and 140 foreign-funded ventures, including
China Hualu Electron Co., Ltd, Dalian Keda Pharmaceutical
Co,. Ltd, and Sino-US Three Star International Group.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the park's total income reached two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the number of high-tech enterprises
based at the park will exceed 600, generating a total income of
eight to 10 billion yuan, according to Zhang Shichen, director of
the park's Administrative Committee.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a science and technology market, which will be
the biggest in northeast China, is also in a preparatory stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim authority in
the northeastern town of Tuzla released 10 serb prisoners today,
including an 84-year-old man who had been in detention since
september 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said that the prisoners, who
were handed over to the Serb authorities at an IFOR base on the
road between Serb town of Doboj and Muslim town of Tuzla, were
aged 65 on the average.
</P>
<P>
SRNA said that they were all taken prisoner during the Muslim
offensive on Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia in last autumn.
</P>
<P>
However, a large group of Serbs are still held in the Tuzla
prison by the Muslim government, the Serb agency added.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed in late
January that 88 Serbs were still imprisoned in the military
section of the Tuzla prison, although all prisoners of war should
have been unconditionally released by January 19 under the terms
of the Bosnia peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> US Troops End Deployment in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. peace
implementation forces (IFOR) have completed their deployment in
Bosnia with only a small group of soldiers delayed by hazardous
roads, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing the U.S. mission in the former Yugoslav republic,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters, "So far, so
good." Casualty totals are low: one American soldier was killed
in a landmine explosion and only a few others were injured in
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The American troops began to enter into Bosnia in late December
only days after a peace agreement was signed to end the 43-month
war in that country by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and
Serbia in Paris on December 14.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday about 16,900 U.S. troops were in the northeastern
section of Bosnia. They are in Task Force Eagle, a specially
traitored force under the command of Maj. Gen. William Nash,
commander of the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
A final group of about 700 Task Force Eagle soldiers was to
have crossed into Bosnia from Croatia earlier this week to
complete the American deployment but was delayed by snow and ice.
The Pentagon said that they will move into position once roads
are considered safe.

as to improve bilateral cooperation in the trade and economic
fields.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-year Loan for Armenia Under ESAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) --The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year loan of some 148 million
U.S. dollars for the Republic of Armenia under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The loan will be provided to support the Government's
medium-term economic and reform program during the period 1996-98.
The first annual ESAF loan, in an amount equivalent to about 49
million dollars, will be disbursed in two equal semiannual
installments. The first which is about 25 million dollars will be
available at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The major macroeconomic objectives of the ESAF-backed program
are to raise the economic growth from 5 percent in 1995 to 7
percent in 1998, reduce the rate of annual inflation from 32
percent in 1995 to 8.0 percent by the end of 1998, and narrow the
current account deficit from 26.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 12.5
percent of GDP in 1998 while raising gross international reserves
from the equivalent of 1.5 months of imports in 1995 to 3.5 months
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's medium-term economic program for 1996, supported
by the first annual ESAF loan, aims at a real GDP growth rate of
6.5 percent, a reduction in the rate of inflation to 19 percent,
and lowering of the current account deficit to 17 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Armenia joined the IMF in May 1992. Its quota
is about 99 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totaling 69 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> 2 Wounded in Attack on Bus in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A bus service that was just
opened today to link the Serb and Muslim sectors of Sarajevo was
canceled immediately after unidentified attackers opened fire on a
bus today, wounding two passengers, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this transport service was agreed upon at
a meeting Tuesday between Serb and Muslim representatives held at
the office of High Representative of the international community
Carl Bildt in downtown Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at the meeting that the IFOR would be in charge
of security and that fuel and vehicle maintenance would be
financed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the divided city of Sarajevo would
become a unified and multi-ethnic capital by March 19. But most
Serbs living in Sarajevo were reluctant to be ruled by the Muslim
government for fear of retaliation or discrimination, and many of
them have already moved out of their houses to other Serb
territories.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman said today that the attack occurred in the
separation zone guarded by IFOR soldiers and that it was not yet
known which side had opened fire.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims went worse these
days after the Muslim government arrested several Serb officers
and soldiers late last month and extradited two senior Serb
officers to the Hague war crimes tribunal Monday for further
investigation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Gramm Quits White House Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Texas Senator Phil
Gramm today dropped out of the presidential race after repeated
poor performances in the GOP's Louisiana and Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
Gramm, who came a dismal fifth in the Iowa voting on Monday,
declined to throw his support behind any of the eight remaining
Republican contenders.
</P>
<P>
But Gramm took a slap at his chief rival in the Louisiana
caucuses Pat Buchanan because of his calls for trade
protectionism, saying he could never support that position.
</P>
<P>
"I am today ending my campaign for president of the United
States. When the voters speak, I listen," Gramm said at a Capitol
Hill news conference here packed with cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
Gramm, who was the first Republican to announce his
presidential candidacy earlier last year, became the third
candidate to quit the race. California Governor Pete Wilson had a
short-lived campaign, and Pennsylvannia Senator Arlen Specter
dropped out of the race late last year.
</P>
<P>
Gramm spent nearly 20 million U.S. dollars in his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that it was a wise choice for Gramm to quit the
race. If he had stayed in the race, it would have jeopardized his
chances of re-election to his Senate seat in Texas.

<HEADLINE> Serb Official Warns Against War Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb
official warned today that the extradition of two Serb officers
was a violation of the peace accord and might cause war tension in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Parliament speaker of Serb state Republika Srpska Momcilo
Krajisnik said the arrest of the Serb officers by the Bosnian
government and their transfer by force to the Hague by the
Implementation Force (IFOR) "is an international scandal and a
direct violation of the Dayton agreement, and might cause war
tension."
</P>
<P>
The two Serb officers were arrested by Muslim authorities on
January 30 in the Sarajevo zone controlled by the NATO-led IFOR on
suspected war crimes and were transferred Monday to the
Hague-based International War Crimes Tribunal for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik told the local radio of Obrenovac town near Belgrade
that he was disappointed by the passive attitude of world
diplomatic circles on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that on the eve of the transfer, Serb Prime
Minister Rajko Kasagic had been assured by some western
politicians that the two officers would be released as there were
no proofs of crimes committed by them.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on speculations that by extraditing the detained
Serbs, the international community could get the two officers
released more easily in the Hague than in Sarajevo, Krajisnik said
that the international community does not have to try to save face
of those who are flagrantly violating the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the absence of a Bosnian Serb delegation at the
conference on arms control in the former Yugoslavia held Tuesday
in Vienna, the Serb official said it was a "defense mechanism" of
the Serbs to "draw the attention of those who are committed to
implementing the peace agreement but do not treat all the parties
in Bosnia equally."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate but we won't make concessions that
would weaken our position," Krajisnik stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Exports More Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria exported a total of
297,613 metric tonnes of various agricultural products in 1995,
latest statistics available have showed.
</P>
<P>
This figure represented an increase from the l994 figure of
219,682 metric tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Among the exports are cocoa, coffee, cashewnuts, sesame seeds,
ginger, cotton, wheat and shea nuts.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa recorded the highest number of 126,683 metric tonnes in
the exports last year, while palled/palm kernel and cashew nuts
followed with 124,999 and 18,063 metric tonnes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, the mainstay of the Nigerian economy in the past,
has been neglected since the oil boom in the mid-70s. Oil, now
becomes the country's economic backbone and dominates Nigeria's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The share of agriculture in total export of nigeria was 85.6
percent in 1960. It declined to 30 percent in 1970 and to 2.4
percent in 1980.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
Addis Ababa, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will soom send a
group of representatives to the Italian embassy here to demand
the immediate return of the Axum obelisk which was taken away by
the Italians 60 years ago when Ethiopia was under the Italian
occupation.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conferenced here today, the National
Organizing Committee for the celebration of the Adowa centenary

organizations.
</P>
<P>

Norther Ethiopia, which forced the Italian aggressors to
recognize Ethiopia as a sovereign independent state.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Crown Prince Receives Message from Kuwaiti PM on Restoring Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is taking practical steps
toward restoring ties with Jordan, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah said in a letter to Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The letter, which indicates Kuwait's positive response to
Jordan's desire for resumption of bilateral relations, was
delivered to Crown Prince Hassan by Kuwaiti envoy Mohammad
al-Roumeih during their meeting here today, Radio Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was responded to an initiative on mending ties by
Crown Prince Hassan, who exchanged letters with the Kuwaiti Prime
Minister over past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official praised Jordan's political moves aimed at
fostering common Arab action.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Jordan and Kuwait became
estranged for Jordan's stance toward Iraq after the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan tried to restore its relations with Kuwait
during last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Kuwaiti prime minister sent a
congratulatory cable to the newly appointed Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti shortly after Kabariti sworn in as
prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Arrives in Yekaterinburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived this evening in his hometown of Yekaterinburg, where he
will announce whether he will run for his second four-year term of
office in June, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, the president confirmed that
he will announce Thursday his decision as to whether or not he
will run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
His decision is connected with the results of the December 17
parliamentary elections, Yeltsin told reporters, adding that his
main task is to keep the country on the path of reform.
</P>
<P>
In the legislative elections, the Communist Party of the
Russian Federation headed by Gennady Zyuganov won more than one
third of the seats in the 450-member State Duma, lower house of
the Russian parliament. Gennady Seleznyov, one of the communist
party leaders, became speaker of the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
Asked why it has taken him so long to decide, Yeltsin noted
that "this is a difficult decision."
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the results of elections to the Duma, on what it
(Duma) will be like and what may happen: will reform continue
after President Yeltsin leaves and a new president comes?" he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are many different ideas regarding that subject. To be
more sure, I decided to come here to consult people," Yeltsin
said. "This does not mean, of course, that I will be surely
elected. But we must continue reform, for we have no other path to
go. There is no way back and therefore we must bring our endeavor
to the end."
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Electoral Commission, more than 50
initiative groups wishing to nominate their candidates for the
Russian presidency have registered. However, Communist Party
leader Zyuganov is likely to be the most strong rival for Yeltsin
in the forthcoming presidential elections, analysts here believe.
</P>
<P>
Asked which of the seven plans proposed for the Chechnya
settlement he has chosen, Yeltsin said, "A decision has not been
made yet. Commissions are still working on that... Besides, they
have their own ideas. And I think that we will find a way out in
order to achieve peace in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
The first words pronounced by Yeltsin as he descended from his
plane at Koltsovo airport, Yekaterinburg, where he had been away
since 1992, were: "Hello, dear Urals!"
</P>
<P>
Yekaterinburg, some 1,440 kilometers southeast of Moscow, is
located at the Urals mountains, where the European and Asian
continents meet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the schedule of his current trip due to start
Thursday morning, Yeltsin told reporters that he plans to visit a
number of industrial enterprises and shops. He will have talks
with local leaders and the heads of major enterprises to discuss
urgent social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
His trip includes a visit to the monument to Marshal Georgy
Zhukov and a monument to Afghan war veterans. Yeltsin, together
with his wife, will visit his relatives' graves, see the city
metro and talk to its passengers on a new station in the center of
the city.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to local people at the Palace of Youth, the
president will announce his decision on whether he will run the
presidential elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin, Deputy Defense Minister
Andrei Kokoshin and other government officials have arrived in
Yekaterinburg as well.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is scheduled to leave the city for the neighboring city
of Chelyabinsk Thursday evening to continue his Urals tour. He is
expected to return to Moscow Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Will Not Stop Construction of Dams on Euphrates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official said here
today that turkey would not bow to threats made by Syria and Iraq
to Ankara to stop the construction of two dams on the Euphrates
River.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said," Trying to
take other countries behind you, or trying to pull the water
question onto the international agenda to provide a smokescreen
for other issues will serve no interest."
</P>
<P>
His statement followed a meeting between Syrian and Iraqi
officials in Damascus at which the two countries urged turkey to
stop the construction of the Birecik and Kargamis dams on the
Euphrates, or the two downstream nations "would be faced with the
necessity to take action."
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian claims that Turkey is not giving enough water are
completely baseless. Turkey has given Syria more than 500 cubic
meters of water per second for the last year," Nurkan said.
</P>
<P>
"The first issue on the agenda between Turkey and Syria is
Syrian support of terrorism," Nurkan said, adding that "the head
of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) continues to reside in
Syria, although Damascus continues to deny it."

<HEADLINE> Unequal Wealth Hampers Economic Growth: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua)-- A society in which wealth
remained as unequally shared as in South Africa could not sustain
sufficient economic growth, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the three-day debate in parliament on his
opening-of-parliament speech, Mandela said the recently-published
study on indicators of poverty in the country should "spur us on
to make the attack on poverty our guiding objective".
</P>
<P>
Mandela was referring to a report compiled by the Southern
Africa Labor and Development Research Unit of the University of
Cape Town which indicates that South Africa's income gap was
among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released last month, said 40 percent of
the country's households accounted for less than 10 percent of
its consumption and represented the poorest 53 percent of the
population while the wealthiest 5.8 percent of the population was
responsible for 40 percent of consumption.
</P>
<P>
"It reinforces beyond debate the need for more than 'business
as usual' if South Africa is to realise its potential to banish
poverty and ensure equity," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Without growth, it would also become increasingly difficult to
sustain south africa's socio-economic programs, added the
president.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the challenge South Africa was facing at present
was that, while implementing the reconstruction and development
program, the government would have to eleborate a growth and
development strategy which would take the country out of the
quagmire of "jobless growth".
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government would have to make many
difficult choices to get rid of the quagmire, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation speech at the 1996 sitting of
parliament on February 9, Mandela appealled to all South Africans
to work together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth,
opportunity and power in a new society. enditem

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Meets with French Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh met here today with French envoy Francis Gutman to discuss
the latest developments of the French mediation efforts to settle
the dispute between Yemen and Eritrea over three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
The personal envoy of French President Jacques Chirac arrived
in Sanaa this afternoon on his third visit to Yemen after paying a
two-day visit to Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Yemen Radio reported that Gutman is trying to
hammer out an agreement that could lead to a just settlement of
the marine border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Saleh also reiterated today his determination
to settle the dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iriyani paid a visit to Egyptian capital of Cairo
Wednesday. The Yemeni official told reporters that his country has
accepted a French-proposed formula for settling the dispute.
</P>
<P>
France had suggested that both countries station troops on the
disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni foreign minister also urged Eritrea to positively
respond to that formula.
</P>
<P>
France, Egypt and Ethiopia are making efforts to mediate a
settlement to the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute.
</P>
<P>
The three disputed islands are located in major shipping lanes
at the southern end of the Red Sea. Both Yemen and Eritrea have
claimed sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two countries had
a fierce battle. The Eritrean troops occupied the island of Greater
Hanish while the other two islands are still in the hands of Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls For Reconciliation Of Afrikanerness With Being Full South African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua)--South African President
Nelsom Mandela noted today that the challenge of a new patriotism
is not one of a choice between Afrikanerness and South
Africanism, but "it is about the healing reconciliation of
Afrikanerness with being a full South African".
</P>
<P>
The presidnt was aparently reacting to statements made by
Freedom Front Leader Constand Viljoen in his parliamentary debate
that a new patriotism depended on inclusivity and everything had
to be done to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen said that enough lives had been sacrificed and each
future life sacrificed eroded the foundation on which a new
patriotism could be built.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the three-day debate in parliament on his
opening-of-parliament sppech, Mandela said the government noted
voices expressing anxiety that the nation-building process was
not all inclusive.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government seriously noted such
concerns, it had often struck him how Afrikaners remarked that
the new South Africa, in which all could participate in a broader
world of relations with all their fellow Ssouth Africans, gave
them a feeling of liberation.
</P>
<P>
He said the exciting challenge of the new patriotism was not
one of a choice between Afrikanerness and South Africanism. "On
the contrary, it is about the healing reconciliation of
Afrikanerness with being a full South African," He added.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation speech when opening the 1996
session of parliament on February 9, Mandela called on all South
Africans not to wallow in the notions of the past, but to work
together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth,
opportunity and power in society.
