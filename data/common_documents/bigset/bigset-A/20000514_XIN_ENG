<HEADLINE> Israel's Histadrut Threatens to Strike Against Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Histadrut, or Jewish
Labor Federation, Sunday passed a resolution to prepare for mini-
strikes to protest against a tax reform plan in the country.
</P>
<P>
The mini-strikes, such as partial work stoppages and other job
actions, could lead to general strikes if the union's demands to
revise the reform plan are not met, according to Histadrut
spokesman Giora Tsur.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by Histadrut leaders in Sunday's special
meeting, ordered that the mini-strikes begin on May 30, the end of
a two-week calm period as the strike law in Israel demands.
</P>
<P>
The union had expressed its displeasure toward the tax reform
proposals, which were submitted to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak by the Finance Ministry on May 4, in a one-hour strike last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The major controversial point between the union and the Finance
Ministry is the taxation of continued-education funds of average
workers.
</P>
<P>
The labor federation also objected the abolishment of a half-
point tax exemption of working women and the plan's neglect for
those workers who do not earn enough to pay income tax, Tsur said.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut's plan to strike will force the government to put
all its efforts to reach a compromise with the union, which is the
dominant labor power in the country, controlling employees of
Israel Radio, Israel Electric, Ports, Airports and Railway
Authorities, banks, and government offices throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel's doctors union had already been on strike for more than
two months, while the workers of Bezeq, or Israel Telecommunication
Company, also launched their walkouts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform plan recommended levying a 25-percent tax on
capital gains, such as that from continued-education funds, to
offset the state's loss of tax revenue due to income tax reform, in
which the take-home pay of middle-class wage earners reportedly
will be increased.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to go through its first reading in the next
few months and began to be effective by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut announced on Sunday that its leaders will continue
talks with the government to resolve their differences and a
meeting with Finance Minister Avraham Shochat had been scheduled on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Situation in West Bank, Gaza Tense: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Sunday that the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
is tense as Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli security
forces for the third day, leaving at least 17 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his cabinet that such a situation in the territories
should be addressed carefully, but he did not say how to do so.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of transfer of three Palestinian villages
near Jerusalem to the Palestinians, Barak pointed out that the
topic has been on the government's agenda since it came to power
last July, said a statement issued by Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The three villages are Abu Dis, Eizariya and Suwahara. Their
transfer has met strong objection not only from the opposition, but
also from Barak's own coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the cabinet meeting, Barak also handed out to all the
ministers copies of the book "The Third Way: The Renewal of Social
Democracy" by Anthony Giddens, and urged them all to grasp its
thesis as part of the drafting of the state budget for the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
The book recommends steering a domestic policy balanced between
an unfettered free market and the heavy hand of state intervention.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of the Palestinians in Gaza Strip and West
Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron clashed with Israeli security
forces for the third day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are demanding the release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails and expressing their solidarity with
the Palestinians who are on a hunger strike at various Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 Palestinians were injured Saturday in clashes with
Israeli security forces at different locations of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli negotiators on interim issues met here on
Sunday to discuss the prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have reinforced their presence in the
territories in anticipation of more Palestinian protests to mark
Nakba Day (the day of catastrophe) on Monday, the 52nd anniversary
of Israel's declaration of statehood.

Hassan was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has 21 members with 380 million people and a combined
gross domestic product of 165 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. Inter-
COMESA trade stood at 2.5 billion dollars that year, compared to
834 million dollars in 1985, translating a trend towards increasing
trade among the members. Inter-COMESA trade is expected to reach 4
billion dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday summit is going to look into different aspects of
the group's economic situation, including trade, investment,
customs, infrastructure, communications, and maritime, air and land
transportation, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also discuss the outcome of the first
economic gathering in Cairo in February and a report on the first
foreign ministers meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, in April, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka meeting stressed the necessity of securing a climate
favorable for promoting development and stability in the COMESA
members.
</P>
<P>
Cairo is to host a COMESA summit in 2001, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Air Raids Injure 9 Civilians in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A three-year-old boy was among the
nine people wounded in Saturday's attacks by U.S. and British
warplanes in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA), the spokesman
said that at the local time of 20:30 (1630 GMT) on Saturday, 10
hostile formations of U.S. and British planes from bases in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait carried out 22 armed sorties, overflying the
southern provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit,
Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The enemy jets bombed civilian and service installations,
resulting in the injury of nine people, including a three-year-old
boy identified as Ali Abdul-Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi air defense artillery fired at the
invading jets, forcing them to retreat to their bases in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's operations brought to 21,097 the total number of
armed sorties over Iraqi territory by U.S. and British planes since
December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the Desert Fox
Operation air strikes against Iraq, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes patrol the two no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq set up after the 1991 Gulf War, with the
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds and the Shiite Muslims from the
forces of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the air exclusion zones, which are not
specifically covered by any U.N. resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos arrived here Sunday on the first visit to Israel by
a Greek head of state.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos, who brings with him a 120-member delegation
composed of government officials and businessmen, aims to boost the
economic and security ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israeli daily the Jerusalem Post prior
to the visit, the Greek president said "there is a great margin for
the improvement of relations between the two countries", which
established full diplomatic ties a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president is scheduled to meet Israeli President
Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, opposition leader Ariel
Sharon as well as Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Stephanopoulos is expected to discuss with
Israeli officials the security relationship between the two
nations. Greece and Israel signed a military pact in 1994, but it
has not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israel's increasing military cooperation with Turkey has been a
source of concern for Greece. Asked whether Israel's strong defense
relationship with the Turks is an obstacle to Greek-Israeli ties,
Stephanopoulos said the Greeks prefer a collective security
structure.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old president is also to pay a private visit on
Wednesday to east Jerusalem to visit holy sites before a meeting
with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Fail to Resolve Disputes Over Prisoner Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian interim
negotiation teams on Sunday discussed the issue of releasing more
Palestinian security prisoners, but failed to reach any agreements.
</P>
<P>
After meeting his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran in a Jerusalem
hotel, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that he is
waiting for Israeli's official response to Palestinians' demand to
free more than 200 Palestinians, who have been jailed for years.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Israel Radio, Erekat said that the Israeli team
promised there would be a further meeting between the two sides to
discuss the details of the demand in two days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Erekat said he got orders from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that Sunday's interim talks should be focused on the
issue of security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Eran said that the Palestinians would achieve
nothing through violence and called for the Palestinian National
Authority to quell the street violence throughout the West Bank and
Gaza Strip towns.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiator was referring to the continued clashes
between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli security forces in
recent days, which resembled the Intifada Movement, or
Palestinians' Uprising in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing demonstration, which entered into its consecutive
seventh day on Sunday, is showing Palestinians' support for the
remaining prisoners in Israeli prisons and calling for their
release.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israelis had freed about 400 Palestinians since the
signing of Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum between the two sides last
September, there are still 1,600 security prisoners jailed, who had
been on hunger strike for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, several dozens of Palestinian demonstrators and
about ten Israelis had been injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
In such a context, Palestinian negotiators categorically
rejected Eran's demand for calm. Two members of the Palestinian
negotiation team even walked out of the meeting room in protest,
with one of them telling reporters outside that "You can expect an
intensification of the protests in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
Erekat also emphasized that the cause of the demonstrations is
Israel's "non-compliance with signed agreements which called for
the release of Palestinian prisoners."
</P>
<P>
A round of talks in Israel's Red Sea resort city of Eilat, the
latest effort to push forward the peace track, failed to make any
substantial progress and the two sides missed the May 13 deadline
for sealing a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian sources, Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei had flied to Sweden to meet with
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami there to blaze a
back-channel way to resolve their disputes as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Forthcoming Visit to Spain to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
projected visit to Spain at the end of this month will further
boost the time-honored relations between the two countries, a
diplomatic source said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president's office announced earlier in the day
that Mubarak will visit Spain on May 29-31, during which he is to
hold talks with Spanish King Juan Carlos I and Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar on international and regional issues and ways of
intensifying cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Spain are playing a key role in helping push the
Middle East peace process forward and enhance Euro-Mediterranean
cooperation, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Madrid hosted in October 1991 the Middle East peace conference
that kicked off the peace talks between Arab countries and Israel
under the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
And the 15 nations of the European Union and 12 countries on the
eastern and southern coast of the Mediterranean, including Egypt,
started the Euro-Med partnership, or the Barcelona process, during
a meeting in 1995 in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak paid a three-day visit to Spain in 1985. The Spanish
king visited Egypt on February 19-21, 1997. During the two visits,
Egypt and Spain signed a number of agreements on economic,
industrial and cultural cooperation. During Mubarak's forthcoming
visit, the two countries are expected to sign more pacts aimed at
bolstering cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume stood at about 420 million U.S.
dollars, with Egypt exporting around 110 million dollars worth of
goods. Spain has so far provided Egypt with loans of 300 million
dollars and contributed to its projects of electricity, transport,
communications and social development.

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Palestinian Detainees Injured in Israeli Jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Palestinian detainees in the
Israeli jail of Magd were injured on Sunday in violent clashes with
the warders and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The wounded prisoners were hospitalized and some of them are in
critical case, said chief of Palestinian Prisoner Club Isa
Karaki'e.
</P>
<P>
The clashed started when the detainees of Magd jail organized
demonstrations in solidarity with their fellows who staged a hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
The protesters threw stones utensils at the prison warders who
fired rubber bullets and tear-gas bombs in return, Karaki'e added.
</P>
<P>
The prison authorities also summoned a unit of the Israeli civil
defense forces to reinforce.
</P>
<P>
Over the last week the Palestinians stage protests in West Bank
and Gaza Strip in solidarity with the hunger strikers who try to
press ahead the demands for improvement of the living conditions
inside Israeli jails and for early release. The demonstrators
clashed with Israeli soldiers, causing injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,600 Palestinian detainees still held in the
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a new round of interim talks in Jerusalem on
Sunday, Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran said the talks would not
yield fruitful results until the end of the violent confrontations.

<HEADLINE> UK's Welfare Fraud Costs Taxpayer 7bn Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) - Britain's benefit fraud is soaring
under the Labor government and is now costing the taxpayer as much
as 7 billion pounds a year, an internal report shows.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times quoted the report by the Department of Social
Security (DSS) reveals that successful prosecutions against
housing benefit fraudsters have halved under Labor, though the
problem is growing.
</P>
<P>
DSS estimates show 2 billion pounds of confirmed fraud, 3
billion pounds of "high suspicion" fraud and 2 billion pounds of "
low suspicion" cases.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the proportion of housing benefit fraud cases
won by local authorities has collapsed from 38 percent to 18
percent in the space of a year.
</P>
<P>
Two-fifths of local authorities have no formal prosecution
policy on benefit fraud, and only 7 percent referred 20 or more
cases during 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
This is in stark contrast to Labor's 1997 election manifesto
pledge that "we will start with a clampdown on housing benefit
fraud ... and we will maintain action against benefit fraud of all
kinds."
</P>
<P>
Other DSS evidence shows there were 350000 fraudulent income
support and jobseekers' allowance claimants during the 1998-99
financial year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest area of fraud was among lone-parent claimants
living "as husband and wife" with somebody working. Most other
fraudsters were working while claiming benefit.

<P>
Vancouver, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) left here for Venezuela Sunday morning after
wrapping up a six-day official visit of friendship to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Seeing him off at the Vancouver International Airport were
Raymond Chan, Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) of Canada, local
Canadian officials and Chinese Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Canada Mei Ping and Chinese Consul
General to Vancouver Song Youming were among officials making
their farewells to the CPPCC National Committee chairman at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Li Ruihuan paid an official call to Governor
General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson. He also met Speaker of the
Senate Gidas Molgat, Speaker of the House of Commons Gilbert
Parent and Prime Minister Jean Chretien on separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and Canadian officials expressed satisfaction with
the first ever visit by a CPPCC National Committee chairman to the
North American country.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials praised Li Ruihuan's visit as complete
success. Li Ruihuan said he is pleased to see the visit has
reached its goal of improving mutual understanding, enhancing
friendship, expanding common ground and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are convinced that the two countries will see even
better ties with all-round development of cooperation and,
especially, with frequent exchange of visits at top level.
</P>
<P>

Canadian government. He then visited the country's largest city
Toronto before touring the coastal city of Vancouver in the west.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Situation More Stable - British Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's military commander in
Sierra Leone said on Sunday that the situation in the West African
nation is more stable now.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is much more stable now," British commander
Brigadier David Richards told BBC's Breakfast with Frost from
Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Freetown is now secure by the United Nations
and by the new government forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also speculated that Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh
could be dead.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that Sankoh has yet reasserted his authority
over the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). He could be dead," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, whose rebels are holding about 500 U.N. peacekeepers
captive, was reportedly disappeared from his Freetown home after
fighting earlier this week and has not been since or heard of
since.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook forecasted
that the violence in Sierra Leone, a former colony of Britain,
would be over "within a month", another sign of growing optimism
that the crisis in war-torn Sierra Leone was near an end.
</P>
<P>
Cook pledged that British troops who have played a role in
stabilizing the situation would be pulled out as soon as U.N.
troops were at full strength.
</P>
<P>
"Once the U.N. is there as an effective force at full strength,
then we will not be remaining within Lungi," Cook told the Frost
program.
</P>
<P>
"If we feel a need to pull out sooner, we'll do that. We are
not going to become combat troops. We expect it to be over within
a month," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has about 700 paratroopers in Sierra Leone, while at
least four British warships have anchored off Freetown carrying
600 Royal Marines and 13 Harrier fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
The troops has so far evacuated about half of the 550 British
nationals who registered with the British High Commission in
Freetown.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Opens Talks on Western Sahara in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy on Western
Sahara, James Baker, on Sunday opened talks in London aimed at
overcoming deadlock between Morocco and the Algerian-backed
Polisario Front over the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
A Polisario official said Baker met Moroccan Foreign Minister
Mohamed Benaissa and Polisario national secretariat member Mahfoud
Ali-Beiba, the Reuters reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Algeria and Mauritania were due to attend as
well,the report said.
</P>
<P>
Baker, a former United States secretary of state and now the
personal representative of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on
Western Sahara, was not expected to comment publicly on the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks could stretch into Monday, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Annan said Baker intended to "consult with
the parties and the neighboring countries and, taking into account
existing and potential obstacles, to explore ways and means to
achieve an early, durable and agreed settlement of the dispute in
Western Sahara".
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for more than eight years to
organize a referendum to decide whether the territory should be
incorporated into Morocco, which controls most of the former
Spanish colony, or become independent as the Polisario wants.
</P>
<P>
A referendum that was originally set for January 1992 has been
repeatedly postponed due to differences over who should be
eligible to vote.

<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Bradford City surprisingly defeated
Liverpool 1-0 with a 12th minute header by David Wetherall on
Sunday which was enough to keep the club in the English premier
league next season.
</P>
<P>
The result also meant that Leeds United finished above
Liverpool in third to claim a Champions League place.
</P>
<P>
Wetherall's header and some desperate defending gave Bradford a
famous victory to keep them up in their first season against the
odds.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon, who began the day needing only to match Bradford's
result, lost 2-0 at Southampton to go down 14 years after reaching
the top flight for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Leeds started the day a point ahead of Liverpool and stretched
that to two with a goalless draw at West Ham United. They join
Manchester United and Arsenal in the Champions League while
Liverpool, who finished fifth, will play in the UEFA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Species Comparison Explains Human Chromosome Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Using new methods of species
comparison to track the history of human chromosomes over a 130-
million-year period of mammalian evolution, French researchers
have found that one human chromosome, Chromosome 7, is shared in
its modern form only with chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
And human Chromosomes 16 and 19 have a more ancient
evolutionary origin, researchers from the Institute Curie in Paris
reported in this month's issue of Genome Research.
</P>
<P>
To track the history of a particular human chromosome, Florence
Richard and colleagues looked for analogous chromosomes or
chromosome fragments in other mammalian fragments by tagging them
with fluorescent molecules.
</P>
<P>
They applied the tags to chromosomes from the Chinese tree
shrew, nine-banded armadillo, mountain zebra, Diana monkey, and
other representative species arising from the 130-million-year
history of placental mammals.
</P>
<P>
By examining the regions of these animal's chromosomes that
became brightly fluorescent, Richard and colleagues found, for
example, that human chromosome 7 historically exists as two
separate pieces in most non-primate mammals. These pieces
eventually migrated and fused together to form the present-day
human chromosome 7.
</P>
<P>
Applying this analysis to more chromosomes and species will
help scientists not only determine the origins of human
chromosomes but also reconstruct evolutionary relationships
between primates and between other mammalian species.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Rally for Gun Control on Mother's Day in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of mothers and their
families joined the "Million Mom March" in Washington Sunday to
oppose gun violence and demand Congress to pass stricter gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
Throngs of mothers, aunts, sisters, grandmothers, children and
more than a sprinkling of fathers gave up the traditional flowers
and brunches to spend Mother's Day on the National Mall in the
center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In an area bounded by the Capitol, Washington monument and the
popular Smithsonian Museums, marchers carried signs showing
handguns with red lines through them and messages proclaiming "
Freedom Gun Trauma." Some carried pictures of their dead children.
</P>
<P>
"The Million Mom March" organizers lined up plenty of
entertainers. But the real stars were Americans who lost love ones
to gun violence, telling their personal stories.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton held a separate warm-up rally outside the White House on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants legislation that would require child safety locks
with all new handguns, close a loophole that permits firearms
purchases at gun shows without background checks and ban the
import of large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
Every day in the United States, 12 children are killed by guns,
either intentionally or accidentally.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Retain Gold, Slovakians Win Silver at Ice Hockey Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the Czech
Republic retained their gold medal Sunday at the 64th Ice Hockey
World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, after beating
Slovakia 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia grabbed the silver, the first medal since the team's
debut in the worlds in 1996. The period scores were 3-0, 0-1, and
2-2.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs scored three goals in the first period but none in
the second. The Slovakians, buoyed by enthusiastic fans, managed
three goals in the second and third periods, catching up to 3-4
against the rival team.
</P>
<P>
Just a little over one minute before the end, Robert Reichel of
the Czech Republic shattered the Slovakians' prospect of a tie and
sealed the defending champions' fresh victory with an equal
strength goal.
</P>
<P>
Before its peaceful breakup, Czechoslovakia had been one of the
world's ice hockey powerhouses, winning six gold, 12 silvers and
16 bronzes from 1920 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs have won two gold (1996, 1999) and two bronzes (1997,
1998) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's silver represented the first medal for Slovakia since
its debut in the world championships in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In another finals match Sunday afternoon, 1998-1999 silver
medalists Finland edged Canada 2-1 to take the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Finns' hope to advance to the first place was shattered
Friday in the aftermath of a 3-1 defeat by Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Adrian Aucion scored the team's only goal seven
minutes into the first period. The Finns, on the other hand,
netted one goal each in the second and third periods. All three
were equal strength goals.
</P>
<P>
The current championships, which started on April 29, featured
16 teams mostly from Europe and North America. Japan, the only
Asian team, suffered six straight losses in the preliminary and
consolatory rounds.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 13 in Dutch Fireworks Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials at Enschede confirmed on
Sunday that 13 bodies had been identified following explosions at
a fireworks warehouse in eastern Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
They also confirmed that 541 people were injured by the fire
and the explosions and 62 still remained in hospital with 10
people under intensive cares.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, three were firefighters and one other fireman
was still listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Wim Kok arrived at
Enschede on Sunday morning to inspect the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
A blaze inside a local fireworks warehouse Saturday afternoon
triggered multiple explosions that destroyed the warehouse and a
nearby residence area accommodating some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports quoted local dweller Freek Tonis as
saying: "A whole neighborhood was blown away and it was like a war
zone after the first explosion."
</P>
<P>
The resident of the town added that the death toll could go
still higher as local residents initially thought that the fire
was part of a show and swarmed toward the fireworks warehouse to
have a look.
</P>
<P>
Local people described that there were two explosions that were
heard clearly. The first smaller blast set off a chain reaction
of the fireworks in the warehouse while the chain reaction in turn
triggered the second major explosion that did most of the damage.
</P>
<P>
The warehouse reportedly held an estimated 100 tons of
fireworks.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia kicked off its second
general elections Sunday, the second since it changed from the
republic to the federal system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Voters living in the capital of Addis Ababa began going to the
polling stations in their constituencies as early as six o'clock.
</P>
<P>
Some polling stations in the downtown street of the metropolis
have become full of voters, queuing up outside small polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
However, it is hardly seen any bustling and excitement scenes
in the stations.
</P>
<P>
Some people attributed the quiet election to the ongoing heavy
fighting at borders between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and to the
famine crisis that millions of Ethiopians are facing.
</P>
<P>
More than 20.2 million Ethiopians, some 75 percent of the
eligible voters in the country were registered to vote in some
26,000 polling stations throughout the country, according to the
Ethiopian National Election Board.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,200 candidates, including 490 independents from 50
political parties are due to contest in the election, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the elections will be announced officially
on June 7.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels Retake Strategic Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) rebel forces Sunday pushed back the pro-government
forces and reportedly retook the strategic town of Masiaka on the
main highway towards the capital Freetown of the war-torn west
African country, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Masiaka is in the hands of the rebels," a high-ranking
military officer from Sierra Leone Army (SLA) was quoted as saying
when he addressed the media near the strategic town, 74 kilometers
from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"We have withdrawn and we have taken up defensive positions,"
he said, but he did not mention the casualty during the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday's counter-attack by the RUF rebels took SLA forces
by surprise. They regained control of Masiaka and pushed out the
rebels along the main road from the capital on Saturday with the
active support of British evacuation troops, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The present tense situations in Sierra Leone follows the early
May abduction of the United Nations peacekeepers by the RUF rebels
loyal to the country's veteran rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who
allegedly charged by the international community for the violation
of the Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Peace Accord, signed by Sankoh and elected President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in Togo's capital Lome last year under the
auspices of the Economic Community of West African States,
envisaged disarmament and demobilization of the rebels ahead of a
general election planned for February 2001.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Customs Cooperation among ECO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday called on members of
the Economic Cooperation Organization to streamline customs
procedures in order to boost trade among them.
</P>
<P>
There are tremendous potentials for further enhancement of trade
transactions among ECO members, said Mehdi Karbasian, head of
Iran's Customs Administration.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in 1985. It was
joined by Afghanistan and the Central Asian and Caucasian republics
of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan
after the collapse of former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a five-day ECO seminar on
customs information systems, Karbasian warned complicated customs
procedures can only create unjustifiable delays for clearance of
goods as well as unnecessary expenses, leading to exorbitant
prices.
</P>
<P>
Modern trading facilities, including data processing systems,
will help the private sector compete more effectively in world
markets, he said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He asked ECO states to share their valuable experiences and
technical achievements in the field.
</P>
<P>
Karbasian, also deputy minister of economic and financial
affairs, said the volume of Iran's exports to ECO countries in 1999
amounted to 445.6 million U.S. dollars, or 18.3 percent of its
total exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Iran's imports from ECO states in 1999 totaled 282.3
million dollars, constituting 3.1 percent of its total imports, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Turkey was Iran's biggest trading partner among ECO
members while Afghanistan was the smallest.

<HEADLINE> More UAE Exhibitors to Attend Baghdad Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- More than twice as many government
departments and private companies of the United Arab Emirates as in
1999 will participate in this year's Baghdad International Fair due
in November.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Abdul Rahman Al Mutaiwee, director general
of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI), according to
Emirates News Agency (WAM) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Between 70 to 80 exhibitors are expected at the UAE Pavilion
during the coming trade fair in the Iraqi capital, while there were
only 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
After a slight decline in 1998, overall trade volumes between
the UAE and Iraq are believed to double, showing a strong recovery
in 1999, although the year-end figures are yet to be published.
</P>
<P>
Al Mutaiwee also pointed out that the UAE participation in the
fair, one of the biggest such events in the Middle East and arab
world, is to give exposure to UAE companies in the Iraqi market.
</P>
<P>
DCCI, in association with the Jebel Ali Free Zone authority and
the Dubai Ports Authority, will be organizing the UAE Pavilion at
the trade fair, to be held from November 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad International Fair is a general commercial fair
organized annually. Nearly 50 countries are supposed to participate
in this year's event, showcasing various scientific, technical and
commercial items from across the world.
</P>
<P>
But all the transactions will have to be put into the U.N. oil-
for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited crude to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under harsh U.N. sanctions imposed after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Third Dhaka Declaration on Arsenic Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Third International Arsenic
Conference ended here Sunday with a declaration calling for
immediate actions to deal with the arsenic contamination crisis in
Bangladesh on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
The Third Dhaka Declaration-2000 on Arsenic laid emphasis on
mobilizing the entire nation to combat the arsenic problem,
developing a comprehensive water policy through research and
giving attention to the needs of the arsenic patients and their
management.
</P>
<P>
Saying progress in dealing with the arsenic problem in
Bangladesh has been "tragically slow," the declaration suggested
that all agencies -- governmental, non-governmental, donor,
academic, national and international -- act promptly.
</P>
<P>
Time should not be further wasted and emergent efforts should
be made through social mobilization and involvement of villagers
and local government bodies to stop people from drinking arsenic-
contaminated water, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The two-day international conference, jointly organized by the
United Nations Children's Fund and Dhaka Community Hospital, was
attended by representatives from various countries and
organizations.

<HEADLINE> State Election in North Rhine-Westphalia Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- at least 13 million voters of German
North Rhine-Westphalia went to the polls Sunday to elect a new
state parliament Landtag.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest opinion, the German Social Democratic
got 45 percent and the opposition, the Christian Democratic Union,
the CDU only 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are in an extremely good position," said Wolfgang Clement,
the Prime Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The SPD
is now much confident of winning the state election.
</P>
<P>
Since the coalition of the SPD and the Greens came into the
power in Germany on September 27, 1998, the coalition had been
defeated by the CDU for seven times in the state elections, the
local elections and in the election of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the finance scandal of the CDU was broken out since last
November the CDU had been discredited. In the state election of
Schleswig-Holstein on February 27, the SPD and the Greens had won
again.
</P>
<P>
Now the state election in North Rhine-Westphalia is an
important political test for both sides.
</P>
<P>
For the coalition it will be a test for the consolidation of
its coalition in whole Germany. For the CDU which had just chosen
its new leader Angela Merkel, it will be a test if the party has
got over from the serious finance scandal since last November.

It went on to say that the elected Taiwan leader lacks
sincerity toward improving the cross-straits relationship, as he
avoids talking about the key issue of one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
The article said recognizing that Taiwan is part of China, and
the one-China principle, are basic requirements the mainland
expects from the Taiwan regional leader.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of mail service, trade, and air and shipping
services has been our consistent stand, and we have made
unremitting efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"But these three exchanges are certainly made within one China,
and smooth dialogs and negotiations between the two sides of the
straits can only be conducted under the one-China principle," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Abandonment of this principle is actually intended to
separate Taiwan from the motherland," it continued.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will never allow the
separation of Taiwan from China. We have the determination,
confidence, and ability to achieve the complete reunification of
the motherland," it concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A harsh air alert rang out suddenly
today in the city of Hefei, capital of Anhui Province in east
China, to remind people not forget the national humiliation of
more than half century ago.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, 1938, Hefei was occupied by Japanese troops, a day
commemorated by the local citizens since the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
According to the local air defense department, the main purpose
of the alarm was to test the air alert system and also arouse
people's awareness of the importance of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The local government informed the people of this alert two
months ago, and so daily life was undisturbed, said a government
official.

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed, 17 Injured in Cairo Building Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were confirmed
dead, including a family of four, and 17 others injured when their
Cairo apartment building collapsed early Sunday, a rescue official
of the Health Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Two people were pulled out alive from the ruins and rescuers
were working to find around 20 others thought to be trapped in the
rubble of the 70-year-old building in the central, poor El-Sayeda
Zeinab district, the official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Eleven bodies have so far been recovered, including lawyer
Ashraf Abdel Rahman Darwish, his wife Abeer and their toddler
children Mustafa and Mohammed, he said.
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said that a man and his four children managed to
escape from the five-story building before it fell down shortly
after 1:00 a.m. (2200 GMT Saturday) after seeing sand falling from
the structure.
</P>
<P>
Emergency repairs were being carried out on the building
Saturday, neighbors said. A man added that workers were digging
inside the building to prepare for emergency reinforcement work.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the building was originally called for in October
1992 following an earthquake that shook the capital, but it was
delayed until emergency reinforcements were ordered around a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
The occupants were demanded to leave the building after the
emergency repairs were ordered, but most were still living inside
when it folded. Seven of the building's 12 apartments were
inhabited at the time, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, an apartment building fell down in Cairo, killing
three residents and injuring two others. In another incident last
June, a factory under construction for a plastics company in Sixth
of October City, 20 kilometers northwest of the capital, collapsed,
leaving 12 workers dead and 12 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliamentary Delegation Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ramon Pez Ferro, Head of the Foreign
Affairs Commission of the Cuban National Assembly, expressed desire
to further develop friendship with Turkey, reported Turkey's
Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ferro, who is currently on a visit to Istanbul at the head of a
delegation of the Cuban National Assembly, made the remarks
Saturday when meeting Gurbuz Capan, Mayor of Esenyurt, Istanbul
Province.
</P>
<P>
Capan and Ferro then proceeded to the Havana Park, which was
built in the city for friendship between Cuba and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Following a brief ceremony in which one-minute silence was
observed in memory of Abdullah Ataturk, founder of the Republic of
Turkey, and Jose Marti, national hero of Cuba, Ferro said in a
speech that he wants the two countries to further develop their
relations.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly relations between our two countries should
constitute a model for all world's nations. But unfortunately, the
case in many other parts of the world is just the opposite.
Powerful countries, for the sake of their own interests, are
imposing their own policies on other nations," Ferro said.
</P>
<P>
Capan told reporters that during his stay in Havana last year
where he attended an international conference, he had the
opportunity to make wide contacts with various Cuban officials
including the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
He told the mayor of Havana about Abdullah Ataturk and later had
a statue of Ataturk sent to Havana. It was erected in the city
square.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Cubans sent a statue of Jose Matin to his city.
It was likewise placed in the city, Capan added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Politicians Mourn Obuchi's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
and leaders of major political parties on Sunday mourned the death
of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who passed away the same
day six weeks after falling into a stroke-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
Mori said he was sorry that his predecessor, who decided to
hold July's summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) major powers in
Okinawa, died before seeing Japan hosts the event.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most regrettable that he passed away without seeing
its success," Mori, who was visiting Okinawa to attend a ceremony
to unveil the summit's main venue, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hiromu Nonaka, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), said that Obuchi's death coincided with the
inauguration ceremony for Bankoku Shinryokan, the main venue for
July's G-8 summit in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had worked so eagerly for the summit, Nonaka said.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that I have to bid farewell so soon to
someone who would have a bright future," Nonaka said.
</P>
<P>
Former LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato said Obuchi died after
expending all his energy on politics.
</P>
<P>
"I have the impression that he died in the pursuit of his
duties as a politician....I think the Okinawa summit would have
been the highlight of his life and political career," Kato said.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the largest opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ), said, "There is no word with which to
express my feeling other than the word sadness."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Communist Party head Tetsuzo Fuwa and Social
Democratic Party chairwoman Doi Takako also expressed sorrow for
Obuchi's death.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi died at 4:07 p.m. (0707 GMT) at the Juntendo University
Hospital, 43 days after suffering a stroke on April 2.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori succeeded Obuchi as LDP president and Japan's
prime minister on April 5.

<P>
The DPRK cannot but takes a serious note of desperate moves of
the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force of arms under the pretext if
its "missile threat", said a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is seeking to realize its ambition to militarily
stifle the DPRK by deploying new types of sophisticated strategic
weapons in its mainland and northeast Asia under that pretext and
strengthening its military and strategic position there.
</P>
<P>
Its immediate aim is to contain its potential rivals and big
powers and establish its unchallenged domination over the Asia-
pacific region, said the commentary, adding that these moves of
the U.S. cannot but spark a new arms race, a missile race, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. loudmouthed "missile threat" from the DPRK is aimed at
justifying its moves to establish the "missiles defense" system,

peacetime exemption for any occupation in American history.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 46 world records had
been surpassed during China's Fifth National Games for the
Disabled which closed in the country's largest city on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day event also witnessed the creation of 196 Games
records.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, president of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, declared the conclusion of the Games at the closing
ceremony here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever national sports gathering for the disabled
attracted a total of 6,000 participants including 1,805 athletes
from 35 delegations from all over China, including Hong Kong and
Macao, which became China's special administrative regions after
their respective handover to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Games featured 11 special sports -- athletics, swimming,
table tennis, shooting, weightlifting, badminton, judo for the
blind, gate ball for the blind, wheelchair basketball and sitting
volleyball. Liaoning, Shanghai Team A and Yunnan grabbed the top
three places in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth National Games for the Disabled will be held in east
China's Jiangsu Province in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The impressive number of new records set at the National Games

<HEADLINE> New Game Format for Junior World Badminton Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Desperate to find out ways to
raise public interest and sponsorship, the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) will introduce a more efficient and exciting five-
set, seven-point game at the world junior championship in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the experimental best-of-five game, the points of every
set were reduced from 15 to 7, giving players more time to rest
during the breaks.
</P>
<P>
In the current badminton matches, players need to take 15
points for the victory of a set in all the men's competitions and
in the women's doubles games, and 11 points were required to claim
a win for the women's singles players. A usual badminton game
plays 30-40 minutes, but some could be extended to one and a half
hours or even longer. A five-game group tie may run to five or
six hours, which is too long both for the athletes and the
audience.
</P>
<P>
The new scoring system could be more profitable to the European
players, who are physically better than the Asians, to promise
high speed throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
"We're killing players," IBF chief executive Neil Cameron said
here on Sunday. "We must reduce the total length of the game."
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing we want to make assure is that the
match will be more exciting under the new scoring system," he said.

<HEADLINE> IBF Headquarters May Leave England to Stint Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) may leave England after 66 years, looking around
the world for a site for its new headquarters, it was announced
after an IBF Council meeting here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the IBF was established in England in 1934, the
sport's world governing body was moving around in the areas of
south England, but the high costs of running the federation force
IBF to turn eyes to the world.
</P>
<P>
India proposed to establish a select committee to supervise the
feasibility of moving the IBF headquarters now located in
Cheltenham, after a vote of 105 in favor, 84 against in the
council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has not been decided yet," IBF chief executive Neil
Cameron said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some changes in favor of marketing the sport were also made in
the meeting in the Golden Horses Hotel here. IBF turned down the
proposal that all team events, including the Thomas Cup for men
and Uber Cup for women and Sudirman Cup, should no longer be
counted in World Rankings as from January 1, 2001. IBF feared the
cut-off of the rankings points from the team events will reduce
the participation of small nations or areas, whose players
consider the team competitions the only way to collect rankings
points.
</P>
<P>
For the Sudirman Cup, a biannual mixed teams tournament, the
length of semi-finals and finals competitions would be shortened
as each tie in the non-group rounds would be stopped when the tie
is decided. It means when the score of the game comes to 3-0 or 3-
1 in the best-of-five tie, the rest games of the tie will not be
played.
</P>
<P>
But in the preliminary round, teams play the full five games as
usual for the possible use of countback.
</P>
<P>
And the first section of the qualifying round for the 2002
Thomas/Uber Cup Finals Pan-American Zone will be played in Jamaica,
Cameron said.

<HEADLINE> Evading "One China" Principle Impermissible: People's Daily Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary said there will be no lasting peace across the
Taiwan Straits if the one-China principle and the fact that Taiwan
is part of China are not recognized.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "Evading 'One-China' Principle
Impermissible," points out that any misinterpretation of the
principle has ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
It said that the elected-leader in Taiwan recently said that he
is "willing" to improve cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he" has adopted an attitude of evading and
defying the most important and most key issue for developing the
cross-straits relationship," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the relaxation, improvement, and development of
cross-straits relations depend on whether or not Taiwan recognizes
and adheres to the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
Following the Taiwan regional election on March 18, China has
closely followed the words and actions of the elected leader.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have repeatedly
stressed that "no matter who is in power in Taiwan, he is welcome
to the mainland for talks. And at the same time, we can go to
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
But the basis for dialogue is to first recognize the one-China
principle. Under this principle, anything is open to discussion,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government's proposal and stand in handling cross-
straits relations is firm, consistent, and clear, and it has shown
great sincerity and patience," the People's Daily said.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the two sides of the straits have dialogs,
talks, and negotiations as equals, but the sole precondition is
that the Taiwan side must recognize the one-China principle."
</P>
<P>
"This is our bottom line," the commentary added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Anti-Desertification Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called for immediate and efficient efforts to combat serious
desertification in the country and to build greenbelts to improve
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
He made the call during a recent inspection tour in north China
's Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from May 12
to 14.
</P>
<P>
Since early spring, 12 sandstorms have swept much of northern
and northwestern China, causing widespread social concern and
deeply worrying Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last Friday, the premier, accompanied by top local
officials, visited areas in Hebei and Inner Mongolia where
desertification is very serious.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the direct reason for the frequent
sandstorms which hit northern China this spring was abnormal
weather, but excessive logging as well as massive reclamation and
mining are the real culprits.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments and the masses to act
immediately to work for a better environment for the benefit of
the country and its younger generations.
</P>
<P>
Over-grazing by cattle and sheep is also a major cause of
desertification in China's northern and western regions, he noted,
and urged efficient protection and supervision of the grasslands.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the central government will increase
financial support to Hebei and Inner Mongolia for their efforts to
combat water and soil erosion and for the creation of new forests.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A symposium was held in Beijing
recently to mark the third anniversary of the Regulations on the
Management of Farm Chemicals, the first such regulations on the
administration of farm chemicals in China, issued by the State
Council in 1997. Recent tests have shown that the qualification
rate of farm chemicals has now reached 70 percent, up from the
previous 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,045 farm chemicals including products from abroad were
registered with the Ministry of Agriculture in 1999, and the
registration rate increased from 75 percent three years ago to the
current 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, authorities began strictly controlling
production, stopping redundant projects, and eliminating those

<HEADLINE> China to Clean up Cosmetic Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Internal Trade and the Ministry of Health decided recently to
carry out a full-scale rectification of the country's cosmetic
industry.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that consumer complains against beauty
salons have been rising in recent years, as more and more people
are concerned about the beauty salons' fake advertisements, poor
equipment, and unsafe plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 1.2 million beauty salons and shops
employing more than six million people, and the sector's business
turnover hits some 24 billion yuan (2.9 billion US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Yet the lack of standards and a supervisory system has left the
industry somewhat troubled, in spite of its huge development in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Administration of Internal Trade and the
Ministry of Health said that compulsory regulations will soon
standardize the industry's operations and advertising, and beauty
salons and staff will be required to obtain certificates to be
issued by related departments.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Chairman of
Tanzanian opposition Civic United Front (CUF) Ibrahim Lipumba has
become the first from the opposition camp to declare the intention
to vie for presidency in the coming general elections to be held
this October.
</P>
<P>
Lipumba, who was economic adviser to the retired president Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, collected the nomination forms Saturday at the
party's District Offices in Dar es Salaam, the Sunday Observer
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after picking the forms, the chairman was
quoted as saying he had started preparations to go to State House
and if given that chance he will emulate former president Mwinyi's
strategy of ridding the masses of abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
He also noted, even though he had picked the forms, the
opposition camp is still discussing on whether they could unite
and field one presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanzanian constitution, each party can select
only one candidate to join the final presidential race.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time for Lipumba to vie for the highest
post in the east African nation on the CUF ticket. He first
contested in 1995 in the first multiparty general elections and
lost to the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) candidate Benjamin
Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa has decided to run for a second five-year term
and he is so far the only CCM member who has officially declared
to join the race.
</P>
<P>
The election, to be held on October 29, will enable Tanzanians
on the mainland and the Zanzibar Isles to elect a Union president,
members of parliament and councilors for local governments.
</P>
<P>
The semi-autonomous Zanzibar region will elect its own
president at the same time.

regional GDP growth of 6.7 percent for non-Japan Asia over the
2000-2001 interval," he said in a report available today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now increasingly impressed with Asia's willingness to
begin the heavy lifting of structural reform. In the end, such
reforms hold the key to crisis prevention and pan-regional
economic stability," Roach pointed out in the report entitled A
New Asia Emerges.
</P>
<P>
Describing the recently announced Asian Regional Financial
Arrangement (ARFA) as the "new liquidity backstop," Roach said
that Asia has a disproportionate share of the world's total
foreign exchange reserves, which now totals around 1.8 trillion U.
S. dollars excluding gold stocks, and such a large pool of pan-
Asian assets could make a real difference at times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the broader implication of the plan to
establish the ARFA is that Asia is moving outside the Washington-
IMF sphere and taking matters into its own hands in shaping a new
regional financial architecture with Japan and China leading the
way.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of a new foreign exchange regime and a large
liquidity backstop satisfies two of the key recommendations that
have come out the post-crisis debate on the imperatives for reform
of the international financial architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is now making good progress on this front. And in doing
so, it is also forging a new axis of leadership between Japan and
China that could have much to say about the region's economic and
political prowess in the 21st century," the economist noted.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Airport Sets New Highs in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of passengers and air
cargo tonnage handled by the Hong Kong International Airport
reached new highs in April, according to the Hong Kong Airport
Authority today.
</P>
<P>
Almost three million passengers passed through the airport in
April, an increase of 14.6 percent on a yearly basis. The airport
handled nearly 31.3 million passengers in the 12 months from May
1999 to April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The high passenger figures for April can be attributed in part
to the Easter holidays. One-day records for the airport were set
on Good Friday when 121,000 passengers arrived or left on a total
of 610 flights, the highest number of flights and passengers so
far on a single day at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Cargo growth maintained a double-digit rate in April, with 185,
000 tons handled at the airport. The total for the last 12 months
reached 2.09 million tons, a rise of 25.9 percent over the
corresponding period in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
Cargo exports for April rose 20 percent from a year earlier,
and 35.2 percent for the past 12 months.

<HEADLINE> At Least Two Killed in Building Collapse in Cairo: Official </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and
two others injured in the collapse of a building early Sunday in a
populous district in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, an official of
the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The five-story tenement on El-Sayeda Zeinab Street in the El-
Sayeda Zeinab District fell at 1:00 local time (2200 Saturday GMT),
Ayman, who declined to give his family name, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Two people have been confirmed dead and two others injured in
this accident," Ayman said. But he did not know how many people
lived in the building with eight flats before it went down.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by Egypt's Middle East News Agency said that
five bodies have been recovered from the debris of the building and
that two people have been rescued. It added that some 21 people
were believed to have lived in the building.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Israel Predicts 4 Percent Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Israel on Sunday
updated its forecast of the country's economic growth in 2000 to 4
percent from the initial 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This revision stems mainly from the accelerated growth seen in
the second quarter through the last quarter of 1999", the central
bank said in a review of economic developments from October through
March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli gross domestic product growth had slowed for four
consecutive years, but began to pick up in mid-1999 with structural
reforms and private sector reorganizations as well as the expansion
of the country's high-tech sector, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Increased growth in 2000 is based on expectations of greater
global demand, Israel's continued emphasis on technology production
and a rise in tourism. In the last quarter of 1999 alone, the Gross
Domestic Products (GDP) growth hit 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite slower growth in the first quarter of 2000, "these
trends are expected to continue, even if their strength is not
clear because they are influenced by future developments on local
and foreign capital markets," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The higher economic growth will boost per capita GDP by 1.6
percent in 2000, compared with a 0.2 percent drop in 1999. Import
growth will have slowed to 7.5 percent from 14.7 percent in 1999,
but exports should rise by 11.5 percent in 2000 from 9.7 percent a
year earlier, the Bank of Israel said.
</P>
<P>
The revised forecast matches other economists' expectations.
Israel's Finance Ministry said last month it sees economic growth
will reach 3.5-4.0 percent in 2000. The international Monetary
Fund last week said that it expects a 3.8 percent growth for the
Israeli economy in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: COMESA Steps up Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Long Shengdong
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Summit of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is due to open in
Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius, from May 18 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the COMESA member states, who have made unremitting
efforts to accelerate the pace of the regional economic
integration, will discuss relevant issues on establishing a Free
Trade Area (FTA) scheduled for October 31 this year at the
forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
The FTA requires full liberalization of trading practices,
including the elimination of non-tariff barriers to ensure the
free movement of goods, services and capital within the member
states.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the establishment of the FTA will help
promote trade among the 21 member countries and make it closer to
the ultimate objective of creating a regional economic community
as part of the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Since COMESA formally succeeded the Preferential Trade Area for
Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in December 1994, the 21-member
regional group has been working hard to strengthen the process of
regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, COMESA heads of state agreed that a common
external tariff would be implemented by 2004 to strengthen the
establishment of a regional Customs Union, with a zero tariff on
products originating from within the common market.
</P>
<P>
By July 1, 1999 four COMESA member countries had reduced their
tariffs by 90 percent, six by 80 percent, one by 70 percent and
three by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although most member countries have not fully met the targets
for tariff reductions by the agreed date, all of them reiterated
at the previous summit in Kenya's capital Nairobi their commitment
to achieving the target of 100 percent reduction by October this
year.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the member states endorsed the establishment of
a special Free Trade Area Committee comprising Kenya, Mauritius,
Zambia, Uganda, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to assist in the preparatory activities
culminating in the launching of the FTA.
</P>
<P>
According to COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha, the FTA
is a gateway to integrating small markets into the competitive
global economy and will create a unified economic space enabling
gains in efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The FTA would also act as an engine of growth through increased
 investment from both within and outside the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA aims to formulate a common investment procedure to
promote domestic, cross-border and direct foreign investment by
ensuring the free movement of capital, services and labor.
</P>
<P>
In order to quicken the steps towards the FTA, the COMESA held
its first Regional Economic Conference in Cairo, Egypt, in
February this year. The participants centered their discussions
mainly on challenges facing COMESA within the global environment,
privatization process, economic restructuring and information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Besides, COMESA member states have also adopted a single COMESA
Customs Document to replace the previous multiplicity of
documents, installed customs management systems to facilitate data
and revenue collection and introduced a customs bond guarantee
scheme to reduce the cost of financing transit goods.
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 8, 1999 It has implemented the automated
system for customs data and management computer program in 12 of
its 21member states.
</P>
<P>
The system is part of a comprehensive program aimed at
enhancing the mode of customs clearance and trade statistics
processing in COMESA member states before the realization of its
Customs Union Treaty in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the intra-COMESA trade rose
sharply from 734 million U.S. dollars in 1985 to 4.2 billion
dollars in 1998, with an annual growth rate of 20 percent, and
trade with third countries is also growing at about 7 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the regional economic integration,
COMESA leaders have come to realize that the regional economic
integration will not be accomplished unless there is durable
peace, political stability and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
To this end, foreign ministers of the COMESA held their first
meeting on peace and security in Zambia's capital Lusaka in April
this year, focusing on implementing the decision by the COMESA
summit in Nairobi. A report adopted at the meeting will be
submitted to the forthcoming COMESA summit.
</P>
<P>
The Mauritius summit is expected to identify ways for a
preventive diplomacy with the focus on capacity building in early
warning, conflict resolutions and post-conflict management.

<HEADLINE> Eight Confirmed Dead in Netherlands Fireworks Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Eight people including two firemen
were killed in a fireworks warehouse explosion at Enschede in the
eastern Netherlands, the country's national wire service ANP said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two other firemen were still missing from the scene.
</P>
<P>
Earlier television reports said the death toll could be as high
as at least 20. Police and firefighters at the scene, however,
did not rule out the possibility of rising casualties.
</P>
<P>
Among the confirmed 310 injured, nine still remain under
intensive care at local hospitals and military bases.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Wim Kok arrived at
Enschede on Sunday morning to inspect the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
A blaze inside a local fireworks warehouse Saturday afternoon
triggered multiple explosions that destroyed the warehouse and a
nearby residence area accommodating some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Television reports quoted local dweller Freek Tonis as saying:
"A whole neighborhood was blown away and it was like a war zone
after the first explosion."
</P>
<P>
He added that the death toll could go still higher as local
residents initially thought that the fire was part of a show and
swarmed toward the fireworks warehouse to have a look.
</P>
<P>
People in the town described that there were two explosions
that were heard clearly. The first smaller blast set off a chain
reaction of the fireworks in the warehouse while the chain
reaction in turn triggered the second major explosion that did
most of the damage.
</P>
<P>
The warehouse reportedly held an estimated 100 tons of
fireworks.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi Dies at 62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, who had been in a coma for six weeks after suffering a
stroke, died Sunday of a cerebral infarction at a Tokyo hospital.
He was 62.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said Obuchi died at 4:07 p.m. (0707 GMT) at
the Juntendo University Hospital, 43 days after the stroke.
</P>
<P>
The date of Obuchi's funeral service has not yet been decided,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's political heavyweights, such as Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki and secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) Hiromu Nonaka, went to the hospital Sunday evening to
express condolences to Obuchi's family.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier in the day that Obuchi's blood pressure
had dropped to a near-critical level and that he was becoming
unresponsive to medication to stimulate circulation.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Japanese media reported that the former prime
minister was in a very serious condition and many senior
politicians canceled plans to leave Tokyo for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was sent to the hospital at around 1 a.m. on April 2
after complaining of feeling unwell at his official residence, and
a stroke was diagnosed. He fell into a coma that evening and was
put on an artificial respirator.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori on April 5 succeeded Obuchi as LDP president and
Japan's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi became prime minister on July 30, 1998, replacing
Ryutaro Hashimoto, after a long political career that included
stints as foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was reelected prime minister when the remainder of his
term as LDP president ended in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi struggled with dismal approval ratings when he assumed
the premiership, but his support ratings rose in the first year,
after Japan's economy showed signs of improvement after a long
recession.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Waseda University, Obuchi was elected to the
House of Representatives at the age of 26. He had served 12 terms
in the Diet, or the Japanese parliament, since 1963.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is survived by his wife, Chizuko, two daughters and a
son.

<P>
ABU DHABI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The unpredictable future of oil
prices has compelled Gulf states to focus on information
technology, said Mohammed Gergawi, director general of Dubai
Technology, E-Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority and Chief of
Dubai Internet City.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the three-day Third Gulf Excellence
Forum on Saturday, Gergawi said "we have a fair idea about the
proven oil reserves but we are unaware of the prices," the Dubai-
based daily Gulf News reported.
</P>
<P>
Dubai Internet city aims at creating a healthy infrastructure to
attract qualified Third World cadres, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union expects e-commerce to provide 20 million
jobs in the coming ten years and the Arab world , which reels under
unemployment, must therefore consider the sector seriously,"
Gergawi added.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East Internet users only represent 0.25 per cent of
global e-users, but Arab e-purchases rose from 21 million U.S.
dollars in 1998 to 100 million U.S. dollars in 1999, said Nasser
Jassem Al Sane'e, head of the forum's technical committee.

visit is of historic significance in promoting bilateral ties on
the eve of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese are following with great interest the
development in China's reform and feel happy and encouraging about
the great success achieved by China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Representing the Canadian government at the gathering were
Sophia Leung, member of parliament, and Ujjal Dosanjh, premier of
Canada's west coastal province of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of Vancouver as a city of
historical links with China, hoping the working relationship of
the two countries will become closer and closer.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed heart-felt thanks for the warm welcome he received
during his visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering about the encouraging results achieved by
China since it adopted the policy of reform and opening up to the
outside world in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
But China must remain sober-minded and keep unity in its hard
struggle to further narrow its gap with developed countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged Chinese Canadians to make greater efforts to help
China in its development while seeking business opportunities of
their own.
</P>
<P>
China highly evaluates the contribution by overseas Chinese to
its development over the past two decades, he said, adding China
will continue to value the important role of overseas Chinese so
as to make its reform more fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Li began his official visit of friendship Monday. He is
scheduled to end his six-day trip in Canada Sunday. His good-will
mission will also take him to Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Calls Meeting Over Abu Dis Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
called an urgent meeting Saturday night with key Labor ministers
and members of parliament to discuss issues concerning handover of
Abu Dis village to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held at his home near Tel Aviv and lasted
till small hours Sunday morning, was the latest in a series of
Barak's consultations with party colleagues and coalition heads
about his proposal to transfer Abu Dis and other two Palestinian
villages near Jerusalem to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Barak is facing objections over the Abu Dis issue. The National
Religious Party, the right-wing coalition partner, has already said
it will leave the government should Barak go ahead with handing
over the three villages, while Yisrael Ba'aliya, another coalition
partner, is likely to vote against any land transfer at this point
of time.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the second largest coalition partner with 17 parliamentary
members, has not decided whether to support Barak's proposal over
the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, sources close to Barak said the prime
minister was weighing the option of taking a vote on Abu Dis
transfer in the cabinet next week.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Shas Chairman Eli Yishai Thursday night to discuss the
Abu Dis issue and the latter told Barak that only Shas's spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef has the right to say whether Shas
supports the land transfer.
</P>
<P>
The three Palestinian villages are now in Area B of the West
Bank, where Palestinians are in control of civil administration and
Israel takes charge of security. The transfer of the three villages
have been postponed several times due to objections not only from
the opposition, but within the coalition in Israel.

Kazini  issued a 48-hour ultimatum for Rwandan troops to leave
parts of Kisangani in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Kazini threatened to reprisals should the ultimatum be ignored,
the New Vision newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) will occupy the
northern and eastern parts of Kisangani, while the Rwandan
Patriotic Army (RPA) occupied the southern and western part the
city, according to the Mweya agreement signed by Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame
last year.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, RPA violated this agreement and occupied some areas
that are legally supposed to be in the sector of the UPDF," said
the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The end of the ultimatum falls on the eve of a summit between
Museveni and Kagame which is to take place Sunday in Tanzania.
The two leaders are supposed to discuss the recent crisis between
Kampala and Kigali.

Troops of the two neighboring countries fought each other on
May 5 and 8 in Kisangani where they support rival rebel factions

Ugandan Army Commander Jeje Odongo said that since the
ultimatum was issued, the RPA have known where they are supposed
to be. Odongo said he was also in touch with Rwandan Army Chief
of Staff Kayumba Nyamwasa about the troops withdrawal from
Kisangani.

<P>
TOKYO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, who had been in a coma for six weeks after suffering a
stoke, died on Sunday. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi died at 4:07 p.m. (0707 GMT) in Tokyo's Juntendo
Hospital, according to Michiko Shimizu, an official in Obuchi's
administrative office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier in the day that Obuchi's blood pressure
had dropped to a near-critical level and that he was becoming
unresponsive to medication to stimulate circulation.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Japanese media reported that the former prime
minister was in a very serious condition and many senior
politicians canceled plans to leave Tokyo for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was elected to the House of Representatives at the age
of 26. He served 12 terms in the Diet, or Japanese parliament, and
had headed up many important ministries and the Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Obuchi was elected prime minister amid a decade-
long economic crisis. On April 2, he was hospitalized following a
stoke. Officials said that he had been in bad condition for "over-
exhaustion."
</P>
<P>
His successor, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, took office on
April 5 and pledged to stick to Obuchi's policies.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is survived by his wife, Chizuko, two daughters and a
son.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Explosion Kills at Least 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An explosion inside a fireworks
warehouse in eastern Netherlands killed at least 20 and injured
some 300 others, television reports said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A blaze inside the fireworks warehouse at Enschede Saturday
afternoon triggered multiple explosions that destroyed the
warehouse and a nearby residence area, where some 2,000 people had
their homes.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were firefighters as well as local residents.
Firefighting teams rushed to the scene from throughout the
Netherlands and neighboring Germany.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday morning, two firefighters were confirmed dead and
another two were reported as missing.
</P>
<P>
A dozen people were hospitalized in intensive care units in
local hospitals and military bases.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports quoted Freek Tonis as saying: "A whole
neighborhood was blown away and it was like a war zone after the
first explosion."
</P>
<P>
The resident of the town added that the death toll could go
still higher as local residents initially thought that the fire
was part of a show and swarmed toward the fireworks warehouse to
have a look.
</P>
<P>
Local people described that there were two explosions that were
heard clearly. The first smaller blast set off a chain reaction
of the fireworks in the warehouse while the chain reaction in turn
triggered the second major explosion.
</P>
<P>
The warehouse reportedly held an estimated 100 tons of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Wim Kok were scheduled

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Back-Channel Talks Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JEUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Prime Minister's Office has
admitted that back-channel negotiations with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are under way in order to speed up the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
"There are and have been contacts on different levels," Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky was quoted by local
daily the Jerusalem Post as reporting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Baltiansky added that these contacts were for the most part
nothing more than "quiet arenas in which to sound out ideas and
help the main, official channel."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not deny the earlier reports that both Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Gilad Sher, a former
negotiator and confidant of Barak, are involved in the back-channel
talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Ben-Ami and Sher have been meeting
with Palestinian Legislative Council speaker Ahmed Qurei and PNA
cabinet minister Hassan Asfour in search of a way to achieve a
framework accord as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
PNA sources also confirmed that Ben-Ami has been involved in
back-channel talks with other senior Palestinian official, and said
he also participated in the summit held last week between Barak and
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Other secrete channels are said to have been opened between
Arafat and number of Israeli officials, among them Minister of
Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon and Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the main channel between the two sides, Baltiansky
stressed, was the official one between negotiators Oded Eran and
Yasser Abed Rabbo, who are to meet again on Tuesday to continue the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to visit Washington next Tuesday to hold
talks there with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss ways of
overcoming the delays in the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach the framework agreement on final-
status issues Saturday and the Palestinian side blamed Israel for
this failure.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side did not enter seriously into the negotiations
under the pretext of internal problems and the lack of political
decision," the PNA said in a statement Friday.

Gerome Frittle of Le Ficaro (French newspaper) and Olivier Daube
of Agence France Presse (AFP), the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Army based in Bus-Bus, Sulu, confirmed that five of
the 12 journalists failed to return after they managed to trek
toward the jungle hideout of the Abu Sayyaf in Patikul and Talipao
municipalities, where the rebels are holding 21 hostages, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said that Guzman could not figure out how
the rest of the journalists managed to break away from the rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have been ordered to check the whereabouts of
the missing journalists, it said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven foreign journalists together with a Filipino colleague,
Rikki Alvarez, a DZRH correspondent, hired an FX van which took
them to Patikul from downtown Jolo and proceeded by foot to the
Abu Sayyaf jungle hideout at 08:00 a.m. (00:00 GMT) Saturday, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Alvarez together with three other foreign
journalists returned to Jolo shortly before 09:00 a.m. (01:00 GMT)
Sunday, while three others returned later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels have reportedly
freed at least 40 hostages, who were taken by the rebels in
Esperanza town, Sultan Kudarat Province, Saturday, when they were
pursued by government forces.
</P>
<P>
The rebels burst into a remote Southern Philippine village and
rounded up about 400 people, demanding rice and food. But later,
they took away at least 40 villagers as hostages and freed rest of
them.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Appeals Again for Relief Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has appealed
again to the international community for assistance in fighting
drought and hunger.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Herald newspaper quoted Minister of State Sharrif
Nassir as saying that the government was not able to provide
enough food for the drought-hit areas in the north and northeast
Kenya due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the government called for international aids
to help victims of the hunger in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Nassir said on Saturday that the government had so far spent
750 million shillings (around 10 million U.S. dollars) in relief
effort.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 80 percent of the country's land received less
than 400 mm rainfall last year and even less rain this year,
adding that there was no equipment to drill boreholes for water.
</P>
<P>
There are 700,000 Kenyans at immediate risk of the famine,
including 100, 000 under five, according to the U.N. Children's
Fund.

<HEADLINE> Explosions Shock Western Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Several powerful explosions shook
Kermanshah late Saturday night, the capital of Iran's western
border province Kermanshah, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted witnesses as saying that several people were
injured in the explosions occurred around 2325 hours local times
(1855 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Police closed off a densely populated district where the blasts
occurred near the city's silo in the eastern part of the city, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based Iranian outlawed military group Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization (MKO) has claimed that its members had a mortar attack
against the headquarters of an Iranian anti-riot police in
Kermanshah.
</P>
<P>
The explosions happened hours after Iraq blamed "Iranian agents"
for an attack on Baghdad, in which a child was killed and several
other people injured. An Iraqi opposition backed by Iran claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the MKO have launched three
mortar attacks on residential units in the capital city of Tehran,
close to Iranian government building and military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the MKO fired several mortar shells into a
sports complex near the Iranian police headquarters, injuring six
people.
</P>
<P>
The group, a famous political-military one which fought against
the former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into
Iraq following sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
serials of cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including assassinating senior Iranian officials. In retaliation,
Iranian armed forces also launched several air raids on the MKO
bases in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China's Medical Sector Woos Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors are being
encouraged to invest more in research and development in the
health and medical industries in China, today's Business Weekly
quoted a senior government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investors will enjoy favorable export tax treatment when it
comes to medical instruments and enterprise income tax preferences,
said Yu Mingde, director of the department of medicine of the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation can be in various and flexible forms, Yu said at
the China (Beijing) International High-Tech Industries Week 2000
held last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The move would help domestic institutes, colleges and hospitals
absorb more advanced technologies and put them into practical use.
</P>
<P>
It would also inspire domestic firms and institutions to
increase their technological research budgets, which are only a
small fraction of their present output partly because of funding
shortages.
</P>
<P>
China's medical industry is striving for technological
renovation, experts said.
</P>
<P>
A hot issue is the development of biopharmaceuticals, which is
regarded as one of the most promising and profitable industries of
the future.
</P>
<P>
About 140 firms in China have begun to develop biological-based
medicines, sources said. They are already producing about 20
biopharmaceutical products that have been put into commercial
production, turning out an annual output value of as much as 3
billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sector will receive more government support, but production
should be in tune with practical demands, Yu said, adding that the
central government will set up a special committee to supervise
the development of the high-tech content of new drugs to avoid
waste and repetition.
</P>
<P>
Imported medicines and drugs produced by foreign-invested firms
have already taken nearly half of the existing domestic market
share, according to Chen Kaixian, an academician with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Firms Should be Allowed to Trade in Stock Market: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance companies should
be allowed to trade directly in the stock market so to develop
mature unit-linked products that can help them deal with monstrous
potential risks facing the life insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly quoted experts and officials as saying
that unit-linked products allows insurance companies to make long-
term investments using premium income. Returns from these
investments can be distributed to policyholders in addition to
certain fixed amounts specified in insurance contracts.
</P>
<P>
Investment returns can be large or small in accordance with
investment results and policy holders should bear the risks
outlined in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
Unit-linked products are an important part of life insurance
products in developed markets, while in China, the first such
product has just been developed by the Ping An Insurance company
of China.
</P>
<P>
The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) is considering
giving more favorable treatment to unit-linked products in terms
of tax treatment and by opening more investment channels, said
Chen Wenhui, director general with the commission's life insurance
regulatory department.
</P>
<P>
But this will require the co-operation of other governmental
departments, including the taxation bureau and securities
regulators, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
"We should let insurance funds directly enter the capital
market instead of indirectly by purchasing securities funds," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance companies can only make money by using bank
deposits, treasury bonds, State-level corporate bonds, interbank
lending and purchases of securities funds.
</P>
<P>
The narrowness of the channel, especially a lack of most
profitable direct stock investments, has hindered the
profitability of China's unit-linked products.
</P>
<P>
The fledgling Chinese insurance industry is facing monstrous
hidden risks. Its investment returns on premiums have declined
annually because of continuous drops in interest rates of bank
deposits and treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
But senior economist Wu Jinglian warned at a recent seminar
that the opening of the securities market to insurance funds
should be gradual and steady because both the stock and insurance
markets still need to be standardized and regulated.

Fortunately, I was there for the put-back."

<HEADLINE> Owning a Private Plane Is No Longer A Dream For Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- While most Chinese high-income
earners are setting aside money for private cars, Li Anli, a
former Air China stewardess, has ordered a private plane costing
over 500,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the first Chinese woman to buy her own plane, Li said this
will realize a long-cherished dream of piloting a plane of her own.
</P>
<P>
She has ordered a Bonanza A36 luxury plane from the U.S.-based
Raytheon Aircraft, which sells some 100 such planes a year. The
company will deliver the aircraft to Shanghai in August.
</P>
<P>
Raytheon said the company has given Li a discount as an
encouragement to the first Chinese buyer of the Bonanza model,
whose market price is some 600,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Li now runs a private trade company in Shanghai. She believes
that more wealthy Chinese will own their own planes as China is
opening the blue sky to private planes.
</P>
<P>
Li's plane will be put under supervision of China Eastern
Airlines, said Zhang Feng, general manager of the Shanghai Eastern
Aviation Educational Training Co. Ltd. The company began in April
as the first corporate training center for private pilots in China.
</P>
<P>
The company also acts as an agent submitting flight
applications for private pilots to airports. "Because unlike
driving cars, piloting a plane needs ground navigational backup,"
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yue, general manager of the Yuanda Group, a giant air-
conditioner producer in China, was the first private plane owner
in China. He now owns four planes, one jet aircraft from Cessna
and three Bell helicopters. With these airplanes, his work has
become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
"I can fly to any place I want," said Zhang, "I only have to
inform the aviation authorities of my flight route three hours
prior to take off."

<HEADLINE> Italy Agrees With Germany on European Federation Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Saturday that he agreed with the idea put forward Friday by
his German counterpart Joschka Fischer, who proposed an
unspecified European nucleus to cope with European Union reform
and expansion and map out a true European federation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a line of thought which, from many angles, I myself
developed in the meeting of foreign ministers in the Azores a few
days ago," Dini said, referring to the informal consultations held
on May 5 and 6 in San Miguel, the Azores.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully the new idea will pave the way for the on-going
negotiations to beef up European institutions and their work, as
well as in the perspective of its expansion, Italian news agency
Ansa quoted Dini as saying.
</P>
<P>
Facing these challenges, Dini said that "the European Union
must be capable of speaking in a single voice and must thus
achieve a more precise identity which will allow our continent to
act as a protagonist on the international scene, and not as a
spectator."
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister went on to say that, within a shared
framework, it will be necessary for "the member states that want
and can do so to go ahead of the others without delay toward the
goal of political integration."
</P>
<P>
"This is the crucial knot the intergovernmental conference on
the revision of the treaties must untie within the year to thereby
provide concrete prospects for progress toward a strong and
dynamic European project," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in
Berlin that he envisioned a "center of gravity" or "locomotive" in
the "avant-garde" for integrating policy ahead of the creation of
a European federation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he could not instantly answer the
questions as to which states to be included in that project, and
whether the EU founders, the 11 members of the euro or yet another
group could serve as the "locomotive".
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he recalled that the same idea had been put
forward by former European Commission President Jacques Delors,
who spoke of basing a federation initiative on the six founders of
the European Community, and discussed by ex-German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, who named the euro 11 as a core for these efforts.

<HEADLINE> Top Yugoslav Official Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Another top Yugoslav official was
assassinated by a terrorist Saturday in the northern city of Novi
Sad.
</P>
<P>
Bosko Perosevic, 43, head of the provincial government of
Yugoslavia's northern Vojvodina province since 1993, was shot
around midday while attending the opening ceremony of the 67th
agriculture fair in the provincial capital, Yugoslav state news
agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was arrested by police on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Novi Sad clinic chief Djordje Janjic said Perosevic, also a
senior official of Milosevic's Socialist Party, died around 4 p.m.
(1400 GMT) after he was sent to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
His death was the latest in a series of high-profile killings
in Yugoslavia, including that of Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic
in February.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party denounced the shooting as a terrorist act,
saying it showed how those who carried out aggression against
Yugoslavia "are putting their weapons in the hands of local
servants".

SANTIAGO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government has made a
plan to establish a training center for military forces to carry
out United Nations peace missions, Defense Minister Mario
Fernandez announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be implemented in the short term for the armed
forces personnel taking part in U.N. missions of humanitarian
organizations in an all-including way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three Chilean armed forces members are now taking part
in U.N. peace missions in the East Timor island of Dili headed by

The Chilean group has contributed 4,000 persons and 50 tons of

adding that this mission is a very stimulating move because it
means to give an unprotected community very needed support.

PARIS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Svetlana Khorkina jumped from
sixth to first in the final two events to clinch the individual
all-around title at the European women's gymnastics championships
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was the balance beam, not usually her favorite apparatus
that earned her top spot, after Romania's Simona Amanar, who led
Khorkina by 0.15 points going into the final rounds, made an error.
</P>
<P>
Khorkina scored 9.775 points on the beam with a solid
performance to finish with 38.749 points.
</P>
<P>
Khorkina's Russian team mate Yelena Zamolodchikova was second
with 38.624 points. Third was Ukraine's Victoria Karpenko, 38.456.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Party Wins State Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The German Social Democratic Party,
the SPD led by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder won the state
election in North Rhine-Westphalia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The SPD got 43.3 or 43.8 percent of votes, said projections
broadcast by Germany's ARD and ZDF public television networks.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Christian Democratic Union, the CDU gained only
37.3 per cent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The partner of the SPD in the coalition, the Greens won 7.1
per cent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The liberal Free Democratic Party, the FDP was successful in
returning into the state parliament, the Landtag. It won 9.9 per
cent of the votes. In the state election in 1995 it had been
ousted from the Landtag with 4.4 per cent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The SPD will rule in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, but
with which party it forms a coalition is now unknown yet. The FDP
has got more votes than the junior partner of the SPD in the
election. The SPD has to consider about it conscientiously.
</P>
<P>
The famous politician of the FDP, the former German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher appealed the SPD to throw out the
Greens and form a coalition with the FDP.

<HEADLINE> (Updates)Thousands Rally for Gun Control on Mother's Day in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of mothers and their
families joined the "Million Mom March" in Washington Sunday to
oppose gun violence and demand Congress to pass stricter gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
Throngs of mothers, aunts, sisters, grandmothers, children and
more than a sprinkling of fathers gave up the traditional flowers
and brunches to spend Mother's Day on the National Mall in the
center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In an area bounded by the Capitol, Washington monument and the
popular Smithsonian Museums, marchers carried signs showing
handguns with red lines through them and messages proclaiming "
Freedom Gun Trauma." Some carried pictures of their dead children.
</P>
<P>
"The Million Mom March" organizers lined up plenty of
entertainers. But the real stars were Americans who lost love ones
to gun violence, telling their personal stories.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton held a separate warm-up rally outside the White House on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants legislation that would require child safety locks
with all new handguns, close a loophole that permits firearms
purchases at gun shows without background checks and ban the
import of large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
Every day in the United States, 12 children are killed by guns,
either intentionally or accidentally.
</P>
<P>
However, pro-gun supporters gathered for a counter-rally near
the Washington Monument. The Second Amendment Sisters, a pro-gun
group that has its own moms, was sending a different message: New
controls on handguns would only give criminals the advantage.
</P>
<P>
The organization, independent of the National Rifle Association
(NRA), wants the administration to enforce the laws already in
force. The group was giving balloons to participants to separate
them from the competing demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, mothers and children also gathered in about 65
other communities nationwide in support of greater gun control.
</P>
<P>
Symbolizing the dozen children killed by gunfire every day in
the United States, 12 young people rang a bell created by a
community-based coalition in Bridgeport, Connecticut State.

<HEADLINE> Free Democrats Are Biggest Winners of State Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- In the state election of North
Rhine-Westphalia the Liberal Free Democrats, the FDP have won 9.9
per cent of the votes and can enter into the state parliament, the
Landtag.
</P>
<P>
In the state election before five years the FDP got only 4 per
cent of the votes and could not win any seats in the Landtag.
According to the Germany's election law a party must win at least
more than five per cent of the votes so that it can get the seats
in the state parliament.
</P>
<P>
"This is a proud day for the Free Democrats," said Juergen
Moellemann, the FDP leader in North Rhine-Westphalia. He stressed
still : "The people no longer want to ruled by the Greens."
</P>
<P>
The FDP was a junior partner of the coalition of the Christian
Democratic Union from 1982 to 1998 under leadership of Helmut Kohl.
After the defeat in the general election on September 27, 1998 the
FDP was tossed out in several Landtags.
</P>
<P>
it is an historical victory for the FDP for many years. With 9.
9 per cent of the votes the FDP can enter into the Landtag and
becomes an important power in the political life. The biggest
party, the SPD can form the government alonely, it has to
cooperate with other parties.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the veteran of the FDP, the former German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called on the SPD throw out the
Greens and form a coalition with the FDP.
</P>
<P>
Genscher said : "The SPD now has to decide: do they want a
coalition with the winners or the losers."
</P>
<P>
With which party to form a coalition the question must be
decided by Schroeder's government in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Gov't Forces Re-control Masiaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Pro-government forces
Sunday regained the control of Masiaka, a strategic town on a
highway towards the capital Freetown fell into the hands of rebels
early in the day, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The see-saw battle for the control of Masiaka, 74 kilometers
east of Freetown, was a clear indication of the tense situations
in the west African strife-torn country came after the early May
abduction of the United Nations peacekeepers by the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) led by the veteran rebel leader Foday Sankoh,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
With the logistic support of the British naval taskforce
anchored off Freetown, the Sierra Leone Army managed to drive
rebels out of Masiaka after counter-attacks and made the capital
secure from possible attacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, no causality was reported by both sides during the
chaotic events of the day, added the source.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is much more stable now," a senior British
military officer was quoted as saying in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the UN peacekeepers by the RUF rebels was
widely condemned by the international community, noting the RUF
leader Foday Sankoh should be held responsible for the insurgency
of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lome Peace Accord, signed by Sankoh and
elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in Togo's capital Lome last
year under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African
States, the rebel fighters should be disarmed and demobilized
ahead of a general election planned for February 2001.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Lazio Scoops Second Championship Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- After a week of angry protests over a
controversial refereeing decision last Sunday, Lazio fans finally
felt themselves vindicated Sunday, when their team clinched their
second championship title ever in a nail-biting end to the season'
s play.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, the Rome based soccer club, scooped the title after
thrashing Reggina 3-0 here in Rome and after rival contenders
Juventus were beaten 1-0 by Perugia.
</P>
<P>
This left Lazio with 72 points, just one ahead of Juventus,
while Milan claimed third place with 61 points.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's only other championship win was back in 1974, while
Sunday's victory followed an amazing, totally unpredictable day of
play, which saw the Juventus-Perugia match suspended for more than
an hour because of torrential rain and the Lazio-Reggina game
briefly halted due to a pitch invasion by over-enthusiastic fans.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's winning goals were scored by Simone Inzaghi and Juan
Veron in the first half and Diego Simeone in the second half,
while Perugia's championship-deciding goal was scored by
Alessandro Calori,minutes after play resumed.
</P>
<P>
Even more satisfying for Lazio supporters was the fact that it
was Juventus which last week benefited from a dubious refereeing
decision which could have allowed the rival team to walk away with
the title Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the Parma-Juventus match last Sunday, a goal by Parma,
which most observers have deemed perfectly legitimate, was
disallowed by the referee, enabling Juventus to close the game 1-0
and chalk up another three points.
</P>
<P>
If Parma's goal had been allowed, Juventus and Lazio would have
gone into the last day of play with an equal number of points.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hundreds of Lazio fans staged a protest in central
Rome against Sunday's decision which turned violent and ended in
clashes with police.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mothers March for Stricter Gun Control in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The participants gave up the traditional flowers and brunches
to spend Mother's Day in the center of the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Through personal stories of tragedy, songs, banners, posters, T-
shirts and tears, the marchers aimed to send Congress a "Mother's
Day" message: A new movement of mainstream Americans is getting
politically active, ready to battle the gun lobby and to work
against lawmakers who oppose gun control.
</P>
<P>
Huge crowds thronged to the National Mall in sight of the
Capitol, the blocks-long grass and sand terrain that has been host
to many Washington demonstrations. Though there were no official
crowd estimates, the participants filled half a dozen blocks on
the mall framed by the museums of the Smithsonian Institution,
Congress and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
While shouting "Save Our Kids", the marchers carried signs
showing handguns with red lines through them and messages
proclaiming "Freedom Gun Trauma," "Stop Gun Violence". Some
carried pictures of their dead children.
</P>
<P>
"Politicians, take heed. We are watching you. The hands that
rock the cradles rule the world," said Dawn Anna, mother of Lauren
Townsend, a student killed in the Columbine High School shootings
in Colorado State, which stunned the whole country on April 20
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The gun that killed my daughter in her classroom was one that
could be loaded by a 6-year-old, carried by a 6-year-old, and
fired by a 6-year-old," said Veronica McQueen, who was transformed
into a public figure when her daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot
and killed in her first grade classroom in Michigan State on
February 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Every day in the United States, 12 children are killed by guns,
either intentionally or accidentally.
</P>
<P>
For the gun-control rally, thousands of Mother's Day cards were
printed with the message: "Forget the flowers... forget the
chocolate... forget breakfast in bed. This Mother's Day, give us a
present that lasts: common sense gun laws."
</P>
<P>
There was room for personal notes to members of Congress, and
the cards were deposited in a letter slot beneath a model of the
Capitol Dome.
</P>
<P>
The "Million Mom March" principally wants trigger locks to
protect children and a national system that would register
handguns and license their owners. All major gun control
legislation before Congress has been stalled for a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton remained at the White House,
encouraging several hundred rally figures to surmount "the
political mountain" they had to climb. First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York, joined the
demonstration. Neither she nor the president appeared on the dais,
although their messages carried on jumbo television screens.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton did join the march for a time, but the crush of
onlookers forced her to a nearby road where she slowly made her
way to the Capitol on her own, shaking hands with well-wishers who
lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
However, pro-gun supporters gathered for a counter-rally near
the Washington Monument. The Second Amendment Sisters, a pro-gun
group that has its own moms, was sending a different message: New
controls on handguns would only give criminals the advantage.
</P>
<P>
The organization, independent of the National Rifle Association
(NRA), wants the administration to enforce the laws already in
force. The group was giving balloons to participants to separate
them from the competing demonstrators.

Also on Sunday, mothers and children gathered in about 65
cities across the country in support of greater gun control.
