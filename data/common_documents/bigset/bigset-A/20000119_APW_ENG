<HEADLINE> China To Boost Oil, Gas Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEIJING (AP) -- China National Offshore Oil Corp. plans to double its annual
crude oil and natural gas output by 2005 to 40 million metric tons, or 280
barrels, this year, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   CNOOC president Wei Liucheng said the company will invest $1.9 billion in
developing three oil fields -- Suizhong and Qinhuangao in the Bohai Sea, off
China's northeastern coast, and Weichan in the South China Sea, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wei said CNOOC plans to boost crude oil production by 20 percent a year on
average between 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   CNOOC's profits improved last year due to a decline in production costs to
$10.68 a barrel from $11 a barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   CNOOC reported annual profits of $332.9 million in 1999, up from $72.6
million in 1998. The company's core businesses -- oil and gas exploration and
development -- have been merged into a new shareholding company called CNOOC
Ltd., which has been registered in Hong Kong in anticipation of an overseas
stock listing, Wei confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The company plans to make initial public offerings in Hong Kong and New York
stock exchanges this year after deferring an IPO planned for last October.
</P>
<P>
	   CNOOC, China's sole offshore oil operator, has four production zones -- the
Beibu Gulf in the South China Sea, the Pearl River near Hong Kong, the East
China Sea and the Bohai Sea.

<HEADLINE> Suburbs Are Still a Hot Destination  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More Americans are content to stay right where they are.
When they do decide to move, though, it's usually to escape city life for the
quieter suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   According to U.S. Census data being released Wednesday, about 16 percent of
Americans packed up and changed addresses in the 12 months before March 1998,
down from 16.5 percent in the previous one-year period and from a high of 20.2
percent in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
	   As the general U.S. population grows older, more people are settling into
homes they are less likely to vacate, said Census demographer Carol Faber.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are different kinds of characteristics leading into this, but mainly
it's age and tenure. The older people get, the less likely to move away,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those aged 20-24 were most likely to move -- 34.2 percent of that group.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the actual number of people moving has increased slightly the last
decade as the U.S. population grew. In 1997-98, 42.5 million people moved,
compared to 41.5 million in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, city populations again took a big hit: in the one-year period, 5.9
million moved out of central cities, while 3.3 million moved in. Suburbs
surrounding the cities gained 6.2 million residents and lost 2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   By region, there were higher percentages of movers in the West (19.4
percent) and South (17.2 percent). The Northeast had the lowest overall rate
(11.5 percent), while the Midwest (14.7 percent) was also below the national
average.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau calculated the data by the four regions only and did not
break down the numbers state-by-state.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlene Ehle of Seattle-based Pacific Movers said she's been very busy the
last year moving people out West from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been a boom town. It used to be just Boeing out here, and now there
are more companies coming in,'' Ehle said. ``It's slowed down a little lately. I
don't get a whole lot of people moving away, but I get a lot of people moving
out here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The moving trends mimic those seen in recent population estimates, which
showed that the South and West were the country's fastest-growing regions, and
residents continue to flee cities for suburban life.
</P>
<P>
	   One trend stood out, though: more people moved from the West to the Midwest
(310,000) than from the Midwest to the West (201,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Other highlights of the report include:
</P>
<P>
	   --White people had lower overall rates of moving (14.5 percent) than blacks
or Asians and Pacific Islanders (19 percent for each). Hispanics had the highest
rate, 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --One-third of America's renters moved the last year, compared to 8.2
percent of homeowners.
</P>
<P>
	   --Most moves are relatively short-distance relocations: 27.1 million moved
within the same county, and 7.9 million moved to another county within the same
state.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Stay With Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Tuesday to ``spend the
rest of my life'' with President Clinton, whose relationship with a White House
intern led to his impeachment and a failed Senate vote last year to remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been
together -- this will be our 25th year of marriage -- and we have so much
between us and so many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I
certainly intend to spend the rest of my life with him,'' Mrs. Clinton told
Buffalo's WKBW-TV in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady, who is preparing to run for the Senate from New York,
commented after being told people were saying that ``when Bill leaves the White
House, she's going to leave him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared momentarily taken aback by the comment, but then
quickly offered her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Mrs.
Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. She usually brushes
them aside, although she has said in the past that they are a couple who still
love each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton plans to formally enter the Senate race next month, and has
said she hopes to have her husband and daughter Chelsea at her side for the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, she predicted victory in the Senate race if she and Democrats get
their message out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am absolutely confident that if we do the best we can to get the word
out about what it is at stake in this election, then ... I will be in Washington
and we will all be working together to make western New York and Erie County and
Buffalo the very best that we can be,'' she told several hundred Democrats at a
Buffalo community center.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing New York's female voters breaking evenly between Mrs.
Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her likely Senate opponent, the
first lady sat down Tuesday night for a one-hour cyberspace town hall meeting on
iVillage.com, an Internet Web site geared toward women.
</P>
<P>
	   She told the audience of about 4,000 women that the Senate election ``is
essentially a job interview and I have to do the best job I can to present
myself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- C.J. Black hit the go-ahead free throw with 1:04
left in the second overtime and No. 16 Tennessee beat No. 9 Florida 81-79
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a school-record sixth straight Southeastern Conference road victory
for the Volunteers (16-2 overall, 4-1 SEC).
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied at 79-79 after Tennessee's Jon Higgins and Florida's Brent
Wright traded 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   After Black's free throw, Jon Higgins added a free throw with 23.8 seconds
left. Florida (13-3, 2-2), needing only a basket to tie, had its last chance
fizzle when Brett Nelson missed a 3-pointer under pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Isiah Victor hit two free throws and Vincent Yarbrough connected on a
3-pointer as Tennessee grabbed a 76-72 lead in the second overtime. Florida
responded with two free throws by Matt Bonner and a jumper by Teddy Dupay with
2:50 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee took a 71-70 lead in the first overtime period after Vincent
Yarbrough hit two free throws. Donnell Harvey, who opened the overtime with a
dunk and added two free throws, hit one of two from the foul line to tie the
game 71-71 with 30 seconds remaining, forcing the second extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   Victor forced overtime with a baseline turnaround jumper with three-tenths
of second left that made it 66-66.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey scored inside with 55 seconds left, giving Florida a 66-64 lead.
Teddy Dupay had a chance to put the game out of reach with 21.6 seconds
remaining, but missed two free throws, and Harvey's subsequent basket kept the
Vols in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida scored 14 unanswered points for a 58-51 lead midway through the
second half. The sequence featured Dupay's steal and layup, and a dunk by Kenyan
Weaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Harris ended a seven-minute Tennessee scoring drought with a 3-pointer,
cutting the deficit to 58-54 with 7 1/2 minutes left. Vincent Yarbrough's
3-pointer tied it at 58-58 two minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Co. Challenges Bell Atlantic  </HEADLINE>
    By TRUDY TYNAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Mass. (AP) -- The tiny Richmond Telephone Co. has just 11
employees and 1,100 customers in an isolated town in the Berkshire mountains of
western Massachusetts. It also has enough gumption to take on giant Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The 97-year-old company this week ignited a battle of David v. Goliath
proportions pitting one of the state's oldest and smallest independent companies
against the regional phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   What does Richmond have in its slingshot? The know-how to be neighborly.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think people want the personal service a locally owned company can
provide," said Richmond President Lorinda Ackley-Mazur.
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond Tel is capitalizing on efforts by federal regulators aimed at
fostering competition for local telephone service. It will lease Bell's lines
and equipment at a discount and pass some of the savings on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Its subsidiary, Richmond NetWorx, will attempt to compete with Bell Atlantic
for local, long distance and Internet service throughout Berkshire County, a
region of 142,000 people, known for its quaint villages, skiing, classical music
and arts.
</P>
<P>
	   "The big companies are focusing on the more densely populated areas. That's
their strategy and it makes sense for them," Ackley-Mazur said. "Our expertise
is in the more rural areas. It's our niche."
</P>
<P>
	   It's hard to get more personal than the little telephone company in the
white clapboard building in Richmond, a town of fewer than 1,700 on the New York
border.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's sole installer, repairman and computer whiz -- Maurice
Garafoli -- has been working for Richmond for 21 years and knows all his
customers by their first names. He takes pride in a response time that is
measured in minutes instead of days.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our customer never hears 'tomorrow by 5 p.m.,"' Garafoli said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to leasing Bell Atlantic's lines, Richmond is also looking to
expand its own lines and equipment, Ackley-Mazur said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is opening a satellite office in Pittsfield, the biggest city in the
county, boosting its staff to 20 and has talked of perhaps tripling its customer
base.
</P>
<P>
	   Even wooing away less than 10 percent of Bell Atlantic's more than 42,000
customers in the region would mean more than quadrupling business for Richmond.
</P>
<P>
	   "Life's a chance," said Ackley-Mazur, whose father bought Richmond Tel in
1961 and invested $165,000 to replace its crank phones with dial service. She
declined to be specific, but said the company is investing about $2 million in
the expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond Tel isn't alone in taking on the big boys.
</P>
<P>
	   "More and more rural telephone companies, already geared up to serve the
most costly area in their region, are finding that they can extend their service
into neighboring communities for a fairly low additional cost," said Rex G.
Mitchell, a telecommunications analyst for the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a trend we've been seeing for the past four years in Montanna,
Washington and most of the rural states," said David Bolger, a spokesman for the
United States Telecom Association. "The smaller independents are in many ways
the most entrepreneurial."
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic contends it isn't bothered by the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great," said spokesman Michael Pequinot. "We think competition
benefits everyone. We welcome it. And we hope to be competing someday in the
long-distance market."
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond's challenge could prove a boon to Bell Atlantic, because the larger
carrier needs to demonstrate to regulators it has competition as it seeks to
enter the long-distance market in Massachusetts, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond is banking on an old fashioned yen for the personal touch -- a
single, simple bill for local and long distance calls and Internet service, and
people -- not recorded messages -- to answer customer's questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "People still do want that," said Jackie Rawson, who serves on the Richmond
Board of Selectmen and who grew up with Richmond Tel's crank telephones. That
was a time when the operator "knew where all the children were and everything
else that was going on in town."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Ackleys are very progressive, but they've kept it a company where you
can go in and talk to them on a personal basis," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, if customers have phone trouble, Ackley-Mazur says, they can stop
her or Maurice (pronounced Morris) on the street to report their problem.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's true," said Jim Weber, a metals broker, who just had Richmond Tel
install a fourth telephone line in his home office to accommodate his fax
machines, voice mail, cell phones, laptop and desktop computers. He was also one
of Richmond's first Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm an extremely demanding customer and they have never disappointed," said
Weber, who nine years ago moved to the Berkshires and work from home by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   Once, when he was burning some yard cuttings and the fire got out of
control, Weber dialed 911 on a portable telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   When the first volunteer firefighter arrived, he recalled he wasn't
surprised: It was Garafoli in the Richmond Tel truck.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal grand jury has indicted two men in connection
with a terrorist plot first uncovered when an Algerian man and others were
arrested trying to enter the United States just before New Year's, one of them
with a carload of explosives.
<P>
	   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, of Brooklyn, and Mokhtar Haouari were indicted
earlier this month for violations of the federal law against providing material
support to terrorists. The indictments were unsealed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari and Meskini are accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen
U.S. Immigration identity cards and passports of foreign countries - including
some from Canada and France. They were also indicted for using fake credit, bank
and charge cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment did not specify what items were bought by Haouari and Meskini
with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the violations - which prosecutors said took place from Oct. 1997
through December of last year - was thought to be connected to terrorist
activity in the United States, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Valiquette, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New
York, said the FBI's inquiry has ranged from Seattle to Vermont, Boston and New
York and that authorities are still trying to determine how widespread the case
is.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's really the focus of the investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested in his Brooklyn apartment after authorities connected
him to Ahmed Ressam. Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian national, was arrested at
Port Angeles, Wash., on Dec. 14 while allegedly trying to smuggle bomb-making
materials into the United States. He was en route from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini, who also went by the name Eduardo Rocha and whom authorities say
has been living in the United States illegally, was traced to Ressam through a
piece of paper the Algerian man had on him when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Roland Thau, the attorney who represented Meskini in court last week, has
said the evidence against his client is sketchy and the charges should be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam has pleaded innocent and is being held without bail in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest sparked fears of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, particularly
after a Canadian woman - Lucia Garofalo - was arrested five days later as she
tried to cross into the country at Beecher Falls, Vt. She was later linked to
Ressam through telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested Dec. 30 in New York City and accused of attempting to
meet up with Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have further connected Garofalo, Meskini and Ressam
through telephone records.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats Closing Is End of Era  </HEADLINE>
    By CHERYL WITTENAUER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) -- Growing up in St. Joe, Roger Garber didn't spend a
lot of time pondering a career.
</P>
<P>
	   When he was 8 years old, he knew he'd work at the Quaker Oats plant, which
has employed generations of workers since 1926 in this Missouri River city in
the state's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Garber's grandfather had worked there since the 1930s; his father, since the
late '40s. Both retired from the plant. Garber, 45, won't be as lucky.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago-based Quaker Oats announced Jan. 13 that it will close the
73-year-old plant as part of a companywide restructuring. As a result, more than
600 workers will be out of high-paying union jobs that were the most sought
after in this solidly blue-collar town.
</P>
<P>
	   The skilled workers, most without a college education, enjoyed good
benefits, and job security at the city's sixth-largest employer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always thought Quaker Oats was going to be there," Garber said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll ride the Titanic till it sinks and grasp onto something else. It's so
much a part of our family. It's like losing a best friend."
</P>
<P>
	   In this city of 72,000 whose modern economy was built on agribusiness and
manufacturing, Quaker Oats jobs were considered "elite," superior to messy jobs
in the meatpacking plants that flourished here until the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was the place you wanted to get on," said Ron Snyder, a manager with
25 years at the plant. "It paid well, and they treated you well. Once you got
in, you got in for life."
</P>
<P>
	   Jobs were passed from parent to child, from brother to cousin to sister, and
provided dual incomes for married couples. By most accounts, people loved their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker said the St. Joseph plant was hurt by its age and other factors.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Quaker said it would cut as many as 1,200 jobs from its cereal
manufacturing plants in the Midwest and East.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Quaker plants in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Danville, Ill.; and Manhattan,
Kan., appear to be spared. Less certain is the fate of plants in Shiremanstown,
Pa., and Peterborough, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   In St. Joseph, where the plant produced Cap'n Crunch, King Vitaman, oatmeal
and grits, Quaker and the union are negotiating a closing date and severance
package. Counselors brought in from Chicago helped workers vent emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   All of this comes during National Oatmeal Month.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're keenly aware of how much the community valued Quaker Oats," company
spokesman Mark Dollins said. "But the realities of delivering returns might be
surprising. We're about people too. We very much value the people who worked
there."
</P>
<P>
	   The rail line to the plant was laid in 1859, local historian and museum
director Gary Chilcote said. Workers walked from squat, modest homes in Sugar
Town, which sprang up around the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1880s, St. Joseph newspaperman Chris Rutt concocted in his
kitchen what would become Aunt Jemima pancake mix.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutt sold the trademark to a St. Joseph miller, who hired a former slave to
hawk the mix at the Chicago World's Fair. Quaker bought the milling plant in
1926.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheer size of the St. Joseph plant, a behemoth of red brick and white
trim, made it seem indomitable. The grand dame of the city's manufacturers was a
fortress against the city's economic blows.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, after the 1993 flood, St. Joseph lost 1,700 jobs and Montfort
Pork, Sherwood Medical, and Lee Jeans. But the city rallied and last year
created 1,500 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Expansions at Sara Lee and other businesses are creating 500 new jobs, which
will help the city absorb the Quaker job losses, said Chamber of Commerce
director Patt Lilly.

Oats workers were earning upwards of $50,000 a year because of union scale,
seniority and overtime.

better than what you could get with a college degree. Far and away, it was one

<HEADLINE> 2 Indicted in Alleged Terrorist Plot  </HEADLINE>
   By SHARON L. CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal grand jury has indicted two men in connection
with a terrorist plot uncovered when an Algerian man and others were arrested
trying to enter the United States at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, and Mokhtar Haouari were indicted earlier this
month for violations of the federal law against providing material support to
terrorists. The indictments were unsealed in U.S. District Court late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari and Meskini are accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen
U.S. immigration identity cards and passports of foreign countries -- including
some from Canada and France. They were also indicted on charges of using fake
credit, bank and charge cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment did not specify what items they bought.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the violations, which prosecutors said took place from Oct. 1997
through December, was thought to be connected to terrorist activity in the
United States, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Roland Thau, the attorney who represented Meskini in court last week, has
said the evidence against his client is sketchy and the charges should be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested after authorities connected him to Ahmed Ressam.
Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian, was arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., after he
arrived on a ferry from Canada on Dec. 14. He was allegedly trying to smuggle
bomb-making materials into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini, who also went by the name Eduardo Rocha, was traced to Ressam
through a piece of paper the Algerian man had on him when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam has pleaded innocent and is being held without bail in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest sparked fears of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, particularly
after a Canadian woman was arrested five days later as she tried to cross into
the country at Beecher Falls, Vt. She was later linked to Ressam through
telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested Dec. 30 in New York City and accused of attempting to
meet up with Ressam. No other information was released on Haouari.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Fraud Case Settled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A national chain of kidney dialysis centers has settled a
health care fraud case with the Justice Department for $500 million, The
Washington Post reported. The agreement would be the largest health care
settlement in the department's history.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement with the Massachusetts-based National Medical Care Inc.
includes a criminal fine of $101 million for wide-ranging misconduct, the Post
said in its Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Also included are civil fines, penalties and restitution for fraud related
to Medicare and other government health care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department has scheduled a news conference in Boston for
Wednesday, spokeswoman Chris Watney said, but she would not provide details or
comment on the Post report.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement includes allegations company officials used Medicare to pay
for hundreds of needless tests for patients suffering from kidney disease, a
condition that frequently requires patients to receive dialysis, according to
unidentified sources quoted by the Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also allegedly obtained referrals of lab business by
paying kickbacks, a violation of anti-kickback statutes, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Medical Care is owned by Fresenius Medicare Care AG, a German firm
that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services.

<HEADLINE> Duval Returns to Scene of the 59  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- David Duval is going to have a hard time
topping this one.
</P>
<P>
	   When the five-round Bob Hope Classic starts Wednesday on four courses, Duval
will return as defending champion to the PGA West course knowing that whatever
he shoots won't be as good as the last time he played it.
</P>
<P>
	   Unless, of course, he can manage a 58.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time to do something else," Duval said Tuesday. "Maybe go a little
lower."
</P>
<P>
	   The signature round of a career that includes 11 victories came a year ago
on a calm, cool Sunday in the desert. Duval started the final round seven
strokes out of the lead and feeling a "little spaced out" on the practice range.
</P>
<P>
	   Before long, he was in a zone that few players can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
	   By making 11 birdies and an eagle -- 12 putts that measured a total of 53
feet -- Duval became only the third player to shoot a 59.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was amazing," he said. "Each time I pulled out a club, the ball ended up
next to the hole. It didn't matter if it was a 5-iron or a sand wedge. To have a
day like that was wonderful."
</P>
<P>
	   Those kind of days are required to win the Hope Classic, sponsored by
Chrysler. Shooting a 69 usually means giving up about four shots to the field.
The worst 90-hole score in the Hope in the 1990s was a 21-under 339 by Peter
Jacobsen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval will try to become the first repeat champion since Johnny Miller in
1976. Tiger Woods is taking another week off, but the first full field in the
continental United States includes the 2000 debut of Phil Mickelson, Fred
Couples and Davis Love III, plus Tom Lehman and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
	   Arnold Palmer will be playing his first -- and possibly only -- PGA Tour
event at age 70. He has only missed one Hope Classic in its 41-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hope also features the debut of Casey Martin, who earned his tour card
in October. The PGA's appeal of a federal lawsuit that allows Martin to use a
cart could be returned any day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself," Martin said. "I'd like
to get off to a good start, but I don't know if that's going to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Martin has played only three other times in tour-sanctioned events. He tied
for 23rd in the 1998 U.S. Open, missed the cut in the Greater Hartford Open and
tied for 66th in the Quad City Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see him being something different," Duval said. "He earned his way
out here."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval earned a place in the history books with what is considered a close to
perfect round. He missed only one green in regulation, required just 23 putts
and closed out the first final-round 59 with a 5-iron to six feet for an eagle
on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergio Garcia thought he should have had a 59 last year in Europe. There
have been others who walked off with a 62 or 63 and said golf's magic number was
within range.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a big difference to say you should have done it and actually doing
it," Duval said. "They think, 'Well, I missed this one, I missed that one.' But
they don't think about chipping in for par, either. I can't go back to my 59 and
say that I missed one. I parred a par-5. Everything else went the right way."
</P>
<P>
	   The key now is for Duval to get everything going his way for an entire week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lost in the dramatic duel two weeks ago between Woods and Ernie Els in the
Mercedes Championship was a solid start by Duval. While Duval finished four
strokes out of the playoff, he was five shots clear of the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent most of his offseason getting into shape, and all it takes is one
look to see what kind of work he put in. He is leaner and stronger, thanks to a
strict diet and exercise plan he hopes will carry him through the season.
</P>
<P>
	   He is also fresh, having spent the last week on a snowboard in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval will play the next three tournaments, but probably won't be in a
tournament with Woods until Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   At this time a year ago, Duval was No. 2 in the world and almost everyone
but the IMG manager who administers the world ranking believed he should have
been No. 1. Now, Woods is so far ahead in the ranking that no one can argue.
</P>
<P>
	   But Duval doesn't believe he's unbeatable. What separates him from Woods, he
said, is "less than has been written about."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's playing very, very well," Duval said. "Now it's a matter of catching
up. I'm ready to go. Let's see what happens."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's drive to develop a national missile
defense suffered a setback Tuesday night when a prototype missile interceptor
failed to hit a mock warhead, a Pentagon official announced. "An intercept was
not achieved for reasons unknown at this time," spokesman Air Force Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner said. The mock warhead, launched from an Air Force base in
California, was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United States. The
interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein
Atoll in the Marshall Islands at 9:19 p.m. EST and headed over the Pacific

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected rightist militias dragged seven unarmed
villagers from their homes and executed them in the town plaza Tuesday, police
said, as political violence surged in Colombia. The rampage followed bombings of
electrical towers and bloody weekend clashes between guerrillas and government
troops. The fresh fighting had been expected following the expiration last week
of a temporary, year-end truce. In another attack Tuesday, two hand grenades
thrown at a small police post in the capital, Bogota, killed a girl and wounded
five people at an adjacent school, authorities said.

the Caribbean coast was washed out, preventing relief workers from reaching
eight coastal communities still recovering from the December floods. Heavy rains
last month sent an avalanche of mud, water, boulders and trees, killing up to
30,000 people by official estimate.

Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn rulings disallowing bail for Lee, 60, who
is charged with breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by moving
classified material to unsecure computers and computer tapes. The prosecution

<HEADLINE> Suspect in slaying of missing man commits suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Kevin Linder was reported missing Sunday, but for
nearly two weeks his body lay in a shallow grave just 75 yards from a road
leading into a new condominium complex.
<P>
	   Police said they were led to 22-year-old Linder's body - and his killer - by
people who witnessed his murder but were hesitant to come forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe Patrick McDaid killed 22-year-old Linder Jan. 5 in a drug
deal that had soured, and then took his own life early Tuesday as police moved
to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kevin was selling drugs. Patrick wanted them, so he killed him," police
Chief Ronald Marcotte said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McDaid called Linder to his home to purchase rock cocaine, but then
attempted to rob the convicted drug dealer of the crack and the cash, Marcotte
said. When Linder balked, McDaid allegedly shot him through the neck with a
crossbow and twice more with a handgun as the victim staggered out the door.
</P>
<P>
	   McDaid kept the body overnight in his garage and buried it the next day in a
shallow grave near the condo complex about a mile away, Marcotte said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime was pieced together with help from witnesses and friends of the
two men, including one who contacted police on Friday fearing Linder had been
killed, Marcotte said. Linder's family, who live in Enfield, did not report him
missing until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Linder's body was found Monday night, and police were carrying arrest and
search warrants for McDaid when they entered his home early Tuesday. Marcotte
said McDaid had fatally shot himself in the hour before officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said they were not surprised Tuesday to see police outside the
home where McDaid lived with his three dogs. They said their street of
one-family homes was quiet except for the boxy, brown-shingled house with a hole
cut in the side to allow the dogs, including a pit bull, access to the yard.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Molinari, who lived across the street, said people came and went at all
hours, a noisy generator had run since electricity was recently cut off and
police cars were often seen in front of the home.
</P>
<P>
	   McDaid was convicted in 1998 of possession of an automatic rifle after
police received a complaint he threatened someone. He received three years
probation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody would associate with him," Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   But several neighbors said they heard nothing unusual, either on the night
Linder was killed or early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Linder, who had been known to police since he was a 14-year-old runaway, was
free on $250,000 bond on drug selling and possession charges. He had been
scheduled to appear in court twice last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating whether others were involved in the slaying and
searching for the murder weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The state police Major Crimes Squad worked behind the closed blinds of
McDaid's home Tuesday; a bomb squad was called in as a precaution but found
nothing suspicious.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut social index rises to highest point in 9 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A report on the quality of life in Connecticut
may help lead lawmakers toward solutions for poverty, child abuse and other
social ills, state leaders said.
<P>
	   The 1999 Social State of Connecticut, an annual report on the state's
quality of life, found that the state's social health has improved to the
highest level in nine years, but child abuse, health care costs and poverty are
stunting the quality of life for many.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a road map for us. It's a road map of where we're headed and where we
really need to change our course," said House Speaker Moira K. Lyons,
D-Stamford, said Tuesday at a forum to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons and Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads, R-Kent, said they would
review the report to see what changes might be made to the state's health care
plan for poor children, called HUSKY, to get more children enrolled.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrollment figures have not kept up with expectations, and Lyons said the
state may expand the program to children's parents in an effort to improve
families' health.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Services Commissioner Pat Wilson-Coker said she would examine the
figures for racial minorities to see how programs and services might be changed
to better help minority families.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the state's social health index was 49 out of 100 - the best in
nine years, but well below the 1970s, when Connecticut scored a 72. The report
used figures from 1997, the latest year available.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a good performance. Social health has improved, but not for
everyone," said Marc Miringoff, co-author of the study and director of the
Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, first released in December, showed that the gap between the rich
and poor continued to grow - to the highest level in the state since 1970,
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Windham County, the poorest county in the study, per capita personal
income was $23,765 - less than half of the per capita income of Fairfield
County, which was $50,423 in 1997, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The report mirrored a national report released Tuesday by the Economic
Policy Institute that showed that Connecticut's rich got richer over the past 20
years, as the poorest lost ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The poorest fifth of state residents' incomes dipped below $20,000 in the
1990s to about the same levels seen in the 1970s. For the richest fifth of the
state, incomes surged past $170,000 in the 1990s, up from more than $110,000 two
decades before.
</P>
<P>
	   The picture was brighter for infants and teen-agers. The infant mortality
rate has improved from a high of 17.2 deaths per 1,000 births in 1970 to 7.2
deaths in 1997. High school dropout rates, meanwhile, have decreased to the
lowest level since 1973, and teen pregnancies leveled off, after rising in the
late 80s.
</P>
<P>
	   But child abuse has increased steeply over the last 20 years, with about 45
children out of 1,000 referred in child abuse cases in 1997, up from about 10
children per 1,000 in the 70s, the report said. Suicides among people ages 15 to
24 have risen 36 percent over the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people without health insurance increased, as the amount of
income people spent on health care decreased slightly. Violent crime was down in
Connecticut in 1997, after sharp increases n the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Things got better for workers in Connecticut in recent years, the study
showed. Unemployment is at the lowest level since 1990 and average weekly wages
for factory workers were up in 1997 for the first time in three years. The
report also noted that manufacturing jobs continue to shrink and are being
replaced by lower-paying service jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing costs remained high, but have become more affordable in 1997 than in
the late 80s.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies request for two trials for brothers accused in witness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Russell Peeler Jr., accused in the killings of
an 8-year-old murder witness and his mother, will not be tried separately from
his brother, Adrian, also charged in the slayings.
<P>
	   A judge on Tuesday denied a motion to grant a separate trial for Russell
Peeler, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Peeler had asked that his trial be severed from the trial of his
brother, Adrian Peeler, 24. Both brothers face the possibility of the death
penalty in the Jan. 7, 1999, killings of 8-year-old Leroy "B.J." Brown Jr. and
his mother, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Russell Peeler arranged for his brother, Adrian, to
kill the mother and son to silence B.J., who was expected to be the
prosecution's key witness in the 1998 slaying of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph
Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   In arguing for separate trials for the brothers, Russell Peeler's lawyer,
John Walkley, said the two have "antagonistic" defenses that should be heard
separately by two different juries.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley would not elaborate. At Walkley's request, Superior Court Judge G.
Sarsfield Ford agreed to seal from public view a memorandum containing details
on the separate defenses each of the Peeler brothers plans to use.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutor Jonathan Benedict, in arguing against separate trials, said
that Adrian Peeler plans to claim that Gary Garner, the driver of the getaway
car, did the killings. Benedict said Russell Peeler will claim "he had nothing
to do with anything."
</P>
<P>
	   "They're basically saying the same thing. They are not mutually exclusive
defenses," Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Garner was charged with conspiracy to commit murder. His arrest
came as the state's key witness in the slayings, Josephine Lee, was testifying
behind closed doors and implicating Garner in the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Lee told them Garner drove Adrian Peeler to Clarke's home and
waited as Peeler went inside and killed the mother and son. Lee said Garner then
drove Peeler to a Milford motel.
</P>
<P>
	   Garner is expected to testify against the Peeler brothers. His name appears
on the prosecution's witness list.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke, is expected to be the state's
star witness. In a plea bargain, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
murder. She told police she alerted the Peeler brothers when Clarke and her son
arrived home after grocery shopping, then knocked on Clarke's door and watched
as Adrian Peeler shot the mother and son to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense has asked that the brothers' trial be moved out of Bridgeport
because of extensive media coverage. But Judge G. Sarsfield Ford said he would
reserve decision on the request, at least until an attempt is made to pick a
jury in Bridgeport. Since jury selection began on Jan. 6, just two jurors have
been chosen.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley said after the hearing that he asked for his memo to be sealed
because it contains "sensitive information" about the defense that could make it
even more difficult to pick a jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Russell Peeler targeted B.J. Brown after he learned
the boy was going to testify against him in the killing of Snead. A year before
Snead was fatally shot in a Bridgeport barber shop, B.J. was a passenger in a
car driven by Snead that was fired on by another car. The boy later identified
the shooter as Russell Peeler.

    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Marc Savard scored two second-period goals and
Valeri Bure added his team-high 22nd as the Calgary Flames routed the Detroit
Red Wings 6-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Lindsay, Andrei Nazarov and Denis Gauthier also scored, and Fred
Brathwaite made 28 saves to help the Flames run their winning streak to four
games. Calgary has won six straight at home and is 12-1-1 in its last 14 games
at the Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's Steve Yzerman opened the scoring at 2:02 of the first period, his
22nd goal of the season and 614th of his career. He moved past Mario Lemieux for
sixth place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
	   Savard tied it at 2:24 of the second period, and Lindsay made it 2-1 at
8:52. Calgary broke it open with two power-play goals late in the period, with
Nazarov connecting with 6:03 remaining and Savard adding his second of the game
with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthier made it 5-1 at 3:49 of the third, prompting Red Wings coach Scotty
Bowman to replace goalie Chris Osgood with Ken Wregget. Osgood is 1-5-1 and has
given up 24 goals since returning from a hand injury on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure completed the scoring with 3:40 remaining. Bure, the younger brother of
Florida star Pavel Bure, had a career-high 26 goals in 80 games last season.

<HEADLINE> REPORT: Arrest expected in Moxley murder case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - More than 24 years after Martha Moxley's savage
murder, her mother finally has reason to believe that a suspect will be arrested
and, perhaps, even tried for the crime.
<P>
	   The Connecticut Post is reporting in today's editions that authorities would
release an arrest warrant today naming a suspect in the Oct. 30, 1975, killing
of the 15-year-old girl, whose body was found on her family's Greenwich estate.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper, which cited court sources it did not identify, did not name
the suspect. But Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict scheduled a 9
a.m. news conference at which he was expected to release the results of an
18-month grand jury investigation into the Moxley murder case.
</P>
<P>
	   Benedict is not bound to follow the grand jury recommendation. However,
Dorthy Moxley said she is hopeful the report will lead to a prosecution of the
suspect in her daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have prayed for this for so long," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Court officials refused to comment on the arrest warrant Tuesday. But
Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, widow the late U.S. Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, was the main focus of the 18-month grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel continues to maintain his innocence, said his lawyer, Michael
Sherman.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of the grand jury's recommendations or actions, he has been and
will continue to be innocent of any wrongdoing here," Sherman said late Tuesday.
"He's obviously very anxious about having this matter resolved, and he's looking
forward to being exonerated ..."
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Post said the warrant was based on a finding of probable
cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman said he has prepared Skakel for his possible arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they elect to do that, he will appear (in court), he will plead not
guilty, he will go to trial and he will be acquitted," Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge George Thim investigated the case in his role as a
one-man grand jury, interviewing more than 40 witnesses. Thim's sealed report
was filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the murder, Michael Skakel - the son of Rushton Skakel, Ethel
Kennedy's brother - was a 15-year-old neighbor of the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of her death, Ms. Moxley had visited the Skakel home, along
with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks. She then
left the Skakel residence, purportedly bound for home, but never made it. Her
body was found the next day under some low-hanging fir trees on her family's
estate, located across the street from the Skakel estate.
</P>
<P>
	   She had been beaten with a 6-iron and stabbed in the throat with a piece of
the club's shattered shaft, police said. The club was matched to a set owned by
the Skakel family but no one was ever arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel, and his older brother Thomas Skakel, then 17, were
looked at possible suspects, along with others, including Kenneth Littleton, a
tutor who had just moved into the Skakel house the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than two decades of dead ends, Thim was appointed as a grand
juror in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thim began calling witnesses, it quickly became clear that Michael
Skakel was the focus of the probe, even though the proceedings were held in
secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors filed court documents in which they claimed Skakel had made
"admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley" while residing at a school and
substance abuse treatment center from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors said he made the
admissions to fellow students at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine. Thim
heard testimony from former students at the school behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-month investigation ended on Dec. 10. Thim had 60 days from that date
to file his written report.

<HEADLINE> Researchers say something in the waters may be killing fish  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HAMPTON, Conn. (AP) - Studies by a University of Connecticut
biologist working with state and federal fisheries officers are indicating that
something lurking in the waters of Lake Pocotopaug is killing thousands of fish.
<P>
	   "There's no virus or bacteria or anything fungal that's causing this," said
Bill Hyatt, supervisor of the Department of Environmental Protection's inland
fisheries division. "There's no pathogen."
</P>
<P>
	   Conclusions by UConn pathobiologist Richard French increase the chances that
fish are dying because of something in the water, Hyatt said.
</P>
<P>
	   French and his team, along with officers from the state DEP and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, have been trying for more than two weeks to determine
the cause of a sudden and unprecedented fish kill in this popular eastern
Connecticut lake.
</P>
<P>
	   They believe something is affecting the gills of all types and sizes of
fish, causing them to die by the thousands. French and his team still have to
look at slides of internal organs of the fish, and plan to view gill tissue
under an electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, they'll see something that is doing damage to the fine gill
tissue," Hyatt said. Thus far, Hyatt said, French's test results and conclusions
coincide with those reached by the state Department of Environmental Protection
lab.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent tests taken from fish in the 510-acre lake shows that the
fish are suffering from damage and excessive mucus in the gills. As a result,
the fish, in effect, may be suffocating.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyatt said investigators have not yet found any obvious environmental
contamination in the water, but will continue looking.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers are also searching for microscopic plants and animals that could
be attacking the fish or producing chemicals that are toxic to the fish.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll be looking for clues within the organ tissue," Hyatt said. "And we'll
be looking at species of alga that are not easily observed."
</P>
<P>
	   Since recent tests have shown that fish placed in samples of the lake's
water continue to survive, there is a possibility that the fish may have been
previously contaminated, but are only now beginning to show the symptoms, Hyatt
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the gut feeling is that there is still something out there," Hyatt
said. "We saw fish dying as recently as last week."

<P>
    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber had 30 points and 10 rebounds
Tuesday night as the Sacramento Kings withstood a fourth-quarter rally to win
their sixth straight game, 104-98 over the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers continued to struggle, losing their sixth straight game and
10th in their last 11. Los Angeles is 3-18 on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by 17 points early in the fourth quarter, the Clippers twice
reduced the lead to a basket, the final time when Lamar Odom's 3-pointer made it
100-98 with 31 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Williams and Webber both made two free throws in the final 30 seconds
to seal the victory, the 10th in 12 games for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Anderson had 19 points for the Kings and Vlade Divac had 10 points and
11 rebounds. Williams added eight points and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor scored 22 points for Los Angeles and Odom had 19 points and
14 rebounds. Michael Olowokandi added 14 points and 15 rebounds before fouling
out in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Barry halted the Clippers' 17-2 run in the fourth quarter, hitting a
3-pointer to give Sacramento a five-point lead. Webber followed with a basket
from short range and Barry added two free throws, putting the Kings ahead 98-90
with 3:23 left.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Kings opened the third quarter with a jumper from Predrag
Stojakovic, the Clippers quickly reduced the 17-point deficit. Eric Murdock
scored the final seven points of the run, cutting it to 91-89 with 5:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite sloppy play early in the third quarter, the Kings later had an 11-2
run, taking an 83-63 lead on Anderson's 3-pointer with 3:05 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson scored 10 third-quarter points, making all four of his shots,
including two 3-pointers. Webber added nine points as the Kings took an 87-72
lead into the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 16 points and six rebounds, helping the Kings take a 57-47 lead
into halftime.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Wages Diplomatic Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- On Jan. 1, North Korea forged diplomatic ties
with Italy. On Jan. 22, negotiators from the communist country will meet U.S.
envoys in Berlin. In February, Australia plans to send a delegation to Pyongyang
for the first time since suspending relations in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, widely viewed as a reclusive nation with a taste for terrorism,
is engaging in more diplomacy than it has in years. For now, though, many
observers doubt the maneuvering augurs a significant shift in policy toward the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
	   The central dilemma persists: North Korea is so impoverished that it
desperately needs to court foreign governments for hard cash and humanitarian
aid. But if it opens its doors to foreigners, the totalitarian regime risks
eroding its own authority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not prepared yet to open up for a real discussion with the outside
world beyond its propaganda,'' Dr. Claus Vollers, Germany's ambassador in Seoul,
said in written responses to questions from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The daily barrage of vitriol that North Korea flings at its triumvirate of
perceived enemies -- Japan, South Korea and the United States -- is as much a
domestic policy tool as a foreign one.
</P>
<P>
	   The rhetoric boosts the regime by feeding deep-rooted suspicion among its 22
million people toward the world, a tactic made feasible by Pyongyang's clamp on
independent sources of information.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has shown a willingness to
accommodate. In September, Washington lifted some U.S. sanctions against North
Korea. In exchange, Pyongyang agreed to halt missile programs as long as
bilateral talks continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan and North Korea are expected to resume talks soon on establishing
ties. They have never had diplomatic relations, and talks broke off in 1992 over
allegations that North Korean agents kidnapped Japanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy became the sixth European country to establish ties with North Korea,
after Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Denmark and Austria. Rome's ambassador in
Beijing will double as its envoy to Pyongyang and will still live in China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a policy that we have pursued with Iran, with Iraq, with Algeria.
Some countries are problematic. We believe that even with these countries,
dialogue is necessary,'' said Carlo Trezza, Italy's ambassador in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the West should be tougher on North Korea, arguing that its
motives for talking are to cadge handouts from wealthy nations, buy time to
build up its large military and, simply, to vent its wrath as a lonely Cold
War-era holdout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The North Koreans have not in fact evidenced any indication of reform or
change in their attitudes, and we are simply enriching the regime,'' said Chuck
Downs, author of the book, ``Over the Line: North Korea's Negotiating
Strategy.''
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea lets in some cash-bearing South Korean companies, but has
rebuffed overtures from the South Korean government, ridiculing it as a U.S.
stooge. It contemptuously dismissed a recent proposal by South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung to form a joint economic council.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Soon-young, who lost his job as South Korea's foreign minister in a
Cabinet reshuffle Thursday, speculated last month that unification -- the stated
goal of both Koreas -- could take a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korean officials made 222 visits abroad last year, compared to 134 in
1998 and 99 in 1997, according to South Korea's main spy agency, the National
Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's diplomats were protagonists in the Cold War and once key
players in the Non-Aligned Movement, the bloc of developing nations, but their
pool of allies evaporated after the fall of communism a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Beset by food shortages and a lack of cash, Pyongyang has closed 17
diplomatic missions, including eight in Africa, over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean officials, citing former North Korean diplomats who defected,
say some of the 51 missions that stayed open were forced to largely finance
themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, North Korean diplomats have been caught smuggling gold,
narcotics, ivory, pirated CDs and counterfeit U.S. dollars in and out of Japan,
Russia, Thailand and a number of African countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Western intelligence agencies believe the gambling haven of Macau, which
reverted from Portuguese to Chinese rule in December, is a center of North
Korean criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
	   In February, a North Korean diplomatic office is scheduled to open in nearby
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same month, Australian envoys are expected for talks in Pyongyang at
the invitation of the North Korean government. Australia sends aid to North
Korea, but has no immediate plans to resume full diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea and the United States have yet to resolve a host of issues,
including human rights in the communist nation, its missile programs and
inspections of nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. negotiators hope a round of talks in Berlin this month will open
the way for a visit to the United States by a high-level North Korean official.
Exchanging liaison offices with Pyongyang is another U.S. goal.

<HEADLINE> Figures in N. Korea Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   North Korea, which shuns most contacts with the outside world, has been
stepping up diplomatic activity. Here are key figures in the communist country's
foreign policy:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Kim Jong Il, 57, who took over as leader from his father, Kim Il Sung,
who died in 1994. He bolsters his authority with a personality cult and is
believed to have consolidated his control of the military, the powerful prop of
his Stalinist regime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we know is that all important decisions are made by Kim Jong Il only
and nobody else,'' said Yoon Ji-hwan, a spokesman for South Korea's foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Paek Nam Sun, 70, foreign minister. He was North Korea's representative
in contacts between the two Koreas for a scheduled leaders' summit in 1994. The
summit was canceled because of the death of North Korea's Kim Il Sung. Paek has
been a member of the Supreme People's Assembly, or the parliament, since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Kang Sok Ju, 61, first vice foreign minister. He led talks with U.S.
envoy William Perry, former defense secretary, during his visit to Pyongyang in
May 1999 to discuss improving ties. If North Korea decides to dispatch an envoy
to the United States, as Washington hopes, Kang is a likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Kim Yong Sun, 65, chairman of the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee,
which promotes cultural and economic exchanges with countries that do not share
diplomatic ties with North Korea. He is a former ambassador to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Chu Chang Jun, ambassador to China, a traditional ally of North Korea
that forged close economic ties with rival South Korea in the 1990s. Chu, who
has held the post for 11 years, has held two rare news conferences in recent
weeks to criticize U.S. and South Korean policy.
</P>
<P>
	   A retired army general, Chu once served as chief negotiator with U.N.
delegates at the Korean border village of Panmunjom.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Growers Eye Govt. Purchases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Northwest wheat farmers are worried that the federal
government may not come through on its promise to buy millions of tons of
surplus wheat.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in October that it would purchase as
much as 3.3 million tons of surplus wheat and flour. But the sale is dependent
on approval by the White House Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Following two years of depressed prices and the recent loss of two large
wheat sales to Pakistan, Northwest growers hope the promised government
purchases will boost prices for their crop.
</P>
<P>
	   The wheat would be used in international food relief programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Hammon, government relations director for the National Association of
Wheat Growers in Washington, D.C., said he expects the wheat program will be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
	   A bipartisan group of U.S. senators sent a letter to the budget office on
Friday in support of the food aid purchase, Hammon said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They sent a ... message that there is support for the program and that it
is working," he said. "Programs that get wheat out of the marketplace can only
have a positive effect."
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat farmers need a big sale.
</P>
<P>
	   "In another year of low prices and high wheat stocks, continued aid would be
a tremendous help to U.S. farmers, as well as hungry people around the world,"
said Lynn Blair, chairman of the Washington Wheat Commission and a Pasco wheat
farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   A world wheat surplus continues to depress prices, which have been near
record lows for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of wheat likely will rise when the government orders, Hammon said,
but he wouldn't speculate by how much. The big impact is the potential that the
federal purchase will spur grain market speculators to buy wheat, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That may encourage more sales and higher prices," he said.
</P>

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Some Iowa farmers worry they may have difficulty
finding conventional seed for spring planting as increased emphasis is placed on
high-tech crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies, such as Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., have said that plenty
of both kinds of seed will be available for planting.
</P>
<P>
	   But some farmers are thinking twice about genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's definitely indecision," said Tom Matya, customer operations manager
at the former DeKalb Genetics Corp., a major seed corn company now owned by
Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial concerns have dampened enthusiasm for the seeds. Crop restrictions
have cut U.S. exports, worrying some of this country's producers about
marketability.
</P>
<P>
	   Many farmers also doubt the crops can generate enough additional income to
offset the higher-priced high-tech seed used to produce them.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Floss, chief executive officer of the Iowa Corn Growers Association,
believes plenty of the new class of seeds will be available while supplies of
conventional seed products will be limited.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically engineered corn accounted for about one-third of U.S. corn
acreage in 1999, while biotech-based soybeans were planted on about half of the
country's soybean acreage.
</P>
<P>
	   The seed industry had expected more than half the U.S. corn acreage to be
planted with biotech hybrids within the next few years.

    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Marc Savard scored two second-period goals and
Valeri Bure added his team-high 22nd as the Calgary Flames routed the Detroit
Red Wings 6-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Lindsay, Andrei Nazarov and Denis Gauthier also scored, and Fred
Brathwaite made 28 saves to help the Flames run their winning streak to four
games. Calgary has won six straight at home and is 12-1-1 in its last 14 games
at the Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's Steve Yzerman opened the scoring at 2:02 of the first period, his
22nd goal of the season and 614th of his career. He moved past Mario Lemieux for
sixth place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
	   Savard tied it at 2:24 of the second period, and Lindsay made it 2-1 at
8:52. Calgary broke it open with two power-play goals late in the period, with
Nazarov connecting with 6:03 remaining and Savard adding his second of the game
with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthier made it 5-1 at 3:49 of the third, prompting Red Wings coach Scotty
Bowman to replace goalie Chris Osgood with Ken Wregget. Osgood is 1-5-1 and has
given up 24 goals since returning from a hand injury on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure completed the scoring with 3:40 remaining. Bure, the younger brother of
Florida star Pavel Bure, had a career-high 26 goals in 80 games last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit is 0-3-1 in its last four games.

<HEADLINE> Life in Serbia Defies Explanation  </HEADLINE>
   By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- If anyone in Serbia should hate the United
States, it ought to be Zagorka Marinkovic.
</P>
<P>
	   Her house was obliterated when U.S. bombers blasted her neighborhood during
last year's NATO 78-day bombing campaign. The family across the street died,
along with 14 other people. Only the rubble left a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hate Americans? Oh no!'' she says, leaning forward to kiss her U.S.
visitor. ``It takes two to tango, you know. You can't have a fight without two
or three.''
</P>
<P>
	   Welcome to Serbia, where real life defies expectations -- and often
explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, this is an authoritarian state where opposition newspapers
denounce the government, where an accused war criminal appears as a television
talk show guest, where a hotel celebrated Orthodox New Year's with a salute to
the Depression-era 1930s and where twinkling red Christmas lights decorated the
Socialist Party headquarters, which was blasted during the NATO bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Examples abound of this virtual reality, the dichotomy of a country that
keeps running even though no one is really sure how. Oil is embargoed, yet
traffic jams the cities. Businesses don't pay their workers, but people swarm
cafes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty percent of the workforce is unemployed, but rush hour lasts all day
long. A combative press manages to publish despite government harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Normal life is beyond comprehension for us,'' said author Slavoljub
Djukic. ``One can adapt to suffering as well as peace. It's like an imposed
reality.''
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't even considered unusual this week when opposition politicians
flatly accused President Slobodan Milosevic's government of gunning down the
paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, known as ``Arkan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nor was Arkan, shot in the head while at the swank Intercontinental Hotel,
vilified for his past. Though his alleged underworld connections and war crimes
indictment were well known, many in Serbia coughed up a good word on his behalf,
praising Arkan's choice to take up arms in wars in Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   His fighting unit, the Tigers, earned plaudits for being well-trained.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was famous for personally leading his own men even into the most
dangerous military operations,'' the independent daily Blic said. ``Extreme
discipline and obedience by members of the Tigers fascinated even Arkan's
biggest enemies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The wars accompanying the breakup of Yugoslavia have marked Serbia, a
largely rural region the size of Maine. Scarred by a decade of international
sanctions imposed because of Milosevic's warmongering, the official economy is
in virtual collapse. The black market, however, flourishes.
</P>
<P>
	   A recession forces pensioners to stand in line at dawn to buy subsidized
milk. Tens of thousands of laborers visit soup kitchens. Former professionals
sell their old shoes in street markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition mayor of Nis, Zoran Zivkovic, estimated that as many as 70
percent of the population lives near or at the poverty line. The average family
in his city survives on about $28 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Those struggling to make ends meet don't have to look far to see it can be
worse: The region has been flooded by as many as 1 million Serb refugees from
Bosnia, Croatia and most recently, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Struggling with the influx, the government has lodged Serb refugees in
places like the Sicevo Gorge, a former holiday resort nestled against a hillside
just outside of Nis, the country's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   Water leaks through the cracked walls of the resort's cabins. A single
toilet is shared by dozens.
</P>
<P>
	   Elmije Novabrda, a cleaning lady from Kosovo, lives in one cabin with her
husband and six children. Cradling her six-week old baby, she numbly tried to
explain how her life had fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My children were so healthy. They had cheeks like apples. Now they are
always sick,'' she said. ``Now we have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   People struggling with daily survival are too exhausted to worry about the
future, much less efforts to oust Milosevic, opposition leaders say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Aside from those who actually lost family in the bombing, many have
forgotten the war,'' Zivkovic said. ``They have other problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   The country has made modest efforts to rebuild, including the construction
work in Aleksinac, 125 miles south of the capital, Belgrade. Milosevic himself
cut the ribbon at the grand opening there of a rebuilt apartment building,
painted in ``Miami Vice''-like hues of peach and green.
</P>
<P>
	   He also visited Mrs. Marinkovic's block, though she didn't speak to him
directly. The government has given her help to rebuild and, given the
circumstances, she says she feels blessed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God saved us,'' she said. ``We were lucky.''

<HEADLINE> Mandela Focuses on Burundi Civil War  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Nelson Mandela is bringing Burundi's civil war to the
United Nations' spotlight as part of a new effort to revive peace talks and end
a conflict that has left more than 200,000 people dead and tens of thousands in
dire humanitarian straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela is the featured speaker at an open meeting today of the Security
Council, which is expected to adopt a resolution condemning a recent surge of
violence in the small Central African nation that threatens to explode.
</P>
<P>
	   Burundi's civil war has been raging for six years, but it has not received
the international attention of other conflicts -- even those in Africa. Donor
nations have provided only about 17 percent of the $83.6 million requested last
year by U.N. agencies to provide basic humanitarian aid to Burundians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela, the former South African president, was appointed by African
leaders in December to mediate Burundi's stalled peace talks and use his
diplomatic skills, widely respected on the continent and elsewhere, to try to
bring an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the current council president, invited
Mandela to appear before ambassadors in today's session to highlight the
volatile situation in the country and give impetus to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first foray this weekend into the troubled peace process, the
anti-apartheid champion upbraided negotiators for having stood by and dawdled
while people were being killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The daily slaughter of men, women and children is an indictment of every
one of you,'' Mandela told regional leaders Sunday in Arusha, Tanzania, the site
of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting between Burundi's Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has
killed more than 200,000 people since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of Burundi's 6.5 million people are Hutu, but Tutsis have
dominated the government, the military and the economy since independence from
Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior U.N. officials told reporters last week that, if unchecked, the
fighting -- which has been on the increase in recent months -- could slide
Burundi back into an era of large-scale killings seen in the country the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to fears about the increase in violence in the capital,
Bujumbura, Burundi's army has forced more than 320,000 people, mainly Hutu
civilians, into 53 ``regroupment'' camps. The government hopes to clear the
countryside of all but the Hutu insurgents, which it can then pursue freely.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations and human rights organizations have condemned the policy,
which U.N. officials say clearly violates international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
	   The people herded into the camps are living in nearly inhumane conditions,
with aid agencies only able to reach a fraction of the settlements, one senior
official said. Malnutrition is rising and the death rate is ``unacceptably
high,'' the official said, speaking to a press conference on condition he not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected to address the issue in his
remarks to the council, which is holding the open meeting as part of its
month-long focus on Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Burundi's U.N. ambassador, Marc Nteturuye, disputed the U.N. claims, telling
a press conference that security had improved dramatically since the regroupment
camps were established in October and claiming humanitarian access to the camps
wasn't restricted.

<HEADLINE> Kings 5, Sabres 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ziggy Palffy had two goals and Luc Robitaille scored
twice on power plays as the Los Angeles Kings ended a three-game losing streak
with a 5-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Chartrand also scored for the Kings, who chased goalie Martin Biron to
the bench with three goals on 14 shots. The rookie had shutouts in two of his
previous three outings, including a scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings won for only the third time in 14 games (3-10-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Michal Grosek, Geoff Sanderson and rookie Maxim Afinogenov scored for the
Sabres, who fell four games under .500 after reaching the Stanley Cup finals
last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Both of Palffy's goals came with the teams skating four-on-four, after the
Kings had managed only one four-on-four goal during their first 43 games. On the
first one, Palffy beat Biron between the pads at 4:26 of the first period on a
breakaway to open the scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smolinski sent a long lead pass into the neutral zone that found
Palffy a couple of strides ahead of Sanderson and defenseman Jason Wooley. The
goal came about two minutes after Kings goalie Jamie Storr stopped Afinogenov on
a breakaway for one of his 23 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Palffy's second of the game capped a three-goal second period by the Kings
and increased their margin to 5-2 with four minutes left in the period. He beat
Dwayne Roloson high to the glove side from close range after getting the puck in
the slot from Rob Blake. It was the 16th goal for Palffy, who has been hampered
with a strained lower back since early December.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille's first goal gave the Kings a 2-0 lead three minutes before the
first intermission, while Brian Holzinger was serving an interference penalty.
Garry Galley's centering pass from the left circle bounced off Smolinski's stick
and Robitaille batted the fluttering puck past Biron with a backhanded swing.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille, the highest-scoring left wing in NHL history, reached the
20-goal mark for the 13th time in 14 seasons midway through the second while
former Kings defenseman Alex Zhitnik was off for tripping Ian Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake and Galley each broke their sticks seconds apart on slap shots from
inside the blue line during the power play, but the puck slid into the slot and
Palffy shoveled the puck to Robitaille for his 536th career goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Chartrand gave the Kings a 3-0 cushion just 31 seconds into the second
period with his fifth goal, beating Biron from less than 10 feet in front after
Marko Tuomainen's centering pass hit Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener.
</P>
<P>
	   At that point, coach Lindy Ruff replaced Biron with Roloson in an effort to
shake up his team. The Sabres responded just 34 seconds later with their first
goal, as Blake failed to control a bouncing puck and Grosek beat Storr from a
sharp angle.

<HEADLINE> McCain petitions challenged in more than half of state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Arizona Sen. John McCain says he will fight attempts
to disqualify him from more than half of New York's 31 congressional districts
before the state's March 7 presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   "I am a credible candidate," McCain said Tuesday. "Everyone knows that I
have a right to be on the ballot in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   And while the state GOP Chairman is challenging McCain's petitions, New York
City mayor and possible Senate contender Rudolph Giuliani also stood up for
McCain - the George W. Bush backer chided his fellow Republicans for trying to
knock McCain off the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Buley, a lawyer working at the direction of state GOP Chairman
William Powers, challenged McCain's presidential petitions in 17 of the state's
31 congressional districts. The challenges claim McCain failed to obtain the
required number of signatures from party members who reside in those districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "The facts will speak for themselves," Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the challenges be upheld by the state Board of Elections next week,
and possibly by state courts thereafter, McCain could be without convention
delegate slates in more than half of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp says it will fight Buley's challenges. "We intend to defend
our petitions ... and then we'll take them on in the streets," said Staten
Island Borough President Guy Molinari, who is McCain's New York campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting the Bush camp hadn't challenged millionaire publisher Steve Forbes'
New York ballot petitions, Molinari said "that says it all. They're afraid of
McCain ... and they have good reason to be afraid of McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said there was no need to challenge Forbes because he had many more
petitions than what he needed. "It was futile to try," he said. "On their face
they were obviously good."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections will hold a hearing on the challenges to the
McCain petitions on Friday and possibly make a final decision at the board's
meeting on Tuesday. The board hopes to certify the New York primary ballot by
Jan. 31 but court challenges to anything the board does could delay the final
makeup of the primary ballot beyond that date.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must circulate petitions to qualify separate
convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in
which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari had previously conceded the McCain petitions would probably come up
short on the required number of signatures in at least five of the 31 districts,
and possibly in a sixth.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Forbes have filed petitions they claim qualify them for the primary
ballot in all 31 congressional districts. Their petitions have not been
challenged.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is the only other GOP presidential contender to attempt to qualify
for the New York ballot through the petition process.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to open up the ballot
in New York. That lawsuit will be heard at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain called the New York petition challenges "Stalinist politics" and
called on Bush to use his influence with Powers and Gov. George Pataki to get
the petition challenges dropped. Bush has refused, saying the matter is one for
New York Republicans to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said McCain didn't file petitions in the 30th Congressional District
in New York, a Buffalo-area district. The 17 challenged districts are in
addition to that.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges include the petitions filed in three congressional districts
on Long Island, four in New York City and nine in the remainder of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said his team was checking only whether those signing and distributing
McCain petitions actually were Republicans who lived in the specific
congressional districts where the petitions were being circulated.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said the anti-McCain forces were not relying on more technical aspects
of the state's ballot-access rules to challenge the McCain petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could have massacred these things," Buley said. "We were very
restrained."
</P>
<P>
	   Powers has accused McCain of hypocrisy, noting that he used Arizona's ballot
access rules to successfully keep a possible Senatorial primary opponent off the
primary ballot there in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani rebuked New York's Republican State Committee Tuesday over the
McCain issue, risking a new rift with party leaders he had otherwise been
courting in his expected run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had long opposed efforts to use the ballot laws to fend off
insurgents.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she plans to spend rest of life with husband  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The nation's most famous "commuter marriage" couple
plans to stay married, Hillary Rodham Clinton says.
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said she planned to "spend the rest of my life"
with Bill Clinton, the president whose affair with a White House intern led to
his impeachment and a failed vote in the Senate last year to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been together
- this will be our 25th year of marriage - and we have so much between us and so
many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I certainly intend
to spend the rest of my life with him," Mrs. Clinton told Buffalo's WKBW-TV in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady, who is preparing to run for the Senate from New York and
recently moved into a $1.7 million home the Clintons have purchased in suburban
Westchester County, made the remark after being told that people were saying
that "when Bill leaves the White House, she's going to leave him."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared taken aback, but then quickly offered her thoughts on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview came just minutes after Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to face
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race, picked up the
endorsement of the Erie County Democratic Committee during a meeting at a
community center in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to several hundred Democrats who turned out to offer their
support, Mrs. Clinton predicted victory in the Senate race, if she and Democrats
could get their message out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am absolutely confident that if we do the best we can to get the word out
about what it is at stake in this election, then ... I will be in Washington and
we will all be working together to make western New York and Erie County and
Buffalo the very best that we can be," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also told the Democrats that "this will be a very exciting
campaign. It's going to certainly draw a lot of attention and they'll be a lot
of people interested in this race who are from all over the country and even the
world."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has said she plans to formally enter the Senate race early next
month, and plans to have President Clinton and daughter Chelsea at her side for
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the public disclosure of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
Mrs. Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. Usually she
has brushed them aside, although she has said in the past that they still love
each other. Last summer, during a visit to Jamestown just after her interview
with Talk magazine had been made public in which she discussed her marriage,
Mrs. Clinton had said she was done talking about the subject. She had avoided it
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing New York's female voters breaking evenly between Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani, the first lady sat down Tuesday night to do a one-hour
cyberspace town hall meeting on iVillage.com, an Internet website geared toward
women.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Mrs. Clinton plans several campaign stops throughout the Buffalo
area.

<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A group of county and municipal officials say their
bridges and roads are crucial aspects of New York's transportation system, and
as such the state should pay for the maintenance costs.
<P>
	   The government representatives said Tuesday that better maintaining the
local roads and bridges - traditionally the chief responsibility of local
taxpayers in New York - would be a sound investment for the state. They also
estimated that it would cost about $9 billion to get local roads and bridges in
good repair.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reliability and safety of our local roads and bridges is essential to
the state's overall economic well-being," said Frank Dolan, president of the
state County Highway Superintendents Association. "Investing in our local
infrastructure is good public policy and will lead to a stronger economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Dolan's group made an accounting of local road and bridge maintenance costs
and concluded that some $9 billion would be needed to get them in good repair.
It said $4 billion is needed by New York City, $2 billion by counties, $2
billion by towns and $1 billion by cities and villages to maintain the bridges
and roads in their respective jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, local governments maintain about 95,000 miles of local roads and
nearly 9,000 bridges. Seventy-five percent of the cost of that work is borne by
local taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Farrell, head of the state Conference of Mayors, said cities in
particular have faced a decade of tough fiscal times. Cities as a whole kept the
increases in their budgets to under the rate of inflation during the 1990s, in
many cases by deferring maintenance on their roads and bridges, according to
Farrell.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the state does not come forward, we are not going to be able to look to
the property taxes to meet these needs," Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state makes about $2 billion a year from highway use taxes but returns
only about 4 percent of that money to localities for bridge and road work, the
local officials said. It is time to consider the local bridges and roads as an
integral part of the state's transportation network and for the state to fund
them accordingly, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Local roads have an impact beyond the boundaries of any one municipality,"
Farrell said. "Local roads serve as feeder roads to all the state's expressways.
All the superhighways are serviced by local roads."
</P>
<P>
	   The local officials also complained about Gov. George Pataki's proposal to
cut nearly $35 million from the $276 million Consolidated Highway Improvement
Program (CHIPS). It is the main way that the state currently helps localities
pay for local bridge and road maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said while unveiling his 2000-01 budget last week that he has no
problem using state funds to subsidize the construction of local roads and
bridges but does not favor maintaining them with state money.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Tuesday that one of the first
topics of legislative hearings on Pataki's proposed budget will be CHIPS funding
and the question of maintaining local infrastructure. He said the Legislature
has customarily restored proposed cuts in the CHIPS program.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am sure that you will see it likewise this year," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the proposal for the state to assume local bridge and highway maintenance
costs, Silver said the Assembly will "see what portion of it we can address."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Conference of Mayors and County Highway Superintendents
Association, other groups making the funding plea Tuesday were the state
Association of Counties, the Association of Towns and the Association of Town
Superintendents of Highways.

    	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - A cup of joe could have frozen into a java pop in
short order Tuesday, but that didn't keep diehards in an area with traditionally
harsh winters from seeking out sundaes.
<P>
	   The Grill 'N Chill ice cream stand in Colonie, an Albany suburb, began
serving from its outdoor window Tuesday for the first time in three weeks. And
the customers came.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite some of the coldest temperatures in the nation, many upstate New
Yorkers forged on - sometimes with unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just waited on a couple that ordered shakes," said Grill 'N Chill manager
Lauren Connally around 5 p.m., when the temperature was 4 degrees. "There's a
lot of people who just love it year-round. Our regular customers couldn't wait
until we reopened."
</P>
<P>
	   David Gross, a parking lot attendant for 20 years in downtown Syracuse
worked the evening shift Tuesday without gloves.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't feel the tips of your fingers it's so cold," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gross said it was not as bad as seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1993 we had 48 inches of snow (in one storm), and that was probably one
of the toughest," he said. "But the nice warm, sunny days in the summer make up
for it."
</P>
<P>
	   In Utica, 2,800 people lost power for about two hours Tuesday night. Niagara
Mohawk said a primary power line was completely burned out, and that usually
happens when a cold snap settles in and the power lines are overworked.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Children's Museum in Utica, a pipe broke Tuesday, spraying water on a
collection of artifacts of Oneida County's history. Damage was being assessed
Tuesday night, museum officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the rest of the Northeast, New York was locked in an arctic air mass
that plunged low temperatures into the single digits in New York City and
brought snow to the Carolinas. High winds on Monday drove temperatures to as low
as minus 50 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds diminished Tuesday but temperatures barely made it into the teens
in upstate New York as it endured another day of bitter cold. Wednesday's
forecast was for gradually rising daytime temperatures but overnight readings
that will remain in the single digits or lower until at least the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Lows Tuesday hit minus 27 in Ogdensburg, minus 12 in Utica, minus 10 in
Watertown, minus 9 in Binghamton and minus 8 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saranac Lake, the thermometer displayed minus 31 early Tuesday and
reached only 13 degrees below later, making this Adirondack village the coldest
spot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, skiers continued shussing down the nearby Whiteface Mountain. A
few cases of frostbitten toes were reported among skiers who reached the summit
of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, two youngsters testing first-hand whether it was cold enough
to freeze their tongues to metal found their experiment confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys - ages 8 and 10 - licked a light pole about 8 a.m., said Darrell
Grigg, a spokesman for Rural/Metro Medical Services. Both of their tongues
immediately froze to the pole, but the 10-year-old freed himself.
</P>
<P>
	   A paramedic poured a warmed saline solution onto the other boy's tongue to
free him.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital for observation, then released.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she plans to spend rest of life with husband  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The nation's most famous "commuter marriage" couple
plans to stay married, Hillary Rodham Clinton says.
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said she planned to "spend the rest of my life"
with Bill Clinton, the president whose affair with a White House intern led to
his impeachment and a failed vote in the Senate last year to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been together
- this will be our 25th year of marriage - and we have so much between us and so
many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I certainly intend
to spend the rest of my life with him," Mrs. Clinton told Buffalo's WKBW-TV in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady, who is preparing to run for the Senate from New York and
recently moved into a $1.7 million home the Clintons have purchased in suburban
Westchester County, made the remark after being told that people were saying
that "when Bill leaves the White House, she's going to leave him."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared taken aback, but then quickly offered her thoughts on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview came just minutes after Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to face
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race, picked up the
endorsement of the Erie County Democratic Committee during a meeting at a
community center in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to several hundred Democrats who turned out to offer their
support, Mrs. Clinton predicted victory in the Senate race, if she and Democrats
could get their message out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am absolutely confident that if we do the best we can to get the word out
about what it is at stake in this election, then ... I will be in Washington and
we will all be working together to make western New York and Erie County and
Buffalo the very best that we can be," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also told the Democrats that "this will be a very exciting
campaign. It's going to certainly draw a lot of attention and they'll be a lot
of people interested in this race who are from all over the country and even the
world."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has said she plans to formally enter the Senate race early next
month, and plans to have President Clinton and daughter Chelsea at her side for
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the public disclosure of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
Mrs. Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. Usually she
has brushed them aside, although she has said in the past that they still love
each other. Last summer, during a visit to Jamestown just after her interview
with Talk magazine had been made public in which she discussed her marriage,
Mrs. Clinton had said she was done talking about the subject. She had avoided it
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing New York's female voters breaking evenly between Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani, the first lady sat down Tuesday night to do a one-hour
cyberspace town hall meeting on iVillage.com, an Internet website geared toward
women.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Mrs. Clinton plans several campaign stops throughout the Buffalo
area.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine home delivery a phone call away, prosecutors say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Upper-class professionals in prime Manhattan
neighborhoods benefited from a cocaine gang that delivered drugs to their
doorsteps, prosecutors said as charges were brought against 10 men.
<P>
	   What was dubbed the Home Delivery Cocaine Organization operated for the last
year, making up to $11,000 a day, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case proves that cocaine distribution
and use destroys society, "especially when it becomes as easy to order as
pizza."
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Ms. White, said he could not comment on
whether prosecutors were pursuing the customers of the organization. But he said
the investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 men were accused of violating federal laws against conspiracy and
narcotics distribution, according to an indictment in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization allegedly used beepers and cellular telephones for
communications with well-to-do clients whose names, telephone numbers and
addresses were kept on file.
</P>
<P>
	   The men indicted were accused of serving people in a myriad of professions,
including advertising, real estate, investments and even legal fields.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization's records showed contact information for hundreds of
customers in numerous residential buildings on the Upper East Side, on the Upper
West Side, in Chelsea and in SoHo, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization also allegedly delivered to restaurants and bars throughout
Manhattan, sometimes meeting clients on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Court papers showed that most of the deliveries were in small amounts: half
a gram for $25, 1 gram for $50 or 3 grams for $150.
</P>
<P>
	   The orders were placed by customers who beeped the organization, which then
returned the pages using cellular telephones often subscribed to in fraudulent
names, prosecutors said. Two of the telephones were being monitored by agents of
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   After an order was placed, a deliveryman posing as a livery cab driver would
meet the customer at a prearranged location, sometimes the residence of the
customer, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a wake-up call to those who believe that they can avoid arrest
through the use of livery cabs and cloned cellular phones," said Lewis Rice Jr.,
special agent in charge of the DEA's New York Division. "Using or selling drugs
is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the gun loaded."
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the defendants in the case were being held without bail. Another was
held pending a bail hearing later in the week, and a fourth was held on $500,000
bail, which his lawyer said he could not afford. Arrest warrants were issued for
the other men.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, each defendant would face a mandatory minimum of 10 years in
prison and a maximum of life in prison with no parole.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Help Increase Family Wealth  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The typical American family enjoyed a 17.6 percent rise
in wealth during the mid-1990s, reflecting a prosperous economy and a booming
stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   But a new report from the Federal Reserve showed that not all income groups
shared in the good times. The net worth of the poorest Americans, those earning
less than $25,000 annually, actually fell sharply during the period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America shows
similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Another report released Tuesday, a study by two Washington think tanks on
earnings rather than net worth, had similar findings. It said earnings rose less
than 1 percent between 1988 and 1998 for the poorest 20 percent of American
families, but for the richest 20 percent earnings jumped 15 percent. It also
found that income rose more than 10 times as much for the richest fifth of
Americans as for the poorest fifth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve study found that the median family's net worth, the
midpoint for all families, rose to $71,600 in 1998, up 17.6 percent from a
median net worth of $60,900 in 1995, after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   But families earning less than $10,000 annually saw their net worth drop by
25 percent to $3,600, and those earning $10,000 to $24,999 suffered a 20 percent
drop in net worth to $24,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Net worth represents a family's assets in such as bank accounts, stocks and
housing, minus the family's liabilities, covering such things as a home
mortgage, car loans and credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey, done every three years, is the government's most
comprehensive look at family wealth. The new statistics were based on
comprehensive interviews with 4,309 families.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17.6 percent increase from 1995 to 1998 in median net wealth compared
with a much smaller 7.8 percent rise for the three years ending in 1995 and an
actual drop of 5.3 percent in family wealth for the three years ending in 1992,
when the country was struggling to recover from the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed said ``a booming stock market accounts for a substantial part of the
rise in net worth'' in the latest measurement period.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of American families holding stock, either directly or
indirectly as part of a mutual fund or retirement account, hit an all-time high
of 48.8 percent in 1998, up from 40.4 percent in 1995 and just 31.6 percent in
1989, before the current bull market got rolling.
</P>
<P>
	   During the latest period from 1995 to 1998, the Standard and Poor's index of
500 stocks surged a remarkable 76 percent while another major asset for most
families, the value of the family home, rose by 15 percent. Both trends have
continued since the Fed survey was taken, indicating that family wealth rose
more in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The median net worth of families earning $25,000 to $49,999 rose 6.3 percent
to $60,300 from 1995 to 1998, while families earning $50,000 to $99,999 enjoyed
the biggest jump in median net worth, a 20 percent increase to $152,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Families with annual incomes above $100,000 showed basically no change in
their already sizable median net worth, which stood at $510,800 in 1998,
compared with $511,400 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But this group of the very rich enjoyed a 22.4 percent increase in their
average net worth, which climbed to $1.73 million, up from $1.41 million in
1995. The average would better capture the sizable increases in net worth for
the small number of extremely wealthy families in contrast to the midpoint
figure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey found that a family headed by someone with less than a high
school diploma continued to see a slide in net wealth, down to $20,900 in 1998,
compared with $24,000 in 1995 and $30,700 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   At the other end of the scale, families headed by someone with a college
degree enjoyed the biggest wealth gains as their median net worth has soared by
32 percent since 1995, hitting $146,400 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A Fed official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said, ``We
see a lot of indications that people with skills to sell can do quite well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at the type of assets owned by the typical family, retirement
accounts, such as 401(k) accounts, represented 27.5 percent of total financial
assets, the biggest percentage. That was followed by direct ownership of stocks,
which accounted for 22.7 percent of the median family's holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial assets, which also include such as bank checking accounts and
certificates of deposit, represented 40.6 percent of total family assets with
nonfinancial assets making up 59.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bitter cold slugs Northeast; storms dump snow on Carolinas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The bitter cold that has chilled the eastern United
States this week has been blamed for the deaths of three people in New York
City.
<P>
	   In a whiplash reversal of unseasonably warm temperatures around the nation,
New York City's temperatures hovered in the mid-teens Tuesday with the wind
chill gusting to 10 below at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The cold proved fatal for two unidentified men, who police said were
homeless. One of the men, said to be in his 40s, was found on a Brooklyn loading
dock Monday, when the temperature was 19 with a wind chill of minus 16. The
medical examiner said Tuesday he apparently had died of exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, a second man, said to be 55, was found dead in the back of a
vehicle in Queens, and a 75-year old female patient at Flushing Hospital was
found dead on the roof of the hospital wearing just a robe and slippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Freezing temperatures spell "terrifying times for the homeless," said Mary
Brosnahan, director of New York's Coalition for the Homeless. "There are a lot
of people fighting for their lives."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, 6,873 men and women stayed in homeless shelters Monday night into
Tuesday, said Mitchell Netburn, first deputy commissioner of New York City's
Department of Homeless Services. The system was still 700 beds below capacity,
Netburn added.
</P>
<P>
	   Having a home didn't always ensure warmth. The city received 3,919 calls on
Monday reporting inadequate or lack of heat; its hotline usually averages 2,000
calls per week. "Our people are very busy, and are doing their best," said
Housing Department spokeswoman Carol Abrams.
</P>
<P>
	   And around the country, people bundled up to face the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yup, we're a little cool up here," said Carolyn Stimpson, town clerk of
Enosburg Falls, in northern Vermont, where temperatures dipped to 38 below zero.
"If you're wise, you wrap yourself up."
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, winter caused school closings or delays in North Carolina,
South Carolina and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather stalled school buses, delayed trains and created hordes of
irritable workers who, for once, couldn't wait to get to the office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I could find a way to get home without going outside," said Jeanette
Cordero, who bundled up for a smoking break outside New York's Paine Webber
building. "I guess I was expecting this sooner or later. If it's just a short
time, I guess I can deal with it. Barely."
</P>
<P>
	   Maine, which contends for the title of coldest place in the contiguous
states, reported 21 below zero with no wind at Allagash and 4 below with a minus
35 wind chill factor in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Considering the wind and the temperature, it was a bone chiller," said Art
Lester from the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The eastern part of North Carolina was blasted by six inches of snow;
schools, courts and businesses were closed around the state. Its western
mountains, which usually suffer the brunt of winter storms, were largely spared.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very pretty," said state sheriff's office spokeswoman Carol Hoover.
But she added that law enforcers were kept busy pulling motorists out of
ditches.
</P>
<P>
	   "This cold is disturbing," said Ar Khan, who spends 14 hours a day running
an outdoor magazine stand near Grand Central Terminal. "It's absolutely painful,
but I have to be out here." To make matters worse, "business is very slow."

<HEADLINE> Casey Martin Ready for Hope Classic  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- The gold money clip with his name inscribed
arrived in the mail last month. It was Casey Martin's identification as a PGA
Tour member, the realization of a dream he had to pursue with only one good leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin looked at the exclusive money clip, socked it away in a drawer like a
plane ticket and took it out when it was time to play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I could say it was monumental," he said Tuesday, wearing the money
clip on his belt before heading out to practice for today's first round of the
Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   It was about as monumental as the time PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem,
who lost a courtroom battle with Martin over the use of carts, handed him his
tour card in October after Martin secured a Top 15 spot on the Nike Tour money
list.
</P>
<P>
	   While Martin was a long shot to earn a spot alongside Tiger Woods and David
Duval, he now embarks on another goal -- winning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if I will, or when or how, but I do think I have the ability
to do it," he said. "I've seen people who have won that I can play with. If they
can do, so can I."
</P>
<P>
	   While Martin has rode in the U.S. Open and two PGA Tour events in 1998,
today marks his debut as a cart-riding, card-carrying member. The Hope Classic,
sponsored by Chrysler, isn't a bad place to start.
</P>
<P>
	   For one thing, he won't be the only player in a cart.
</P>
<P>
	   They come in all varieties in the five-day Hope Classic, where the first
rounds feature one pro and three amateurs. Martin even saw a couple of carts
made by Rolls Royce. His will be a standard issue with no top, its only purpose
to carry him down the fairway to his ball.
</P>
<P>
	   And while the attention figures to follow him all year, the galleries likely
will be spread out among the four desert courses. Even with all the hoopla over
his cart, Martin might not be as appealing as the foursome of Arnold Palmer,
Rush Limbaugh, Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine and Atlanta Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
	   "My first event, I would love to tee it up and have no one really care for
awhile," said Martin, who has a disease that affects the circulation in his
right leg. "There are times when you want to work on your game and get to a
level that commands attention -- instead of having it for other reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   One way to get a lot of attention would be to shoot a 59. Just ask David
Duval.
</P>
<P>
	   The signature round in a career that already includes 11 tour victories
occurred a year ago on a calm, cool Sunday on the PGA West course. Seven strokes
out of the lead, Duval had 11 birdies and an eagle to become only the third
player to shoot a 59 in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval hasn't seen the PGA West course since. Fittingly, that's the first
course he was assigned to this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time to do something else, maybe go a little lower," he cracked.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval will try to become the first repeat champion since Johnny Miller in
1976. Tiger Woods is taking another week off, but the first full field in the
continental United States includes the 2000 debut of Phil Mickelson, Fred
Couples and Davis Love III, plus appearances by Tom Lehman and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
	   Palmer will be playing his first -- and possibly only -- PGA Tour event at
age 70. He has only missed one Hope Classic in its 41-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval earned a place in the history books with what is considered a close to
perfect round. He missed only one green in regulation, required just 23 putts
and closed out the first final-round 59 with a 5-iron to six feet for an eagle
on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergio Garcia thought he should have had a 59 last year in Europe. There
have been others who walked off with a 62 or 63 and said golf's magic number was
within range.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a big difference to say you should have done it and actually doing
it," Duval said. "They think, 'Well, I missed this one, I missed that one.' But
they don't think about chipping in for par, either. I can't go back to my 59 and
say that I missed one. I parred a par-5. Everything else went the right way."
</P>
<P>
	   At this time a year ago, Duval was No. 2 in the world and almost everyone
but the IMG manager who administers the world ranking believed he should have
been No. 1. Now, Woods is so far ahead in the ranking that no one can argue.
</P>
<P>
	   But Duval doesn't believe he's unbeatable. What separates him from Woods, he
said, is "less than has been written about."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's playing very, very well," Duval said. "Now it's a matter of catching
up. I'm ready to go. Let's see what happens."

<HEADLINE> Maradona in Cuba for Drug Treatment  </HEADLINE>
    By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Diego Maradona, a friend and admirer of Cuban president Fidel
Castro since 1987, is taking advantage of that friendship to get treatment for
drug abuse in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have faith in Cuban medicine and I know that they can cure me," the
39-year-old Argentine soccer star said Tuesday after his flight from Buenos
Aires.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona chose to be treated in Cuba because of difficulties in obtaining a
visa to the United States. He tested positive for stimulants during the 1994
World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona got off the plane briefly at a stopover in Holguin, Cuba, donning a
T-shirt with the image of revolutionary icon Ernesto "Che" Guevara, the
Argentine-born doctor who fought in the Cuban revolution and went on to become a
leader in the communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Government television videotapes also showed the soccer star showing of a
large "Che" tattoo on his upper right arm.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am also a rebel in this convulsed world," Maradona told a correspondent
for the national government network Radio Rebelde (Rebel Radio.)
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban medical authorities at Havana's airport said Maradona would be treated
in the Cuban capital. Maradona was greeted by Dr. Bernabe Ordaz, a physician who
fought in Castro's revolution more than four decades ago and is now director of
Havana's primary psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear where in Havana Maradona will be treated or for how long.
</P>
<P>
	   Early reports from government media said he would go to Havana's Psychiatric
Hospital or Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   But considering Maradona's stature and entourage, a more private setting
appeared likely. Maradona was accompanied by a team of doctors; his wife,
Claudia; his parents, Diego and Tota; and his manager, Guillermo Coppola.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government has an extensive "health tourism" program and numerous
clinics that specialize in treating foreigners for ailments ranging from drug
addiction to skin problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In brief comments to reporters, Maradona praised "the dignity of the Cuban
revolution" and said if he didn't trust Cuban medicine "I wouldn't be here."
</P>
<P>
	   For almost a week, Maradona's doctors had been trying to persuade him to
seek a drug rehabilitation program outside Argentina.
</P>
<P>
	   He was hospitalized in Uruguay two weeks ago and placed in intensive care.
He was diagnosed with high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Blood and
urine samples found cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have said Maradona's heart was working at less than half its
capacity when he was hospitalized. They have warned that continued drug use
could endanger his life.
</P>
<P>
	   An admitted addict, Maradona was suspended from the Italian League in 1991
for 15 months following a positive test for cocaine use. Soccer's governing body
suspended him in 1994 for 15 months following the positive test during the World
Cup.

<HEADLINE> First Coach, then Stadium for Jets  </HEADLINE>
    By HAL BOCK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Robert Wood Johnson IV has been approved as the
new owner of the New York Jets, he can get busy on some other matters.
</P>
<P>
	   His goals are to find a coach by the end of the week and a stadium by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The pharmaceutical company heir sounded like he meant business Tuesday after
winning approval from the NFL owners for his $635 million purchase of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson made it clear he would like Bill Parcells to return as coach of the
team. But he's not going to wait around very long for a decision from the often
enigmatic Parcells.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've met with or talked with Bill Parcells every day," Johnson said. "We
had a long meeting on Wednesday and again on Friday. He's a very unusual man who
brought a life to this team not seen since the Namath era. We have had
discussions and talked about what he wants to do. Those discussions are
continuing."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about reports that he had offered Parcells $5 million to return for
one more year, Johnson smiled thinly and said, "I don't remember making such an
offer."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jets coaching situation became complicated when Parcells resigned on
Jan. 3, only to have defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, his hand-picked
successor, turn down the job a day later, amid speculation that he had better
offers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   That raised questions about the possibility of Parcells doing a U-turn back
to the sidelines. Johnson would welcome that but after several lengthy
discussions, he admitted he didn't know how Parcells felt about that idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he doesn't want you to know, you don't know," the new owner said. "But
we have decided by the end of the week we are going to resolve this decision."
</P>
<P>
	   The stadium issue will take a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Leon Hess, disturbed with conditions at Shea Stadium, moved the Jets
to the Meadowlands in 1984 and they have shared Giants Stadium ever since. Their
current lease runs through 2008 and Johnson said he won't be renewing it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eight years from now, they will play somewhere else," the owner said. "The
Jets have never had their own stadium. Every game they've played for the last 39
years has been an away game. They have never had the home-field advantage."
</P>
<P>
	   That brought up New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's frequently mentioned
idea about constructing a stadium on the west side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at all our options," the new owner said. "We want to do
everything in our power to provide them with their own stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson talked about keeping some continuity around the team, while at the
same time "trying to stabilize what is perceived as some instability in certain
ranks."
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the continuity question was settled when Johnson said Steve Gutman
would remain as president of the franchise. Gutman handled much of the
day-to-day operation of the franchise for Hess, who died last May. "He knows
more NFL than anybody," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still to be settled is the Belichick issue. When he quit, the coach filed a
grievance asking to be released from the last three years of his contract. There
is widespread speculation that he is the No. 1 candidate for a coach-general
manager job in New England and that the Jets would demand compensation to
release him. Three years ago, the Patriots were awarded four draft choices for
allowing Parcells to join the Jets .
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would have a decision on the Belichick
matter by the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Packers Name Mike Sherman Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike Sherman was playing an NFL video game with his
son when the call came on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   His son was controlling the San Francisco 49ers. Sherman was leading the
Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Wolf was on the phone, offering Sherman the chance to be the 13th head
coach in the Packers' 81-year history. Sherman immediately accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   The video game, he told his son, would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was Wolf's unlikely selection to succeed Ray Rhodes, who was
abruptly fired after missing the playoffs in one 8-8 season. Wolf introduced
Sherman on Monday, just two days after the Packers GM said Sherman "blew my
socks off" in a Saturday interview.
</P>
<P>
	   In that interview, Sherman needed less than five hours to persuade Wolf to
risk the Packers' future on another untested coach. Sherman, a longtime college
assistant with just three years of NFL experience, spoke with Wolf for 4 1/2
hours in Wolf's office at Lambeau Field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew that for all intents and purposes, the search was over," Wolf said.
"I went home and thought about it that night. I told my wife that if I really
and truly had any guts, I would go sign Mike Sherman right on the spot."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman wasn't the first to be interviewed, but quickly made the best
impression, Wolf said. In fact, their chat reminded Wolf of a similarly
enlightening conversation eight years ago with Mike Holmgren, who took the
Packers to two Super Bowls in his first head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
	   "I realize that this is a huge responsibility and undertaking on my part,
but I look forward to continuing the legacy that has been created here," Sherman
said. "Many teams in the NFL don't have an identity. We do. I think last year,
somehow, we just forgot that a little bit."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was the Packers' tight ends coach for two seasons before following
Holmgren to Seattle, where he was offensive coordinator this season. Green Bay
was his first NFL stop after 16 seasons as a college assistant, most recently as
offensive line coach at Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his coaching career at Stamford (Conn.) High School, where he
doubled as an English teacher. That's another background he shares with
Holmgren, who was a history teacher before following his coaching dreams.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Wolf
believes the Packers have a roster that can succeed now, but Rhodes' inability
to win and his light touch on discipline prompted Wolf to change course.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman's interview might have been impressive, but the rapidly shrinking
pool of candidates undoubtedly influenced Wolf's decision. Wolf couldn't accept
the salary demands of former Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer, and St.
Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz took a hefty pay raise to stay with the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf expects Sherman to curb the lack of discipline that was Rhodes'
downfall, but Sherman also was attractive because he adheres to Holmgren's
offensive scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf believes the Packers' players -- particularly three-time MVP
quarterback Brett Favre -- will be better off staying in the same system.
</P>
<P>
	   "I consider myself an offensive coach, and I want to be very much a part of
the offense," Sherman said. "Certainly, Mike Holmgren's philosophy will be a
part of what we do right here. ... We'll tweak it a little bit here and there,
but it's pretty much that same philosophy."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman said he already has several names in mind for his staff, and both he
and Wolf said the most important hire would be at defensive coordinator. Two
names -- former Oakland coordinator Willie Shaw and former New England coach
Pete Carroll -- have already surfaced, though Sherman wouldn't confirm them.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike McCarthy, Rhodes' quarterbacks coach, was a favorite of Wolf and is
thought to have a shot at the offensive coordinator's job. Sherman said he
likely would call the plays, just as Holmgren did with him and Sherman Lewis,
his offensive coordinator for seven seasons in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman passed his time quietly during his first stay in Green Bay. Wolf
said he and Sherman never spoke at length during the two years that Sherman
coached the tight ends and supervised the scout team.
</P>
<P>
	   But Packers players who knew Sherman, particularly the tight ends who played
under him, applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman and Holmgren "are going to be kind of similar," said Tyrone Davis,
who caught seven touchdown passes during the best season of his career in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mike will bring his own aspect to it, but I think he'll bring that same
kind of discipline. Accountability is one of the biggest things we need here."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Chmura, who made the Pro Bowl during both of Sherman's seasons in Green
Bay, said: "The team will take to him well."
</P>
<P>
	   "He'll demand a lot, which he should. He won't let the little things slip,"
Chmura said.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren touted Sherman as a future coach to friends around the league,
praising his organizational skills and capacity for hard work.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mike Sherman will be missed," Holmgren said. "He was a very important part
of our staff the last three years and our early development in Seattle."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman joins Rhodes, Jon Gruden, Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron and Andy Reid
as former Holmgren's assistants in Green Bay who moved on to run their own
teams.

Stocks Help Increase Family Wealth

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The typical American family enjoyed a 17.6 percent rise
in wealth during the mid-1990s, reflecting a prosperous economy and a booming
stock market. But a new report from the Federal Reserve showed that not all
income groups shared in the good times. The net worth of the poorest Americans,
those earning less than $25,000 annually, actually fell sharply during the
period. The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America
shows similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.

<HEADLINE> Fletcher in Middle for Rams Defense  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- London calling.
</P>
<P>
	   London Fletcher, that is, who called on opposing ball-carriers more often
anyone on the St. Louis defense this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The middle linebacker led the Rams with 138 tackles, 22 more than anyone
else. And it wasn't because the defense is specifically designed for his
position to make the plays.
</P>
<P>
	   He simply is a playmaker -- inside, outside, wherever.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see where the ball is going," said Fletcher, who last week admitted he
considered himself the best middle linebacker in the NFL. "Then I get there and
make the tackle.
</P>
<P>
	   "I consider myself old-school, a throwback type of player and I like to play
like that ... tough football. That's what we'll see Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   That would be in the NFC championship game, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
and their highly regarded defense come to the Trans World Dome. The Bucs have an
All-Pro linebacker in Derrick Brooks and another well-publicized one in Hardy
Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher would like to see his defense gain the same reputation, but he
knows with the way the St. Louis offense is operating, most of the plaudits will
go to Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk and company.
</P>
<P>
	   "I definitely think our defense is underrated," Fletcher said. "There isn't
anyone you are able to focus on, but if we win the Super Bowl you can't
downgrade our defense anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, the defense is considered formidable enough, if not overpowering.
Fletcher is the middle man on a unit that includes All-Pro end Kevin Carter, who
led the league in sacks, and cornerback Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand we have a very good defense that is overshadowed by our potent
offense," said the second-year man from Division III John Carroll (Don Shula
also went there). "But I think we should be considered dominant. I see our
defense consists of a lot of playmaker capable of big plays. We scored more
touchdowns than any other defensive unit."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams had seven interception runbacks for TDs, two each by linebacker
Mike Jones and end Grant Wistrom. Jones also ran in a fumble for a score.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand they (the Bucs) are very good, but we're very good as well,"
he added. "Hey, don't overlook the St. Louis Rams' defense."
</P>
<P>
	   Plenty of people overlooked Fletcher, who was the Division III linebacker of
the year in 1998. He signed with the Rams as a free agent, and despite being
5-foot-10 -- the team listed him at 6-0 until he complained -- was a special
teams demon and the Rams' rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   He went to training camp determined to win the starting linebacker's job,
and beat out Lorenzo Styles and Charlie Clemons.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm only in the NFL two years and this has been great," said Fletcher, who
has only five years or organized football experience; he was a basketball player
before that at St. Francis (Pa.) a Division I school in hoops. He transferred
and switched to football, figuring a 5-10 point guard has little chance for an
NBA career. "To be at this point in time from where we came from, and all those
losing years here -- this city has not had a winning football team in so many
years -- is definitely a season to remember.
</P>
<P>
	   "But anything less than the Super Bowl would be unsatisfactory."

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Has Coach, Players Next  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- April Heinrichs has the job: coach of the U.S. women's
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Now she needs her players, and for that to happen, the U.S. Soccer
Federation has to come up with some more money.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I know about the players, I know they want to be on the field and I
know U.S. Soccer wants them on the field," Heinrichs said Tuesday after being
introduced as coach of the world champion U.S. women's team.
</P>
<P>
	   Her first game will be a Feb. 6 exhibition against Norway at Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., but it's not clear if the women who won the World Cup last
summer will be with her. They are boycotting in a pay dispute with the USSF,
wanting raises from $3,150 per month to $5,000 plus bonuses of $2,000 game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know it hurts all of us," said Heinrichs, captain of the U.S. team that
won the first Women's World Cup in 1991. "I know we all feel an urgency."
</P>
<P>
	   USSF executive director Hank Steinbrecher said a bargaining session is
scheduled for Monday in Los Angeles. He said the USSF believed in parity between
the money paid men and women on the U.S. national teams, but the dispute is in
the definition.
</P>
<P>
	   Because most of them now play with professional clubs, the U.S. men are kept
together only for short periods before games and tournaments. The U.S. women,
who do not have pro clubs or team contracts, are together longer, costing the
USSF more to house, feed and travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinbrecher suggested that treatment of those expenses was an issue. Also
affecting talks are payments by FIFA. During the 1998 World Cup, the USSF
received $800,000 per game from FIFA, and much of that money went to the
players. FIFA gave nothing to teams during the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. women claimed they were underpaid for their efforts last summer, and
got into a dispute with the USSF over a postchampionship tour.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were rewarded," Steinbrecher said. "Whether they were rewarded to the
amount of money they thought should be rewarded is debatable."
</P>
<P>
	   With a group of college-age players, the Americans won a four-nation
exhibition tournament last week in Australia. But Steinbrecher said fans
shouldn't be misled.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not a World Cup and that's not an Olympics," he said. "It's very
difficult from playing international friendlies to playing tournaments when gold
medals are on the line."
</P>
<P>
	   Heinrichs, who turns 36 next month, has a similar assessment, saying the
kids needed the experience of practicing with the vets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need these women to beat up and get them callused and show them the
ropes," Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
	   She was given a four-year contract to replace Tony DiCicco, who quit last
fall. An assistant coach on the U.S. team that was eliminated in the semifinals
of the 1995 Women's World Cup, she was coach of the Virginia women's team for
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
	   She is looking forward to FIFA starting a women's youth tournament. The
governing body is expected to vote in March to start a Women's Under-21
Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   She also wants a U.S. women's league. Steinbrecher said he expects one will
start within two years and says it probably will be financed by cable television
networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a women's professional league is around the corner," Heinrichs
said. "It's going to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. player Julie Foudy was looking forward to playing under Heinrichs
</P>
<P>
	   "April has been such a constant beam, source of light, for this team," Foudy
said. "She is just an incredible leader, a great motivater and a great
tactician."

<HEADLINE> Titans' George Looks to Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eddie George, who wants to be one of the NFL's best
running backs, already has put himself in some exclusive company. Now he has a
chance to be recognized among the best.
</P>
<P>
	   "My whole goal is to win championships. Do that, then recognition comes,"
the Tennessee Titans running back said.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets his chance Sunday when the Titans (15-3) play the Jacksonville
Jaguars (15-2) for the AFC championship at Alltell Stadium in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   George and the rest of the Titans have taken their first playoff berth since
1993 and run with the opportunity. George said the lack of playoff games and the
resulting exposure limited the attention he received.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was doing my thing, but no one really cared," said George, who was the
1996 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and joined Barry Sanders, Earl Campbell
and Eric Dickerson as the only backs to rush for at least 1,200 yards in each of
their first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time, Terrell Davis had a big year, and Barry Sanders had 2,000. My
1,300 every year didn't compare."
</P>
<P>
	   George is more popular than ever with fans after doing something not even
Campbell did for the franchise formerly known as the Oilers -- top 100 yards in
back-to-back playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   George ran for 106 yards in the Titans' Music City Miracle win over the
Buffalo Bills, and he provided most of the offense in their 19-16 divisional
victory over the Indianapolis Colts by picking up a franchise-record 162 yards
on 26 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous high was Campbell's 118 yards against New England in 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher has turned to George even more in the playoffs, and he
said the running back is handling the increased role.
</P>
<P>
	   "He believes he can carry this team. He showed that he's got every reason to
believe that," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   George was criticized before this season for tailing off after rushing for
1,368 yards in his rookie season. His average per carry dropped each year, with
a low of 3.7 yards in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He also heard about how he wore down in the second half of each season, when
his 100-yard games nearly disappeared. He didn't top 100 yards in any of the
final seven games of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   That changed this season. George averaged 4.1 yards a carry and rushed for
1,304 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. He also had a career-best 47
receptions for 458 yards, second only to Indianapolis' Edgerrin James in
combined yardage in the AFC, and got his third straight Pro Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
	   George said he never wore down and that people unfairly picked on him on a
team struggling to finish 8-8 in 1997 and 1998, limiting his rushing attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   How many times George carries the ball is a key for the Titans. They are
15-0 when he has at least 27 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year, we've had more success. I've had more chances to carry the ball
late in games," he said.

<HEADLINE> Castro Still Looms in U.S. Politics  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four decades after he seized power, Fidel Castro
continues to loom large in American politics as a nemesis for all seasons and to
both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Why does this aging leader of an impoverished island nation, isolated from
the rest of the hemisphere and long ago abandoned by his Moscow benefactors
still command so much attention from U.S. policy-makers?
</P>
<P>
	   A trade embargo has stood fast through nine American presidencies -- even as
the United States has moved in recent years to trade with communist-ruled China
and Vietnam and to try to forge ties with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are driven by the electoral votes coming out of the state of Florida,
and that goes unchallenged,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who has waged a
long and still-uphill battle for normalizing relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Rangel added, ``Castro is the only communist dictator in the Western
Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
	   The riveting drama over custody of Elian Gonzalez could place another
obstacle to efforts by those like Rangel and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who
want to ease the embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, 6, was rescued at sea Nov. 25 after his mother drowned trying to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered him home to his
father in Cuba. President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have supported
the INS ruling, but it is presently being challenged in federal court by the
boy's Cuban-American relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   If anything, the controversy seems to have hardened political animosity
toward Castro after a period that appeared to be moving toward a slight thaw --
with baseball team exchanges, a limited increase in travel and the easing of
restrictions on humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, one of the first things Congress will take up when it returns next week
is legislation -- both in the House and the Senate -- to automatically grant
Elian U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   That would block the INS from being able to deport him.
</P>
<P>
	   The citizenship bill has strong backing from Florida's congressional
delegation, and from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
authors of a 1996 law that tightened the embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has signed on as a cosponsor of
the bill; and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., expressed support for the
move.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only have all the Republican presidential candidates criticized the INS
ruling, but the two Democratic candidates are now agreeing that the boy's father
should come to the United States to seek Elian's custody.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we should remember and honor the fact that this child's mother
lost her life, sacrificing her life in order to try to get her child freedom,''
Vice President Al Gore said in Monday's Democratic debate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Echoed rival Bill Bradley: ``The best answer would be for his father and
Elian to be in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore earlier said the issue should be decided by the courts, while Bradley
had said he wouldn't ``second guess'' the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little disappointed in Gore and Bradley,'' said fellow Democrat
Rangel. ``It is so inconsistent for them to support wanting to keep the Cuban
kid here when it would never enter their minds to do the same for a kid from
China or North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders, farmers and tourist organizations continue to push for an
easing of the embargo that was first imposed when Dwight Eisenhower was
president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Johnstone, a former senior State Department official who now heads the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's international division, said the Elian drama ``makes
it harder for people to take an informed and rational position'' on the Cuba
trade issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are two losers out of the embargo process: the American people and
the Cuban people,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnstone said that some opening with Cuba seems inevitable, but added:
``What is not inevitable is the timing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who like many farm-state senators opposes keeping
the embargo, said that while Castro ``is no friend to freedom,'' current U.S.
policy is a relic of the past -- and has done nothing to displace Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We close our eyes to the fact that the world has changed,'' Hagel said.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Protesters' Rights Mulled  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is taking a new look at the free-speech
rights of anti-abortion demonstrators, studying what limits can be placed on
their ``sidewalk counseling'' outside clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   The case being argued today involves a Colorado law that requires protesters
to stay at least eight feet away from people entering health-care clinics,
unless someone agrees to closer contact to talk or take a leaflet.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   A state court upheld the law, a ruling lawyers for three anti-abortion
demonstrators say was a ``stunning strike'' against freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Distributing leaflets, displaying signs and orally educating, counseling
or protesting are paradigms of protected forms of expression,'' the lawyers have
told the justices in court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's lawyers have countered that the law does not limit free speech
but ``provides a patient a few arms' lengths of space between her and a hostile
mob of demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
	   Their written briefs say, ``The only avenue of communication restricted is
nose-to-nose harangues of an unwilling listener.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration and 18 states are backing Colorado. Justice
Department lawyers said the law aims to ensure safe access to health-care
facilities, adding that protesters can convey their message across an eight-foot
distance.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators are being supported by, among others, the AFL-CIO and the
American Civil Liberties Union. The AFL-CIO's brief said its member unions have
a ``vital interest'' in citizens' free-speech right to express their views on
the public streets by picketing and leafleting.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU's brief said that while protecting the right of women to seek
medical treatment is a significant goal, the law goes too far by barring speech
-- such as handing out a leaflet -- that would not obstruct someone entering or
leaving a clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court reaffirmed the right to abortion in 1992, and today's case
does not address that issue. The justices agreed last week to hear arguments in
a separate case this spring on whether states can ban a surgical procedure
opponents call ``partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court has addressed the abortion-protest issue twice before.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994 the justices upheld a 36-foot demonstration-free zone around a
Florida clinic. And in a 1997 New York case, they upheld a 15-foot buffer zone
around abortion clinic entrances.
</P>
<P>
	   But in that case they struck down a judge's order for a ``floating buffer
zone'' requiring protesters to stay 15 feet away from patients or staff members
as they entered or left the clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1993 Colorado law, affecting protests within 100 feet of clinics, was
enacted in response to what the state's lawyers called ``a history of
obstructive demonstrations'' outside abortion clinics. The state's lawyers said
protesters in effect blockaded clinics by grabbing, surrounding and yelling at
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was challenged by Leila Jeanne Hill, Audrey Himmelmann and Everitt
Simpson Jr., who said they merely advised women of alternatives to abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   After Colorado courts upheld the law, the Supreme Court in 1997 ordered them
to reconsider the case under its 1997 decision. The Colorado Supreme Court again
upheld the state law last year, saying an eight-foot buffer zone, unlike a
15-foot one, ``allows for normal conversational tones.''

<HEADLINE> Russia's New Duma Elects Speaker  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Communist was elected speaker of the Russian Parliament at
its first session Tuesday, a vote that came after about 100 opposition lawmakers
walked out of the hall in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   Gennady Seleznyov, who was speaker in the previous State Duma, or lower
house, was overwhelmingly re-elected after a speech by acting President Vladimir
Putin, who urged lawmakers to stop fighting with the presidency and start
tackling the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
	   He also used the occasion to dismiss suggestions by critics that he intended
to become a dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who speak of a dictatorship are the same who dream of one. In modern
Russia, this dream of theirs is unattainable,'' Putin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers complained that the Communists and the pro-government Unity
movement, which have the two largest factions in the new Duma, had made a
behind-the-scenes deal to support Seleznyov and forced their decision on other,
smaller factions.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov's foes, former Prime Ministers Yevgeny Primakov and Sergei
Stepashin and liberal lawmaker Viktor Pokhmelkin, withdrew their candidacies
before the vote to protest what they called ``collusion'' between the Communists
and the pro-government Unity party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have today is a real profanation,'' Primakov said. ``It's a real
collusion, which will prevent the State Duma from working effectively in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three Duma factions -- Primakov's Fatherland-All Russia, liberal Yabloko and
the Union of Right Forces -- then walked out of the session hall in protest.
Some members of the fourth faction, Regions of Russia, also joined the walkout.
But nearly 300 members of the 450-seat Duma remained in their seats for the
election.
</P>
<P>
	   After the vote, Seleznyov played down the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a week, we will have forgotten this incident already,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote followed Putin's call on lawmakers to begin constructive
cooperation with the government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The executive power is prepared for fruitful cooperation with the new
Duma,'' Putin said. ``We must put an end to the policy of confrontation and
rival ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Communists, who controlled the old Duma, had strongly pushed for
Seleznyov's re-election. The speaker is key in determining how the legislature
handles its daily business and deals with the executive.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov appeared a convenient candidate for the government because of his
past record. During his first tenure as speaker, Seleznyov had proven ready for
compromise, and was even criticized by fellow Communists as being too
pro-Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   The pro-government Unity didn't have a strong candidate of its own, and
other contenders didn't suit the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Primakov was considered likely to use his privileges as
speaker if he decided to run for president. Primakov used to lead the opinion
polls before Putin's quick ascent to nationwide fame, and would be the only
serious rival to him in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech before lawmakers, Putin promised friendship to all factions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We shall not divide the lawmakers into `ours' and `theirs,'' he said. ``We
need the widest support base in the State Duma, and this is not a political but
a pragmatic position.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's vote suggested that the government no longer viewed the Communists
as a serious threat. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov is trailing far behind
Putin in the presidential race, according to opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> Fish Kill Surfaces in Ind. Race  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY FORLITI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A massive fish kill on a polluted Indiana river
couldn't have happened at a better time for opponents of Democratic Gov. Frank
O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
	   While state and federal officials conduct a criminal investigation into the
kill, which already numbers in the hundreds of thousands, opponents of the
governor are pointing fingers at his administration as he gears up for a likely
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 85 tons of dead fish have piled up along a 50-mile stretch of the
White River since it was poisoned five weeks ago by what investigators suspect
was an industrial polishing agent used at an auto parts plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have complained that the state responded too slowly and
failed to keep the public informed. The state said it acted on the information
it had, though the Department of Environmental Management conceded the state
should have responded sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy is surfacing in Indiana's governor's race.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have accused O'Bannon's administration of bungling the state's
response to the fish kill.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 1996 campaign, O'Bannon used TV commercials to attack his GOP
opponent, former Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, over a sewage release in
the city that killed 500,000 fish in the White River.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, John Price, an Indianapolis lawyer seeking the GOP
nomination for governor, stood by dead fish on the riverbank and filmed his own
commercial, saying he wants to protect Indiana's rivers. He has said he would
have handled the fish kill better than O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Bannon accused the GOP of playing politics. During his State of the State
address last week, he proposed doubling the fines for criminal environmental
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The catfish, bass, sunfish and other species died between Anderson and
Indianapolis along the river, which supplies 60 percent of the drinking water to
800,000 people in and around Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is like someone dropped a nuclear bomb,'' said Josh McDermott, who
lives near the river. ``The fish had jumped 6 or 7 feet onto the shore. It was
like they were jumping out of the water to try and get away from whatever it
is.''
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials believe the deaths began when sodium
dimethyldithiocarbamate, or DMDK, entered Anderson's wastewater treatment plant
in mid-December and killed microbes needed to break down ammonia from raw
sewage.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, environmental officials said, the high levels of ammonia and carbon
disulfide, a byproduct of DMDK, were released into the river. Both chemicals are
dangerous to aquatic life; the state said the contamination never posed a threat
to people.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten industrial companies in Anderson filter their waste through the
treatment plant. Only one -- Guide Corp., which makes auto parts -- uses DMDK,
according to the Department of Environmental Management.
</P>
<P>
	   Exactly how the DMDK got into the water is unclear. Guide is supposed to
pretreat its waste before releasing it to the city treatment plant,
environmental officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guide has denied responsibility for the contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Guide is not responsible, it could be fined up to $50,000 for twice
refusing to allow state environmental inspectors inside its plant. On Jan. 12,
state officials obtained a search warrant and went inside to question employees
and examine records.
</P>
<P>
	   Guide spokesman Raquel Bahamonde said the company simply wants to ``ensure
it can reasonably and responsibly comply with the department's continued
requests for information without disrupting its business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guide and the state aren't the only ones under fire. The Anderson wastewater
treatment plant was criticized for allowing a week to pass before reporting
elevated levels of ammonia in discharge material.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the Indianapolis Water Co. is increasing chlorine treatment and is
drawing more of its water from other sources as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Natural Resources said it is too soon to say how long it
will take the river to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot take away in a week what took so many years for nature to place
there and expect that things will recover miraculously,'' spokesman Stephen
Sellers said.

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Misses Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to the Pentagon's push to develop a national
missile defense by 2005, a prototype missile interceptor roared into space in
search of a mock warhead but failed to hit it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor, a high-tech ``kill vehicle'' designed to destroy a missile
warhead by ramming it head-on, was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands about 20 minutes after its target -- a Minuteman intercontinental
ballistic missile -- lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor and a mock warhead aboard the Minuteman missile were
supposed to collide about 140 miles above the Pacific, but officials monitoring
the test from the Pentagon Tuesday night said there was no impact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,''
spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said the 121-pound, 55-inch long interceptor, built by Raytheon
Corp., was launched successfully from Kwajalein Atoll. ``What happened after it
got into space we do not know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said Pentagon officials would conduct an extensive review of the test
data to determine why the interceptor missed the target. He said the first
preliminary report would not be available for at least 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United
States, and a successful intercept would have provided a dramatic boost to the
Pentagon's effort to show a limited missile defense system can work.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pentagon officials had high hopes for a successful intercept, they
noted in pre-launch interviews that setbacks were to be expected in any
experimental military project, especially one as complicated as missile defense.
Depending on what went wrong, the failed intercept may not be a serious setback,
although it is certain to provide fuel for critics who say the system would be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsuccessful test also may cause consternation among congressional
Republicans who have been pushing President Clinton to go forward with a system
that could defend against attacks by countries such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to go ahead with a
national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates would cost at least $12.7
billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005, although
many officials involved in the program believe that may be too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading Republican presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, both favor deploying a national missile defense
as soon as possible. Among the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
says numerous factors -- including the affordability of such a defense and its
geopolitical ramifications -- must be considered. Bill Bradley is even less
enthusiastic, saying he believes the U.S. nuclear arsenal provides sufficient
deterrence to a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials had asserted before the test that even if the interceptor
failed to hit its target, there were other important goals for the test,
including the first test of a computerized battle management system that is
designed to communicate with the interceptor as it soars into space.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said there was no immediate word on whether these other aspects of
the test worked as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The next interceptor test is scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to reporters several hours before the test, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said that if the interceptor, called a ``kill vehicle,'' succeeded
in hitting the target warhead -- and if all of the radar, communications and
other technical aspects of the test worked correctly -- then the Pentagon would
have met its self-defined minimum standard for recommending that the system is
feasible to deploy.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial test last October resulted in a successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen protesters held a vigil outside Vandenberg Air Force Base
on Tuesday to protest the test.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuclear powers Russia and China are the most vocal opponents of a proposed
U.S. national missile defense, but it is North Korea -- economically destitute,
politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that Clinton administration
officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, like Iraq or
Iran.

<HEADLINE> McCain Chases Campaign Money  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While most presidential candidates plow Iowa's political
ground for votes in the days before the nation's first caucuses, Sen. John
McCain is digging for dollars half a continent away -- and he's unearthing more
than just Republican money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate's foremost Republican campaign finance reformer is also dredging
up the thorny issue of collecting money from individuals whose businesses are
regulated by his Senate Commerce Committee. The problem has dogged McCain for
weeks and has highlighted the hazards of crusading against a system in which he
takes part.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, says such controversy can't be
avoided because 80 percent of the nation's businesses are regulated by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The alternative is ... to not take money from anybody, which would only
lead to public financing (of campaigns), which Senator McCain is opposed to,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike every other presidential candidate, McCain has forgone Iowa for the
states where he thinks he can slow George W. Bush's $67-million momentum -- New
Hampshire on Feb. 1, South Carolina on Feb. 19 and Michigan three days later.
</P>
<P>
	   The reasons for forfeiting Iowa: McCain's opposition to federal subsidies
for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn, is unpopular with farmers; so was his
legislative campaign in 1998 to crack down on tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign dismissed McCain's campaign strategy as flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for whoever the ultimate Republican nominee is to
demonstrate the ability and the strength to run in all regions of America,''
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is sticking close to the East Coast this week with five fund-raisers
and a few other campaign events, such as his speech today in New York to the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   But he is tapping more than just Republican money, a move sure to raise
objections from conservatives who believe he compromises too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's money tour, for example, started with three events Tuesday in New
York. One host, Seagram executive Edgar Bronfman Jr., is well-known among
Democratic activists but has spread his money around. According to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group that studies campaign
finance issues, Bronfman last year gave $1,000, the legal maximum, to Democratic
presidential candidates Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, as well as to
Republicans Bush and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has cash-raising events planned this evening in Boston, and
Thursday at the Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO President John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   Another New York host, financial news service founder Michael Bloomberg,
also has contributed to Gore and Bradley, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
	   Other hosts include State Street Bank Chairman Marshall Carter of Boston and
Peter Henderson of Wall Street investors Henderson Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's money-raising ability has mirrored his rise in the polls in the
early primary states, most notably in New Hampshire where he has tied or
surpassed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., who shared a stage with Bradley in New Hampshire to push
for overhauling campaign finance laws, surged in the last three months of 1999,
raising more than $6.1 million. That's twice as much as he took in during the
preceding three months, July 1 to Sept. 30, but was still less than the
estimated $10 million that Bush raised in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain reported $13.6 million in donations for the year, plus an additional
$2 million transferred from his Senate campaign account. The Arizona senator
also expects to receive $6.2 million in federal money, bringing his year-end
total to almost $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said the campaign receives more than $20,000 a day from Internet
contributions, and his database of contributors tops 130,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, raised $67 million by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Final 1999 figures are due Jan. 31 at the Federal Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Tape of Khmer Rouge Victim Found  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS FONTAINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The tape-recorded voice of Chan Nhoung is slow
and unemotional -- an almost boring speech that nonetheless sends chills up the
spines of researchers seeking to document the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first taped confession to be discovered by genocide researchers
sifting through the mountains of new evidence surfacing amid growing hopes for a
tribunal to judge Khmer Rouge leaders accused of mass killings and deadly social
experiments.
</P>
<P>
	   Arrested for treason in 1977, the Khmer Rouge officer was jailed at the
movement's infamous S-21 detention center and forced to recite a detailed
confession peppered with stories of CIA spies, Vietnamese plots and internal
enemies bent on undermining the radical communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   After telling a life story that was likely extracted under torture, Comrade
Nhoung was taken to one of the thousands of mass graves in Cambodia and killed,
becoming one of the estimated 1.7 million victims of the Khmer Rouge's four-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape may not be much use to prosecutors, who will have access to
thousands of similar handwritten confessions. But to historians it is a
fascinating piece to the puzzle of why the Khmer Rouge brought Cambodia to its
knees, causing the deaths of nearly one person in five.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel this is coming alive, that a prisoner that was accused and killed
by this unfair court of the Khmer Rouge is coming alive and talking to me and
still telling me that what happened to him was unjust and unfair,'' says Youk
Chhang, director of the leading research group, the Documentation Center of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape, yellowed with age and labeled with typical revolutionary jargon,
was given to the Documentation Center by an anonymous source along with a stash
of documents from the Khmer Rouge regime. Youk Chhang is certain of its
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of the estimated 20,000 victims of S-21, also known as Tuol Sleng,
a former school turned into prison and torture center, Chan Nhoung confesses
improbable tales of espionage and secret subversion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was involved with the enemy. I joined the CIA with a man named Bun
Chamroeun, my contact,'' Nhoung says emotionlessly in the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   The prisoner says he attempted to flee into neighboring Vietnam. After
several nights on the run, he was arrested in a village while trying to steal
bananas.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape does not contain any sounds of torture, but the exhausted voice
suggests the terror employed by Tuol Sleng's wardens.
</P>
<P>
	   The Documentation Center knew that interrogators tape-recorded some
confessions -- often because the prisoner was illiterate. But this is the first
one discovered since the center was founded in 1995 to amass evidence that could
be used to try Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was among 150,000 pages of documents and hundreds of photographs
received by the center in the past three weeks from two sources -- anonymous
individuals who Youk Chhang says recently contacted him in hopes enough evidence
will be found to convict every surviving Khmer Rouge leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are too afraid to support (our work) publicly. They want to go
through us,'' Youk Chhang says. He said the new donations show the public
backing for the drive to try Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen is rumored to want a tribunal convened by April 17,
the 25th anniversary of the day the Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh and evacuated
the capital city's entire population to labor camps.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia and the United Nations have been seriously discussing a tribunal
since last year, after the collapse of the guerrilla war waged by the Khmer
Rouge since they lost power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   But negotiations have proceeded slowly as the two sides try to agree on a
Cambodian trial with enough U.N. involvement to ensure proper justice.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Photos Adorn Taiwan Eatery  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Customers at a Taipei eatery can dine on spicy crab
or steamed chicken legs while the emaciated, tortured faces of Nazi death camp
victims stare at them from photographs and murals on the wall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Jail'' restaurant, co-owned by Taiwanese TV star Jacky Wu, is designed
to give diners the feeling they are eating in a prison. Most of the decor -- mug
shots, prison bars, shackles -- are from traditional jail scenes.
</P>
<P>
	   But included in the mix is a wall mural based on photos of starving women
and men bunched together behind a barbed wire concentration camp fence. Another
picture in a small dining room shows victims crammed together on bunk beds,
while one man with protruding ribs stands nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   A large wooden sign over the restroom entrance reads, ``Gas Chamber,'' and
the bathrooms are decorated with open pipes and valves.
</P>
<P>
	   The restaurant's manager, Stone Cheng, said the owners and designers spent
months planning the business' interior and never thought the pictures might
offend some diners, especially members of Taipei's small Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Taiwanese just aren't that aware of this history and aren't as sensitive
about it as foreigners are,'' Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Taiwanese can describe in great detail the massacres and other
atrocities committed by Japanese troops who controlled Taiwan and parts of China
during World War II. But many are still fuzzy about what happened in Europe
during the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheng said the restaurant, which opened last month, didn't want to appear to
be supporting the Holocaust and didn't mean to offend anyone. Although the
restaurant hadn't received any complaints from customers, Cheng said the owners
might take the murals down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just wanted to have pictures of prisons from all over the world,''
Cheng said, pointing to a photo of the sign over a gate at Auschwitz reading,
``Arbeit macht frei,'' or ``Work makes you free.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hilmar Kaht, director general of the German Trade Office Taipei, said: ``We
deplore this kind of business.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If such things happened in Germany, it would have been forbidden at the
same moment,'' Kaht said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaht said he believed the restaurant owners made an innocent mistake and
selected the photos because they seemed unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Taiwanese businesses have used Nazi symbols or themes to market
athletic shoes, motorcycle helmets, cars and other items.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a trading company selling German-made electric heaters designed a
cartoon caricature of Adolf Hitler for ads in buses, store windows and subway
stations throughout Taipei.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, K.E. and Kingstone, said it decided to use Hitler to emphasize
that the heaters were made in Germany. The company removed the posters
immediately after German and Jewish residents in Taipei complained.

<HEADLINE> China PM Defends Governing Alliance  </HEADLINE>
   By JOJI SAKURAI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Facing opposition from senior members of his own party, Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi defended his controversial governing alliance today and
insisted his policies would lead his party to victory in elections later this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party governs in a coalition with the Liberal
Party and the Komeito Party, a political group that has strong ties with a
powerful Buddhist organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We faced very difficult issues last year that we overcame thanks to the
support of our members and our coalition partners the Liberal Party and the
Komeito Party,'' Obuchi told about 600 party members at the LDP's annual
convention today. ``My faith in the alliance has never wavered.''
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition gives the LDP majority backing in both houses of Parliament
and has allowed it to get swift approval for key economic and security
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, influential LDP leaders have distanced themselves from the current
administration because of the inclusion of a party with known ties to a
religious organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The public has also been angered by what it interprets as political
opportunism on the part of the LDP. Obuchi's once lofty approval ratings have
tumbled since the coalition was formed in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Former LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato, seen by many as a leading
candidate to become prime minister, has broken with the party line by publicly
urging dissolution of the coalition before elections due by October.
</P>
<P>
	   He has warned the LDP would suffer a humiliation similar to the 1998
electoral defeat that ended the administration of former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto unless the party dumps its partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Obuchi also faces other threats within his party.
</P>
<P>
	   The LDP's conservative wing is urging a slowdown in the pace of structural
reform and deregulation because they hurt small businesses -- traditionally some
of the party's strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the LDP promised today in its policy statement to tackle the
ballooning budget deficit triggered by economic revival measures. But Obuchi
insisted in his speech that priority goes to ensuring that Japan emerges from
its recession rather than bringing down debt.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also potential rifts among Obuchi's coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Parliament's new session begins Thursday, one of the main issues will
be a bill to reduce the number of seats in the legislature. The Liberal Party
has threatened to bolt the alliance if the law doesn't pass, but the Komeito has
opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite such worries, Obuchi expressed confidence that efforts to boost the
stagnant economy will allow his party to win the elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must put forward a list of superior candidates, and make all out
efforts to ensure all of our candidates get elected,'' Obuchi said. ``In order
for us to carry out our policies in the 21st century, we must win.''

<HEADLINE> Impotence Reported After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nearly 60 percent of men who've had cancerous prostates
removed are impotent 18 months after surgery, researchers reported today in
initial results from one of the largest studies ever done on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers also found that more than 8 percent of men who underwent
what is known as a radical prostatectomy had trouble controlling their bladders.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clearly a large effect on men's quality of life, and I think it's
important they go into the surgery knowing that," said Janet Stanford of the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the lead author of the
study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers are still following the men who answered the survey and are
trying to determine whether their impotence remained five years after surgery
and whether Viagra worked for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is the second
most common type of cancer found in American men, behind skin cancer. A total of
179,300 were diagnosed with the disease in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Treatments include the radical prostatectomy -- the removal of the prostate
-- and radiation. Doctors also often recommend "watchful waiting," or leaving
the cancer untreated, in elderly men who are more likely to die first from other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies found a wide range of difficulties with incontinence and
impotence a year or more after patients' prostates were removed -- 4 percent to
40 percent reported problems holding their bladders and 29 percent to 75 percent
reported trouble getting and maintaining erections.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study is considered to be one of the most comprehensive because
participants were from six states and were black, Hispanic and white. The
patients also ranged in age from 39 to 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers surveyed 1,291 men beginning in 1994 who had undergone a radical
prostatectomy within six months of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. They
found that patients who had surgery that spared one or two bundles of nerves in
the area were less likely to be impotent.
</P>
<P>
	   About 59 percent of those who had unilateral nerve-sparing procedures (in
which one of two nerve bundles can be saved) and 56 percent of those who
underwent bilteral nerve sparing (both nerve bundles remain) said they were
impotent 18 months or more after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 66 percent of those whose nerves were not spared said they could not
keep or sustain an erection. Doctors say the nerves can regenerate, but that can
take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons at two major research institutions said they have had even better
results.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. William Catalona, who performs about eight radical prostatectomies a
week at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he has
found that 86 percent of men under 50 are able to regain sexual function after
surgery in which the fewest number of nerves are damaged or disturbed. The
percentage lessens with age all the way to 42 percent for those older than 70,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the patients are young and have good erections before surgery -- and if
they are treated by a surgeon who specializes in this sort of surgery -- then
the results are excellent," said Catalona, the school's chief of urological
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Charles Brendler, head of urological surgery at the University of
Chicago Medical Center, said he has also found that younger men are more likely
to retain sexual function. But he said even doctors who specialize in the
surgery must learn new techniques to prevent post-surgery impotence.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing well getting rid of the cancer and with urinary control," he
said. But, he added, where sexual function is concerned, "We're a long way from
perfect."

<HEADLINE> Cos. Give to Nominating Conventions  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organizers seeking to pay for the glitz at the
presidential nominating conventions have increased their asking price for
donors, and several companies like AT&AMP;T and Atlantic Richfield Co. have
responded with $1 million contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the same companies already have given hundreds of thousands of
dollars to the political parties in separate contributions that will earn their
executives and lobbyists VIP golf and dinner with top Democrats and Republicans
at the conventions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're giving money because this is a prime audience for them,'' said
Larry Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
research group that studies campaign finance. ``They're trying to gain the
appreciation of the biggest assembly of important politicians in the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Potential donors are being asked to give more this time around by the host
committees raising money to cover costs at the Republican convention in
Philadelphia and the Democratic convention in Los Angeles this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   At the 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago, the top host committee donors
were called vice chairs and gave at least $100,000. The 2000 host committee in
Los Angeles now has three levels above that, led by ``primary partners'' who
contribute at least $1 million in cash, equipment or services.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic convention committee had just two million-dollar donors in
1996, Ameritech and Motorola; it already has six for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The host committee for the GOP convention refused to divulge any of its
donors. However, at least five companies told The Associated Press they have
made six- or seven-figure donations to the Philadelphia committee. For the 1996
convention in San Diego, the top contribution level for the host committee was
$100,000, with three companies -- AT&AMP;T, Philip Morris and Amway -- giving $1
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee each
will get $13.2 million in taxpayer funds to put on the conventions, and are
barred from using any private donations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the government allows cities hosting the quadrennial gatherings to raise
unlimited private funds for such things as transportation, telephones and glitzy
parties for the delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Some big givers to those efforts have major business pending before the
government officials, members of Congress and other political luminaries
attending the conventions.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlantic Richfield has a major merger pending. And AT&AMP;T, which is giving $1
million in equipment to each of the convention host committees, is seeking
federal approval to buy the cable TV company MediaOne. The phone giant also is
trying to stop the Baby Bells from getting permission to provide long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As America's leading telecommunications company, we have a long history of
supporting both conventions,'' AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen said. ``We
understand the telecommunications challenges associated with putting on an event
of this scale.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Baby Bells aren't missing a beat either.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacific Bell is a $1 million donor to the Los Angeles committee, while Bell
Atlantic is contributing to the Philadelphia committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Other major donors to both host committees include United Parcel Service,
DaimlerChrysler and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe in the political process and we think the nominating
conventions are an important part of electing our leadership in this country and
a process we want to be a part of,'' said Rick Miller, a spokesman for
Microsoft, which is fighting a government antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles host committee president Lucy McCoy said corporate donors are
motivated by civic pride, not political gain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot of corporate and other partners who appreciate the value of
bringing a national political convention to Los Angeles and are there with us as
partners in making sure that we showcase the city,'' McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers bristle at suggestions they are selling access.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not selling access to the convention. We're not selling access to
the parties,'' said David L. Cohen, co-chairman of the Philadelphia host
committee. ``Basically what we sell is a civic opportunity to promote economic
development in the Greater Philadelphia region.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political parties, however, are trumpeting the VIP benefits their
biggest donors will receive at the conventions. The best perks are reserved for
six-figure donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Big givers to the Republican House fund-raising committee will get the
chance to golf with Speaker Dennis Hastert, while major contributors to House
Democrats will break bread in Beverly Hills with Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   And those who have boosted the fortunes of Senate Republican campaigns can
dine with Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Conventions are an opportunity for the parties to show their gratitude to
donors,'' Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said.

<HEADLINE> New Computer Upgrades Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- True, a human weather forecaster using a hand-held
calculator could work out the same predictions as the National Weather Service's
costly new computer. It's just that what the IBM does in one second would take
the human 500 years.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why Weather Service Director John W. Kelly Jr. expects great things
from the agency's new machine, dedicated Tuesday and one of the two fastest
weather computers in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Five times faster than the Cray C-90 it replaces, the new 786 processor IBM
SP can make 690 billion calculations per second. By September it will be speeded
up to 2.5 trillion calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This new supercomputer puts us closer to reaching our goal of becoming
America's no surprise weather service,'' said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This gives our forecasters more sophisticated models of the atmosphere and
oceans, which act as blueprints for upcoming weather patterns,'' he said. ``On a
daily basis, we should see a 10 percent improvement in predicting temperatures,
humidity and pinpointing when, where and how much rainfall will occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new computer's debut included a warning that major East Coast cities
face the threat of snow and severe cold late this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A low pressure area developing off the Carolinas is expected to bring snow
from Washington to New England on Thursday night, followed by brutally cold
conditions on Friday and into Saturday, said Louis W. Uccellini, director of the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction in Bowie, Md., where the new
computer is located.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer, leased for $35 million until 2002, provides the basic guidance
for forecasts issued by the weather service as well as forecasts provided in
newspapers and broadcast on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Billions of pieces of information on the weather around the world are fed
into the computer continually, giving it a picture of current conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer then uses forecast models, which are complex sets of
mathematical formulas, to calculate how these conditions will probably change
over the next few minutes, hours and days. The models understand patterns of
weather movement and how one type of weather affects areas nearby. The models
are repeatedly updated with new sets of conditions and then run again.
</P>
<P>
	   The results of the models are then sent by computer to weather service
offices around the country, to universities, to private forecasting companies
and to foreign weather services for use in developing local forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   The faster the computer runs the more accurate the forecast is likely to be
and the longer period of warning meteorologists can give, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, national forecasts are able to predict the development and
movement of weather systems about the size of New Jersey two to five days in
advance, Uccellini said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the new computer, he said forecasts will be able to predict systems as
small as individual counties some six to 10 days ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
	   Uccellini said the theoretical limit on an accurate forecast is thought to
be about 14 days, and for longer periods predictions are more general.
</P>
<P>
	   The older Cray C-90 computer, in use since 1994, was destroyed in a fire
last September.

<HEADLINE> Russia Said Reliable With Putin  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia will be a more predictable and reliable country
under the presidency of Vladimir Putin, according to a top Russian government
aide who was former President Boris Yeltsin's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Dmitry Yakushkin, in the United States to assess U.S. concerns with Putin's
government, told reporters not to expect any ``hawkish declarations'' from
Putin. He also said Putin would save any harsh economic steps for after the
March 24 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin, however, said in a session Tuesday with reporters at the National
Press Club that the crisis in Chechnya would not be resolved in months, but in
years.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that Yeltsin, who resigned Dec. 31, was so irritated by
President Clinton's position on Kosovo that he sometimes avoided talking with
him. Yakushkin said relations with Putin should be better, ``much more calm,
much more pragmatic, much more workmanlike.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be a more predictable, more reliable country,'' Yakushkin said,
adding that Russians are acutely aware of the economic and political problems
that grip their nation. ``I don't see any hint of possible future
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin, a deputy to Putin chief of staff Alexander Voloshin, said Putin
will use his expected strong support in the election ``to promote difficult
economic decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Yeltsin's resignation came as a complete surprise to him, although
he now can point to signs it was coming, including speeches Yeltsin made in
which he mused over his 10 years in power. Putin recently revealed that he was
informed 10 days in advance of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin described Yeltsin as a dominant figure while in office, but
discounted rumors of continuing Yeltsin influence over the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no double center of power,'' Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin said he planned no official visits while in the United States for
Putin's government but was here to get the views of private American analysts,
journalists and others on the new Russian government.

<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower Wednesday, driven down by an
overnight decline on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 298.82 points, or 1.56
percent, to 18,897.75 at the end of the day. On Tuesday, the average closed down
240.66 points, or 1.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 105.54 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at
4 p.m. (0700 GMT) Wednesday, up 0.36 yen from late Tuesday but below its late
New York level of 105.72 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei fell during the morning on selling of major
high technology issues after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.26
points, or 1.4 percent, to 11,560.72 on Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were selling lower-priced domestic issues and biotechnology
shares, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors, even brokerage dealers, have begun to wonder which direction
they should be heading for, whether going for information technologies, high
technologies or biotechnologies," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo
Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed down 34.56 points, or 2.07 percent, to 1,631.28. The TOPIX closed
down 16.13 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar moved in a narrow range in quiet trading
ahead of a weekend meeting of finance officials from the major industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said remarks by French Finance Minister Christian Sautter on Tuesday
that Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo will discuss foreign exchange
and the promotion of economic growth helped support the dollar and euro vs. the
yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan hopes the G-7 will support its goal of subduing the yen's strength,
which authorities worry could derail the budding economic recovery by making its
exports too expensive overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was trading at 107.22 yen, up from 105.98 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was 1.7450
percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish. Its price remained 100.47.

Stocks Help Increase Family Wealth
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The typical American family enjoyed a 17.6 percent rise
in wealth during the mid-1990s, reflecting a prosperous economy and a booming
stock market. But a new report from the Federal Reserve showed that not all
income groups shared in the good times. The net worth of the poorest Americans,
those earning less than $25,000 annually, actually fell sharply during the
period. The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America
shows similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Program Targets Latinos  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- When Juan Torres told his mother he was gay at age 12, she
``flipped out'' -- a response he calls common in the Latino community where
cultural taboos about homosexuality run deep.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Being a Hispanic homosexual, it's very rare that you will meet someone who
will be open about it,'' said Torres, who is of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
	   Now 22, he is a peer adviser for the Brockton branch of the Latino Health
Institute, which will bring a message of safe sex, condom use and AIDS awareness
to cable public access channels this week and next.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcasts, in Spanish, follow a report last week from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention that showed newly diagnosed AIDS cases among
Hispanic and black gay men have surpassed the number of new cases among whites
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   While the white gay community has been confronting AIDS head-on for some two
decades, Torres contends that Latinos have been burying their heads in the sand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's getting more and more deadly and they still choose not to
understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man behind the Latino institute and the programming idea is Dr. Anibal
Sosa, a Venezuelan-born infectious disease specialist. He said cultural and
language barriers play a large role in the surge of Latino AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, there is a pool of new Latino immigrants who are less educated
and less familiar with English.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of (men) need years to go through acculturation,'' Sosa said. ``They
don't know how to navigate a system (to find) where the resources are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers also say homosexuality holds a greater stigma among minorities.
Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to identify themselves as gay
or seek AIDS prevention and treatment services.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the CDC research, minorities represented 52 percent of the
18,153 gay and bisexual men diagnosed with AIDS in 1998. About a third were
black men, while Hispanics accounted for 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, minorities represented 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute has had a weekly cable program for almost a year on Boston
Neighborhood Network, a public access television channel. Sosa said AIDS and
other health issues have been discussed before but this is the first time the
hosts are specifically addressing AIDS and gay Latino men.
</P>
<P>
	   Massachusetts has already been working to address the growing problem of
minority AIDS cases, but more needs to be done, said Jean McGuire, director of
the AIDS bureau of the Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a major epidemic among men who are gay and people of color,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, things are often better for gay Hispanic men in the United States
than they are elsewhere, Torres said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, where his mother was born, ``you cannot even talk about
it,'' Torres said. ``Here, I feel there's more help, more people are
understanding.''

<HEADLINE> Harry, Louise Pushes Uninsured Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry and Louise are back.
</P>
<P>
	   The fictional suburban husband and wife whose warnings about President
Clinton's health reform plan helped defeat the proposal in 1994 are featured in
new TV ads about helping uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ads that start today, nationally on CNN and locally in Washington,
Harry frets about an ``epidemic'' of uninsured in America and declares, ``We
can't leave working families and kids without insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Health Insurance Association of America, which sponsored
the old and new Harry and Louise ads, said there's nothing strange about the
poster couple warning about the effects of universal coverage now taking sides
with those who would benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not that different from 1993-1994,'' said Chip Kahn, the group's
president. ``We were concerned with the unintended consequence of the Clinton
plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the group's previous $17 million campaign in 1994, the couple worried
that Clinton's proposal would turn health care decisions over to government
bureaucrats, limit choice of doctors and lead to the rationing of care. The
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the ads as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue with the new ads is how to provide coverage for 44 million
Americans without health insurance. The association, representing large
insurance companies, favors a combination of expanded government programs for
low-income people and tax credits to help small businesses offer insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   It's promoting that plan as an alternative to proposals that might detract
from participation in employer-sponsored plans crucial to large insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1 million ad campaign is aimed at getting political candidates,
especially Republicans, interested in the group's proposal, a $50 billion-a-year
plan to help the uninsured by expanding existing government programs for
low-income people, giving federal vouchers to the working poor to purchase
insurance, and providing tax credits for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad ends with Louise e-mailing candidates about the group's plan, called
InsureUSA.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Republican leaders have talked about providing tax credits so
people could buy their own insurance and possibly circumvent employer-provided
insurance plans -- the main business of large insurers. The insurance group is
arguing that preserving the current system of employer-based coverage, plus
federal help for low-income people, is the best solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they are concerned about proposals for individual tax credits,''
said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy research
group. ``Their bread and butter is selling group coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kahn said that while Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley --
vying for the Democratic presidential nomination -- have both outlined plans to
provide coverage for uninsured Americans, the field of GOP candidates have said
little about the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   By hauling Harry and Louise out of retirement, the insurance industry hopes
to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get their attention,'' said Kahn. The initial campaign is
small, but the group is looking at expanding it over time.

period. The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America
shows similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.

<HEADLINE> Drama Over Boy Hardening Attitudes  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four decades after he seized power, Fidel Castro
continues to loom large in American politics as a nemesis for all seasons and to
both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Why does this aging leader of an impoverished island nation, isolated from
the rest of the hemisphere and long ago abandoned by his Moscow benefactors
still command so much attention from U.S. policy-makers?
</P>
<P>
	   A trade embargo has stood fast through nine American presidencies -- even as
the United States has moved in recent years to trade with communist-ruled China
and Vietnam and to try to forge ties with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are driven by the electoral votes coming out of the state of Florida,
and that goes unchallenged,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who has waged a
long and still-uphill battle for normalizing relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Rangel added, ``Castro is the only communist dictator in the Western
Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
	   The riveting drama over custody of Elian Gonzalez could place another
obstacle to efforts by those like Rangel and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who
want to ease the embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, 6, was rescued at sea Nov. 25 after his mother drowned trying to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered him home to his
father in Cuba. President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have supported
the INS ruling, but it is presently being challenged in federal court by the
boy's Cuban-American relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   If anything, the controversy seems to have hardened political animosity
toward Castro after a period that appeared to be moving toward a slight thaw --
with baseball team exchanges, a limited increase in travel and the easing of
restrictions on humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, one of the first things Congress will take up when it returns next week
is legislation -- both in the House and the Senate -- to automatically grant
Elian U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   That would block the INS from being able to deport him.
</P>
<P>
	   The citizenship bill has strong backing from Florida's congressional
delegation, and from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
authors of a 1996 law that tightened the embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has signed on as a cosponsor of
the bill; and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., expressed support for the
move.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only have all the Republican presidential candidates criticized the INS
ruling, but the two Democratic candidates are now agreeing that the boy's father
should come to the United States to seek Elian's custody.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we should remember and honor the fact that this child's mother
lost her life, sacrificing her life in order to try to get her child freedom,''
Vice President Al Gore said in Monday's Democratic debate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Echoed rival Bill Bradley: ``The best answer would be for his father and
Elian to be in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore earlier said the issue should be decided by the courts, while Bradley
had said he wouldn't ``second guess'' the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little disappointed in Gore and Bradley,'' said fellow Democrat
Rangel. ``It is so inconsistent for them to support wanting to keep the Cuban
kid here when it would never enter their minds to do the same for a kid from
China or North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders, farmers and tourist organizations continue to push for an
easing of the embargo that was first imposed when Dwight Eisenhower was
president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Johnstone, a former senior State Department official who now heads the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's international division, said the Elian drama ``makes
it harder for people to take an informed and rational position'' on the Cuba
trade issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are two losers out of the embargo process: the American people and
the Cuban people,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnstone said that some opening with Cuba seems inevitable, but added:
``What is not inevitable is the timing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who like many farm-state senators opposes keeping
the embargo, said that while Castro ``is no friend to freedom,'' current U.S.
policy is a relic of the past -- and has done nothing to displace Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We close our eyes to the fact that the world has changed,'' Hagel said.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Debt More Quickly  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Have you been making heftier payments on your credit card
bills in recent months, far exceeding the 2 percent or 3 percent minimum payment
on your balance? Are you resisting the lure of new cards offered in the mail at
seductively low "introductory" interest rates?
</P>
<P>
	   If so, you're part of a new nationwide trend that has helped reduce
historically high personal bankruptcy rates, the Consumer Federation of America
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It said 112,000 fewer Americans filed for and received bankruptcy court
protection last year than in 1998. The consumer group said the 8 percent drop to
under 1.3 million was the largest one-year decline on record.
</P>
<P>
	   More cautious borrowing by consumers is at the heart of the decrease,
Consumer Federation concluded, saying that has forced credit card companies to
restrain their solicitations and lures. For the first time in a decade, the
group said, credit card lenders have curbed the expansion of credit lines, or
limits, offered to their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lenders mailed an estimated 2.4 billion credit card solicitations in
January-September 1999, which projects to 3.1 billion for the whole year,
compared with 3.5 billion in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have increasingly just said 'no' to credit card solicitations,"
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   While 2.8 percent of consumers accepted unsolicited offers of new credit
cards in 1992, that dropped to 1 percent in the first nine months of last year,
Brobeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Brobeck said, many consumers with credit card debts have
realized the importance of paying more than the minimum required on their
monthly bills. They are sending larger payments as well as defaulting less
frequently on their debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The data were released a week before the Senate is scheduled to resume
debate on major bipartisan legislation, pushed by credit card companies and
retail businesses, that would make it tougher for people to erase their debts in
bankruptcy court. The House approved parallel legislation last May by a
veto-proof margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the legislation have said it is needed to stanch a rising tide
of personal bankruptcies that had occurred despite the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Brobeck and other Consumer Federation officials said that given the decline
in personal bankruptcies, the legislation was overly harsh and not needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the banking industry and lawmakers who support the legislation say that
even with the decline, personal bankruptcies remain at historic high levels and
legislation is needed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process by some
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Americans filing personal bankruptcies in 1998, at nearly 1.4
million, was up more than 300 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a key author of the bankruptcy legislation,
called the recent decline in filings a slight change and insisted that a
"bankruptcy crisis" still exists.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the decrease in filings from 1998 to 1999 should be viewed in the
context of an unusually high level of bankruptcies in 1998, "in part because of
aggressive marketing by bankruptcy lawyers who pressed unwitting consumers to
file" before passage of the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good news that consumers are showing restraint," said Patricia
Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. She maintained,
however, that the recent decline does not ensure a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer Federation's data are based in part on a new study by economist
Lawrence Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, whose
figures indicate personal bankruptcies declined to about 1,285,800 last year
from 1,397,700 in 1998, down 8 percent. The drop continued last year, he found.

<HEADLINE> Harry, Louise Push Uninsured Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry and Louise are back.
</P>
<P>
	   The fictional suburban husband and wife whose warnings about President
Clinton's health reform plan helped defeat the proposal in 1994 are featured in
new TV ads about helping uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ads that start today, nationally on CNN and locally in Washington,
Harry frets about an ``epidemic'' of uninsured in America and declares, ``We
can't leave working families and kids without insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Health Insurance Association of America, which sponsored
the old and new Harry and Louise ads, said there's nothing strange about the
poster couple warning about the effects of universal coverage now taking sides
with those who would benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not that different from 1993-1994,'' said Chip Kahn, the group's
president. ``We were concerned with the unintended consequence of the Clinton
plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the group's previous $17 million campaign in 1994, the couple worried
that Clinton's proposal would turn health care decisions over to government
bureaucrats, limit choice of doctors and lead to the rationing of care. The
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the ads as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue with the new ads is how to provide coverage for 44 million
Americans without health insurance. The association, representing large
insurance companies, favors a combination of expanded government programs for
low-income people and tax credits to help small businesses offer insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   It's promoting that plan as an alternative to proposals that might detract
from participation in employer-sponsored plans crucial to large insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1 million ad campaign is aimed at getting political candidates,
especially Republicans, interested in the group's proposal, a $50 billion-a-year
plan to help the uninsured by expanding existing government programs for
low-income people, giving federal vouchers to the working poor to purchase
insurance, and providing tax credits for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad ends with Louise e-mailing candidates about the group's plan, called
InsureUSA.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Republican leaders have talked about providing tax credits so
people could buy their own insurance and possibly circumvent employer-provided
insurance plans -- the main business of large insurers. The insurance group is
arguing that preserving the current system of employer-based coverage, plus
federal help for low-income people, is the best solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they are concerned about proposals for individual tax credits,''
said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy research
group. ``Their bread and butter is selling group coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kahn said that while Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley --
vying for the Democratic presidential nomination -- have both outlined plans to
provide coverage for uninsured Americans, the field of GOP candidates have said
little about the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   By hauling Harry and Louise out of retirement, the insurance industry hopes
to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get their attention,'' said Kahn. The initial campaign is
small, but the group is looking at expanding it over time.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Rightist Militias Kill 7  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected rightist militias killed at least seven
unarmed villagers in northern Colombia, and officials feared dozens more people
were dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's killings followed bombings of electrical towers and bloody weekend
clashes between guerrillas and government troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, two hand grenades apparently thrown at a small police post in
the capital, Bogota, killed a girl and wounded five people at an adjacent
school, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   An upsurge in Colombia's fighting had been expected following the expiration
last week of a temporary, year-end truce.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence also coincided with a visit to a rebel stronghold Tuesday by a
U.N. envoy, who nonetheless expressed optimism in the country's fledging peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   In a village outside Becerril, a rural town in northern Cesar State, gunmen
Tuesday dragged seven men from their homes, lined them up in the main plaza, and
fatally shot them, state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Assassins arriving with lists is a trademark of rightist paramilitary
groups, which have killed thousands of people they accuse of collaborating with
leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   In neighboring Antioquia State, 100 men wearing the armbands of Colombia's
national paramilitary organization burst into three adjoining villages and began
shooting people, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Accounts of the violence came from peasants who fled to the nearby town of
Yarumal, town manager Jose Eliecer Agudelo told The Associated Press. Soldiers
and police were headed to the villages late Tuesday to try to confirm the
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people in the strife-torn central region were already reeling from
explosions the day before that crippled electrical energy grids and forced many
schools to close.
</P>
<P>
	   Bombs by suspected rebels on Monday damaged or toppled 22 electrical towers,
most of them in Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
	   The state capital, Medellin, was under severe electricity rationing Tuesday,
and more than 650,000 students were unable to go to school, officials said. In
neighboring Choco State, 14 towns were without power.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials suspect the bombings were carried out by the Leftist National
Liberation Army, or ELN, which routinely sabotages oil pipelines and electrical
towers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the ELN and the paramilitary groups have complained about being
excluded from peace negotiations begun a year ago between President Andres
Pastrana and Colombia's largest rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks are moving slowly amid ongoing fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   FARC attacks over the weekend killed 75 rebels, twelve soldiers and police,
and eight civilians, the army reported. They were the bloodiest clashes since a
20-day truce expired on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the latest violence, U.N. envoy Jan Egeland of Norway said Tuesday
he sees ample ``political will'' to make peace in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by presidential peace commissioner Victor G. Ricardo, Egeland
made the statement after meeting with Manuel Marulanda, the founder and
legendary chief of the FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   The rendezvous occurred in a massive southern region that Pastrana cleared
of troops more than a year ago to facilitate peace talks with the 15,000-member
rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Jeter Close to Record Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter has been called a special player by New York
Yankees manager Joe Torre and owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter is so special that Steinbrenner is about to reverse his reluctance to
multiyear contracts and make him baseball's richest man.
</P>
<P>
	   After helping lead the Yankees to three World Series titles in four years,
the All-Star shortstop was near agreement on a record contract worth about $118
million for seven years, The Associated Press learned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter submitted a $10.5 million figure for 2000 in salary arbitration
Tuesday, a record amount for a player, and the Yankees put in $9.5 million, the
most ever offered by a team. But neither side expects the matter to go to a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and Jeter's agent, Casey Close,
declined comment. But a pair of sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking
on the condition they not be identified, said a seven-year deal to keep him in
pinstripes was nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eventually, I'll get a long-term deal," Jeter said Tuesday at the Yankees'
training complex in Tampa, Fla. "Hopefully, it will be sooner than later. It's
out of my hands. We'll see what happens. It's just a matter of time, I think."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal and the average salary would shatter the records set by pitcher
Kevin Brown on Dec. 12, 1998, when he agreed to a $105 million, seven-year
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a deal that averages $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the sources said Jeter's contract probably would wind up being worth
$118.5 million, which would make its average $16,928,571.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte was close to agreeing to a $25.5
million, three-year contract, one source said. After swapping arbitration
numbers with the team, catcher Jorge Posada agreed to a $1.25 million, one-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   At 25, Jeter already has won three World Series championship rings.
</P>
<P>
	   He batted .349 and set career highs in home runs (24), RBIs (102) and hits
(219) last season. He safely reached base in the Yankees' first 53 games, the
team's longest such streak since the expansion era of 1961.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter ranks fifth on the Yankees' career list with a .318 average. He has
led the team in hits for four straight years and has scored at least 100 runs in
each of those seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   He beat the Yankees in arbitration last winter, getting a $5 million salary
instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. He wasn't worried about the prospect
of another hearing this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   "You look at it, you're in a win-win situation," Jeter said. "Even if you
lose the arbitration case, you're making a lot of money ... you're making a lot
more money than you did the previous year. I really don't focus on it too much."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, according to one of the sources, won't be finalized until
Steinbrenner meets with Jeter and until the shortstop takes a physical for
insurance purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   It probably will be completed sometime in the next 10 days, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York has been burned in the recent past by delaying agreements with its
star players.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernie Williams got an $87.5 million, seven-year contract from the Yankees
after the 1998 season, more than $30 million higher than he would have agreed to
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter would have been eligible for free agency after the 2001 season, and
the Yankees knew that if they waited, the price would have been affected by Alex
Rodriguez's next contract. Rodriguez, the Seattle Mariners' star shortstop, is
eligible for free agency after next season, and some have speculated his next
contract could average $20 million a year or more.

<HEADLINE> Indians Revise History of Team Name  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eighty-five years later, the story of how the Cleveland
Indians got their nickname is changing a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   The team said it is making a slight change in its 2000 media guide in the
section about the origin of the nickname "Indians." For more than 30 years, the
team has claimed it was named in honor of Louis Sockalexis, a Penobscot Indian
who played for the Cleveland Spiders from 1897-99.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to give a more accurate portrayal of the process of how the name
was chosen," Indians vice president Bob DiBiasio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The name "Indians" was said to have been given as a tribute to Sockalexis
after Cleveland fans were asked to vote on a name by local newspapers in 1915.
</P>
<P>
	   However, DiBiasio said research has shown that Cleveland owner Charles W.
Somers had wanted to use the nickname "Indians" and asked local baseball writers
to solicit their readers for their favorite nickname.
</P>
<P>
	   "And the name selected was Indians," said DiBiasio. "What we're going to do
is change one sentence to more accurately portray that."
</P>
<P>
	   The history section of last year's media guide says: "In fan balloting
through a local newspaper, Indians was chosen to honor former Spider Louis
Sockalexis, the first well known Native American professional baseball player."
</P>
<P>
	   DiBiasio said that passage will be altered slightly in this year's guide.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll say something to the effect that Somers solicited writers to ask
their fans for their favorite nickname, and in turn, the name Indians was
selected. And as legend has it, Indians was in reference to Sockalexis,"'
DiBiasio said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiBiasio said the change was prompted by research done by Ellen Staurowsky,
an Ithaca College professor who has been campaigning for the Indians to change
their name, and by Morris Eckhouse, executive director of the Society of
American Baseball Research.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, protesters have demonstrated against the "Indians" nickname
and the club's smiling Chief Wahoo mascot, saying they are degrading to American
Indians and that the club should make a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland fans sometimes argue the nickname was meant as a tribute to
Sockalexis and not an insult.
</P>
<P>
	   "This hasn't changed anything in our estimation," said Juanita Pelphrey of
the United Church of Christ, an outspoken critic of the Indians' nickname and
Chief Wahoo logo. "It's still perpetuating a lie."
</P>
<P>
	   Merchandise featuring the Chief Wahoo logo is among baseball's best-selling.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Dolan, who is buying the Indians from Richard Jacobs, said the name
and logo will remain under his ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   The team first began mentioning the Sockalexis link in its 1968 media guide,
and in the 1999 guide a full page was devoted to Sockalexis and a history of
Cleveland's nicknames.

<HEADLINE> Mets Far Apart With Benitez on Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets and Armando Benitez have very different
opinions on how much New York's closer is worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Benitez asked for $4.9 million in salary arbitration Tuesday, more than
double the $2,037,500 he made in his first season in New York. The Mets
countered with an offer of $3.25 million for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only one that was surprising was Benitez," New York general manager
Steve Phillips said. "That was extremely surprising. We haven't talked to his
agent yet to find out what he was thinking about. I don't want to predict what
might happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Benitez, who came to New York in a trade before last season, started 1999 as
a set-up man for John Franco, but became the closer when Franco was injured in
July. Benitez went 4-3 with 22 saves and a 1.85 ERA. He struck out 128 batters
in 78 innings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mets have settled all of their arbitration cases since 1992 before going
to hearings. That year, New York went to arbitration with David Cone, Kevin
Elster and Jeff Innis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The preference is to try to get the deal done before filing," Phillips
said. "Once the numbers are filed, I'd prefer not to go to a hearing, but we
have to do what is best for the organization. It's more business than baseball
or personal."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips was more confident in the team's chances of settling with its four
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortstop Rey Ordonez, who made $1.675 million in 2000, asked for $3.5
million, while the Mets offered $2.5 million. Ordonez hit .258 with one homer
and 60 RBIs last year while winning his third consecutive Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
	   Reliever Turk Wendell, who made $1,214,998 last year, asked for $2.15
million, while the team offered $1.85 million. Wendell went 5-4 with three saves
and a 3.05 ERA in 80 relief appearances in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Right-hander Pat Mahomes, who made $310,000 last season, asked for $940,000,
while the team offered $625,000. Mahomes went 8-0 with a 3.68 ERA in 39 relief
appearances in 1999 and is in the running for the fifth spot in the Mets'
rotation this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Infielder Matt Franco, who made $250,000 last year, asked for $500,000,
while the Mets offered $425,000. Franco hit .235 with four homers and 21 RBIs in
1999 when he was used mostly as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Mets avoided arbitration with starter Rick Reed, agreeing to
a $4,375,000, one-year deal with the right-hander.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A national chain of kidney dialysis centers has settled a
health care fraud case with the Justice Department for $500 million, The

Stocks Help Increase Family Wealth
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The typical American family enjoyed a 17.6 percent rise
in wealth during the mid-1990s, reflecting a prosperous economy and a booming
stock market. But a new report from the Federal Reserve showed that not all
income groups shared in the good times. The net worth of the poorest Americans,
those earning less than $25,000 annually, actually fell sharply during the
period. The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America
shows similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.

reporters not to expect any "hawkish declarations" from Putin. He also said
Putin would save any harsh economic steps for after the March 24 presidential

<HEADLINE> Baseball Owners Prepare Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Moving to overhaul the game off the field, but not between
the foul lines, baseball owners plan to eliminate the American and National
league offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Deciding the changes they made six years ago to weaken the commissioner's
office were a mistake, owners intended today to consolidate all authority under
commissioner Bud Selig and toss aside more than a century of tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   But it won't alter anything on the field: the AL and NL will still exist on
paper. Even the DH distinction will remain -- the AL will keep it and the NL
won't adopt it.
</P>
<P>
	   Gone will be AL and NL umpires. The staffs will be intermingled.
</P>
<P>
	   Gone will be league presidents issuing suspensions. Discipline will be taken
over by the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
	   And coming up will be another push for more realignment and perhaps more
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
	   The National League organized at a meeting in New York on Feb. 2, 1876, and
the American League formed when the Western League, then a minor circuit,
changed its name to the AL on Oct. 11, 1899.
</P>
<P>
	   It took a full season for the junior circuit to gain national recognition,
and it finally reorganized as a major league on Jan. 28, 1901.
</P>
<P>
	   For two years, it fought with the NL over players, but the leagues met on
Jan. 9, 1903, at Cincinnati and agreed to a peace treaty -- which led after the
season to the first World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   While the leagues recognized each others contracts, they had separate
presidents, umpires, officials, statisticians and balls -- with most of the
traditions continuing into the 1970s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   And on the field, they met annually in the All-Star game and World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   But the distinctions started to blur when the AL moved from Boston to New
York in 1974 and the NL followed from San Francisco three years later.
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth ordered them to move into the same building as the
commissioner's office in 1985, and the staff of the commissioner has increased
from dozens to hundreds, dwarfing the league staffs, which remained under 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the changes expected to be approved during the two-day session,
Selig's ability to fine teams will be raised from $250,000 to $2 million, which
should give him more leverage in dealing with balky owners, some of whom have
refused to follow his guidelines to consider minorities for all GM and manager
openings.
</P>
<P>
	   In another change, Selig is proposing a clause that could give him broad
power to order more revenue sharing, saying he would "without limitation" have
the right to ensure "there is an appropriate level of long-term competitive
balance among the clubs."
</P>
<P>
	   Also at these meetings, owners might approve the proposed sale of the
Cleveland Indians from Richard Jacobs to Larry Dolan. Shareholders of the
Indians' holding company meet Feb. 7 to approve the $320 million deal, which is
expected to close before opening day.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter broke an arbitration record, and he's about to
break baseball's biggest salary marks, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter asked for an arbitration-record
$10.5 million salary Tuesday and New York closer Mariano Rivera was close
behind, requesting $9.25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jeter's case is not expected to ever see a hearing room. The All-Star,
according to a pair of sources familiar with the talks, is close to an agreement
on a record-setting deal: a seven-year contract worth about $118 million.
</P>
<P>
	   On one of the busiest days of the offseason, 27 players in arbitration
agreed to contracts, including an $18 million, four-year deal for Los Angeles
infielder Mark Grudzielanek, a $15 million, three-year contract for Montreal
pitcher Dustin Hermanson and a $14.25 million, three-year deal for Philadelphia
outfielder Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-two players wound up exchanging arbitration figures with their teams,
and one of them, Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, immediately settled on a $1.25
million, one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
	   For players who don't reach agreements, hearing before three-person panels
will be scheduled for the first three weeks of February.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Jeter won $5 million in arbitration and Rivera $4.25 got million.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter's request tops the previous record, set when teammate Bernie Williams
asked for $9 million in 1998. The Yankees offered Williams $7.5 million two
years ago, the highest figure submitted by a team before Tuesday, and settled at
$8.25 million. After the season, when Williams was a free agent, they agreed on
an $87.5 million, seven-year deal, the highest on the team until now.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter's agreement would surpass the $105 million, seven-year contract Kevin
Brown agreed to with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Dec. 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera won at $4.25 million last year, then had a major league-leading 45
saves and was voted MVP of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees countered him at $7.25 million, meaning a second straight
arbitration hearing is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, eligible for free agency after next season,
asked for a raise from $5.95 million to $8.45 million after going 14-11 with a
4.70 ERA. The Yankees, who offered $6.5 million, were close to agreement on a
$25.5 million, three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of players traded during the offseason also asked for large salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston outfielder Carl Everett, acquired from Houston, asked for a raise
from $2.5 million to $6 million, and the team countered at $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Cubs pitcher Ismael Valdes, acquired from Los Angeles, asked for a
raise from $4,275,000 to $6.2 million. The Cubs countered at $5,275,000.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Mets closer Armando Benitez asked for $4.9 million, more than
double his $2,037,500 salary last season. He was offered $3.25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson, who lost in arbitration last year after
winning in 1998, asked for a raise from $3.6 million to $5.1 million, with the
Orioles offering $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Three players agreed to two-year contracts: Cincinnati outfielder Michael
Tucker ($3.5 million), Tampa Bay catcher Mike DiFelice ($1.3 million) and
Toronto catcher Alberto Castillo ($1.15 million).
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles settled with all six of its players in arbitration. In addition
to Grudzielanek, the Dodgers agreed to one-year contracts with right-handers
Chan Ho Park ($3.85 million), Terry Adams ($1.4 million) and Dan Naulty
($300,000), third baseman Kevin Orie ($600,000) and outfielder Trenidad Hubbard
($300,000).
</P>
<P>
	   In a strange move, the Dodgers then attempted to send Hubbard to the minors
outright and he refused, becoming a free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis agreed to one-year deals with three pitchers: right-handers Kent
Bottenfield ($4 million) and Alan Benes ($550,000) and left-hander Mike Mohler
($690,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Also agreeing to one-year contracts were Chicago White Sox right-hander
James Baldwin ($3.3 million), Atlanta second baseman Quilvio Veras ($3 million),
Cincinnati second baseman Pokey Reese ($1.95 million), Kansas City right-hander
Jeff Suppan ($1.45 million), Phillies right-hander Robert Person ($1.4 million),
Cleveland right-hander Steve Karsay ($1.2 million), Milwaukee right-hander Jamey
Wright ($1,025,000), Cubs right-hander Matt Karchner ($776,000), Brewers
left-hander Bill Pulsipher ($575,000), Anaheim outfielder Orlando Palmeiro
($550,000) and Detroit right-hander Danny Patterson ($550,000)

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski Says Guilty Plea Coerced  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski says he would
rather die than spend his life in prison, and was coerced into pleading guilty
to three fatal mail bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski has filed a handwritten, 58-page brief, seeking to withdraw his
plea and go to trial despite the risk of a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will decide the issue after reviewing
prosecutors' arguments, which are due in 10 days. The court ruled last October
that a federal judge may have violated Kaczynski's rights by allowing his
lawyers to use his mental condition as a defense, over his objections, and
denying his request to represent himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The guilty pleas ``were induced by the threat of a mental-state defense that
Kaczynski would have found unendurable, as well as by deprivation of
constitutional rights,'' wrote Kaczynski, who referred to himself in the third
person.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kaczynski's counsel's portrayal of him as a grotesque lunatic would have
been broadcast nationwide, and this was a prospect that anyone might have found
unendurable. Suicide to avoid public humiliation is by no means unknown,'' said
Kaczynski, who attempted suicide in jail after his lawyers told him of their
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he ``repeatedly made it clear to his attorneys that if
presented with a choice between life imprisonment and a death sentence, he would
just as soon have the death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
	   His brief, which had been due Tuesday, was filed Dec. 28. Kaczynski is in a
maximum-security federal prison in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest recluse,
pleaded guilty in January 1998 to mail bombings that killed three people and
injured 23. Two of the deaths were in Sacramento and the third was in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski's writings have connected the attacks to his campaign against what
he considered the tyranny of technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department initially sought a death sentence for Kaczynski but
accepted a life sentence after a court-ordered psychiatric examination,
conducted over his objections, concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty after U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of Sacramento
refused to let him represent himself or delay the trial to let Kaczynski get a
lawyer who would present a defense based on his views about technology and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his brief, Kaczynski repeated his past denials of mental illness and his
willingness to face a possible death sentence if he could choose his trial
strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham declined comment. Before Kaczynski
pleaded guilty, prosecutors argued that he should be allowed to control his
defense, even at the risk of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who has written a book on the
case and helped Kaczynski with an earlier legal filing, said Tuesday he thought
Kaczynski could represent himself adequately.
</P>
<P>
	   If he is convicted and the trial goes to a penalty phase, Mello said,
Kaczynski is ``the best person to explain ... why he did what he did, why he
felt morally compelled ... why he doesn't deserve to die for what he did, or why
he wants to die.''

<HEADLINE> Phillips Testifies for Umpires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Richie Phillips, head of the overturned Major League
Umpires Association, planned a second day on the witness stand, testifying on
behalf of 22 umpires who lost their jobs in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips began his testimony Tuesday, and his lawyer didn't finish
questioning him by the end of the day. The hearing will continue through at
least Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arbitrator Alan Symonette heard testimony last month from MLUA president
Jerry Crawford, then recessed the case because of a family illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips claims the 22 umpires were illegally fired, while owners say they
merely accepted their resignations, the result of a failed mass resignation
strategy by the MLUA.
</P>
<P>
	   Umpires have since voted 57-35 to replace the MLUA with an insurgent union,
the Major League Umpires Independent Organization Committee, led in large part
by American League umps unhappy with Phillips. The MLUA filed objections to the
election and NLRB hearing officer David Leach III heard three days of testimony
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a National Labor Relations Board hearing officer in New York is
expected to decide this week on Phillips' attempt to reverse a November election
that kicked out his union.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach can recommend the NLRB certify the results or order a new election.
The losing side has two weeks to appeal his decision to the five-man NLRB in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the dispute, almost no bargaining has taken place for a labor
contract to replace the deal that expired Dec. 31.

those earning less than $25,000 annually, actually fell sharply during the
period. The Fed survey, released Tuesday, found that family wealth in America
shows similar characteristics to personal incomes. And for many years, personal
incomes have shown a growing gap between rich and poor.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's drive to develop a national missile
defense suffered a setback Tuesday night when a prototype missile interceptor
failed to hit a mock warhead, a Pentagon official announced. "An intercept was
not achieved for reasons unknown at this time," spokesman Air Force Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner said. The mock warhead, launched from an Air Force base in
California, was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United States.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia will be a more predictable and reliable country
under the presidency of Vladimir Putin, according to a top Russian government
aide who was former President Boris Yeltsin's chief spokesman. Dmitry Yakushkin,
in the United States to assess U.S. concerns with Putin's government, told
reporters not to expect any "hawkish declarations" from Putin. He also said
Putin would save any harsh economic steps for after the March 24 presidential
election. Yakushkin, however, said in a session Tuesday with reporters at the
National Press Club that the crisis in Chechnya would not be resolved in months,
but in years.

United Nations' spotlight as part of a new effort to revive peace talks and end
a conflict that has left more than 200,000 people dead and tens of thousands in
dire humanitarian straits. Mandela is the featured speaker at an open meeting
Wednesday of the Security Council, which is expected to adopt a resolution
condemning a recent surge of violence in the small Central African nation that
threatens to explode. Burundi's civil war has been raging for six years, but it
has not received the international attention of other conflicts.

Prevention found that the number of such women who had ever smoked declined from
44.1 percent to 38.2 percent. The researchers said that women who said they were
pregnant were about half as likely to be current smokers as those who were not

Lee asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to grant him bail, arguing that his
right against self-incrimination was violated. The lawyers urged the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn rulings disallowing bail for Lee, 60, who
is charged with breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by moving

has said that Lee stole enough nuclear secrets to build a functional

<HEADLINE> Elian Learns of Different Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By IAN JAMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- If he were attending school in Cuba, 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
would be taught to honor President Fidel Castro and urged to be a pioneering
communist.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Miami, the private school the boy is attending teaches its students
that Cubans have suffered under Castro's revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   The contrast underlines the deep disagreements that for four decades have
pitted many Cuban exiles in Miami against Castro's government and have led to a
highly politicized custody fight for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this schooling they are violating the rights of the father, who has
not been consulted,'' Cuban education specialist Rafael Bell Rodriguez said
during a roundtable broadcast live on government television in Havana on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are trying to educate the child in a society of competition,
inequalities, individualism, violence and vice,'' added Marisela Rodriguez
Penate, another education specialist participating in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued last November after his mother and 10 others died when
their boat sank while trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the Cuban government are demanding
the boy's return, a move backed by the Clinton administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The issue will apparently be settled in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Elian is attending the Lincoln-Marti School, learning basic
skills and English in his first-grade class. The school, named after Abraham
Lincoln and Cuban independence hero Jose Marti, has given Elian a full
scholarship of $3,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
	   Demetrio Perez, the Cuban-born director of Lincoln-Marti, said Elian walked
into class on his second day at school and greeted his teacher in English,
saying: ``My name is Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   If he is able to stay, the boy will be taught a curriculum quite different
from that which he would study in Cuba, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Perez said, students are taught to salute the country's flag with
its single white star, to respect revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara and
to recite the slogan of the Pioneers, the nation's communist youth organization:
``Pioneers for communism, we will be like Che!''
</P>
<P>
	   Perez has written a textbook entitled ``Citizens Training Handbook'' that is
used with older students at the school in teaching values, civics, morality and
other topics.
</P>
<P>
	   The book's dedication mentions Cuba and calls it ``a nation oppressed by
communism'' that has been unable to provide for ``people's most basic needs,
such as food, clothing and housing.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Targets Heavy Immigration  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- While other presidential candidates aggressively
court Hispanics, Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan is promising to seal the
U.S.-Mexico border and slash the number of immigrants legally admitted to the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan on Tuesday blamed ``mass immigration'' for a list of social woes,
and warned that the process is fragmenting the United States into ``separate
ethnic nations within a nation'' and driving down wages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In too many cases, the American melting pot has been reduced to a
simmer,'' Buchanan told 350 people in a speech at the Richard Nixon Library &AMP;
Birthplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we want to assimilate new Americans -- and we have no choice if we are
going to remain one nation -- we must slow down the pace of immigration,''
Nixon's former speechwriter said. ``America is Balkanizing like never before.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan rejected the notion that his tough talk on immigration could
alienate the growing Hispanic vote. In this state, about 15 percent of the
electorate is Hispanic, and many remain angry with conservatives for fighting to
cut state aid to illegal immigrants and to dismantle affirmative action and
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the message I offer is good for Hispanic Americans,'' he said
after the speech. ``Clearly, you're going to bring in more Hispanics, but we
need to control our borders, (because) borders belong to all Americans --
Hispanic Americans, all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan pledged to make control of illegal immigration a national priority,
though he offered no specific plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited the ``thousands of illegals streaming across the border into
Arizona'' and recent deadly attempts to smuggle Chinese citizens into West Coast
ports aboard cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, Buchanan promised to reduce new entry visas to between
250,000 and 300,000 a year. In printed copies of his address, distributed to
reporters in advance, he set the figure at 300,000.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, the United States has admitted between 700,000 and 800,000
legal, permanent residents each year, said Don Mueller, a spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan criticized a U.S. policy that favors prospective immigrants with
relatives here, rather than their education and skills, and promised to change
it.
</P>
<P>
	   And the former Republican, who is to visit an Arizona border town today,
blamed a host of other ills on what he characterized as excessive immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   He said crime and prison populations have increased in some regions where
new immigrants have settled in large numbers, and he contended that immigration
has depressed wages.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he heaped praise on new immigrants, saying he had met many
while riding in cabs, dining in restaurants and traveling through airports
during his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The contributions that immigrants make in small businesses and hard work
in tough jobs that do not pay well merits our admiration and deepest respect,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the immigration dispute over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban found
floating off the Florida coast in an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day, Buchanan
said he favored bringing the boy's family to the United States for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother drowned during the trip from Cuba, and the question of
whether to send the boy back to that country to join his father has become a
political issue. Elian's father has said he wants the boy back, but Buchanan
said, ``We cannot take at face value what an individual says under Fidel
Castro's thumb and his rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should invite that man, the father of that boy, to the United States,
say, 'Bring your whole family here and bring the boy's grandmother here and come
and make the case in freedom that you want him back,''' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think if necessary, we ought to make him an American citizen,'' Buchanan
said.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Less Likely To Be Jailed  </HEADLINE>
   By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN JR. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those who have served their country may be more prone to
respect its laws, according to the results of a government study.
</P>
<P>
	   On average, male military veterans are incarcerated half as much as than
those who have never served in the armed forces, said a study from the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, a division of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   An average 937 male veterans are in jail or prison per 100,000 veteran
residents, compared to an average 1,971 men incarcerated per 100,000
non-veterans, said the study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the study said the number of veterans in jail or prison increased by
46 percent from 1985 to 1998, the increase fell short of the national trend.
According to the bureau, the number of incarcerated non-veterans rose by 172
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
	   The study focused solely on men, who comprise 95 percent of the nation's
veterans and was based on interviews with selected inmates on their military,
criminal and personal backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the report indicated that veterans are less likely to go to jail or
prison, it would seem that veterans haven't been able to dull their taste for
combat. The statistics show veteran inmates to be more likely than non-veteran
inmates to have committed violent crimes. Roughly 35 percent of the veterans
surveyed in state prisons had been convicted of homicide or sexual assault,
compared to 20 percent of the rest of the inmate population, said the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Among state prisoners sentenced for violent crimes, the average sentence of
veterans was 50 months longer than that of the average non-veteran, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants were designated as veterans whether or not they actually were
engaged in combat. In other words, a veteran was defined as a male who served in
the military during the period of a war or conflict, such as during the Vietnam
era.
</P>
<P>
	   Veterans who actually saw combat during their service had less serious
criminal histories than other veterans, according to the report. And half of the
incarcerated veterans in the study had served during a period of wartime; 35
percent were Vietnam-era veterans and 12 percent were Gulf War-era veterans.
Twenty percent had seen combat during their military service.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau also reported:
</P>
<P>
	   --Veterans were less likely to be serving a sentence for a drug conviction
-- 14 percent -- than other inmates -- 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   -- About 70 percent of the veterans had been working full-time prior to
state imprisonment, compared to 54 percent of the other state prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among state prisoners, 12 percent of the veterans and 10 percent of the
non-veterans said they had been homeless at some time during the year before
their arrest.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Newspaper Turns to Web  </HEADLINE>
   By SEAN YOONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Facing a possible government ban, Malaysia's
leading opposition newspaper has launched a daily edition on the Internet to
increase its reach, its editor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're getting nearly 20,000 hits every day,'' Zulkifli Sulong, editor of
the widely read Harakah newspaper, told The Associated Press. ``People are keen
to learn about what we have to say.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harakah Daily Interactive, as the Website is called, was launched Monday,
five days after Zulkifli was arrested and released on bail at the start of a
sudden government crackdown on key opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
	   The Website is a revamped version of Harakah's old Website, which had less
content and was updated less frequently, sometimes not for several weeks,
Zulkifli said. The new site will be updated daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Zulkifli was charged last week with sedition for an Aug. 2 article that
included a quote accusing authorities of a conspiracy against jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim. The newspaper's printer, Chea Lim Thye, was also charged with
sedition.
</P>
<P>
	   Zulkifli's trial begins May 22. If convicted, he faces three years in
prison, and his newspaper, published by the fundamentalist Pan-Malaysian Islamic
Party, or PAS, would likely be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, The Sun daily newspaper quoted Deputy Home Minister Zainal
Abidin Zin as saying the government would monitor Harakah's Internet edition to
``ensure that it does not carry seditious material.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harakah, which is published twice a week, currently sells an average of
300,000 copies. The paper is mostly published in the Malay language but contains
a few pages in English.
</P>
<P>
	   After last week's spate of opposition arrests, the U.S. State Department and
several human rights groups criticized Malaysia for its treatment of opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has accused outsiders of trying to meddle in Malaysia's
internal affairs, claiming all the arrests were in accordance with the country's
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people were charged in court last week for sedition and leaking state
secrets. They face jail terms ranging from three to seven years if convicted.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges Bush on Web Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSFIELD, N.H. (AP) -- While Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush
bicker over tax policy, some voters preparing to cast ballots in the upcoming
New Hampshire primaries say they have other priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tax cuts really aren't a big deal for me,'' Dave Hauver, a 52-year-old
cuff cutter at Globe Manufacturing, said Tuesday after the Texas governor
stopped by for a tour. The company makes firefighter coats and pants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd rather see him put the money into Social Security; I have other issues
that are important to me,'' Hauver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Kendall, 42, a production worker at the same plant, said: ``Honestly,
taxes aren't that important to me. I'm middle class, I do OK. Health reform,
that's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the sentiments, the two rivals for the Republican presidential
nomination are battling over the tax issue in the run-up to Monday's Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, McCain signed a pledge saying he would not tax Internet sales.
``We should not harm this baby in the cradle,'' he said. The Arizona senator
then challenged Bush to take the same stand. Bush refused and instead urged New
Hampshire voters to take a critical look at McCain's own tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for the people of this state to analyze everybody's plan,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   While taxes continue to be a big issue in this sales-tax free state,
nationally voters appeared more aligned with McCain's position.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Time/CNN poll found that 63 percent of Republicans nationwide favored
a small tax cut with more money going to shore up Social Security and reduce the
federal debt. The same survey found that only 29 percent of Republicans favored
a larger tax cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said Tuesday: ``If people don't like the tax cut plan, they can find
another candidate, and I'm sure they will. ... If you expect ... me to go back
in the bus and call up and say, 'What's the latest poll or what's the latest
focus group talking about,' you got the wrong candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
He has said it is irresponsible to cut taxes further until the financial future
of Social Security and Medicare is assured.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would deliver a five-year, $483 billion tax cut. He says the
only way to be certain that projected budget surpluses are not spent by the
federal government is to refund most of the money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates also took their tax arguments to the airwaves in new ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said McCain trusts ``the people of Washington'' rather than the people
of New Hampshire to spend money. McCain said that unlike Bush, ``I won't take
every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   With Internet commerce generating an estimated $170 billion in revenue last
year, McCain promised to support a permanent ban on taxing access, sales or use.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he favored continuing a moratorium on taxing e-commerce but wanted
to know ``what the world looks like'' after three to five years of further
changes before making a long-term decision.
</P>
<P>
	   With his tax-cut plan under fire, McCain put off delivering an education
speech this week, but planned to talk about the issue before the primaries here,
his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has had trouble getting details straight while rolling out proposals,
from health care to taxes, and thereby providing his rivals with ready targets.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky put a positive spin on the delay, saying
it would force the Bush camp ``to continue to defend their (tax) plan which
doesn't devote a penny to Social Security.''

   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful earthquake jolted northern Pakistan and
neighboring Afghanistan today, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6 and was centered in the Hindu
Kush mountain range in central Afghanistan, 150 miles northwest of Peshawar,

<HEADLINE> Michael J. Fox Leaving 'Spin City'  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Spin City" star Michael J. Fox said Tuesday he is
leaving the ABC sitcom, but not show business, because of his fight against
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, who revealed in 1998 that he suffers from the degenerative neurological
disorder that affects movement, said this will be his last season with the
highly rated series.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could not be more proud of the show ... and all that we have accomplished
over the last four years, yet I feel that right now my time and energy would be
better spent with my family and working toward a cure for Parkinson's disease,"
the 38-year-old actor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This does not mean I am retiring from acting, producing or directing, only
that I want to relieve the strain of producing and performing a weekly network
series," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, which had no comment on the show's future, called "Spin City" a "labor
of love" for Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly there are more important things in life and we wish Michael and his
family our heartfelt thanks and support," the network said. "We look forward to
working with Michael in his future endeavors."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, who is up for a Golden Globe award Sunday, plays a hard-charging deputy
mayor on the series now in its fourth year. His co-stars include Barry Bostwick
and Heather Locklear, who joined the cast this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The former star of the sitcom "Family Ties" and the "Back to the Future"
movies told of his incurable illness in the December 1998 issue of People
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   He decided to reveal his affliction because he thought he could help his
family and other sufferers of the disease. Fox has three children, a son and
twin daughters, with actress Tracy Pollan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, Fox noticed a "twitch" in the little finger on his left hand while
on the set of the film "Doc Hollywood." Although a doctor told him he could
function for many years, the disease progressed and he suffered stiffness in his
entire left side and violent tremors.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today as investors penalized Microsoft
for a profit report that met published estimates, but missed traders' most
optimistic projections and failed to impress some Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 21.10 at 11,539.62.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Uninsured Americans  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed a $110 billion
health-care initiative intended to provide medical coverage to 5 million
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal includes several measures that Congress has ignored in
the past. But the White House said the president believes he has a good chance
of winning them this year, his last in office, even though it is a presidential
election year when compromise is difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a real sense out in America that we need to do more on health
insurance,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurance was Clinton's signature issue when he won the presidency in
1992, but Congress ignored his sweeping proposal for universal health coverage.
He has made headway on several fronts, however, including a major expansion of
insurance for children through Medicaid and the state Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   The major element of Clinton's new initiative is a proposal to build on the
CHIP initiative by providing coverage for parents of children in the CHIP. The
White House said the measure would provide coverage for about 4 million
uninsured parents at a cost of $76 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also urged accelerating the enrollment of uninsured children
in Medicaid and CHIP, adding 400,000 children at a cost of $5.5 billion over 10
years. While enrollment in CHIP doubled to 2 million children in 1999, millions
remain eligible but unenrolled, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another major component would provide tax breaks to help 2 million Americans
struggling to provide long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives. Congress
shelved a less costly version of the same program.
</P>
<P>
	   Another proposal would resurrect Clinton's plan to allow workers as young as
55 to buy into the Medicare program. Congress ignored the proposal last year.
This time, Clinton would make the proposal even more attractive for workers --
and more costly for the government -- by offering a 25 percent tax credit for
participants in the Medicare buy-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is intended to help the baby-boom generation as it nears
retirement. The percentage of uninsured is growing fastest among people ages 55
to 65; even more growth is expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of the buy-in and credit over 10 years would be about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also proposed aid to help workers to buy COBRA health
insurance when they leave a job. The COBRA program allows workers to buy into
their employer's health plan for up to 18 to 36 months, provided they pay the
premium. However, fewer than 25 percent of eligible people buy the coverage, in
part because of the cost, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would offer a 25 percent tax credit for COBRA premiums
to make the cost more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   Other provisions of Clinton's initiative would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Give a 20 percent tax credit to small businesses to buy health insurance
through purchasing coalitions. The initiative would be limited to companies that
have not previously offered health insurance to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to insure children through age 20.
</P>
<P>
	   --Extend Medicaid coverage for people who leave welfare rolls to take a job.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to provide insurance for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allocate at least $1 billion over 10 years to help public hospitals,
clinics and thousands of health care providers give health care to the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   In his final budget proposal, Clinton will triple the size of last year's
initiative. It would cost $28 billion over 10 years, providing up to $3,000 in
tax credits for eligible families. The White House is betting that an
election-minded Congress will be more receptive to the idea now as the baby boom
generation nears retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials refused to say how Clinton would pay for his costly
initiatives. Lockhart said the administration would not release details until
the president's budget is unveiled Feb. 7. But the proposal likely will be drawn
into the battle over how to spend a huge projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $1.25 billion over 10 years for
local agencies that support family caregivers with counseling, training and care
techniques. The money would be awarded to state and local ``agencies on aging,''
created by the 1965 Older Americans Act.
</P>
<P>
	   If enacted, the credit for long-term care would be phased in beginning with
$1,000 in 2001, rising in $500 increments so that eligible people would receive
$3,000 in 2005. The credit would be phased out beginning at $110,000 in income
for families and $75,000 for unmarried taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the credit would help about 2 million Americans,
including 1.2 million older Americans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults and
approximately 250,000 children.
</P>
<P>
	   While difficult to quantify, the economic value of care giving for families
ranges from $4,800 to $10,400 per caregiver, according to one study cited by the
White House. Thus, the proposed $3,000 tax credit could cover up to 60 percent
of families' costs.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Guam Gov. Runoff Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A runoff election is not required to determine Guam's
governor, the Supreme Court ruled today. The unanimous decision is a victory for
Carl Gutierrez, the U.S. territory's Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices restored for Gutierrez the victory he thought he and running
Madeleine Bordallo, the lieutenant governor, won in November 1998. Lower courts
had stripped them of it, ruling that a runoff was needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's losers are Republican former Gov. Joseph Ada and his running mate,
Felix Camacho.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue was whether a federal law requires a runoff election when a
candidate slate receives a majority of the votes cast for governor and
lieutenant governor but not an absolute majority of the number of ballots cast
in all races.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the court today, Justice David H. Souter said the law ``requires
no runoff in such circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guam is a U.S. territory about 3,700 miles southwest of Hawaii. Gutierrez
and Ada were the only gubernatorial candidates in the 1998 election. Gutierrez
received 24,250 votes; Ada 21,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law requires a territorial governor to get ``a majority of the votes
cast in any election,'' and Guam's Election Commission declared Gutierrez the
winner by a slim margin after adding about 1,900 write-ins and defective votes
to the total.
</P>
<P>
	   Ada sued, contending that the 1,313 ballots on which no votes were cast in
the governor's contest but were marked for other races had to be counted as
``votes cast in any election.'' Counting those votes would leave Gutierrez 83
votes shy of a majority.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge and federal appeals court ruled that a runoff was
required, but Souter said they were wrong and ignored the law's ``obvious
reading.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the context of the disputed law, Souter said, ``Congress would hardly
have used 'any election' to mean 'general election' only to mention 'general
election' a few lines further on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Gutierrez vs. Ada, 99-51.

<HEADLINE> Rules Set for TV Anti-Drug Messages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office has established
guidelines to clarify its arrangement with television shows and other media
outlets that want government financial credits for inserting anti-drug messages
into their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new rules, the government will not review program episodes for
such credits until after the program episodes have aired or been published. The
office also pledged that it would keep separate the process of granting
financial credits from simply offering guidance to networks or producers who
seek advice on how to portray drug-abuse situations.
</P>
<P>
	   The office was responding to recent fallout from the disclosure that the
government used financial incentives to get TV networks to include anti-drug
messages into their shows, in some cases even reviewing the scripts before the
programs aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement has drawn criticism from some who say the government is
intruding on the independence of networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines set out Tuesday are an effort "to eliminate any
misunderstandings and prevent any inference of federal intrusion in the creative
process," said Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new parameters still require a 100 percent match for every dollar the
federal government spends on media outlets and continue to allow media heads to
decide how to meet this requirement. Namely, networks can still receive
financial credit for the content of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   But programs will not be reviewed for these credits until after they have
aired, the office said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the drug office said it would still make available scientific
and technical experts to the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have forged a strong partnership with the entertainment and media
community and look forward to continuing to strengthen those ties," said
McCaffrey. The office plans to periodically seek the advice of the entertainment
industry on the credit process as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial spot bought by
the government with a free one. Since the program started, however, the
government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as the
networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages.

<HEADLINE> Justices Uphold Va. Death Sentence  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deeply divided Supreme Court today upheld the death
sentence of a man who murdered a Virginia state trooper. Four justices said the
jurors who sentenced the killer likely wanted to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 5-4 vote, the nation's highest court said Lonnie Weeks' sentencing
trial did not violate any of his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court that the sentencing
jury ``was adequately instructed.'' But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
dissenters that a judge's instructions and response to a question posed by
jurors almost certainly led them to misunderstand their duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks was convicted of killing trooper Jose M. Cavazos during a traffic stop
along Interstate 95 in Prince William County, Va., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Weeks was a passenger in a car he had stolen weeks earlier.
Weeks, who admitted killing Cavazos, shot the trooper six times.
</P>
<P>
	   At Weeks' sentencing trial, jurors were told they could consider two
aggravating factors cited by state prosecutors: Weeks' future dangerousness and
the ``outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman'' nature of his crime
in choosing between the death penalty and a life prison term.
</P>
<P>
	   During their deliberations, the jurors asked the judge whether a life prison
term carried the possibility of parole. The judge told them to ``impose such
punishment as you feel is just'' and not worry about ``what may happen
afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
	   The jury later asked the judge whether it was required to sentence Weeks to
death if it found at least one of the aggravating factors.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge responded by pointing out the second paragraph of written
instructions he had given to the jury. It said the jury, if finding either
factor present, ``may fix the punishment of the defendant at death, or if you
believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you
shall fix the punishment of the defendant at imprisonment for life.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court upheld, 6-3, that precise wording in a 1998 decision
involving another Virginia death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's majority opinion by Rehnquist said, ``Given that (Weeks') jury was
adequately instructed and given the trial judge responded to the jury's question
by directing its attention to the precise paragraph of the constitutionally
adequate instruction that answers its inquiry, the question becomes whether the
Constitution requires anything more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hold that it does not,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   In dissent, Stevens said what happened during Weeks' sentencing trial
``establishes not just a reasonable likelihood of jury confusion but a virtual
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Contributing to that confusion, he said, was the judge's refusal ``to tell
them that even if they found one of those circumstances, they did not have a
duty as a jury to issue the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is at least reasonable to infer,'' Stevens said, ``that the
conscientious jury members performed what they regarded as their duty under the
law, notwithstanding a strong desire to spare the life of Lonnie Weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens was joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Weeks vs. Angelone, 99-5746.

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Misses Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today it may take several weeks to
determine why a prototype missile interceptor -- a key part of its proposed
national missile defense -- failed to hit its target over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to the expected moment of impact Tuesday night, the interceptor appeared
to be on track to the target, a mock warhead launched from Vandenberg Air Force
Base, Calif., Pentagon spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was extremely close,'' she said. But there was no immediate indication
of what went wrong, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor, a high-tech ``kill vehicle'' designed to destroy a missile
warhead by ramming it head-on, was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands about 20 minutes after the target lifted off from Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   An official who monitored the test Tuesday night from the Pentagon said
today the interceptor seemed to have ``seen'' the target, using its on-board
sensors, as the two objects closed toward each other. That is one of the final
crucial steps to an intercept. The official discussed the matter on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon, working with Boeing Co. and other contractors involved in the
project, is undertaking an extensive review of the test data, and the results
may not be known for several weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,''
spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said the 121-pound, 55-inch long interceptor, built by Raytheon
Corp., was launched successfully from Kwajalein Atoll. ``What happened after it
got into space we do not know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United
States, and a successful intercept would have provided a dramatic boost to the
Pentagon's effort to show a limited missile defense system can work.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a leading supporter of missile defense, issued a
statement today while traveling in Europe in which he called on Congress to give
the Pentagon more money to ``work out the kinks'' in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a setback, by any means,'' Weldon said of the Tuesday night
test. ``The purpose of a testing program is to determine problems and resolve
them before a system goes into production. Testing failures are not only common,
but to some extent necessary to perfect a system's performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pentagon officials had high hopes for a successful intercept, they
noted in pre-launch interviews that setbacks were to be expected in any
experimental military project, especially one as complicated as missile defense.
Depending on what went wrong, the failed intercept may not be a serious setback,
although it is certain to provide fuel for critics who say the system would be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsuccessful test also may cause consternation among congressional
Republicans who have been pushing President Clinton to go forward with a system
that could defend against attacks by countries such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to go ahead with a
national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates would cost at least $12.7
billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005, although
many officials involved in the program believe that may be too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading Republican presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, both favor deploying a national missile defense
as soon as possible. Among the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
says numerous factors -- including the affordability of such a defense and its
geopolitical ramifications -- must be considered. Bill Bradley is even less
enthusiastic, saying he believes the U.S. nuclear arsenal provides sufficient
deterrence to a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials had asserted before the test that even if the interceptor
failed to hit its target, there were other important goals for the test,
including the first test of a computerized battle management system that is
designed to communicate with the interceptor as it soars into space.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said there was no immediate word on whether these other aspects of
the test worked as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The next interceptor test is scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial test last October resulted in a successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen protesters held a vigil outside Vandenberg Air Force Base
on Tuesday to protest the test.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuclear powers Russia and China are the most vocal opponents of a proposed
U.S. national missile defense, but it is North Korea -- economically destitute,
politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that Clinton administration
officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, like Iraq or
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Protesters' Rights Mulled  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices jousted today over the free-speech
rights of abortion demonstrators and what limits can be placed on their
``sidewalk counseling'' outside clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a Colorado law that requires protesters to stay at least eight
feet away from people entering health-care clinics, unless someone agrees to
closer contact to talk or take a leaflet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You certainly can convey anything you want to convey orally from a
distance of eight feet,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told attorney Jay A.
Sekulow, representing three protesters who challenged the law. If a person wants
to take a leaflet ``they can and will and it would be the same if it were one
foot or eight feet,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Antonin Scalia challenged Colorado Solicitor General Michael E.
McLachlan's argument that the law was neutrally written.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we know what it's aimed at, which is abortion protesters,'' Scalia
said, adding that counseling someone to consider the consequences of abortion is
``a totally different entity when you do it from eight feet away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the law, and Sekulow asked the justices to
reverse that ruling. A decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The law ``makes the peaceful distribution of a leaflet, the display of a
sign ... a crime if prior consent is not obtained,'' Sekulow said.
</P>
<P>
	   McLachlan said the measure was aimed to protect vulnerable people seeking
health care.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned whether the law would bar all
protest activity outside a medical office, even if it is only one office in a
tall building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to me that this is troublesome,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked if the same type of
limits could be set on labor picketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyer Barbara D. Underwood, arguing in Colorado's
support, said such a law could be passed if labor picketing created the same
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the public forum out in the street, can we have a law that enables
people to turn off unwelcome speech?'' Scalia asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist suggested that the traditional concept of public speech is
``someone on a soapbox ... not that you're one-on-one with someone one-eighth of
an inch away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen states also are backing Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators are being supported by, among others, the AFL-CIO and the
American Civil Liberties Union. The AFL-CIO's brief said its member unions have
a ``vital interest'' in citizens' free-speech right to express their views on
the public streets by picketing and leafleting.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU's brief said that while protecting the right of women to seek
medical treatment is a significant goal, the law goes too far by barring speech
-- such as handing out a leaflet -- that would not obstruct someone entering or
leaving a clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court reaffirmed the right to abortion in 1992, and today's case
does not address that issue. The justices agreed last week to hear arguments in
a separate case this spring on whether states can ban a surgical procedure
opponents call ``partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court has addressed the abortion-protest issue twice before.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994 the justices upheld a 36-foot demonstration-free zone around a
Florida clinic. And in a 1997 New York case, they upheld a 15-foot buffer zone
around abortion clinic entrances.
</P>
<P>
	   But in that case they struck down a judge's order for a ``floating buffer
zone'' requiring protesters to stay 15 feet away from patients or staff members
as they entered or left the clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1993 Colorado law, affecting protests within 100 feet of clinics, was
enacted in response to what the state's lawyers called ``a history of
obstructive demonstrations'' outside abortion clinics. The state's lawyers said
protesters in effect blockaded clinics by grabbing, surrounding and yelling at
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was challenged by Leila Jeanne Hill, Audrey Himmelmann and Everitt
Simpson Jr., who said they merely advised women of alternatives to abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   After Colorado courts upheld the law, the Supreme Court in 1997 ordered them
to reconsider the case under its 1997 decision. The Colorado Supreme Court again
upheld the state law last year, saying an eight-foot buffer zone, unlike a
15-foot one, ``allows for normal conversational tones.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Bias in Jury Pools  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminal defendants' convictions need not be thrown out
every time a trial judge mistakenly fails to remove a potential juror who showed
signs of bias, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously.
</P>
<P>
	   Such errors do not violate fair-trial rights if defendants subsequently use
peremptory, or automatic, challenges to remove such people as jurors and are
then convicted by juries with no biased members, the court ruled as it
reinstated an Arizona man's drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a defendant elects to cure such an error by exercising a peremptory
challenge and is subsequently convicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,
he has not been deprived of any rule-based or constitutional right,'' Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision, reversing a federal appeals court ruling, was a defeat for
Abel Martinez-Salazar, convicted and sentenced to 10 years and three months in
prison on charges of possessing heroin and a gun. He had been arrested in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   During jury selection, one potential juror said he probably would favor the
prosecution and that he assumed ``people are on trial because they did something
wrong.'' But he also said he understood that defendants are presumed innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial judge refused to remove the man from the jury pool ``for cause,''
and Martinez-Salazar's lawyer used one of his 11 automatic challenges to remove
him.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a new trial was needed
because the judge's error had forced the defense team to use an automatic
challenge when it should not have had to.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's decision said the appeals court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges ... is not denied or
impaired when the defendant chooses to use a peremptory challenge to remove a
juror who should have been excused for cause,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her opinion did not say whether Martinez-Salazar's conviction would have to
be overturned if he had sought, and had been denied, another automatic challenge
to make up for the one he used on the possibly biased man.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is U.S. vs. Martinez-Salazar, 98-1255.

<HEADLINE> Feds Settle $486M Health Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- A national chain of kidney dialysis centers has settled a
fraud case with the Justice Department for $486 million, federal officials
announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is the largest health care settlement in the department's
history.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement with the Massachusetts-based National Medical Care Inc.
includes a criminal fine of $101 million for wide-ranging misconduct, according
to a Justice Department statement issued today.
</P>
<P>
	   Also included are $385 million civil fines, penalties and restitution for
fraud related to Medicare and other government health care programs, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's landmark recovery comes as one more example of success in our
fight against health-care fraud, which has been a priority at the Justice
Department since 1993,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement includes allegations that company officials used Medicare and
other government health insurance programs to pay for hundreds of needless tests
for patients suffering from kidney disease, a condition that frequently requires
patients to receive dialysis, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also obtained referrals of lab business by paying
kickbacks, a violation of anti-kickback statutes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the civil settlement, whistle-blowers will collect $65.8
million of the $385 million civil recovery, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Medical Care is owned by Fresenius Medicare Care AG, a German
company that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services.
A representative from Fresenius Medical Care North America in Lexington did not
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Behind the Scenes at Columbia House  </HEADLINE>
    By AMY FINKELSTEIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Wilcha pulled off a working stiff's dream: He
quit his job at Columbia House, went to graduate school and made a sly, smart
film that exposed the business secrets of the music club giant.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he went back to work there.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Target Shoots First," the film the 28-year-old Wilcha eventually
assembled from more than 200 hours of tape, charts what he calls his "punk rock
identity crisis" as he becomes increasingly immersed in corporate culture and
the selling of his generation.
</P>
<P>
	   The film has been screened at the Vienna Film Festival, the New York Video
Festival and the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Wilcha has entered it in
this year's Slamdance festival held during the Sundance Film Festival in Park
City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed only with his experience managing a record store, and having an
obsessive music-collecting habit and a philosophy degree from New York
University, he landed an assistant marketing job at Columbia House in June 1993.
He showed up the first day with his Sony Hi-8 video camera -- a graduation gift
from mom and dad -- and just kept taping.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every mundane thing that ... happened in the workplace became an
opportunity ... to maybe reveal something about corporate work life," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   People didn't seem to mind. Wilcha cradled the camera in his arm and took it
everywhere: the mandatory employee picnic, music industry conventions, meetings
like the one where it is decided that to be more current, the company will call
"heavy metal" simply "metal."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilcha attends management training seminars where an enthusiastic
facilitator tells everyone to interact with an actual customer!
</P>
<P>
	   He navigates the volatile relationship between executives and creative
types: "I'm not really supposed to be a thinking person. I kind of feel like I'm
sort of like an idiot savant with a magic marker," one art director says.
</P>
<P>
	   And, somehow, he finds himself promoted to a level that demands
accountability: "What my father went to business school to study, I trained for
simply by being a committed consumer," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia House, Wilcha learns, can give away truckloads of free CDs because
they keep costs low and profit margins high on full-price items by manufacturing
their own CDs and paying artists reduced royalties and publishing rates. That
also benefits the record labels that co-own Columbia House -- Sony and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   "The personnel director explains that the benefit of corporate monopolies
like these is that as a Columbia House employee, I'll have access to both the
Sony and Time Warner cafeterias," Wilcha says in the film, which cost around
$10,000 to make.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilcha and like-minded employees actually get the chance to raise the
company's hipness factor and shatter ingrained policy when they are put in
charge of creating a new sales magazine in response to the exploding alternative
music scene.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our only goal is to see what we can get away with," Wilcha says in the
film. And they do: They divulge sales tactics, pick music from the club archives
that they personally like rather than blindly promote new releases, and even
sneak in some criticism. The magazine draws an overwhelming response.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we succeeded at was clear," Wilcha says in the film. "We not only
convinced the kids that consuming was cool, we made it seem like an act of
defiance."
</P>
<P>
	   Not long afterward, Wilcha decided he wanted to take filmmaking more
seriously and quit Columbia House to go to grad school at the California
Institute of the Arts. "I didn't think I had a career in direct mail music
marketing," he says. "I didn't think it was my calling."
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia House's reaction to the film has been muted, though Wilcha says he
made a point of showing it to top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Suzanne Passavant, the director of music club sales promotion -- and
Wilcha's boss -- says she thinks the movie humanized Columbia House by showing
people who are as passionate about music as their customers. And she says she
loved the film, despite a few "Ouch!"-inducing moments.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of things -- the relationship between different departments, the
chain of authority, how your relationship with co-workers changes as you move
into positions of responsibility -- that kind of a tale is true for any
corporation," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Passavant says she didn't take any of the comments about how Columbia House
is run as criticism, but feels the film didn't fully explain it. In return for
paying reduced royalty rates, she says, Columbia House spends hundreds of
millions of dollars advertising music, which people often end up buying straight
from a store rather than from the club.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called Wilcha when she heard he had finished grad school and
invited him to return to the company. Wilcha, who needed a job and money, took
her up on her offer.
</P>
<P>
	   "People who've seen the tape or friends of mine seem to be alternately
disappointed or amused," Wilcha says. "Either they're amused that I'm now using
the job I had to make the movie as the place I'm also doing my post-production
and promotion and marketing of the movie, or they're disappointed in that they
thought I tried to say something about corporate culture and that I somehow
betrayed the spirit of the film by going back.
</P>
<P>
	   "And the truth is, I feel like I'm going to exist in between these worlds
all the time."

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Jack Maple  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even as winter's first chill grips Times Square, distant
memories of mayhem warm Jack Maple.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over on Eighth Avenue, the hookers were four deep!" Maple enthuses as he
huffs down Broadway, reminiscing about his days as a gonzo street cop. Nodding
toward The New York Times building, he adds, "The pressmen got robbed all the
time!"
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may take credit for using police to tame Times
Square and secure the city during the 1990s. But Maple -- a portly,
working-class Queens native rarely seen in public without a bow tie, Homburg hat
and two-toned shoes -- may be more deserving.
</P>
<P>
	   A former deputy police commissioner and chief architect of the New York City
Police Department's heralded crime strategies, Maple, 45, makes a case for
himself in his new book, "The Crime Fighter: Putting the Bad Guys Out of
Business."
</P>
<P>
	   The book, published by Doubleday, is a first-person account of Maple's rise
from self-styled dandy with a badge to crime-stat junkie to high-priced
consultant -- and now author. One of his messages: complacency is the new
culprit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's patting themselves on the back that crime is down," Maple said
during a recent lunch in midtown Manhattan. "To me, it's absurd, especially
since violent crime in America is three and a half times higher than it was in
1961.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1960, there were 400 murders (in New York City). Why can't we be as good
as 1960? And use that just as the starting point?"
</P>
<P>
	   When Maple became a top adviser to Police Commissioner William Bratton in
1994, the city's annual body count still topped 2,000. The year the Bratton team
left -- 1996 -- the homicide total dropped below 1,000; last year it dipped to
629.
</P>
<P>
	   Why?
</P>
<P>
	   Forget favorable shifts in demographics, economics and crack cocaine
consumption. The crime decline in New York City, Maple argues, was too steep and
too rapid to accept answers from academia and not thank cops.
</P>
<P>
	   Maple makes that point by devoting much of the book to how Bratton and his
team overhauled the nation's largest police department. He describes arriving to
find a "dysfunctional" force with too many cops working banker's hours to combat
bad guys working round-the-clock, and leaving behind an efficient paramilitary
machine that uses computer tracking of crime trends to redeploy officers where
they're most needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Now pulling down three-figure consulting fees, Maple has personally taken
his formula to crime-weary cities like New Orleans, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The New York story is no fluke," he writes. "Everywhere I've been, the same
fundamental problems have to be addressed and the same fundamental solutions
work a cure."
</P>
<P>
	   Maple insists his book is not for criminal justice professionals, but for
the average reader. The self-effacing snapshots of Maple the eccentric -- he
admits he looks like a "cross between Quasimodo and Orson Welles" -- may prove
more entertaining than his lectures on crime fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   One of seven children of a postal worker and a nurses' aide, Maple started
as a transit cop patrolling Times Square. At the time, he writes, the streets
were a "smorgasbord for every miscreant, thief, robber and trickster of the
day."
</P>
<P>
	   Maple discovered he was good enough at outsmarting hoods to make detective.
His specialty was running subway decoy units -- cops who would dupe muggers by
portraying drunken businessmen, blind men, European tourists and even
transvestites.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, Maple developed a taste for fancy clothes, Dom
Perignon and running up bar tabs at the Plaza Hotel's Oak Room. He claims his
comic bookish makeover helped put him $28,000 in debt. He also claims it was
worth it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did it because I wanted to be known by crooks," he said. "And I wanted to
be better dressed than the assistant district attorneys."
</P>
<P>
	   On duty, Maple was frustrated by bosses who didn't like cops making arrests
because it meant leaving their posts and drawing overtime. Off duty, Maple, who
never went to college, was boning up on military history -- Hannibal, Nelson,
Patton, Eisenhower -- and devising his own strategies for "knocking down crime."
</P>
<P>
	   When Bratton arrived from Boston in 1990 to take over the then-separate
transit police department, Maple put his plan on paper and made his move.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said to myself, 'let's see what this guy's got," he recalled. "I staked
out his coffee pot, bumped into him on purpose and gave him the plan. ... And
the rest is history."

<HEADLINE> Fleming Brings Marschallin to Met  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Renee Fleming looks around the bar at restaurant Daniel,
surrounded by the ladies who lunch, the bold-faced names of the society columns
who have interrupted their Christmas shopping at Hermes, Gucci and Prada to
quaff champagne and nibble on a truffle or two.
</P>
<P>
	   Is this, she's asked, where the Marschallin, Strauss' most refined of
characters, would be at this very moment if she were alive and in New York City?
</P>
<P>
	   "Ab-so-lute-ly," she says, her voice rising and falling on the scales for
emphasis. "She would be lonely. She would have an inattentive husband and she
would be having a string of affairs with young men trying to fill that void."
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming's portrayal of the Marschallin, the Princess Werdenberg in "Der
Rosenkavalier" comes to the Metropolitan Opera starting today, following
appearances in Houston (1995), Paris, France, (1997) and Munich, Germany (1999).
</P>
<P>
	   She'll take it to London's Royal Opera in March, and "Strauss Heroines," a
stunningly beautiful recording containing nearly 45 minutes of excerpts, was
recently released by Decca. It is a disc that almost demands a recording of the
full opera from Fleming while she's in her prime.
</P>
<P>
	   As Fleming moves past 40, she is eight years older than the age of the
Marschallin created by composer Richard Strauss and librettist Hugo von
Hofmannsthal. The opera, which premiered in 1911, is set in Vienna in the 1740s
but its plot is repeated in the tabloids to this very day: women of society
dealing with growing old.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amazing thing every time I sing her, is two men created her," Fleming
says. "She's such an epitome of the female experience. I'll never get bored of
her. Hopefully, I'll have a full career of fleshing out the character."
</P>
<P>
	   In the opera, the Marschallin is having an affair with Octavian, a 17-year
from a noble family. Her cousin, Baron Ochs of Lerchenau, plans to marry Sophie,
the daughter of Faninal, a wealthy merchant. By the end of the opera, the
Marschallin loses the heart of her younger lover to Sophie and contemplates the
loss of youth.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's how they are, young people," Faninal tells the Marschallin just
before the curtain falls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ja, ja," she responds in a voice filled with both melancholy and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
	   A successful Marschallin must have not only a creamy voice, but one that's
big enough to get through Strauss' thick orchestration in the first act and
still have lieder-like intonation for the third act trio. There have been a few:
Lotte Lehmann, Lisa Della Casa, Maria Reining, Elisabeth Schwartzkopf and Regine
Crespin, among them.
</P>
<P>
	   "It always surprises me when people say Strauss is sugary and lightweight,"
Fleming says.
</P>
<P>
	   The lot of the Marschallin is not an easy one. She is beaming at the
beginning, so filled the life and happiness, but midway through the first act,
she becomes overwhelmed with sadness.
</P>
<P>
	   "But how can it really be, that I was once little Resi and that one day I
shall be an old woman?" she sings. "An old woman, the old Marschallin! 'D'you
see, there she goes, old Princess Resi!' How can this come about? How can our
dear Lord make it so? When I am still the same person? And if He must make it
so, why does He let me see it so, why does He let me see it all so very clearly?
Why does He not hide it from me? It's all a mystery, so very much a mystery. And
we are here to bear it. And in the 'how,' there lies the whole difference."
</P>
<P>
	   For Fleming, the Marschallin is much like the Countess Almaviva in Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro" -- another role she's sung to acclaim. The Countess
flirts with the pageboy Cherubino, triggering jealousy in the Count.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's not yet had the affairs," Fleming says. "This is the Countess maybe
10 years later."
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming thinks back to Houston and recalls how she was "scrambling just to
get myself together vocally." Since then, there have been dramatic upheavals in
her life -- the breakup of her marriage to actor Rick Ross, and her skyrocketing
ascent to the very top of the classical music world. On the recording, her
account is deep and nuanced.
</P>
<P>
	   "My goal is very clear, and it's to move people," she says. "To get to the
heart of the role for me is in the acting. The 10 years of my career were all
technically focused for me -- the voice. I'm sure in 10 more years I'll be
technically focused because it will all be coming apart and I'll be changing to
try to keep it together."
</P>
<P>
	   The Marschallin is focused on time and so are singers who have performed the
part. The voice in 10 years won't be the same. The tick, tick, tick can't be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   "Look how fleeting these 10 years have gone, 20 years," Fleming says. "I
look at my two daughters. They're too grown up! I want them to be babies again.
I don't know anybody ... who is thinking time should go by faster."

<HEADLINE> Macy Gray Vies for Grammy Award  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- One of pop music's most distinctive new voices belongs to a
woman who never thought she could sing.
</P>
<P>
	   Macy Gray's voice is quite unlike anything you've ever heard before, a
curious combination of little-girl giddiness and old man's rasp. It's a
beguiling come-on for her music. Then you notice the strength of her songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gray's debut album, "On How Life Is," made many critics' top ten lists for
1999 and earned her a Grammy nomination this month for best new artist. With
blues rocker Susan Tedeschi, she represents an adult alternative to youthful
favorites Christina Aguilera, Kid Rock and Britney Spears in the Grammy
category.
</P>
<P>
	   Growing up in Ohio, and even later when she was singing in Los Angeles, Gray
was uncertain of her voice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought I could sing," she said. "I never even tried. It never even
entered my mind when I was little. That was the last thing I thought I could
do."
</P>
<P>
	   After she had moved west to attend film school,
</P>
<P>
	   Gray and a friend who owned recording equipment starting writing songs
together and committing them to tape. Gray would do the guide vocals and another
singer would come in and do it over.
</P>
<P>
	   But for one song, her friend left Gray's voice intact and began playing the
tape for people. It received more attention than any of the others, and a new
career was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Her music hearkens back to the more organic soul of a different era. She's a
fan of Sly Stone, Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder and Parliament; traces of Prince and
Al Green are recognizable in her record, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've stolen a lot of different things from a lot of different people," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But for an introduction to a music industry high-roller, Gray may not have
stood out from the pack. After Epic Records won a bidding war for Gray, company
president Polly Anthony urged her to talk to Andy Slater, who manages the
Wallflowers and Fiona Apple, and produced Apple's debut record.
</P>
<P>
	   Slater liked her music, but thought it sounded a bit too generic, with the
same keyboard sounds and production approach used by many other rhythm 'n' blues
artists. He encouraged Gray to work with some new musicians, including hot
producer Jon Brion. Brion brought along some of the odd instruments he's
fascinated with, like the old-fashioned synthesizer, the chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gray admitted to being suspicious at first, since Slater had little
experience in urban music, and watched in wonder as musicians brought in things
like a drum kit that looked like it belonged on "The Flintstones."
</P>
<P>
	   She was won over when she realized Slater wanted to enhance her sound, not
change it.
</P>
<P>
	   "These little touches made all the difference in the world," she said. "It
made it a hot record."
</P>
<P>
	   The heart of Gray's disc stems from a particularly intense relationship. On
the ballad "I Try," Gray sings of the difficulty in walking away even when you
know things aren't working. "My world crumbles when you are not near," she
sings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Still" is written from the chilling perspective of an abused woman. Again,
it tries to explain what brings people to stay in a relationship when logic is
screaming at them to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't like the 'Burning Bed,' but sometimes you argue," she said. "You
yell and scream, and after awhile, you start throwing stuff. You have nothing
else to say but you're still mad. It just got crazy sometimes. I'd never been
that much in love, and I'd never been in a situation where I was fighting with
someone, either. That was a crazy, crazy time."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the disc has been out, she's met several women who've told her the
song struck a chord. Even women who look like they're completely together would
recount similar situations.
</P>
<P>
	   She's not trying to support staying in an abusive relationship. "I'm just
saying a lot of people have found themselves in that situation," Gray said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've Committed Murder" is, despite its title, a love song. The narrator
fantasizes about striking back at a boss who makes her man's life miserable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every woman knows that the woman is the hero a lot of the times," she said.
"You'll be with a guy and he might get into a fight, and you'll be the one who
has to go over and knock the guy on his head."
</P>
<P>
	   Gray sees herself working in music for a few more years, then wants to get
back into her first love: film. Maybe then she'll go back to her real name --
Natalie McIntyre. The real Macy Gray was a family friend that she always used as
a character when writing screenplays. She liked the sound of it so much she
decided to use it as a stage name.
</P>
<P>
	   Mom comes to see her daughter perform and stands there with a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "My family is real proud of me, finally," said Gray, who's 30. "That's
actually nice when your parents are proud of you. I've never felt that before.
They've never been ashamed of me, but they're just glad I've finally got it
together."

<HEADLINE> Mozart at Theatre de la Jeune Lune  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Theatre de la Jeune Lune's staging of "The Magic
Flute" is an unconventional take on the operatic classic, but its masterminds
are confident they've captured the spirit of what Mozart had in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1791 version of "The Magic Flute" was a collaboration between Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart and Emanuel Schikaneder, who owned the Theater auf der Wieden in
Vienna, a rowdy, raucous stage that catered more to the masses than royalty. The
fairy-tale story line dealt with the ordeals Prince Tamino, aided by a
bird-catching sidekick and a magic flute, had to endure to find the beautiful
Pamina and win her love.
</P>
<P>
	   In updating the story, Jeune Lune wasn't very interested in Schikaneder's
libretto, but the collaborators were in love with Mozart's music.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the mortar of the whole project," said Dominique Serrand,
co-artistic director.
</P>
<P>
	   The updated story takes place in a beer hall on New Year's Eve of 1999, on
the cusp of the new millennium, and owes more to vaudeville than traditional
opera. Jeune Lune (French for New Moon) stages it in a cabaret setting. Actors
serve drinks to the audience before and during the show, and the parts are
played and sung in a hash of English, German and Italian.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that Jeune Lune tossed out the traditional version completely.
</P>
<P>
	   The new libretto, by actors Steven Epp and Bradley Greenwald, still has the
Queen of the Night asking the handsome Tamino to find her daughter, Pamina, and
he's still aided in the search by the loyal Papageno.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, though, Pamina isn't being held prisoner by the high priest
Sarastro; she's just missing, ill, hungry and wearing rags when she turns up in
the beer hall and meets Tamino for the first time. The trials they must both
overcome before they can finally be together mostly involve the pain of
separation instead of a series of tests imposed by a mystical order of priests.
In the end, they are reunited and slay a dragon together, shortly before the
clock ticks down the last seconds of the old millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   And for the new version, Papageno is the resident light-bulb changer at the
beer hall, which is festooned in holiday lights, and he wears a garish coat of
red and blue with lime-green pants instead of a feathered bird suit. Instead of
Papageno finding his true love in the bird-suited Papagena as in the original,
he finds his Papagena in the Queen of the Night.
</P>
<P>
	   While the queen was irredeemably evil throughout the original and starts out
as "The Mother of All Mothers" in the new one, this time she gets transformed by
love.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the second act plays out on a dangerously sloped stage, so the
players wear tennis shoes for traction, climbing up and sliding down as the
story progresses.
</P>
<P>
	   Sopranos Janet Gottschall Fried and Jennifer Baldwin Peden play the Queen of
the Night and Pamina respectively, tenor Patrick Miller is Tamino, and bass Mark
Dietrich is Sarastro. A string ensemble kept purposely small lets the singers'
clear voices fill the cavernous old warehouse that houses the theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Epp plays the wisecracking head waiter whose mostly spoken part keeps the
story moving forward and ensures things never get too serious. His sidekick,
Irma, played by co-artistic director Barbra Berlovitz, is given to quoting Yogi
Berra in ways that say a lot about the journey the audience is taking.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you come to a fork in the road, take it," Irma says at one point. "If
you don't know where you're going, you'll end up somewhere else," she proclaims
at another.
</P>
<P>
	   Epp said he and Greenwald, a baritone who plays Papageno, wanted to capture
the spirit of what Mozart and Schikaneder originally staged, and they wanted to
find the same "intimacy and playfulness."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenwald noted there was "nothing courtly" about Schikaneder's theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "People brought food and ate and drank while they watched the show," Epp
said. "They would sing along and yell stuff at the actors. ... Down and dirty
and fun."
</P>
<P>
	   While their wholesale revamping of "The Magic Flute" might shock purists,
Epp and Greenwald said they've received many compliments from people well-versed
in the original.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had actually quite a few musicians or people who know the opera
really well say afterwards that it was like hearing the music for the first
time," Greenwald said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is a surprise to them because they don't know what's going to
happen next," Epp added.
</P>
<P>
	   The show opened Nov. 27, and its run has been extended by popular demand
until Jan. 30.

<HEADLINE> What of Shakespeare Tomorrow?  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LENOX, Mass. (AP) -- In a Berkshire wood where day turned foul for Dick
Clark, Barry Manilow and Bob Dylan, lovers of Shakespeare fancy building their
own brave new world.
</P>
<P>
	   Shakespeare &AMP; Co. believes the 436-year-old playwright's work can win public
favor where the backing of big names in the music industry could not. The
theater troupe is buying an idyllic 63-acre site from the National Music
Foundation, which boasted Clark and others as backers but failed to erect a
museum and performing center for all styles of American music.
</P>
<P>
	   In a swamp of soaps, sitcoms and other stale plot lines, the Bard still
tells "the best stories in our current millennium," says Dan McCleary, marketing
director of Shakespeare &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the theater company's leaders say that unlike the music group,
they have built a broad base of contributors and grants since their founding 21
years ago at The Mount, where writer Edith Wharton lived. Their main goals and
prime subject -- Shakespeare -- are also more easily grasped than the music
foundation's nebulous aim of a shrine to American music, complete with
retirement housing for musicians. Who beats Shakespeare, after all, for name
recognition?
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, too, Shakespeare has hardly seen so fair a day an ocean away from
his homeland, according to those who perform, promote and sell his work. A
clutch of popular movies and videos, more teaching projects, and even the
Internet are demystifying Shakespeare, who has been associated by so many
Americans with iambic pentameter, annotations, spit balls and boredom.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really burst upon the scene with a new vitality," said Adriana
Mnuchin, co-founder of the New York-based Shakespeare Society.
</P>
<P>
	   Her group, which promotes Shakespeare's works to the American public, is a
case in point: In two years since its founding, it has swelled to more than 450
members.
</P>
<P>
	   But Shakespeare's name has perhaps never smelled sweeter to the film
industry than in recent years. Moviegoers have watched Leonardo Di Caprio as an
urban Romeo and also seen Denzel Washington as a dashing Don Pedro in "Much Ado
About Nothing." Gwyneth Paltrow has been the focus of Shakespeare's longings in
"Shakespeare in Love." Michelle Pfeiffer played queen fairy Titania in
"Midsummer Night's Dream." Screen heavyweight Al Pacino has wrestled with the
essence of "King Richard III" in the documentary "Looking for Richard."
</P>
<P>
	   Dollars were made. "Shakespeare in Love" collected seven Academy Awards and
more than $94 million in North America. "Much Ado About Nothing" and several
other Shakespeare films also charmed mass audiences, often with spirited use of
the original language.
</P>
<P>
	   Shakespeare &AMP; Co. is banking on that appeal with its $9 million plan to
redevelop its new site in the Berkshire County town of Lenox, which is also home
to the Tanglewood classical music festival. The Shakespeare troupe -- one of
about 120 Shakespeare festivals in North America -- takes over its expansive new
home in April, eventually performing live theater and training actors there. It
will give its first performance in summer 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Last season, at The Mount, the troupe put on "As You Like It," "King Richard
III," "Love's Labor's Lost," and a smattering of other fare, including
adaptations from the writings of Wharton.
</P>
<P>
	   The troupe, with a $2.8 million budget and 170 employees at peak season,
also teaches Shakespeare in public and private schools, reaching about 30,000
students. Some of the company's programs help inner-city teen-agers around
Massachusetts work out their problems by acting out Shakespeare's universal
tales of greed, hatred, folly, foolishness, love and lust.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are kids who ... probably couldn't put together two sentences with a
subject and verb, who are speaking Shakespeare not because they understand the
words, but because they understand the experience," said McCleary.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Epstein, who has acted in Shakespeare's plays around the country,
believes more children and adults will learn about themselves and human
relations through Shakespeare in such workshops.
</P>
<P>
	   But he fears the mass appeal of television and some new media, while
broadening familiarity with the Bard, will tend to crowd out live performances.
He says some festivals may founder without an Elizabethan stage or engaging
actors with magic to stir the dull ear of a drowsy man.
</P>
<P>
	   "We as actors have to think of ways to be much more dynamic -- or it will
die," he said of live Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
	   At least Shakespearean actors have some better-than-average slings and
arrows to work with.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Season Offers Some Star Turns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Movie-goers will get "shafted" in 2000 and see Tom
Cruise accomplish another impossible mission. But first, a little quiet time.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the summer spectacles hit, including "Mission: Impossible 2" and an
update of the 1970s detective franchise "Shaft," Hollywood enters its
traditional winter hibernation.
</P>
<P>
	   For the next few months, new movies will roll out in a trickle compared with
the mad Oscar dash of late last year. Though it's the industry's slowest period,
there is some star power sprinkled in the mix, with films featuring Leonardo
DiCaprio, Julia Roberts, Madonna, Meg Ryan, Bruce Willis -- and Tigger, Pooh and
Eeyore.
</P>
<P>
	   The first four months of 1999 amounted to a buildup toward the first "Star
Wars" movie in 16 years. The film industry slumped until "Phantom Menace"
debuted in May and went on to launch a record year at the box office.
</P>
<P>
	   The blockbuster picture is a little less certain this year, though Cruise's
"Mission: Impossible" sequel, due out around Memorial Day, is a safe bet.
Besides "Shaft," starring Samuel L. Jackson, here's some other films that may
lead the summer hit parade:
</P>
<P>
	   --"Battlefield Earth," with John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forrest Whitaker
in the adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's sci-fi combat tale.
</P>
<P>
	   --"Dinosaur," Disney's prehistoric adventure that sets computer animated
reptiles against live-action backdrops.
</P>
<P>
	   --"Me, Myself and Irene," starring Jim Carrey as a cop with two
personalities, both in love with the same woman, played by Renee Zellweger. From
Peter and Bobby Farrelly, makers of "There's Something About Mary."
</P>
<P>
	   --"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" brings the beloved
moose-and-squirrel team out of retirement in a comedy combining animation and
live action and starring Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander and Renee Russo.
</P>
<P>
	   --"Nutty 2: The Klumps," Eddie Murphy's sequel to "The Nutty Professor,"
co-stars Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   The year's first new movie, "Fantasia/2000," opened New Year's Day for a
four-month run at big-screen Imax theaters before moving to regular cinemas this
summer. A few other movies debuted the first two weeks of the year, including
Ice Cube's "Next Friday" and the sci-fi tale "Supernova."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rebel Chinese Director Shows Film  </HEADLINE>
    By RENEE SCHOOF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China's rebel director Zhang Yuan, acclaimed abroad for his
edgy films, finally escaped the censors' long ban on his works at home Wednesday
to show his award-winning new movie, "Seventeen Years."
</P>
<P>
	   The story tells of a 16-year-old who kills her stepsister in a moment of
rage, spends 17 years in prison and finally is allowed a brief Lunar New Year
visit home, where she confronts the churning but suppressed emotions of her
mother and stepfather. Zhang said it is based on a true case.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhang, 36, all of whose previous works were effectively banned in China, had
to pass more than one hurdle: Not only did government film censors have to
approve the script and final version, but the prison scenes needed Justice
Ministry approval as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the afternoon premiere at Beijing's Youth Palace, Zhang
matter-of-factly described the difficulties in making "Seventeen Years." But he
refused to elaborate about other run-ins with the censors and said he was happy
that Chinese audiences could finally see one of his films.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's rather hard to see my films in Beijing. I mean, you can't do it,"
Zhang said. "They didn't pass, so you can only see this one."
</P>
<P>
	   Zhang's banned works included "Beijing Bastards," about apolitical punk
rockers, "East Palace, West Palace," whose title referred to a public restroom
in Beijing that was a meeting place for gays, and "Sons," about an alcoholic and
mentally ill man and his wife and sons, filmed partly in a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   When "East Palace, West Palace" was presented at the Cannes Film Festival in
1997, Chinese authorities refused to allow Zhang to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "Seventeen Years," while still realistic and full of tension, is about the
politically correct theme of a model prisoner on the edge of a new life, helped
by a selfless prison guard. Its prison scenes offer a rare glimpse into the
Spartan conditions of the Chinese penal system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Seventeen Years" won the directors' award at the Venice Film Festival.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Uninsured Americans  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed a $110 billion package
of health insurance initiatives, which would be the biggest investment in health
coverage since the establishment of Medicare in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was ``a very ambitious'' proposal and that he was ``quite
hopeful'' that Congress would enact his proposals during this election year. ``I
am elated that health care is an issue in the campaign,'' the president said in
an Oval Office ceremony. ``It is a good thing. It is an issue in people's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's program faces a stiff test in Congress, where many of the same
proposals died last year when he proposed even smaller versions. However, he
said the budget prospect is brighter now with Republicans disavowing plans to
return with another huge tax cut like the $792 billion version they passed --
and he vetoed -- last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday marks the beginning of the last year of Clinton's presidency.
``Tomorrow's the day, isn't it,'' he said. ``I will certainly mark the day.'' He
said he wished he could go without sleep for the whole year. ``I just want to
milk every last second of it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton remarked on the huge sweep of his proposal. ``If enacted, this would
be the largest investment in health coverage since the establishment of Medicare
in 1965, one of the most significant steps we could take to help working
families,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 44 million Americans lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurance was Clinton's signature issue when he won the presidency in
1992, but Congress ignored his sweeping proposal for universal health coverage.
He has made headway on several fronts, however, including a major expansion of
insurance for children through Medicaid and the state Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   The major element of Clinton's new program is a proposal to build on the
CHIP initiative by providing coverage for parents of children in the CHIP. The
White House said the measure would provide coverage for about 4 million
uninsured parents at a cost of $76 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also urged accelerating the enrollment of uninsured children
in Medicaid and CHIP, adding 400,000 children at a cost of $5.5 billion over 10
years. While enrollment in CHIP doubled to 2 million children in 1999, millions
remain eligible but unenrolled, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another major component would provide tax breaks to help 2 million Americans
struggling to provide long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives. Last
year Congress approved a 100 percent deduction for long-term care premiums but
it was part of the $792 billion tax-cut bill that the president vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   Another proposal would resurrect Clinton's plan to allow workers as young as
55 to buy into the Medicare program. Congress ignored the proposal last year.
This time, Clinton would make the proposal even more attractive for workers --
and more costly for the government -- by offering a 25 percent tax credit for
participants in the Medicare buy-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is intended to help the baby-boom generation as it nears
retirement. The percentage of uninsured is growing fastest among people ages 55
to 65; even more growth is expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of the buy-in and credit over 10 years would be about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also proposed aid to help workers to buy COBRA health
insurance when they leave a job. The COBRA program allows workers to buy into
their employer's health plan for up to 18 to 36 months, provided they pay the
premium. However, fewer than 25 percent of eligible people buy the coverage, in
part because of the cost, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would offer a 25 percent tax credit for COBRA premiums
to make the cost more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   Other provisions of Clinton's initiative would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Give a 20 percent tax credit to small businesses to buy health insurance
through purchasing coalitions. The initiative would be limited to companies that
have not previously offered health insurance to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to insure children through age 20.
</P>
<P>
	   --Extend Medicaid coverage for people who leave welfare rolls to take a job.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to provide insurance for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allocate at least $1 billion over 10 years to help public hospitals,
clinics and thousands of health care providers give health care to the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   In his final budget proposal, Clinton will triple the size of last year's
initiative. It would cost $28 billion over 10 years, providing up to $3,000 in
tax credits for eligible families. The White House is betting that an
election-minded Congress will be more receptive to the idea now as the baby boom
generation nears retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials refused to say how Clinton would pay for his costly
initiatives. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the administration
would not release details until the president's budget is unveiled Feb. 7. But
the proposal likely will be drawn into the battle over how to spend a huge
projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $1.25 billion over 10 years for
local agencies that support family caregivers with counseling, training and care
techniques. The money would be awarded to state and local ``agencies on aging,''
created by the 1965 Older Americans Act.
</P>
<P>
	   If enacted, the credit for long-term care would be phased in beginning with
$1,000 in 2001, rising in $500 increments so that eligible people would receive
$3,000 in 2005. The credit would be phased out beginning at $110,000 in income
for families and $75,000 for unmarried taxpayers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 64.22; Nasdaq Down 5.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors penalized Microsoft
for a profit report that met published estimates but failed to impress some Wall
Street analysts. Financial stocks rose, however, on the strength of corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
64.22 at 11,496.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were little changed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 0.08 at 1,455.22, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 5.95 at
4,124.86.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 6 3/16 from its 4 p.m. price Tuesday to 109 1/8 today. Late
Tuesday, the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its
fiscal second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said Microsoft's "whisper number" -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as 49 cents per
share, setting up some investors for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft officials warned analysts about a potential slowdown in demand for
personal computers. Also, some analysts suggested Microsoft had benefited from
strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than strength in the software
business.
</P>
<P>
	   "Microsoft made their numbers and did not change the guidance, but they got
there in a very different way than expected," said Don Young, a Microsoft
analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings reports, which are generally expected to show robust growth, are
dominating trading this week. Chase Manhattan rose 3 3/16 to 74 3/16 after
reporting earnings of $1.97 per share, easily exceeding estimates of $1.32 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Bear Stearns reported earnings of $1.64 per share, blowing past First Call
estimates of $1.20. The brokerage said the robust U.S. equity market had driven
stock underwriting activity to record levels. Bear Stearns rose 1 to 43.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong earnings reports and a moderate improvement in the bond market
helped financial stocks to broad gains today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell to 6.72 percent from 6.75 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of the lagging groups are stabilizing," said Don Selkin, chief
investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. "The fact that we're able to
hold at these levels while there's weakness in Microsoft indicates that the
market is doing quite nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 484.39 million shares, slightly ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.74 to 515.20.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Can Nix Frivolous Appeals  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it easier for
court-appointed lawyers to refuse to file appeals for criminally convicted
clients whose claims they think are frivolous.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld California's procedures governing what
court-appointed lawyers must do in such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Those procedures vary from a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that limited
court-appointed lawyers' ability to back out of filing appeals but Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote for the court today that the variance did not doom
California's system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question is whether that departure is fatal. We hold that it is not,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1967 decision said lawyers appointed to represent indigent clients could
not refuse to pursue an appeal simply by filing a letter saying there were no
issues worthy of consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the court said back then that lawyers in such instances must file a
brief identifying any issues that might support an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, lawyers seeking to avoid filing an appeal are required to
file a brief summarizing the procedural and factual history of their clients'
case but do not have to identify any legal issue that arguably could support an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In ruling that California prison inmate Lee Robbins was entitled to a new
appeal in state courts, a federal appeals court ruled the state's system wrongly
had allowed a court-appointed lawyer to stop short of filing an appeal without
the proper safeguards for Robbins' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's decision said the appeals court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any view of the procedure we described in (1967) that converted it from a
suggestion into a straitjacket would contravene our established practice, rooted
in federalism, of allowing the states wide discretion ... to experiment with
solutions to difficult problems of policy,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the four, Souter said the California system allows
court-appointed lawyers to remain too passive. ``Although (the state's
procedure) assumes that counsel will act as an advocate, it fails to assure, or
even promote, the partisan attention that the Constitution requires,'' Souter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court sent Robbins' case back to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for further study of his claims that he was denied effective legal help on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbins was convicted of second-degree murder in Los Angeles in the 1988
shooting death of his former roommate. He was sentenced to 17 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Smith vs. Robbins, 98-1037.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank company said earnings in its fourth quarter rose 46 percent to
$1.97 per share, easily exceeding analysts' forecasts of $1.32 per share. Chase
said investment banking fees rose 31 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper company earned 81 cents per share in the quarter, below First
Call/Thomson Financial's consensus view of 92 cents. Weyerhaeuser cited effects
of a lockout at some British Columbia ports and Hurricane Floyd-related cleanup
costs in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said fourth-quarter motorcycle sales increased 17.9 percent to
$530.2 million from the final quarter of 1998. For the year, motorcycle sales
rose 18.5 percent to $1.89 billion. The company cited increased production
capacity and popular new lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The company hired Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. to advise its board on strategic
options, which may include the possible sale or merger of the company. Mark IV
is a manufacturing company focused on power transmission and components for
industrial and automotive markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from Bank of Scotland
PLC, said Wednesday that there was "little indication" of how the Scottish
bank's proposal to spend money on NatWest branches would enhance revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday, the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per
share, in its fiscal second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by

Microsoft had benefited from strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than

also announced a 2-for-1 stock split. The stock price had run up sharply ahead
of the earnings announcement, prompting some profit-taking after the report.

    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- As a youngster, Janice Soprano took the ballet shoes her
parents had bought her and sold them. Then she used the money to score
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, this was a girl you needed to keep an eye on.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, after 20 years' absence from the fold, she has shown up unannounced to
add to brother Tony's woes. And as viewers of "The Sopranos" are finding out in
the show's second season, you just can't take your eyes off of her.
</P>
<P>
	   Scheming behind her Earth Mother pretense, Janice manages to give her
mob-boss brother fits.
</P>
<P>
	   Even more impressive: Aida Turturro, the actress portraying this
hippie-on-the-make, more than holds her own in the company of James Gandolfini,
who continues to command the screen as Tony.
</P>
<P>
	   Sis, who has renamed herself for the Hindu goddess Pavarti, is back in New
Jersey to look after their ailing mother. Or so she says. But as a lifelong free
spirit (and free agent), she seems to be working all the angles in the family
circle. Doesn't she really aim to sponge off the old lady? Or worse?
</P>
<P>
	   "You come riding into town like some Vishnu-come-lately trying to play the
concerned daughter," Tony scoffs. "Who are you kidding? You're just here to pick
the ... bones."
</P>
<P>
	   That's one opinion. But Turturro is eager to advance another view.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe she's trouble," allows the actress in mounting a defense, "but I
don't think she's looking for trouble. She's come for the things she needs. And
she wants to see her family again.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's got a lot of love." At that, Turturro senses a reporter's skepticism.
"Well, I think she does."
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe so. On "The Sopranos," where the characters are complex and often
contradictory, anything is possible. And it's in the can. Filming recently
wrapped on the HBO series, whose 13-episode run began last week and continues
Sunday at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   "I miss 'em," Turturro says of the cast and crew with whom she worked the
past six months. "The show was a blessing. I felt like I fell in love."
</P>
<P>
	   Who could blame her? "Usually," Turturro cracks, "you're playing the
prostitute, the secretary or the psychic." Full-figured and vivacious, she
laughs at her plight. "How many psychics have I played? Six psychics in five
movies!"
</P>
<P>
	   The daughter of an abstract painter who loved opera, Aida grew up in a
converted synagogue on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Her cousins -- the future
Turturro actors John ("Cradle Will Rock," "Quiz Show") and Nicholas ("NYPD
Blue") -- lived over in Queens. "I used to love to visit them when I was a kid."
</P>
<P>
	   But she came to acting on her own. "Growing up, I was so shy! Then one day
in eighth grade I did this improvisation in class, and something clicked. I
thought, 'I guess this is what I'm going to do."'
</P>
<P>
	   She did, and her performances led to a supporting role in the 1992 Broadway
revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire," in which another up-and-comer, James
Gandolfini, played her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a real chemistry," she recalls, "and I knew it from Day One: He's
really talented. My friends would say, 'We know.' And I'd say, 'No, no, he's
REALLY talented and special.'
</P>
<P>
	   "James was the one who thought I should audition to play his sister," she
adds, laughing at the rightness of it all. "He knew how I could aggravate him!"
</P>
<P>
	   But years before "Streetcar," Turturro had landed a role in a vastly
different theater piece, "Tony n' Tina's Wedding." An audience-interactive
comedy, it consisted of mock nuptials in a real Greenwich Village chapel which
ticket-holders attended as "invited guests," followed by a rollicking reception
at a neighborhood catering hall.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Italian-American wedding party, Turturro played a bridesmaid named
Marina Gulino. Since Marina's date had stood her up, "I had a lot of time to sit
and improvise with people, one on one," she thinks back with amusement. "And
every night I had to pick up a guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Turturro did the show for two years. "Now, I'm basically one of the best
flirts around."
</P>
<P>
	   Never married, she lists husband and children among her goals, as well as a
country house with a walk-in closet. But thanks to "The Sopranos," another
hurdle may already have been cleared: relief from playing secretaries,
prostitutes and psychics. Six is enough.

	   'CITY OF ANGELS': Following its preview Sunday, this new medical drama
settles into its regular time period tonight at 8 p.m. EST on CBS. The staff is
mostly black, and so are the patients, at Angel of Mercy Hospital, the setting
for this bold effort to put minority characters center stage. Blair Underwood
("L.A. Law") stars as the acting chief of surgery, Vivica A. Fox (the movies'
"Independence Day," "Soul Food") portrays the new director brought in to
resuscitate the failing Los Angeles facility. Black writers and directors are
key members of the production, including co-executive producer and co-creator
Paris Barclay, who shares those duties with Steven Bochco ("NYPD Blue," "Hill

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Misses Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today it may take several weeks to
determine why a prototype missile interceptor -- a key part of its proposed
national missile defense -- failed to hit its target over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to the expected moment of impact Tuesday night, the interceptor appeared
to be on track to the target, a mock warhead launched from Vandenberg Air Force
Base, Calif., Pentagon spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was extremely close,'' she said. But there was no immediate indication
of what went wrong, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor, a high-tech ``kill vehicle'' designed to destroy a missile
warhead by ramming it head-on, was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands about 20 minutes after the target lifted off from Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said it was too soon to say what
impact the failure would have on the decision whether to move forward with the
program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no reason at this point in time to say one way or another
definitively that this will have an effect on the self-imposed deadline,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   An official who monitored the test Tuesday night from the Pentagon said
today the interceptor seemed to have ``seen'' the target, using its on-board
sensors, as the two objects closed toward each other. That is one of the final
crucial steps to an intercept. The official discussed the matter on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon, working with Boeing Co. and other contractors involved in the
project, is undertaking an extensive review of the test data, and the results
may not be known for several weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,''
spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said the 121-pound, 55-inch long interceptor, built by Raytheon
Corp., was launched successfully from Kwajalein Atoll. ``What happened after it
got into space we do not know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United
States, and a successful intercept would have provided a dramatic boost to the
Pentagon's effort to show a limited missile defense system can work.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a leading supporter of missile defense, issued a
statement today while traveling in Europe in which he called on Congress to give
the Pentagon more money to ``work out the kinks'' in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a setback, by any means,'' Weldon said of the Tuesday night
test. ``The purpose of a testing program is to determine problems and resolve
them before a system goes into production. Testing failures are not only common,
but to some extent necessary to perfect a system's performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pentagon officials had high hopes for a successful intercept, they
noted in pre-launch interviews that setbacks were to be expected in any
experimental military project, especially one as complicated as missile defense.
Depending on what went wrong, the failed intercept may not be a serious setback,
although it is certain to provide fuel for critics who say the system would be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsuccessful test also may cause consternation among congressional
Republicans who have been pushing President Clinton to go forward with a system
that could defend against attacks by countries such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to go ahead with a
national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates would cost at least $12.7
billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005, although
many officials involved in the program believe that may be too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading Republican presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, both favor deploying a national missile defense
as soon as possible. Among the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
says numerous factors -- including the affordability of such a defense and its
geopolitical ramifications -- must be considered. Bill Bradley is even less
enthusiastic, saying he believes the U.S. nuclear arsenal provides sufficient
deterrence to a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials had asserted before the test that even if the interceptor
failed to hit its target, there were other important goals for the test,
including the first test of a computerized battle management system that is
designed to communicate with the interceptor as it soars into space.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said there was no immediate word on whether these other aspects of
the test worked as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The next interceptor test is scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial test last October resulted in a successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen protesters held a vigil outside Vandenberg Air Force Base
on Tuesday to protest the test.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuclear powers Russia and China are the most vocal opponents of a proposed
U.S. national missile defense, but it is North Korea -- economically destitute,
politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that Clinton administration
officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, like Iraq or
Iran.

</P>
<P>
	   "I had a seventh-grade teacher who told me if I didn't fool around during

Instead of bugging everybody, I'd figure out my routine. It's amazing how
important that was." -- Comedian Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Spoken one year ago:
</P>
<P>
	   "This stuff feels funny. I keep thinking. 'Why now? I do a part in this
small movie. I get no money. And now?' It is almost like an injection of oxygen
to the brain. It makes you lightheaded." -- Bill Murray, reacting to the
overwhelming response from film critics for his supporting role in "Rushmore."

	   Sarah McLachlan's "Mirrorball" has been nominated for a Grammy Award for
best pop album. "It's recognition from the industry. ... that you've achieved

movies. So how did the daughter of Peter Fonda and granddaughter of Henry Fonda

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Les Claypool  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME HOLGUIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- When bass player Les Claypool is not touring with Primus,
he can likely be found on a tractor, mowing weeds at his Northern California
ranch. Claypool lives with his family on a 30-acre property that has a sizable
lake.
</P>
<P>
	   "Life at Rancho Relaxo is good; a little floating, a little fishing," he
said. "I'm out in the wilderness running around nude, looking for Sasquatch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes I think I'm Sasquatch," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   His peculiar humor arrives not unexpectedly backstage at a recent tour stop.
Since organizing Primus a decade ago, Claypool has created a cast of fictional
characters: Sathington Willoughby, Tommy the Cat and Bodacious, a bovine
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Ballad of Bodacious" is one of 13 new songs featured on "Antipop"
(Interscope Records), the latest album from Primus, which consists of Claypool,
guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia.
</P>
<P>
	   College radio helped establish Primus in the alternative music market, so
"people who weren't familiar with Primus got the perspective that we were this
... silly band," the 36-year-old Claypool said. It probably doesn't help that
Primus recorded the theme song for the outrageous animated series "South Park."
</P>
<P>
	   For "Antipop," Primus asked "South Park" co-creator Matt Stone to help
produce one of the songs. The band also called on ex-Police drummer Stewart
Copeland, Tom Waits, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and Tom Morello of Rage Against
the Machine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coattails of a Dead Man," the album's most unusual song, was co-written by
Waits, who received an early acoustic version before recording it. "I kept it
pretty bare-bones because I knew Tom would get a concept or a vision and just
roll with it," Claypool said.
</P>
<P>
	   1. Did you have Tom Waits in mind when you wrote "Coattails of a Dead Man"?
</P>
<P>
	   Claypool: I had this chorus in my head, and when we started talking to Tom
about possibly producing something ... I said, 'I have this concept for this
Coattails of a Dead Man song,' and he's like, 'Ahhhh?' It was right up his
alley.
</P>
<P>
	   2. Were you nervous about working with some of your musical heroes?
</P>
<P>
	   Claypool: Going into it, it definitely was a fairly frightening thought that
'What if there isn't a chemistry? What if you're working with Stewart Copeland
and it totally sucks? Stewart Copeland is one of my heroes; I'm not going to
tell him that his song is not going on the record.' But it didn't suck.
</P>
<P>
	   3. Where does Primus exist on the musical map?
</P>
<P>
	   Claypool: We're like the band that just kind of cruises along under the
radar. We're not a big MTV band; we're not a big radio band. We get a little bit
of that stuff and we just sort of plod along. This album marks the decade of
putting out albums. I'm in this thing for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
	   4. At what age did you first pick up the bass?
</P>
<P>
	   Claypool: I started playing right before my 15th birthday. It was at a time
when bass players were in big demand because every kid wanted to be Eddie Van
Halen. ... They all wanted to play guitar. I figured I'd get a bass and it would
be easier to get a gig. And it only had four strings. ... I figured it would be
an easier instrument to play.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Are your children old enough to understand your music?
</P>
<P>
	   Claypool: They know daddy's music and they like listening to certain songs
and watching certain videos.

<HEADLINE> Tech: Little Appeal for Lynn Miles  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIC FIDLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   In an era of folk singers with Web sites and music that can be downloaded
from the Internet, singer/songwriter Lynn Miles uses her computer for e-mail.
She hasn't even seen her pages on her record company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about art, it's about how to get art out," she said, referring to
the booming business of music on the World Wide Web. "It just takes away from
the time you get to write."
</P>
<P>
	   And while many of her contemporaries are busy selling their CDs on the
Internet or using technology to reach new listeners, Miles, 40, insists she's
not interested. "Because I am a Luddite, I haven't really investigated it. ... I
find the music business really frustrating."
</P>
<P>
	   However, she is not completely opposed to technology. She has recorded two
CDs for Philo, a division of Rounder Records. A true Luddite would probably go
from house to house, acoustic guitar in hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Her U.S. debut album, "Slightly Haunted," resembled a contemporary folk
album. But Miles, a native of Canada, is a singer/songwriter in the mode of Joni
Mitchell or Shawn Colvin. Her songs are often built on soaring pop melodies, and
she uses percussion and electric guitars to complement her voice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Night in a Strange Town," her most recent album, was recorded in Los
Angeles with veteran session musicians, giving it a more burnished feel. The
album was produced by John Cody and Larry Klein, who is known for his work with
Mitchell and Colvin. But the studio professionals never overwhelm the songs.
Miles' lovely voice and her writing remain front and center as she examines love
and loneliness in her new home in Los Angeles. (She now divides her time between
Ottawa and Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
	   "Loneliness has definitely been one of my themes," she said in a telephone
interview, adding that hers probably comes from moving around a lot while
growing up.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I also think that loneliness is one of the big human conditions. I
think a lot of people get involved with things that they would not have, and
they go with people that they might not have gone with had they dealt with their
loneliness."
</P>
<P>
	   However, singing about loneliness and broken hearts doesn't mean Miles is
morose. She laughs easily during a conversation saying, "I like who I am; I like
where I am."

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Grand Ole Opry  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Grand Ole Opry was entertaining national
audiences before the Internet and cable television came into existence. It
predates television, too.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the longest continuously running radio show in the country. Every
Saturday night since 1925, the Opry has been beamed out on AM radio and heard as
far away as Canada on 50,000-watt, clear-channel WSM. The TNN cable channel airs
30 minutes of each of the current three 2 1/2-hour shows each week.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of folks love and treasure the Opry for presenting country music's
legacy," said general manager Pete Fisher, who was hired six months ago. "They
want it to play a key role in today's country music, and also in tomorrow's
music. That's our focus and the vision we have for it."
</P>
<P>
	   During January, the show is playing at the downtown Ryman Auditorium, home
of the Opry from 1943-1974. At the Jan. 8 show, Porter Wagoner wore a purple
suit studded with rhinestones. The songs of Hank Williams and Dottie West were
performed. Several performers dedicated their numbers to their moms or dads.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of that is business as usual for the Opry.
</P>
<P>
	   The return to the historic Ryman Auditorium is just an extended visit while
the suburban Grand Ole Opry House is being upgraded. More Ryman Opry shows are
likely in the future, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with mainstays Wagoner and Bill Anderson, artists on the Jan. 8 bill
included relative newcomers Jo Dee Messina and the hot band Lonestar.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to make certain that the Opry is evolving, and being able to attract
contemporary artists has a lot to do with providing a performance environment --
whether it's lighting, sound, staging or staff band musicians -- so that they
can present the best performance possible," said Fisher, who has replaced
several longtime house band members with musicians he says are more versatile.
</P>
<P>
	   "(Changing the band) really was about the unique need that we have in a
staff band musician, and that is a musician who can play not only the
traditional music in a very authentic fashion, but also the contemporary music."
</P>
<P>
	   The most visible and welcome change has been the booking of so-called
alternative country artists.
</P>
<P>
	   Iris DeMent and Gillian Welch have played the Opry in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   So has Don Walser, 65, who had been trying to get on the show for years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, boy, that was the thrill of my life!" Walser said about his Opry debut.
"They even said they were going to have me back on the televised part one of
these days. It's something I've dreamed about all of my life. I guess I got on
because a new guy is booking the show."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher is looking for performers who fit into the Opry show, which attempts
to present every facet of country music from square dancing to the latest
hit-makers.
</P>
<P>
	   "In many regards, what we consider to be progressive and alternative in
country music is really just ultratraditional," Fisher said. "Gillian Welch is
perceived as an alternative and progressive artist, but she does that by ...
really getting to the core of traditional country music."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher is also trying to address a long-standing complaint that many of the
big stars who are cast members rarely show up to perform. Cast members are
expected to perform at the Opry at least 12 times a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the early days of the Opry, the Opry WAS country music," Fisher said.
"Participating in the Opry was the best thing you could do for your career. ...
I acknowledge the fact that the Opry is not the center and magnet that it once
used to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way I can win the artist over is to work toward an Opry that really can
be an important component to an artist's career."
</P>
<P>
	   He cites as an example singer Brad Paisley, who appeared more than 20 times
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has acknowledged the Opry," Fisher said. "That was something we didn't
ask for and something we didn't expect, but he really made a point to give us
some credit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The future of the Opry is very bright, when you look at situations like
that."

<HEADLINE> Singer's Broadway Dream Comes True  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- When 21-year-old Ann Hampton Callaway arrived in New York,
her dream was to perform on Broadway. Instead, she became a singer in cabarets
and a writer of popular songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone familiar with the TV sitcom "The Nanny" has heard one of Callaway's
songs. Fran Drescher, the star of the show, asked Callaway to write the theme
song after she heard her singing original songs in cabaret.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think I had a chance in the world," Callaway said. "I had written
TV themes before that didn't get picked up. I wrote two. When they chose one, I
was thrilled. I recorded 'The Nanny Named Fran' and invited my sister to be
backup singer. It's one of the last jazzy TV themes."
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand recorded Callaway's world peace anthem "At the Same Time"
for her "Higher Ground" album. Streisand also asked Callaway to write lyrics for
"I've Dreamed of You" on her "A Love Like Ours" album.
</P>
<P>
	   And there's more: "Sibling Revelry" is a show that Callaway has performed in
London and in venues across the country with her sister Liz Callaway. "I wrote
some of it. A lot of it is Broadway standards. It's a great deal of fun.
</P>
<P>
	   "Liz has a bright Broadway sound. She has been in Broadway shows, done
Disney and animated features. When we blend, we breathe together. If I make a
mistake in a lyric, she knows it before I do and sings the wrong lyric with me."
</P>
<P>
	   And what about her dream of performing on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
	   "Twenty years later, my dream is coming true," the 41-year-old jazz vocalist
said. She is one of the stars of "Swing!" -- an exhilarating new dance revue
that opened in December at the St. James Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Swing!" is an evening of swing dances, interspersed with standards from the
1930s, '40s and beyond, as well as new songs. Callaway admits she's not a great
dancer.
</P>
<P>
	   While growing up in Chicago, she took ballet, jazz and modern dance lessons.
"I didn't have a great facility," she said. "I didn't pick up steps easily.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 'Swing!' they made my character be somebody shy about dancing. I sing
'All of Me' and go into 'I Won't Dance' and Everett Bradley forces me to dance
and I enjoy it. It's very effective because it's real."
</P>
<P>
	   Although she's accustomed to performing in cabarets, which are small,
intimate places, singing in a Broadway theater doesn't intimidate Callaway.
</P>
<P>
	   "Intimacy is also an emotional thing. It's how you think of the relationship
between you and who you're singing to," she said. "When I sing 'Stompin' at the
Savoy,' I'm telling a story. You might as well be in my living room."
</P>
<P>
	   Callaway wrote some additional lyrics for that song about a Harlem dance
hall known as the home of happy feet. "I get to take the audience on a little
tour of that great place. I dedicate that moment to Ella Fitzgerald. She was my
inspiration, growing up. I imagine she's in the mezzanine. I'm singing for her
and she's saying, 'You go, girl."'
</P>
<P>
	   A big framed picture of two dancers at a 1940s stage door canteen hangs in
Callaway's dressing room. "I thought it was the perfect 'Swing!' photo," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The photo makes her think of "I'll Be Seeing You," one of the songs in the
show. "It's one of the most gorgeous songs ever written. I feel I'm in World War
II and maybe I'll never see the love of my life again. I put myself in those
shoes. It's a very intense moment."
</P>
<P>
	   Callaway took dance lessons and lost 40 pounds for the show, giving up
alcohol, meat and caffeine. She was already meditating and studying yoga.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sitting in the meditation hall the first day, I felt like I had finally
come home. Everything in my life opened up. Singing came from a more personal,
open place. Writing flowed more.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to work on your inner self as an artist. If you don't, you have
nothing to say."

<HEADLINE> Feds Settle $486M Health Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Subsidiaries of a national kidney dialysis chain have agreed
to plead guilty to fraud and kickback charges and pay $486 million in civil and
criminal penalties, federal officials announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is the largest health care settlement in the department's
history.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement with the Massachusetts-based National Medical Care Inc.
includes a criminal fine of $101 million for wide-ranging misconduct, according
to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Also included are $385 million civil fines, penalties and restitution for
fraud related to Medicare and other government health care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's landmark recovery comes as one more example of success in our
fight against healthcare fraud, which has been a priority at the Justice
Department since 1993,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement includes allegations that company officials used Medicare and
other government health insurance programs to pay for hundreds of needless tests
for patients suffering from kidney disease, a condition that frequently requires
patients to receive dialysis, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the scheme involved misrepresenting patients' weight loss to justify
using an expensive nutritional therapy when the loss actually had nothing to do
with their kidney disease, officials said at a news conference in Boston today.
</P>
<P>
	   In at least one case, officials said, the weight loss was due to the
amputation of a leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also obtained referrals of lab business by paying
kickbacks, a violation of anti-kickback statutes, officials said. The company
used lavish dinners, a yacht excursion and a bear-hunting trip in Canada as
inducements, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark W. Pearlstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Medical Care is owned by Fresenius Medicare Care AG, a German
company that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the civil settlement, whistleblowers will collect $65.8
million of the $385 million civil recovery, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Markus, senior vice president for corporate compliance with Fresenius,
stressed -- as federal officials did -- that National Medical Care's fraudulent
practices stopped soon after Fresenius acquired the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fresenius knew there was an investigation when it acquired National
Medical Care in 1996, and recognized it and accepted the responsibility to work
with the government to resolve these problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rules Set for TV Anti-Drug Messages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office has established
guidelines to clarify its arrangement with television shows and other media
outlets that want government financial credits for inserting anti-drug messages
into their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new rules, the government will not review program episodes for
such credits until after the episodes have aired or been published. The office
also pledged that it would keep separate the process of granting financial
credits from simply offering guidance to networks or producers who seek advice
on how to portray drug-abuse situations.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the change should put "the
program on a track where it will get universal support."
</P>
<P>
	   "They've revised their policy to no longer look at scripts or do changes in
programming for credit before a program is finished," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The office was responding to recent fallout from the disclosure that the
government used financial incentives to get TV networks to include anti-drug
messages into their shows, in some cases even reviewing the scripts before the
programs aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement has drawn criticism from some who say the government is
intruding on the independence of networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines set out Tuesday are an effort "to eliminate any
misunderstandings and prevent any inference of federal intrusion in the creative
process," said Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new parameters still require a 100 percent match for every dollar the
federal government spends on media outlets and continue to allow media heads to
decide how to meet this requirement. Namely, networks can still receive
financial credit for the content of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   But programs will not be reviewed for these credits until after they have
aired, the office said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the drug office said it would still make available scientific
and technical experts to the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have forged a strong partnership with the entertainment and media
community and look forward to continuing to strengthen those ties," said
McCaffrey. The office plans to periodically seek the advice of the entertainment
industry on the credit process as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial spot bought by
the government with a free one. Since the program started, however, the
government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as the
networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Employees Back After Sickout  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Journalists in the middle of drawn-out contract
negotiations with Reuters, a major financial news provider, staged a sickout
that coincided with the start of the quarterly onslaught of corporate earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters spokesman Bob Crooke said all but 30 of the company's 120
journalists in New York called in sick Tuesday. He said reporters were showing
up to work today but those who were absent Tuesday would need to provide proof
they were sick, such as a doctor's note, or risk not getting paid.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest came just as major U.S. companies began reporting earnings for
the fourth quarter of 1999, an especially busy time for business news companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Crooke said the company was still putting out a "reasonable file, under the
circumstances," with management personnel working with the remaining employees
to write stories.
</P>
<P>
	   The Newspaper Guild in New York, which represents the employees, did not
authorize the action, guild president Barry Lipton said. But Lipton said
tensions have been rising in the ranks as the talks have dragged on for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Management is trying to decimate job security provisions," Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks have been ongoing since 1997, and the contract under which the
journalists had been working expired in February 1998, Crooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters is seeking more flexibility in handling layoffs and how its staff is
deployed, Crooke said. "The guild is resisting this and is insisting on
something that I can only describe as lifetime tenure for all staff, which is
just not realistic in today's market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives for the union and Reuters management were scheduled to meet
again Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Other news organizations have also had labor flare-ups recently. Many
writers for The Associated Press withheld bylines for 10 days over the New
Year's holiday to protest company proposals over pay and benefits. The company
and its union are in negotiations for a new contract to replace one that expired
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, writers and editors at The Wall Street Journal protested
proposals from Dow Jones &AMP; Co. over retirement benefits. The two sides reached
agreement in October on a new three-year contract.

<HEADLINE> FleetBoston Profits Rise 17 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- FleetBoston Financial reported a 17 percent jump in operating
profits in the fourth quarter, driven by higher income from stock and bond
underwriting and credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston reported operating profits of $726 million, or 76 cents a share,
beating analysts' estimates by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company earned $622 million, or 65 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston, however, took a one-time charge of $760 million during the
fourth quarter of 1999 to cover the cost of its merger with BankBoston Corp.
Including that charge, the bank posted a net loss of $34 million, or 5 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Total revenues for the quarter were $3.64 billion, or 15 percent higher than
the year-ago figure of $3.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Terrence Murray, said,
"Our continued strong results bear out the power of our diversified franchise
and the momentum sustained during the integration of two great franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our merger is very much on course," Murray said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleet's takeover of BankBoston received regulatory clearance in September,
making the united bank the eighth largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full-year, operating earnings were $2.8 billion, or $2.91 a share, a
14 percent increase over 1998 when the bank's profits totaled $2.5 billion, or
$2.55 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including merger-related costs, net income for the year $2.04 billion, or
$2.10 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $2.41 per share for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, revenues were $13.75 billion vs. $11.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Total assets on Dec. 31, 1999 were $190.7 billion, up $12.8 billion from a
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Plaintiffs Want Feds' Waco Evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Relatives suing the government over the deadly Branch
Davidian standoff claim they are getting stonewalled on a key question in their
wrongful death case -- whether anyone under the direction of U.S. authorities
fired shots on the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell on Tuesday asked a federal judge to
order the government to provide broader answers to requests for evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department has never completely answered whether personnel from
the Defense Department, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms or
other agencies fired weapons in the siege's final hours, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department did not immediately return a call seeking comment on
the accusation today.
</P>
<P>
	   Government attorneys also failed to meet a deadline to turn over evidence
sought by relatives of those who died in the confrontation, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford said the government produced 50 boxes of
materials over the holiday weekend, beating Tuesday's deadline. But he said an
additional 2,500 pages of documents must be declassified first.
</P>
<P>
	   He said government attorneys also must reproduce and hand over items from 31
boxes of materials, which were surrendered to the Waco federal court last fall
at the direction of U.S. District Judge Walter Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department and FBI long have denied that federal agents fired
shots on April 19, 1993. But the government's sworn answer to the plaintiffs'
question of whether ``any person under the employment, agency, control or
direction of the U.S. or any other government, agency or organization'' fired
shots is incomplete, Caddell wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In its response to the question, the Justice Department said: ``No person in
the employment of the FBI, or under the supervision, direction or control of the
FBI, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993,'' according to
Caddell's court filing.
</P>
<P>
	   Caddell says the U.S. Army Delta Force may have played a role in the final
hours of the siege, and that the Justice Department's response to his question
does not answer that allegation. Military officials have said Delta Force
members were present as observers only.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadly standoff began Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents raided the
rural compound of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers. The
siege ended in a fire that killed Koresh and about 80 followers, some of whom
were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says the Davidians died by their own hands. Trial is set for
May 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- The author of the children's books about Arthur the aardvark
is putting the beloved, bespectacled character, his sister D.W. and his gang of
friends on the shelf.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Compounds Lift Spinal Cord Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By ALEX DOMINGUEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Researchers have used protein combinations to repair damaged nerves in rats,
raising hopes that the technique can someday be used to restore mobility to
paralyzed people and help others recovery from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The proteins, known as nerve growth factors, were given to rats whose nerve
roots had been crushed. The nerves eventually reconnected to the spinal cord,
restoring the animals' ability to sense heat and pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The British researchers are now conducting experiments to determine if older
injuries can be healed using the compounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do know the acute injuries in rat are treatable. So, we are not without
hope in that respect," said Dr. Matt Ramer, one of the authors of the study,
published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramer said nerves outside the central nervous system are able to regenerate,
but the central nervous system's environment keeps nerves cut off at the root
from doing so for reasons that are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramer and his colleagues at St. Thomas' School of Biomedical Sciences in
London said the nerve growth factors appeared to boost the nerves' repair
abilities enough to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The work is not the first with the proteins, but shows that different growth
factors encourage different types of nerve cells to grow, and demonstrates the
effectiveness of a previously untested growth factor, GDNF, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The research involved about 100 rats whose sensory nerves that receive
information from the front paws were crushed at their junction with the spinal
cord. One of the growth factors or a dummy solution was then pumped into the
spinal cord near the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the animals that received the dummy solution, nerve regeneration stopped
at the spinal cord. The rats that received the growth factors showed varying
signs of nerve regrowth. The researchers found GDNF was among the most
successful in stimulating nerve regrowth.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact the growth factors prompted the nerve roots to reconnect to the
central nervous system is encouraging, said Dalton Dietrich, scientific director
of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually, they don't like to do that," Dalton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The results hold promise for human spinal cord repair, the researchers and
others said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Wise Young, director of the W.M. Keck Center for Collaborative
Neuroscience at Rutgers University, said nerve growth factors could also speed
recovery and eliminate pain in the estimated 325,000 patients a year who undergo
operations for slipped discs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is practical therapy which could go to clinical trial," Young
said. "And if it proves to be effective, it could affect a great many people."

<HEADLINE> Feds Settle $486M Health Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- A national chain of kidney dialysis centers has settled a
fraud case with the Justice Department for $486 million -- the largest health
care settlement in the agency's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said Wednesday that National Medical Care Inc. used
Medicare and other government health insurance programs to pay for hundreds of
needless tests for patients suffering from kidney disease, a condition that
frequently requires patients to receive dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the scheme involved misrepresenting patients' weight loss to justify
using an expensive nutritional therapy -- when the loss actually had nothing to
do with their kidney disease. In at least one case, officials said, the weight
loss was due to the amputation of a leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also obtained referrals of lab business by paying
kickbacks. Lavish dinners, a yacht excursion and a bear-hunting trip in Canada
were used as inducements, federal prosecutor Mark W. Pearlstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Massachusetts-based company will pay a criminal fine of $101 million for
wide-ranging misconduct and $385 million in civil fines, penalties and
restitution for fraud. Company whistle-blowers will collect $65.8 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Medical Care is owned by Fresenius Medicare Care AG, a German
company that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services.
</P>
<P>
	   John Markus, senior vice president for corporate compliance with Fresenius,
stressed -- as federal officials did -- that National Medical Care's fraudulent
practices stopped soon after Fresenius acquired the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fresenius knew there was an investigation when it acquired National
Medical Care in 1996, and recognized it and accepted the responsibility to work
with the government to resolve these problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 24.82; Nasdaq Up 26.72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors penalized Microsoft
for a profit report that met published estimates but failed to impress some Wall
Street analysts. Financial stocks rose, however, on the strength of corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   In Afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 24.82 at 11,535.90.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 5.89 at 1,461.03, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 26.72 at
4,157.53.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 6 3/8 from its 4 p.m. price Tuesday to 108 15/16 today. Late
Tuesday, the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its
fiscal second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said Microsoft's "whisper number" -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as 49 cents per
share, setting up some investors for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft officials warned analysts about a potential slowdown in demand for
personal computers. Also, some analysts suggested Microsoft had benefited from
strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than strength in the software
business.
</P>
<P>
	   "Microsoft made their numbers and did not change the guidance, but they got
there in a very different way than expected," said Don Young, a Microsoft
analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings reports, which are generally expected to show robust growth, are
dominating trading this week. Chase Manhattan rose 4 1/16 to 75 1/16 after
reporting earnings of $1.97 per share, easily exceeding estimates of $1.32 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Bear Stearns reported earnings of $1.64 per share, blowing past First Call
estimates of $1.20. The brokerage said the robust U.S. equity market had driven
stock underwriting activity to record levels. Bear Stearns rose 1 1/16 to 43
1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong earnings reports and a moderate improvement in the bond market
helped financial stocks to broad gains today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell to 6.72 percent from 6.75 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of the lagging groups are stabilizing," said Don Selkin, chief
investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. "The fact that we're able to
hold at these levels while there's weakness in Microsoft indicates that the
market is doing quite nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, online brokerages ETrade Group and DLJdirect Inc. reported steep
losses for the quarter, as both businesses spent heavily on advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   But shares of both companies were little changed because the losses were
slimmer than analysts had anticipated. ETrade slipped 11/16 to 27 1/4 and
DLJdirect gained  3/8 to 13 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 713.17 million shares, slightly ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.06 to 518.52.

	   Microsoft Stock Down After Report
</P>
<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. shares were down 7 3/16 at
108 1/8 this afternoon after the software giant reported slowing
growth in sales of its flagship Windows operating program and tied
stronger profits in part to a big increase in investment income.
Microsoft said late yesterday that profits in the latest quarter
rose 22 percent to $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, edging
expectations for a 42 cents-a-share profit, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial. The profit was up from $1.98 billion, or 36
cents a share a year ago. Corporate users are seen as waiting for
the Windows 2000 operating system, to be launched Feb. 17. Another
factor in the latest quarter was relatively flat sales of business
computers attributed to fears over Y2K bug complications -- fears
that did not materialize.

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising mortgage rates didn't stop home
building in December. The Commerce Department said home
construction shot up 7.1 percent, its biggest jump in more than a
year. Builders, aided by better-than-normal weather, began work on
new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71 million
units last month, the largest monthly increase in housing starts
since a 7.7 percent gain in October 1998. December's performance
surprised analysts, who were expecting a smaller rise of 0.6
percent.

The site contained information for visitors, including local

information on WTO events and protests. More than 500 people were

the new rules, the government will not review program episodes for
such credits until after the program episodes have aired or been
published. The office also pledged that it would keep separate the
process of granting financial credits from simply offering guidance
to networks or producers who seek advice on how to portray

<HEADLINE> SEC: Hedge Fund lied about Losses  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal authorities say an Austrian man and his hedge fund
lost $300 million for investors after betting that Internet companies were
overvalued just before they skyrocketed ever higher, and then subsequently lying
about it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a lawsuit filed yesterday,
accused Michael Berger and his fund, Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., of
swindling investors with lies and exaggerations after he bet wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the SEC said it
was bringing the legal action "to stop a massive fraud."
</P>
<P>
	   It said Berger, 28, an Austrian citizen, and his hedge fund had raised more
than $350 million from investors since September 1996 by "grossly overstating
the performance and market value of the hedge fund's holdings."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said investors were told the hedge fund had accumulated hundreds of
millions of dollars in assets and was profitable when it actually had assets of
less than $50 million and had lost $300 million by short-selling securities --
essentially betting the stocks would decline -- of Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement to shareholders of the fund last Friday, Berger conceded
"that the financial statements of the fund that have been distributed over the
last several years have been inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the funds actual net assets were substantially less than those
previously reported, "primarily as a result of market losses over that period of
time."
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Maistrow, a lawyer for the fund, declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC lawsuit accused Berger and the fund of creating bogus account
statements laden with false and misleading information to "hide these monumental
losses from investors."
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants had done further damage by paying certain shareholders who
have redeemed their shares in the fund more than the value of those shares,
leaving less money for remaining shareholders, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hedge funds are high-risk investment funds for wealthy individuals and
institutional investors who speculate on movements in the financial markets
</P>
<P>
	   Berger, who has homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y., operates the
investment fund under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The fund allows
foreign investors and tax exempt U.S. investors such as pension funds and trusts
to invest in the short selling of securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund currently has about 280 investors, eight of which have U.S.
addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit sought a court declaration that Berger and his company had
violated securities laws and an order blocking them from doing it in the future.
The lawsuit also sought unspecified civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Berger and his fund were sued in State Supreme Court in Manhattan
by Bank Austria AG, which claimed it had lost more than $28 million by investing
in the fund from May 1996 through May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Touch Post-Gulf War High  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Petroleum prices surged today to the highest levels seen
since the Gulf War, raising concerns about worsening inflation and a possible
threat to the economies of poor, oil-importing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices turned lower later in the day for North Sea Brent oil but continued a
rally for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in oil reflects signs that OPEC is planning to extend production
limits as well as a cold snap in the northeastern United States that stoked
demand for heating oil and natural gas. Industry analysts said that even though
crude oil prices have more than doubled in the past year, countries dependent on
imported oil should be able to avoid severe economic pain, barring another big
and sustained spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the late retreat, crude contracts in London reached their highest
prices since Jan. 16, 1991, on the eve of the air and missile offensive launched
against Iraq by U.S.-led forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the speculative buying is a result of expectations that ministers of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree in March to
extend the production limits adopted last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of tight supplies came in an industry report Wednesday of the
steepest annual decline in U.S. crude oil inventories in at least a half
century.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. oil inventories declined by more
than 136 million barrels in 1999, a 12.7 percent plunge from the previous year
and the biggest drop for a full calendar year in API records going back to 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Contracts for Brent oil for March delivery jumped 25 cents per barrel to
peak at $26.30 in early trading on the London International Petroleum Exchange,
before slipping a bit. In late trading Wednesday, Brent was down 10 cents from
Tuesday at $25.95.
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery rose as much as 35 cents
to $29.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, then also gave up a little
ground. It traded at $29.17 a barrel, up 32 cents, in late trading.
</P>
<P>
	   "These higher oil prices put inflation back on the corner of the radar
screen," said Peter Gignoux, managing director of the petroleum desk at Salomon
Smith Barney Citibank in London.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gignoux dismissed the run-up in prices as "a blip on the weekly chart,"
saying, "I think you need to see prices at this level for six months before you
start to get concerned."
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the oil market snapped a six-day losing streak when oil ministers
from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela began talking about extending OPEC's production
cuts of 4.3 million barrels a day beyond an expected March expiration date.
</P>
<P>
	   Gareth Lewis-Davies, an oil analyst at Lehman Brothers, argued that OPEC
would have to boost output to protect its own interests. By pumping more oil,
OPEC could trim prices and thereby discourage non-OPEC members from flooding the
market with their own crude and causing prices to crash.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a question of timing as to when OPEC will increase output. I foresee
it happening sooner rather than later," Lewis-Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that oil prices could fall as soon as this spring, when warmer
weather typically causes the seasonal demand for heating oil to wane.
</P>
<P>
	   If prices defy such forecasts and stay firm, oil-importing countries in
Latin America and Asia would have the most to lose, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand and India already have expressed concern over crude prices and are
discussing ways to limit any damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai politicians are weighing whether to cut taxes on gasoline to help
maintain the country's delicate recovery from the Asian financial crisis of
1997. The Indian government is considering raising tariffs on imported oil in an
effort to discourage its use, Lewis-Davies said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Debate Escalates  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The failure of a U.S. missile intercept test, for reasons
the Pentagon could not explain Wednesday, is likely to deepen the divide between
critics of missile defense and supporters who assert America urgently needs a
shield against a potential attack from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the interceptor was ``extremely
close'' to hitting its target Tuesday night but missed at the last moment. It
might take several weeks to get a full understanding of the reasons, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private experts had said before the test that whatever the outcome, the
missile defense debate would continue to rage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Critics will say it proves the system is not ready, and supporters will
leap on it as proof that the program needs more money,'' said Loren Thompson,
head of national security programs at the Lexington Institute, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both of those assertions are true.
</P>
<P>
	   The failure of the Raytheon Corp.-built interceptor to hit its target -- a
mock warhead launched into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. --
demonstrates what the Pentagon already knew: more testing is needed, the project
is bound to encounter setbacks, and its eventual success is far from assured.
</P>
<P>
	   As missile defense doubter Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., put it, ``Obviously
this is a setback for the program. It demonstrates that the technology does not
exist yet to give anybody any confidence that this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration intends to ask Congress to add $2.2
billion to the coming year's budget to pay for more testing and to expand the
number of interceptors that would be fielded. So far, the administration
estimates that building the missile defense system will cost $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves at least two critical questions yet to be answered:
</P>
<P>
	   --Can the Pentagon build a national missile defense that can be counted on
to work in the event of an actual missile attack?
</P>
<P>
	   --Is there enough of a threat of attack -- whether from North Korea or any
other country -- to justify the cost, both in national treasury and diplomatic
complications with Russia and China, which oppose the project and assert that
building it will trigger a new and dangerous arms race? Many critics say no.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans dating back to Ronald Reagan have been pushing for a national
missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration argued for a number of years that there was no
threat that required an immediate push for a system. But in the past year, the
administration decided it should move ahead, although on a version significantly
scaled down from Reagan's vision of a space-based ``Star Wars'' defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., one of the most vocal supporters of national
missile defense, said Wednesday the failed intercept should not be seen as a
setback because, in his view, it will provide important lessons for the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of a testing program is to determine problems and resolve them
before a system goes into production,'' Weldon said in a statement issued by his
office while he was traveling in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need increased funding for a more robust testing program for national
missile defense if we are to successfully work out the kinks and move forward
with deployment,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is scheduled to make a formal decision by late summer on
whether to go ahead with deploying a system designed to protect all 50 U.S.
states against a limited ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The focus of missile defense in the 1980s, when President Reagan initiated a
crash development program, was the Soviet nuclear missile threat. Now that the
Soviet Union is history, attention has turned to so-called ``rogue'' nations
like North Korea that are said to be trying to build long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense, said in an interview Tuesday
that he believes North Korea is capable of an irrational act like attacking the
United States, even though it knows that would amount to national suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be ready,'' Hamre said. ``They could do something terribly
wrong, terribly irrational.''
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea stunned the world in August 1998 by launching a multistage
rocket over Japan, and U.S. officials say the North Koreans have prepared to
test-launch a ballistic missile capable of reaching U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prudence dictates that we now have to be ready for that,'' Hamre said.
``And unfortunately it doesn't end with them, because they are also very willing
to export their technology to other bad actors around the world.''

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Discusses Latest Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio says his role as a rootless
backpacker in Thailand in "The Beach" reflects his own life search.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the only thing that I really connected with and really thought meant
something," he said in Wednesday's USA Today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not to say that I only want to do projects that have some sort of message
to society, but I really identified with this character's search for getting out
of a robotic existence and trying to find some sort of real sensation of
emotion."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach" opens Feb. 11. It follows "Titanic," which made DiCaprio a
superstar.
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio, 25, takes his profession seriously and says he's grateful for the
fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a series of much more highs and lows since 'Titanic,' but I think I'm
a very fortunate person," he said. "I don't have a negative attitude about fame
at all. I'm not tortured or constrained by it. ... It's given me the opportunity
to do the one thing in my life that I know is a true passion of mine, which is
acting."

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 24.82; Nasdaq 25.05  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors penalized Microsoft
for a profit report that met published estimates but failed to impress some Wall
Street analysts. Financial stocks rose, however, on the strength of corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 24.82 at 11,535.90.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.21 at 1,457.35, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 25.05 at
4,155.86.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 7 from its 4 p.m. price Tuesday to 108 5/16 today. Late
Tuesday, the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its
fiscal second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said Microsoft's "whisper number" -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as 49 cents per
share, setting up some investors for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft officials warned analysts about a potential slowdown in demand for
personal computers. Also, some analysts suggested Microsoft had benefited from
strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than strength in the software
business.
</P>
<P>
	   "Microsoft made their numbers and did not change the guidance, but they got
there in a very different way than expected," said Don Young, a Microsoft
analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings reports, which are generally expected to show robust growth, are
dominating trading this week. Chase Manhattan rose 3 11/16 to 74 11/16 after
reporting earnings of $1.97 per share, easily exceeding estimates of $1.32 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Bear Stearns reported earnings of $1.64 per share, blowing past First Call
estimates of $1.20. The brokerage said the robust U.S. equity market had driven
stock underwriting activity to record levels. Bear Stearns rose 1 1/16 to 43
1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong earnings reports and a moderate improvement in the bond market
helped financial stocks to broad gains today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell to 6.72 percent from 6.75 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of the lagging groups are stabilizing," said Don Selkin, chief
investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. "The fact that we're able to
hold at these levels while there's weakness in Microsoft indicates that the
market is doing quite nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, online brokerages ETrade Group and DLJdirect Inc. reported steep
losses for the quarter, as both businesses spent heavily on advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the losses were slimmer than analysts had anticipated. ETrade slipped
1 3/16 to 26 3/4 and DLJdirect gained 7/16 to 13 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, while on the Nasdaq, 11 stocks rose for every nine that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 843.25 million shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.80 to 519.26.

<HEADLINE> Isley Brothers' Music Auction Halted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Isley Brothers' music catalog was pulled off the
auction block after an investment group proposed a $6.5 million deal that would
let Ronald Isley retain his share of the rights to such songs as "Shout" and
"It's Your Thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The catalog, which also includes "Twist and Shout," went on the auction
block after Isley declared Chapter 7, or involuntary, bankruptcy. A large part
of his debt is from an Internal Revenue Service claim of nearly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles postponed the auction until Feb. 23
after the proposed deal was reached Tuesday by the Pullman Group, EMI, Isley and
his bankruptcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based Pullman Group invented the so-called "Bowie bonds," named
after rocker David Bowie, in which music assets are pledged to secure bonds and
the debt is repaid from royalties. The Pullman Group would issue 15- to 20-year
bonds to cover Isley's debt. Isley or his heirs would resume receiving profits
from the song copyrights after the bonds expire.
</P>
<P>
	   Isley's most valuable property is his one-third interest in the Isley
Brothers' catalog. He and his brothers Rudolph and O'Kelly wrote more than 200
songs.

    NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Hartnel Henry, the master of ceremonies for Ziggy Marley

claiming an officer roughed him up outside a club in August and broke his leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry, whose stage name is Sky High, was outside the House of Blues when two
plainclothes officers ordered him to spread his legs and frisked him, the
lawsuit said.

third officer pushed through the crowd, grabbed him and dragged him down the

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Surge in December  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction shot up 7.1 percent in December, the
Commerce Department reported today, capping off the best year for housing since
1986 despite the fact that mortgage rates were creeping higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said today its latest review of the U.S.
economy showed strong business activity around the nation with retailers
recording a great Christmas and manufacturing companies enjoying a broad-based
rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed report, known as the Beige Book for the color of its cover, said
surveys of its 12 regions reported "strong economic growth in December and early
January."
</P>
<P>
	   The strength was coming from continued robust spending by consumers, who
account for two-thirds of total economic activity, and a rebound in
manufacturing as overseas markets began to revive following the Asian currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed said the U.S. banking system and other parts of the economy
weathered the Year 2000 date changeover without major disruptions and the report
predicted few problems down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "Few future disruptions are anticipated and few problems concerning
Y2K-related inventories are expected," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed report noted that even though labor markets remained tight around
the country, there was still no sign that employers were handing out large wage
increases. Consumer prices also remained in check, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey will be used by the central bank when it meets Feb. 1 and 2
to review interest rate policies. Economists are predicting that the Fed will
increase rates for a fourth time in a belief that more credit-tightening is
needed to make sure fast economic growth does not trigger inflation down the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Fed announced today that it would put into place for its
February meeting a new disclosure policy in an attempt to deal with confusion
that arose last year over just what the central bank was trying to tell
financial markets about the future course of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   With its new procedures, the Fed scrapped its old "policy directive," which
was intended to signal the future course of interest rate decisions by the
Federal Open Market Committee, the group of Fed board members and regional bank
presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Fed will issue a brief statement at the end of every FOMC
meeting saying whether Fed policy-makers believe there is a risk of inflation
going forward or a risk of economic weakness. The Fed could also state that it
views the risks balanced between those two outcomes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the housing report, the Commerce Department said builders, aided by
better-than-normal weather, began work on new units at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.71 million units last month.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the largest monthly increase in housing starts since a 7.7 percent
gain in October 1998. December's performance surprised analysts, who were
expecting a smaller rise of 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, builders started construction on 1.66 million new units, up
3 percent from 1998. That followed a 10 percent annual gain the year before.
Still, the 1.66 million level was the highest since 1.80 million units were
started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy continues to thunder on and the housing sector has shown
resilience despite higher interest rates," said Richard Yamarone, an economist
with Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, exceptionally low mortgage rates fueled a record housing boom. Last
year, rising mortgage rates cut into demand but housing activity still remained
brisk. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and a strong stock market
helped make Americans feel wealthy and in the buying mood last year. Many
economists, however, predict slower growth this year as mortgage rates are
expected to continue their upward climb.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was
7.9 percent, up from 6.7 percent in December 1998. Last week, mortgage rates
climbed to 8.18 percent, the highest level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Regionally, housing start surged 17.4 percent in the South to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 801,000 units. They rose 13.4 percent in the Midwest to
a rate of 405,000 units and by 7.6 percent in the Northeast to a rate of
156,000. Housing starts fell in the West by 15.5 percent to a rate of 350,000
units.
</P>
<P>
	   Starts of single-family homes rose 7.9 percent in December to a rate of 1.4
million units, while apartments and condos rose 3.7 percent to a rate of 310,000
units.

whether limits on ``sidewalk counseling'' by anti-abortion protesters violate
their free-speech rights in the name of protecting patients' privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Several justices expressed doubts that a Colorado law squelches protesters'
speech by requiring them to stay eight feet away from people entering
health-care clinics unless the person consents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You certainly can convey anything you want to convey orally from a
distance of eight feet,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said. ``This isn't some
unusual provision.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some justices were troubled that the law could apply broadly to any such
activity outside a building, even when a medical office is only one of many
offices in a large building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're curtailing a lot of other activity that may not be relevant to the
health-care facility,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Antonin Scalia asked, ``In the public forum outside in the street,
can we have a law that enables people to turn off unwelcome speech?''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices are expected to rule by July on the Colorado law, which affects
protests within 100 feet of clinic entrances. The law, upheld last year by the
Colorado Supreme Court, bars people from approaching within eight feet of anyone
-- without their consent -- to protest, counsel or hand them a leaflet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a problem at health-care facilities, a problem of intimidation
and violence,'' said Justice Department lawyer Barbara D. Underwood, arguing in
Colorado's support.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado's lawyer, Michael E. McLachlan, contended the law was written
neutrally because ``it takes no side on the debate.'' He said there had been no
prosecutions under the law thus far.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Jay A. Sekulow, representing three protesters who challenged the
law, said it ``makes the peaceful distribution of a leaflet, the display of a
sign ... a crime if prior consent is not obtained.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such limits violate the Constitution's First Amendment free-speech
guarantee, Sekulow said, arguing that protesters can only be barred from
blocking or impeding access to abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Stephen G. Breyer suggested the law may aid free speech because it
``makes clear what you can do and what you can't do'' instead of having to go to
court to decide whether someone's actions counted as harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalia and Rehnquist asked whether such a law could be applied to labor
union picketing. Underwood said it could only if there were similar findings
that people were being intimidated by picketers.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the court building, Leila Jeanne Hill, one of those who challenged
the law, held up a postcard with a smiley face on it and said, ``I think we're
going to have our First Amendment rights back this summer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., who wrote the law as a Colorado state lawmaker,
said protesters outside clinics are not as low-key as Hill was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They do not hold up smiley faces,'' DeGette said. ``We don't think it's
too great a burden to ask the protesters not to stand in front of patients and
try to physically or psychologically block them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion-rights advocates said Wednesday scores of abortion clinics are
targets of violence. The Feminist Majority Foundation said 20 percent of 360
clinics that responded to a 1999 survey said they experienced incidents such as
blockades, invasions, bomb threats or bombings within the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen states are backing Colorado. The demonstrators are being supported
by, among others, the AFL-CIO and the American Civil Liberties Union, which
expressed concern about limits on protest activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court reaffirmed the right to abortion in 1992, and the justices
have addressed the abortion-protest issue twice before.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994 they upheld a 36-foot demonstration-free zone around a Florida
clinic. In 1997, the court upheld a 15-foot buffer zone around New York abortion
clinic entrances but struck down a judge's order for a ``floating buffer zone''
requiring protesters to stay 15 feet away from people as they entered or left
the clinics.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1993 Colorado law was enacted in response to what the state's lawyers
called ``a history of obstructive demonstrations'' outside abortion clinics by
protesters who grabbed, surrounded and yelled at patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was challenged by Hill, Audrey Himmelmann and Everitt Simpson Jr.,
who said they merely advised women of alternatives to abortion.

<HEADLINE> Union Membership Rises in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor leaders on Wednesday celebrated the largest
increase in union membership in more than 20 years, saying they reversed a
downhill slide by appealing to white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of union members was 16.5 million in 1999, an increase of 265,000
workers from the year before, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported. But while the country added 2.7 million jobs last year, the
overall percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, union leaders said they believe the numbers will translate
into more political clout for organized labor in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year 2000, you're going to see the largest and most significant
activity that grassroots workers have exercised in any political election,''
said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. The labor federation has endorsed Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   One particularly bright spot for union labor was a gain of 112,493 members
working in the private sector. Traditionally, government employees and
contractors have been the stronghold of the labor movement, and while that
remains the case, union organizers noted that the rolls from private industry
had otherwise been in decline since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The private sector growth is a clear sign that our efforts to think
strategically and creatively are beginning to bear fruit,'' said Kirk Adams, the
AFL-CIO's organizing director.
</P>
<P>
	   The novel approach has been to spread the union gospel through a variety of
occupations, not just the jobs that require hard hats. For example, in the last
year, 45,000 doctors have joined unions and 75,000 home health aide workers
unionized in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some high-tech and communications workers are beginning to explore
unions at computer giant Microsoft, Internet book dealer Amazon.com, computer
maker IBM, and AT&AMP;T, the telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Labor Department reported that 37 percent of government workers,
including local police and firefighters were union members, compared with about
9 percent of private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
	   It is too early for unions to declaring a high-tech victory, said economist
Ken Goldstein of the Conference Board, a business-sponsored study group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless they can start to organize the office, days like this are going to
be few and far between,'' he said. ``For all good news this is from their point
of view, this is a quite limited and perhaps a quite temporary celebration.''
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, the unions also are trying to win over future workers
before they hit the work force. For example, Sweeney hopes to woo Dartmouth
College students during an upcoming visit to the New Hampshire school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're turning the corner, but we're not at our destination yet,'' Sweeney
said. ``Our challenge for the future is to remain focused and to broaden our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, organizing director Adams said that for unions to continue to grow
in a rapidly expanding economy, they must add between 500,000 and a million
workers a year -- not a small hurdle because so many union jobs are lost to
attrition. Labor leaders estimated that at least 600,000 workers joined up in
1999, but the net gain was 265,000.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep up, the labor movement has been training and hiring more organizers
and doubled the resources spent on organizing in the last four years. The
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the
steelworkers' union last year committed more than $40 million to organizing
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Protesting Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Maria Ilbay walked 90 miles over narrow trails from
her Indian community on the frigid flanks of snowcapped Mount Chimborazo to
demand President Jamil Mahuad's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ilbay, a 42-year-old mother of six, is one of 5,000 Quichua-speaking Indians
gathered in Quito to demand that the government back off its plan to make the
U.S. dollar Ecuador's official currency. Mahuad announced the measure last week
in a bid to end soaring inflation and stabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many Indians who trekked day and night to reach the capital, some
arriving with swollen feet, Ilbay did not even know what a dollar was until a
few days ago. She says that until Monday she thought it was the name of ``a
brand of noodles.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indian leaders insisted Wednesday on Mahuad's resignation, the closure of
Congress and the Supreme Court and their replacement with a ``popular
government'' appointed by Indians and leftist-led unions and student groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our struggle is peaceful because the only arms that our people have are
their voices and their bodies,'' said Blanca Chancoso, vice president of the
Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which represents Ecuador's
4 million Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   She accused the government of ``a racist attitude'' in trying to prevent
Indians from reaching Quito by throwing up military blockades on the major
highways. She said when officials realized the Indians had slipped by the
military barriers by walking over mountain trails, they magnanimously gave them
permission ``to circulate freely'' in Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that they see it is impossible to stop the river of people who are
arriving in Quito, they say come ahead,'' Chancoso said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Indians marched Wednesday afternoon through the streets of the
city, chanting anti-Mahuad slogans. Their leaders said they will not return to
their communities until the government resigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Maria Edlina Alba, a 48-year-old mother of eight, said she traveled 30 miles
to protest the high prices of rice, sugar and other essential foods.
</P>
<P>
	   The prices of many food items have doubled since Mahuad revealed his plan.
The government announced Wednesday that it was imposing price controls to halt
speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are from Cayambe. We are country people,'' said Alba, who wore a richly
embroidered white blouse, a multilayered skirt and a dark green fedora. ``We
want President Jamil to lower prices. We do not want the dollar. We do not know
how to manage the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's Indian movement has grown in influence during the past decade,
winning greater government services for isolated Indian communities and land
grants for jungle tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Diego Bonifaz, a former head of the government's office of Indian
affairs, said the movement's leaders have ``no sense of reality'' and are using
their followers like ``cannon fodder.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have promised that they are going to throw the government from power
and that is not going to happen,'' Bonifaz said. ``When that doesn't happen, the
Indians are going to realize that their leaders also lie.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the Fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank have been assigned to the
Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and part of Israel's
capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Albright at her home in the
Georgetown section of the capital before seeing Clinton at the White House in
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Explains Poor Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- US Airways Group officials expressed disappointment
Wednesday with the airline's financial performance in 1999, reporting earnings
of $197 million compared with $538 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share fell to $2.64 from $5.60 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "The year's financial performance clearly was well below an acceptable
level," said Stephen M. Wolf, the company chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported a net loss of $81 million for the fourth quarter on
revenues of $2.1 billion. That followed an $85 million loss in the third quarter
that officials blamed on flight cancellations due to Hurricane Floyd and labor
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials warned last year that rising expenses were cutting into
earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways reported 1999 revenues of $8.6 billion, compared with nearly $8.7
billion a year earlier. Operating expenses rose 10.2 percent to $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials cited a variety of factors for the dismal performance:
weather problems that affected passenger loads early in the year; maintenance
and air traffic control troubles; crew shortages; and higher aviation fuel
costs, with a 13.1 percent rise in 1999 to 58.63 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials say US Airways is positioned for improved earnings this year,
pointing to the addition of new Airbus single-aisle aircraft into the fleet and
the pending introduction of Airbus A330-300 transatlantic aircraft service. They
also say that the company's new Sabre computerized reservation system is
functioning smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   They said several agreements reached with the company's labor unions were
hopeful signs for the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was progress during 1999 that speaks well for the future," Wolf said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts $110B Health Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday unveiled a whopping $110
billion package of health insurance initiatives for his final year in office,
asking the Republican-dominated Congress to approve during an election year
costlier versions of programs that died on Capitol Hill last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The less expensive versions died in part because of the president's own veto
of the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cutting plan. The new Clinton plan is the
largest proposed investment in health care since Medicare was created in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These proposals are a significant investment in the health of Americans,
another step toward giving every American access to quality health care,'' the
president said. About 44 million Americans lack health insurance, and the
president's proposal would cover about 5 million of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest ingredients of Clinton's plan are a $3,000 long-term care tax
credit, costing $28 billion over 10 years, and a $76 billion proposal to insure
4 million parents of children who receive health coverage under Medicaid and the
state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   Sensitive to the politics of a presidential campaign year, the president
credited Vice President Al Gore with helping shape the administration's plan. He
said Gore and his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, both have proposed
health programs more extensive than his own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you just look at what's going on in the election season this year, the
public cares a lot about health care and they're talking a lot about it,''
Clinton said in an Oval Office ceremony. ``I am elated that health care is an
issue in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president would pay for his program from the nation's huge budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Universal health insurance was Clinton's signature issue in winning the
White House in 1992. The program died in a Democratic-ruled Congress, prompting
Clinton to adopt an incremental approach of expanding health insurance. The
president eventually signed initiatives to allow workers to carry insurance from
job to job despite health problems, and to provide insurance for millions of
children under Medicaid and CHIP.
</P>
<P>
	   With the election year, health care is a hot topic again. Republicans and
Democrats alike are drawing up bills dealing with long-term care, drugs bought
via the Internet, prescription drugs and other initiatives. House and Senate
negotiators already are trying to reconcile compromises on a patients' bill of
rights and expansion of coverage for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm pleased to see the president joining the debate as we try to find
solutions to long-term care needs,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
chairman of the Senate's special committee on aging. Grassley has proposed
several measures, including tax deductions to encourage people to buy long-term
care insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   To help low-income parents, Clinton's program would create a new ``family
care'' portion of Medicaid and CHIP programs that insure needy children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to have healthy children without healthy parents,'' the
president said. ``We know parents who have access to health care themselves are
more likely to get care for their children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Further, he said the administration would intensify efforts to enroll more
eligible children, adding 400,000 children at a cost of $5.5 billion over 10
years. More than 2 million children are covered now.
</P>
<P>
	   Another proposal would resurrect Clinton's plan to allow workers as young as
55 buy into the Medicare program. Congress ignored the proposal last year. This
time, Clinton would make the proposal even more attractive for workers -- and
more costly for the government -- by offering a 25 percent tax credit for
participants in the Medicare buy-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of the buy-in and credit over 10 years would be about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also proposed aid for workers to buy COBRA health insurance
when they leave a job. The COBRA program allows workers to buy into their
employer's health plan for up to 18 to 36 months, provided they pay the premium.
However, fewer than 25 percent of eligible people buy the coverage, in part
because of the cost, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would offer a 25 percent tax credit for COBRA premiums
to make the cost more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   Other provisions of Clinton's initiative would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Give a 20 percent tax credit to small businesses to buy health insurance
through purchasing coalitions. The initiative would be limited to companies that
have not previously offered health insurance to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to insure children through age 20.
</P>
<P>
	   --Extend Medicaid coverage for people who leave welfare rolls to take a job.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to provide insurance for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allocate at least $1 billion over 10 years to help public hospitals,
clinics and thousands of health care providers give health care to the
uninsured.

<HEADLINE> Fed Notes Good Business Conditions  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, fueled by robust consumer spending and
rejuvenated manufacturing, continues to fire on all cylinders, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday in a report that economists said is further evidence that
the Fed will boost interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In its most recent snapshot of the nation's economic activity, the Fed
reported "strong economic growth in December and January."
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, contributed to the strong growth. Retailers reported strong holiday
sales with purchases of electronics, toys and jewelry especially high nationwide
and expect robust sales early this year, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad-based rebound in manufacturing also contributed to the growth as
overseas demand, which had been dampened by the Asian currency crisis, continued
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are laying the foundation for another tightening move in February,"
said Mark Zandi, economist with Regional Financial Associates. "The report shows
that the economy is not slowing. It is booming."
</P>
<P>
	   Labor markets remained tight around the country, meaning that employers have
difficulty finding workers to fill job openings, something that economists fear
could lead to wage and price inflation in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fed said there was still no sign that employers were giving workers
big wage increases. And, the Fed said that "most consumer prices appear to be
holding steady in much of the country, although a few districts reported
moderate increases."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's survey, known as the "beige book" for the color of its cover, will
be used when Fed policy-makers meet next on Feb. 1-2 to review the central
bank's stance on interest rates. The survey is based on reports from the Fed's
12 regional banks from information collected before Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Fed will boost interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point at the February meeting, citing continuing strong economic
growth. The Fed's latest survey supports such a move, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The beige book simply confirms what the Fed already knows: that momentum is
too strong and has to be slowed," said Tim O'Neill, economist for Bank of
Montreal and Harris Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
sizzling economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists fear that the booming economy could spark inflation down the
road, but the Fed's report indicated that thus far prices remain stable. Given
that, the Fed is likely to follow up February's meeting with several small
increases rather than big ones, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, construction of new homes and apartments surged to a
13-year high in 1999 helped along by a 7.1 percent jump in December, a sign of
the housing sector's resilience even as mortgage rates rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, builders started construction on 1.66 million new units, a
3 percent gain from 1998, pushing total housing starts to the highest level
since 1986, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, builders, aided by better-than-normal weather, began work on
new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71 million units.
</P>
<P>
	   The growth in December's and last year's housing starts came despite the
upward climb of mortgage rates and reflects the nation's good economic times,
economists said. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and a strong
stock market helped make Americans feel wealthy and in the buying mood last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists, however, predict slower growth this year as mortgage rates
continue to rise. In December, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage was 7.9 percent, up from 6.7 percent in December 1998. Last week,
mortgage rates climbed to 8.18 percent, the highest level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect total housing starts to go down by 8 percent in 2000, but that

Michael Carliner.

	   The Fed, in its survey, said the Year 2000 computer changeover did not cause
major disruptions to the U.S. banking system or other parts of the economy. "Few
future disruptions are anticipated and few problems concerning Y2K-related

<HEADLINE> Union Membership Rises in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor leaders on Wednesday celebrated the largest
increase in union membership in more than 20 years, saying they reversed a
downhill slide by appealing to white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of union members was 16.5 million in 1999, an increase of 265,000
workers from the year before, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported. But while the country added 2.7 million jobs last year, the
overall percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, union leaders said they believe the numbers will translate
into more political clout for organized labor in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year 2000, you're going to see the largest and most significant
activity that grassroots workers have exercised in any political election,''
said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. The labor federation has endorsed Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   One particularly bright spot for union labor was a gain of 112,493 members
working in the private sector. Traditionally, government employees and
contractors have been the stronghold of the labor movement, and while that
remains the case, union organizers noted that the rolls from private industry
had otherwise been in decline since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The private sector growth is a clear sign that our efforts to think
strategically and creatively are beginning to bear fruit,'' said Kirk Adams, the
AFL-CIO's organizing director.
</P>
<P>
	   The novel approach has been to spread the union gospel through a variety of
occupations, not just the jobs that require hard hats. For example, in the last
year, 45,000 doctors have joined unions and 75,000 home health aide workers
unionized in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some high-tech and communications workers are beginning to explore
unions at computer giant Microsoft, Internet book dealer Amazon.com, computer
maker IBM, and AT&AMP;T, the telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Labor Department reported that 37 percent of government workers,
including local police and firefighters were union members, compared with about
9 percent of private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
	   It is too early for unions to declaring a high-tech victory, said economist
Ken Goldstein of the Conference Board, a business-sponsored study group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless they can start to organize the office, days like this are going to
be few and far between,'' he said. ``For all good news this is from their point
of view, this is a quite limited and perhaps a quite temporary celebration.''
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, the unions also are trying to win over future workers
before they hit the work force. For example, Sweeney was heading later Wednesday
to woo students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're turning the corner, but we're not at our destination yet,'' Sweeney
said. ``Our challenge for the future is to remain focused and to broaden our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, organizing director Adams said that for unions to continue to grow
in a rapidly expanding economy, they must add between 500,000 and a million
workers a year -- not a small hurdle because so many union jobs are lost to
attrition. Labor leaders estimated that at least 600,000 workers joined up in
1999, but the net gain was 265,000.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep up, the labor movement has been training and hiring more organizers
and doubled the resources spent on organizing in the last four years. The
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the
steelworkers' union last year committed more than $40 million to organizing
efforts.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Reforming N. Ireland Police  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain announced plans Wednesday to
reform the province's terrorism-hardened police force, stripping it of its
``royal'' designation and pledging to increase the number of Catholic officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said he would soon unveil
legislation designed to transform the predominantly Protestant Royal Ulster
Constabulary into a new Police Service of Northern Ireland that would enjoy
greater support from Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in London's House of Commons, Mandelson said he understood how much
it would hurt many Protestants for the RUC -- synonymous with Northern Ireland's
foundation 79 years ago as a Protestant-majority state -- to lose its name,
particularly its ``royal'' designation.
</P>
<P>
	   But he insisted the change, signaled in 1998's Good Friday peace accord and
due to take effect next year, would symbolize a fresh beginning for Northern
Ireland in its new era of Catholic-Protestant cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronting the delicate balancing act ahead, Mandelson urged Protestants
``to accept the need for significant change to create a police service in which
all can feel they belong.''
</P>
<P>
	   And he urged Catholics ``unambiguously to support the police, and to
encourage young men and women from their community to join.''
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, which killed nearly 300 officers in bomb and gun attacks as part of
its efforts to abolish Northern Ireland, has not slain any since calling a 1997
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group is supposed to disarm by May under the terms of the Good
Friday accord, but has not yet signaled whether it will do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has threatened to withdraw
from the province's new Protestant-Catholic administration if the IRA doesn't
soon begin to disarm. The administration, which includes two members of the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party, was formed last month after more than a year of
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, senior minister in the new Belfast
administration, accused the British government on Wednesday of seeking to
dishonor police officers by stripping ``royal'' from the force's name.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he accepted most of the 175 proposals published last
September by an international commission led by former Hong Kong Gov. Chris
Patten -- including the goal of increasing Catholic representation within the
police from its current 8 percent to 30 percent within a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   To achieve this, he proposed amending Northern Ireland's employment law --
which requires employers not to discriminate based on an applicant's
political-religious background -- so that police recruiters could legally favor
Catholic applicants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would be no question whatsoever of ex-terrorists joining the
service,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said Patten's proposal to reduce the 13,500-strong police force to
7,500 members should go forward, beginning with ``generous and sympathetic''
early retirement packages and the abolition of the RUC's 3,000-member reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   These cuts would proceed, he said, ``provided that the security situation
does not deteriorate significantly.''
</P>
<P>
	   For many of the approximately 13,000 officers wounded since Northern
Ireland's conflict ignited in 1969, stripping the force of its name comes too
close to the IRA's goal of wiping it out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the stroke of a pen, this British government is doing what the IRA
failed to do for all those years,'' said Sam Malcolmson, a former officer
crippled by an IRA bomb in 1972. ``It's a gross, calculated insult to all those
brave men and women who sacrificed life and limb in the name of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Settle $486M Health Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- A national chain of kidney dialysis centers has settled a
fraud case with the Justice Department for $486 million -- the largest health
care settlement in the agency's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said Wednesday that National Medical Care Inc. used
Medicare and other government health insurance programs to pay for hundreds of
needless tests for patients suffering from kidney disease, a condition that
frequently requires patients to receive dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the scheme involved misrepresenting patients' weight loss to justify
using an expensive nutritional therapy -- when the loss actually had nothing to
do with their kidney disease. In at least one case, officials said, the weight
loss was due to the amputation of a leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also obtained referrals of lab business by paying
kickbacks. Lavish dinners, a yacht excursion and a bear-hunting trip in Canada
were used as inducements, federal prosecutor Mark W. Pearlstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Massachusetts-based company will pay a criminal fine of $101 million for
wide-ranging misconduct and $385 million in civil fines, penalties and
restitution for fraud. Company whistle-blowers will collect $65.8 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three subsidiaries agreed to plead guilty to three separate conspiracies,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   NMC Homecare Inc. is accused of submitting fraudulent Medicare claims for
nutritional therapy. LifeChem Inc., NMC's blood testing lab, is charged with
submitting false blood testing claims. NMC Medical Products Inc., a dialysis
products distribution subsidiary, is accused of paying kickbacks to dialysis
facilities to obtain their blood testing business.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, two company vice presidents have pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges and are awaiting sentencing, Pearlstein said. Three other company
officials have been indicted, and an unspecified number of others are under
investigation, Pearlstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Medical Care is owned by Fresenius Medicare Care AG, a German
company that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services.
</P>
<P>
	   John Markus, senior vice president for corporate compliance with Fresenius,
stressed -- as federal officials did -- that National Medical Care's fraudulent
practices stopped soon after Fresenius acquired the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fresenius knew there was an investigation when it acquired National
Medical Care in 1996, and recognized it and accepted the responsibility to work
with the government to resolve these problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Relatives File Fed Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorneys for the great-uncle of Elian Gonzalez filed a federal
lawsuit today challenging the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling
that the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, called Elian Gonzalez vs. Janet Reno, seeks to overturn the INS
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said attorney Spencer Eig.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS' top official has ruled that Elian should be sent back to his
father. The boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after his mother and
stepfather drowned Nov. 25 trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted an INS deadline to return the
boy to his father in order to give Elian's relatives in Miami time to challenge
the INS decision in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has determined that the boy's status is an immigration matter, solely
in the jurisdiction of federal law, and brushed aside a ruling from a Miami
family court judge delaying the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS also rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's
father can represent his son before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday in Washington, leaders of several groups that want Elian returned
to his father warned they were prepared to call for protests and acts of civil
disobedience if the child is not sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, including the Cuban American Alliance Education Fund, urged Reno
to enforce the INS decision and release the boy to his father's custody in Cuba
before Congress or the courts become any more involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attorney general doesn't even need to wait'' for the courts and
Congress to act, said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. ``She has the final say. There
is still time for her to send Elian back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation that would grant
U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imposing citizenship on people feels a little like imposing religion on
people,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches,
which supports returning Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said today: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS' ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress has
rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said. ``That's what this is all about.''

trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn inched higher, with the near-term contract posting its highest close in

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Boycott Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Opposition legislators, fearing they've been shut out by a
deal between acting President Vladimir Putin's supporters and the Communists,
boycotted the new parliament for a second day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The chamber's speaker urged them to return to work to tackle Russia's
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sabotage must be avoided,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament. ``We must work constructively with all
factions and deputy groups.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 lawmakers walked out of the parliament's first session on Tuesday
after the Communists and the pro-Putin Unity group formed an alliance to pick
Seleznyov, a Communist who was speaker in the previous Duma. They also were
enraged by the two biggest factions taking control over most of the Duma's
committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite attempts by Seleznyov to play down the controversy, protesting
faction leaders refused to attend the Duma's agenda-setting council Wednesday.
They held a separate meeting to discuss strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   When the parliament was elected in December, the unexpectedly strong
performance by centrists -- including Unity -- raised the prospect that the Duma
would pass reforms that had been blocked by previous Communist-dominated
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the State Department said it would judge Putin and the Duma
by their actions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will visit Moscow
at month's end, said Tuesday that Putin ``seems determined to move reform
forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on Wednesday assailed the deal between the
Communists and Unity as ``one of the first signs of Bolshevik dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boycotting factions, include centrist and reform-oriented parties,
including the Fatherland-All Russia movement, led by Luzhkov and former Premier
Yevgeny Primakov, the liberal Yabloko party, and the Union of Right Forces. They
formed a council that is to meet Thursday to discuss how to avoid diluting their
effectiveness like opposition groups have done in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of the moderate Regions of Russia faction also joined the
boycott.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-line daily newspaper Slovo said the Communist-Unity deal was ``a
triumph of pure pragmatism over party colors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Primakov and Seleznyov met privately later Wednesday, but no other details
were given, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Also Wednesday, the Duma elected
five deputy speakers, including ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Lyubov Sliska of Unity was elected first deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov has declared he will run against Putin in
presidential elections March 26. Some Russian media suggested Wednesday that by
striking a deal with the Kremlin, the Communists had made it clear that Zyuganov
would pose only a symbolic challenge to Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   Primakov, who led the polls before Putin's quick ascent to nationwide
popularity, has not yet said whether he will run for the presidency even though
a support group formally nominated him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's other adversaries include Zhirinovsky, Yabloko head Grigory
Yavlinsky, pro-reform Samara Gov. Konstantin Titov. None of them is believed to
have a chance of beating Putin.

<HEADLINE> New Dietary Standards Target Fat  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nutrition experts revising the government's dietary
guidelines want to tell Americans to "go easy" on sodas and sweets and cut down
on meat, dairy products and other sources of saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines also would specify for the first time who might benefit from
moderate consumption of alcoholic drinks -- primarily middle-aged men and women
-- according to a draft of the new standards obtained by The Associated Press
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised standards also will put more emphasis on eating whole grains,
fruits and vegetables and will include a special section on food safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "These guidelines will be better than they have ever been," said Margo
Wootan, a senior scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
nutrition advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
	   Federally funded nutrition programs, including school lunches and Meals on
Wheels, are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are also widely
used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually when they come up for review it seems like an opportunity for the
food industry to weaken them," Wootan said. "This time I think the dietary
guidelines will actually ... provide consumers advice that's a little stronger
and more straightforward."
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member advisory committee that's writing the new guidelines is
including a subtle change in wording meant to make the standards more palatable
to consumers: The current guidelines recommend that people follow a diet that is
low in total fat. The new recommendation is for a diet that is "moderate in
total fat," but low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommended maximum fat intake won't change -- it will remain 30 percent
of total calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000 calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
	   But research by the food industry indicates consumers are put off by the
term low-fat and see a moderate-fat diet as easier to follow, even if the fat
content is the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "The goal is not to get people to eat no fat," said Susan Borra, a dietitian
with the International Food Information Council, the food industry's consumer
research arm. "The goal is to get people to manage their fat, to control their
fat. We need to find the word that communicates that."
</P>
<P>
	   Wootan said the wording change emphasizes that "what's really important is
to cut back on is saturated fat."
</P>
<P>
	   As for alcohol intake, the existing guideline says "moderate drinking is
associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals."
The draft guideline specifies who those individuals are -- men over 45 and women
over 55 -- and says there is "little health benefit for younger people."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the guidelines become official, they must be approve by the
departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. The departments
typically go along with the advisory committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   Panel members either declined comment on the draft or did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments were recently sued by the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine and other groups that contend the committee is stacked with
scientists biased toward meat and dairy products because of their ties to those
industries through research or advisory work.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, which seeks to block the committee from releasing its
recommendations, alleges that the guidelines "emphasize the consumption of meat,
dairy and egg products."
</P>
<P>
	   The food industry isn't necessarily happy with the committee's work,
however. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Pork
Producers Council opposed the emphasis on saturated fat, telling the committee
that it "unfairly indicts all foods of animal origin as bad."
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the industry also wanted to eliminate the section on sugar. The
current recommendation is for a diet "moderate in sugars." Instead, the section
is expected to be tightened. The draft suggests people "go easy ... on added
sugars" and cites fruit punch and lemonade as sources of sugar.
</P>
<P>
	   The sugar guideline should be left the way it is, said Lisa Katic, director
of scientific and nutrition policy for Grocery Manufacturers of America, saying
there has been no significant scientific research that would support targeting
added sugars.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Discusses China Trade Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton convened a rare Cabinet meeting to
review administration goals for his final year in office, particularly the
strategy for winning congressional approval of normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All hands will be needed on deck,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary William Daley urged opponents of the deal to consider the
economic benefits greater access to the Chinese market would offer U.S.
businesses, especially in the agricultural industry. China, with more than 1
billion people, is the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an extremely good deal for American interests,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the group also discussed new
health care proposals, which the president announced after the meeting, and
several points to be covered in his State of the Union speech Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   But a significant part of the discussion focused on China, participants
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are expected to vote by late spring on whether to grant China
permanent normal trading relations with the United States as part of a deal to
allow China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal Clinton administration officials made with China was one source of
controversy behind the large protests that disrupted the WTO meeting in Seattle
in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke at some length to the Cabinet about the implications of the
agreement on foreign policy and the American economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Republicans have suggested putting off the vote until August, an idea
Daley rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It must be sooner than that,'' he said. ``Some of this is obviously out of
our control but as you get later in the year it will probably be much more
difficult.''
</P>

	   Administration officials say that until Congress returns to Washington later
this month they will not have a full assessment of the trade deal's chances for

obviously were girding for a fight.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Relatives File Fed Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorneys for a relative of Elian Gonzalez filed a federal
lawsuit today challenging the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling
that the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit -- called Elian Gonzalez vs. Janet Reno -- was filed by lawyers
who represent Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle. Elian has been living with
his relative since he arrived in Florida from Cuba on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said attorney Spencer Eig.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS' top official has ruled that Elian should be sent back to his
father. The boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after his mother and
stepfather drowned Nov. 25 trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted an INS deadline to return the
boy to his father in order to give Elian's relatives in Miami time to challenge
the INS decision in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has determined that the boy's status is an immigration matter, solely
in the jurisdiction of federal law, and brushed aside a ruling from a Miami
family court judge delaying the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS also rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday in Washington, leaders of several groups that want Elian returned
to his father warned they were prepared to call for protests and acts of civil
disobedience if the child is not sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, including the Cuban American Alliance Education Fund, urged Reno
to enforce the INS decision and release the boy to his father's custody in Cuba
before Congress or the courts become any more involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attorney general doesn't even need to wait'' for the courts and
Congress to act, said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. ``She has the final say. There
is still time for her to send Elian back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation that would grant
U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imposing citizenship on people feels a little like imposing religion on
people,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches,
which supports returning Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said today: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS' ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress has
rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said. ``That's what this is all about.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Ice: Mystery Or Prank?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's great ice mystery is beginning to look like a
prank.
</P>
<P>
	   Around 30 chunks of ice are said to have dropped from the sky since Jan. 8,
some the size of basketballs, often in gloriously sunny weather, and just about
every Spanish region has taken a hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The precipitation has picked up so much in the past few days that scientists
said Wednesday they had collected enough samples and would not accept any more.
</P>
<P>
	   The Superior Council for Scientific Research urged people who find suspect
frozen matter to double-wrap it in plastic and keep it in a refrigerator. The
council is conducting chemical analyses and has promised to report initial
findings on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, chemists in Valencia did some checking of their own. They
say they don't know what the chunks are, but they know what they are not.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not human waste expelled from airplanes, as had been speculated,
because there is no evidence of microorganisms that would be present in urine,
the University of Valencia team said.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that a sample collected Saturday in the town of Meliana contained
sodium chloride, or table salt, and gypsum, which is chalk. Both are very
earthly, which weakens another popular argument -- that the chunks may come from
the tail of a comet.
</P>
<P>
	   But scientists quoted in newspapers say there are several puzzling things
about the chunks. First, a chunk of ice falling from a plane would smash into
many pieces, but the ones found so far have been intact.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, if this were a natural phenomenon, the size of the ice chunks should
vary. But most have been the size of basketballs.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there is the exponential increase in recent days -- 20 chunks of ice
found on Tuesday alone. At least half a dozen were quickly proven to be
practical jokes -- including a seven-pound block with perfectly sharp edges.

<HEADLINE> Russia Steps Up War on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military redoubled its drive to conquer
Chechen rebels on Wednesday, with troops fighting street by street in the
capital Grozny while helicopter gunships and cannons relentlessly pounded the
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, Russia's deputy chief commander in Chechnya,
announced Wednesday that the war was expected to be over by Feb. 26, although
``nobody is giving the forces any firm deadlines for ending the operation,'' the
Interfax news agency reported. He did not explain how he arrived at that date.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal forces pushed toward the center of Grozny from several directions,
trying to squeeze rebel fighters into an ever-tightening circle, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was impossible to verify the army's claims of progress. Reporters are
constrained from moving freely about the capital because of the danger and the
restrictions imposed by both the Russian and Chechen sides.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Associated Press reporter watched Wednesday as Russian forces in a
northwestern neighborhood called Mikrorayon-3 seized several shell-punctured,
five-story apartment buildings. They failed to take nearby nine-story buildings,
from which Chechen snipers kept up a steady barrage of bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's military command said 23 soldiers were killed and about 50 wounded
in the past three days of fighting in Grozny, the ORT television channel
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian jets rained bombs on the city throughout the day, sending deafening
roars echoing through empty streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny has been a bastion of rebel resistance throughout the war, which has
entered its fifth month, and its capture would give the Russian forces a boost
after a series of surprise counterattacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   But control over Grozny could backfire, as it did during the 1994-96
bloodshed in Chechnya. During that war, Russians took the city and held it for
more than a year, but lost it to the Chechens in a humiliating and bloody
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   After facing relatively little resistance in Chechnya's northern lowlands,
Russian forces have been stalled at Grozny for months and only recently began
pressing into rebel strongholds in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Russian helicopter gunships and artillery pounded the steep,
wooded mountain slopes near the mouth of the strategic Argun Gorge, about 30
miles south of Grozny. An AP reporter took shelter behind some rocks on the edge
of the village of Dachu-Borzoi as helicopters swooped down to strafe the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven civilians were killed Tuesday in an air raid against Dachu-Borzoi,
including seven members of the family of local administrator Alu Khasayev.
</P>
<P>
	   At the edge of the nearby village of Duba-Yurt, a knot of elders crowded
around Russian officers on Wednesday, pleading for an end to shelling. Adam
Akhyazov, chief administrator of the village, said three civilians had been
killed in Duba-Yurt over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When people want to leave the village, the Russians prevent them,
promising not to target the village,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a pro-Moscow Chechen leader claimed Wednesday to be mediating in
talks between several Chechen warlords and federal authorities. Malik
Saidullayev said the talks were proceeding ``with difficulty,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. He refused to say which federal agencies were involved in
the alleged negotiations or to name the Chechen commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The federal authorities) need to carry out a political dialogue with
these people, which is what I'm doing,'' Saidullayev told Echo of Moscow radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov confirmed that four Chechens had
arrived in Moscow for talks on conditions for civilians in the breakaway
republic, but said they did not constitute an official delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations are held continually,'' Korotkov told the AP. ``As for these
envoys, we don't know whom they represent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops marched into Chechnya in late September after rebels staged
armed incursions into the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan and allegedly
organized the bombing of several apartment buildings, which killed about 300
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
    FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser Co. fourth-quarter earnings more
than doubled, but still fell short of analysts' earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the three months ended Dec. 26, Weyerhaeuser made $179 million, or 81
cents per share, on $3.43 billion in sales, compared to earnings of $75 million,
or 38 cents per share, on $2.75 billion in revenue in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding items in both quarters, Weyerhaeuser earned $174 million, or 78
cents per share, compared to earnings of $30 million, or 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of
92 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its quarterly earnings were affected by lockouts at some

Floyd in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   It took a $5 million charge on its fourth quarter earnings associated with
the acquisition of Canadian timber company MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts $110B Health Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday unveiled a whopping $110
billion package of health insurance initiatives for his final year in office,
asking the Republican-dominated Congress to approve the largest investment in
health care since Medicare was created in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Less expensive versions of the programs died last year, in part because of
the president's own veto of the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cutting plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These proposals are a significant investment in the health of Americans,
another step toward giving every American access to quality health care,'' the
president said. About 44 million Americans lack health insurance, and the
president's proposal would cover about 5 million of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest ingredients of Clinton's plan are a $3,000 long-term care tax
credit, costing $28 billion over 10 years, and a $76 billion proposal to insure
4 million parents of children who receive health coverage under Medicaid and the
state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   Sensitive to the politics of a presidential campaign year, the president
credited Vice President Al Gore with helping shape the administration's plan. He
said Gore and his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, both have proposed
health programs more extensive than his own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you just look at what's going on in the election season this year, the
public cares a lot about health care and they're talking a lot about it,''
Clinton said in an Oval Office ceremony. ``I am elated that health care is an
issue in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president would pay for his program from the nation's huge budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Universal health insurance was Clinton's signature issue in winning the
White House in 1992. The program died in a Democratic-ruled Congress, prompting
Clinton to adopt an incremental approach of expanding health insurance. The
president eventually signed initiatives to allow workers to carry insurance from
job to job despite health problems, and to provide insurance for millions of
children under Medicaid and CHIP.
</P>
<P>
	   With the election year, health care is a hot topic again. Republicans and
Democrats alike are drawing up bills dealing with long-term care, drugs bought
via the Internet, prescription drugs and other initiatives. House and Senate
negotiators already are trying to reconcile compromises on a patients' bill of
rights and expansion of coverage for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm pleased to see the president joining the debate as we try to find
solutions to long-term care needs,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
chairman of the Senate's special committee on aging. Grassley has proposed
several measures, including tax deductions to encourage people to buy long-term
care insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   To help low-income parents, Clinton's program would create a new ``family
care'' portion of Medicaid and CHIP programs that insure needy children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to have healthy children without healthy parents,'' the
president said. ``We know parents who have access to health care themselves are
more likely to get care for their children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Further, he said the administration would intensify efforts to enroll more
eligible children, adding 400,000 children at a cost of $5.5 billion over 10
years. More than 2 million children are covered now.
</P>
<P>
	   Another proposal would resurrect Clinton's plan to allow workers as young as
55 buy into the Medicare program. Congress ignored the proposal last year. This
time, Clinton would make the proposal even more attractive for workers -- and
more costly for the government -- by offering a 25 percent tax credit for
participants in the Medicare buy-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of the buy-in and credit over 10 years would be about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also proposed aid for workers to buy COBRA health insurance
when they leave a job. The COBRA program allows workers to buy into their
employer's health plan for up to 18 to 36 months, provided they pay the premium.
However, fewer than 25 percent of eligible people buy the coverage, in part
because of the cost, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's initiative would offer a 25 percent tax credit for COBRA premiums
to make the cost more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   Other provisions of Clinton's initiative would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Give a 20 percent tax credit to small businesses to buy health insurance
through purchasing coalitions. The initiative would be limited to companies that
have not previously offered health insurance to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to insure children through age 20.
</P>
<P>
	   --Extend Medicaid coverage for people who leave welfare rolls to take a job.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand state options to provide insurance for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allocate at least $1 billion over 10 years to help public hospitals,
clinics and thousands of health care providers give health care to the
uninsured.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 71.36; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose to a new record today even
as investors punished Microsoft for a profit report that met published estimates
but failed to impress some Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
71.36 to 11,489.36. The Nasdaq composite rose 20.48 to 4,151.29, its first new
record since it closed at 4,131.15 on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft contributed most to the Dow's decline. Late Tuesday, the company
said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its fiscal second
quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said Microsoft's "whisper number" -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as 49 cents per
share, setting up some investors for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Microsoft officials warned of a potential slowdown in demand for
personal computers. Also, some analysts suggested Microsoft had benefited from
strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than strength in the software
business.
</P>
<P>
	   "Microsoft made their numbers and did not change the guidance, but they got
there in a very different way than expected," said Don Young, a Microsoft
analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
	   While they shunned Microsoft, investors returned to some big-name technology
companies that flourished in 1999. Qualcomm and Yahoo! rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a weaker market, Microsoft would have hurt the rest of the techs," said
Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities in Boca Raton,
Fla. "That was not the case today."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, financial companies found their sterling profit reports tarnished
by continued worries about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase Manhattan and Bear Stearns rose after reporting earnings that easily
beat expectations. But analysts said their gains were contained by continued
worries that rising interest rates will eventually cut into profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their good numbers are for the past," Kaltbaum said. "Interest rates are on
the rise, and that squeezes margins and puts companies' future earnings into
question."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve said today that the U.S. economy, fueled by robust
consumer spending and rejuvenated manufacturing, grew strongly in December and
in the beginning of January.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the report offered further evidence that the Fed will boost
interest rates next month. The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999,
and is widely expected to resume raising rates in an effort to prevent inflation
from escalating.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the Fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton said he was taking on the burden of
nudging Syria and Israel along their path to peace, and that neither country is
giving up despite the suspension in talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank have been assigned to the
Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and part of Israel's
capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Albright at her home in the
Georgetown section of the capital before seeing Clinton at the White House in
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Beat Wall St. Estimates  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The parents of United, American and America West airlines on Wednesday
reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. US Airways
suffered a steeper loss than analysts had projected, and the company's chairman
said performance "clearly was well below an acceptable level."
</P>
<P>
	   All were affected by rising fuel prices. United Airlines, the nation's
largest carrier, said its fuel charges were up 12 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   A barrel of oil for near-term purchase on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was quoted at $15.43 on Oct. 1, 1998; a year later, the cost of a barrel was
$24.54.
</P>
<P>
	   While airlines generally take steps to blunt the effects of rising fuel
costs, their earnings generally fall when price increases are steep.
</P>
<P>
	   Surpassing expectations, United's parent said fourth-quarter profits rose in
spite of higher jet fuel costs and Year 2000 fears that kept passengers away at
year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Worries about rising fuel prices, however, sent its stock down. Shares in
Chicago-based UAL rose 94 cents to $62.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL's stock has fallen since the company warned last week that higher fuel
and labor costs would result in lower-than-expected earnings for 2000. Before
the announcement last Thursday, shares were trading at $74.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL Corp. said net income for the October-December period was $259 million,
or $2.14 a share, compared with $156 million, or $1.25 a share a year earlier.
Excluding special items, fourth-quarter earnings were $1.91 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   That beat the consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial, who projected earnings of $1.75 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues came to $4.48 billion, nearly 5 percent higher than the $4.28
billion of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, net income was $1.67 billion, or $13.71 a share, up from
the 1998 total of $1.3 billion, or $10.24 a share. Excluding special items,
earnings per share came to $10.06 for 1999, down from $10.50 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year revenues were $18.03 billion, up nearly 3 percent from $17.56
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The parent of No. 2-ranked American Airlines blamed higher fuel costs and
travelers' Y2K fears for pushing fourth-quarter earnings down 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's second-largest carrier, based in Dallas, reported operating
earnings of $105 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with $167 million, or $1
a share a year earlier. That surpassed the 61 cents expected by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we continue to be concerned about the price of fuel, we are
encouraged by the strength of the U.S. economy and more-favorable recent trends
in industry capacity," said chairman and chief executive Donald J. Carty.
</P>
<P>
	   AMR said fourth-quarter revenue rose 7.6 percent to $4.49 billion from $4.17
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Including one-time items, the company said it earned $280 million in the
quarter, or $1.84 a share, compared with $182 million, or $1.09 a share, a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter, AMR announced the spinoff of Sabre, a
travel-reservation system, to its shareholders. Carty said the spinoff removes
the last non-airline unit from AMR.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, AMR reported net income of $985 million, or $6.26 a share,
compared with a 1998 total of $1.31 billion, or $7.52 a share.

<P>
	   Full-year revenues were $17.68 billion, a 1.1 percent increase from $17.48

<P>
	   Officials at US Airways Group expressed disappointment with the company's
1999 earnings, which included a deeper loss than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $47 million, or 68 cents a
share, excluding nonrecurring and special items. A year earlier, it earned $104
million, or $1.18 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the
Arlington, Va., company to post a loss of 63 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, its shares rose 31 cents to $25.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were $2.14 billion, little changed from $2.12 billion a year
earlier for the nation's sixth-largest airline in passenger miles.
</P>
<P>
	   "The year's financial performance clearly was well below an acceptable
level," said US Airways chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income was $197 million, or $2.64 a share, compared with
$538 million in 1998, or $5.60. Excluding nonrecurring and special items, net
income for the year was $37 million, or 50 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were basically flat at $8.6 billion, while operating expenses
climbed 10.2 percent to $8.5 billion, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials cited weather problems that affected passenger loads early
in the year, maintenance and air traffic control problems and crew shortages.
Aviation fuel costs also increased by more than 13 percent in 1999 to 58.63
cents a gallon, it said.
</P>

billion, up 9 percent from $2.02 billion in 1998.

</P>
<P>
	   The Phoenix-based holding company is the parent of America West Airlines,
which ranks No. 8 in passenger miles.

<HEADLINE> Former Italian Premier Craxi Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANCES D'EMILIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who defied Washington and stood up
to Italy's powerful communists during a record term as premier, died Wednesday
in Tunisia, where he fled to avoid a prison sentence for corruption convictions.
He was 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi died of a heart attack at his seaside villa in Hammamet, said his
lawyer, Giannino Giuso.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi had suffered for years from heart problems and other complications of
diabetes. In November, a Milan court ruled he could return to Italy for bypass
surgery on condition he serve his corruption sentence under house arrest. Craxi
refused.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd only return as a free man. Any different way, I won't return, nor
alive nor dead,'' Craxi said in an interview with RAI Italian state TV.
</P>
<P>
	   His daughter, Stefania, expressed bitterness Wednesday over what she said
was her father's abandonment by his country and many former political allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They killed him,'' she said, referring to some of Italy's prosecutors and
politicians and ``all the friends who turned their backs on him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He died like a dog,'' Stefania said, speaking in an interview with RAI
from her father's villa.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi was Italy's longest-serving premier of the postwar years, holding two
back-to-back terms from August 1983 to March 1987, a remarkable feat in a
country of ``revolving door'' governments.
</P>
<P>
	   He stood up to the United States in 1985, refusing to hand over the
Palestinian commandos who hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise ship and killed an
elderly American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Craxi also defied Italian communists -- the largest communist party in
the West and a big-vote getter in Italian politics -- by allowing NATO
nuclear-tipped missiles to be installed in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi was delighted by his political staying power. He once recalled his
reception by other European leaders at a summit in Germany in 1985. ``The other
members looked at me, seemingly relieved -- as if to say, `Oh, we know him, it's
the same guy we saw at the last meeting,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The best vacation is power,'' Craxi once said. Those words came back to
haunt him when his Socialists, along with the Christian Democrats they ruled
with in several coalition governments, were disgraced by the inquiries begun by
Milan's ``Clean Hands'' prosecutors in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   They eventually uncovered a well-oiled system in which businessmen filled
party coffers or politicians' pockets with hundreds of millions of dollars in
exchange for deals with the sprawling state economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the scandal, Craxi maintained he was an innocent victim of a
vendetta by jealous politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   He fled Italy in 1994, and a year later a Milan court declared him a
fugitive from justice. Two convictions have been upheld by Italy's highest
criminal appeals court, with sentences of 5 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in corruption
cases. He was absolved in three other cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not a saint but a politician who did some good for Italians. That's
why he was persecuted by his enemies,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a former
Christian Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Benedetto Craxi in Milan on Feb. 24, 1934, the future premier was the
son of a Sicilian lawyer who left the island to migrate north. Craxi dropped out
of the University of Milan for the world of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first elected to Parliament in 1968. A decade later, as Socialists
became the key to forming a government without the communists, Craxi worked to
move his party away from the communists and became its leader in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those immediately informed of his death was Pope John Paul II, who was
``recalling him with prayer,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope recognized that Craxi contributed to ``the good relations between
church and state in Italy,'' the spokesman said. Craxi updated a 1929 pact with
the Vatican, which saw the end of Roman Catholicism as Italy's official
religion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bettino Craxi is now entrusted to the mercy of God, a judge who will
certainly be fairer that human justice,'' said former Italian President
Francesco Cossiga, who visited him in Tunisia a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi's daughter, Stefania, said he would be buried in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his daughter, survivors include his wife, Anna, and son, Bobo.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Relatives File Fed Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorneys for a relative of Elian Gonzalez filed a federal
lawsuit today challenging the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling
that the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit -- called Elian Gonzalez vs. Janet Reno -- was filed by lawyers
who represent Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle. Elian has been living with
his relative since he arrived in Florida from Cuba on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said attorney Spencer Eig.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS' top official has ruled that Elian should be sent back to his
father. The boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after his mother and
stepfather drowned trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted an INS deadline to return the
boy to his father in order to give Elian's relatives in Miami time to challenge
the INS decision in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has determined that the boy's status is an immigration matter, solely
in the jurisdiction of federal law, and brushed aside a ruling from a Miami
family court judge delaying the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS also rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday in Washington, leaders of several groups that want Elian returned
to his father warned they were prepared to call for protests and acts of civil
disobedience if the child is not sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, including the Cuban American Alliance Education Fund, urged Reno
to enforce the INS decision and release the boy to his father's custody in Cuba
before Congress or the courts become any more involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attorney general doesn't even need to wait'' for the courts and
Congress to act, said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. ``She has the final say. There
is still time for her to send Elian back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation that would grant
U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imposing citizenship on people feels a little like imposing religion on
people,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches,
which supports returning Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said today: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS' ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress has
rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said. ``That's what this is all about.''

<HEADLINE> A.M. Rosenthal Finds Home at News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- After 55 years at The New York Times, former executive
editor A.M. Rosenthal has found a new home: its tabloid competitor, the Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
	   The hiring was announced Wednesday by News chairman and co-publisher
Mortimer Zuckerman, who said Rosenthal will write a weekly column for its Op-Ed
page. Rosenthal, 77, was a Times Op-Ed columnist for the last 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been reading the Daily News for most of my life and it is
exhilarating to think that after all these years, I will be writing for it,"
Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal wrote his last column for the Times on Nov. 5, 1999. The
Washington Post reported that Rosenthal, who won a Pulitzer Prize for the Times
in 1960 for his reporting from Communist Poland, was fired. Neither Rosenthal
nor the paper has commented on his departure.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal, who started as the college correspondent at City College and
ascended to executive editor during his half-century at the Times, "is sure to
bring a provocative, passionate, influential voice" to the News, Zuckerman said.

<HEADLINE> SWest Securities Gets Thrift Buy OK  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Southwest Securities Group Inc., a large brokerage and
financial services company, has won permission from federal regulators to buy a
federally insured thrift. The new company will sell both investment and banking
services on the Internet as well as traditional channels.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Wednesday its approval for
Southwest Securities, which provides both traditional and online discount
brokerage services, to acquire First Savings Bank of Arlington, Texas. At
current stock prices, the deal is worth about $76 million.
</P>
<P>
	   First Savings Bank, with $264 million in assets, has an online banking
division. It will continue to operate as a full-service thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the acquisition, "We are one of the first companies to be
able to offer both online brokerage and banking services," David Glatstein,
president and chief executive officer of Southwest Securities, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest Securities, based in Dallas, has said it plans to do limited
cross-marketing of financial products, such as selling securities investments to
thrift customers. Any major change to the thrift's business plan must be
approved by the thrift agency, which is part of the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The thrift agency also required as conditions of its approval that the
thrift and brokerage businesses operate separately and refrain from obligating
customers to buy financial products in order to get a loan.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest Securities is the latest in a string of insurance companies,
securities firms and other businesses outside the banking industry to get new
federal thrift charters in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the thrift agency granted the same powers to Aetna Inc., one of
the nation's largest life and health insurers, to mutual fund giant Fidelity
Investments and to American International Group Inc., one of the biggest U.S.
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   And last week, the thrift regulators approved online brokerage ETrade Group
Inc.'s acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which created the first
soup-to-nuts financial services company entirely based on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation, signed into law by
President Clinton, rewriting the financial services laws and allowing banks,
insurance companies and securities firms to merge and sell each other's
products.
</P>
<P>
	   By approving applications from a number of financial companies outside the
banking industry, the federal thrift regulators had chipped away at the
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries before Congress
acted.
</P>
<P>
	   Other companies receiving new savings and loan charters recently include
retailer Nordstrom Inc., agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
long-distance telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and coffin
manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Southwest Securities were down 25 cents to $29.25 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Late Bahai Leader Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Madame Ruhiyyih Rabbani, wife of a late Bahai leader and a
senior figure in the faith, died Wednesday in the Israeli city of Haifa after a
long illness. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Montreal, where she was called Mary Sutherland Maxwell, Mrs.
Rabbani married then-world head of the Bahai faith, Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, in
1937.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rabbani held several senior positions and played a major role in
increasing the Bahai faith to 5 million followers worldwide, said a release from
the faith's headquarters in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
	   Following her husband's death in 1957, she helped establish the nine-member
Universal House of Justice that Rabbani had said should replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rabbani traveled to 185 countries and territories as part of her quest
to integrate millions of Bahai followers into a unified global community, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also wrote books on religion and on her husband, including ``The
Priceless Pearl'' and ``Prescription for Living.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate information on survivors. Mrs. Rabbani will be buried
on Sunday in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
	   The faith is based on the belief that the will of one God is progressively
revealed through the prophets of the great religions. The founder, Baha'u'llah,
established the religion in 19th-century Persia, now Iran, which consequently
expelled him.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, more than 200 Bahai followers have been
put to death in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Jockey for Positioning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republicans are jockeying for
position in advance of Congress' election-year session -- the White House with
plans to expand health care and cut crime, the GOP touting tax cuts and an end
to the $3.7 trillion public debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If enacted, this would be the largest investment in health coverage since
the establishment of Medicare in 1965, '' Clinton said Wednesday as he rolled
out the $110 billion initiative, the latest in a string of proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The main ingredients would provide a $3,000 long-term care tax credit, and
extend insurance to four million parents of children who receive health coverage
under Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after Clinton spoke in the Oval Office, House Speaker Dennis Hastert
countered in New Mexico for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time since 1835, he said, retiring the public debt is within
reach, if Social Security surplus funds are protected and wasteful government
spending is attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, ``we will still be able to provide the American people
with much-needed tax relief'' and have funds reserved for any future bipartisan
plan to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, said Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men can offer their costly blueprints in large measure because the
economy that balanced the budget unexpectedly two years ago continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   And there is nothing unusual about this or any other White House touting a
series of politically attractive proposals in the early days of the year, when
Congress returns to work and the president readies his budget and a State of the
Union address. Clinton steps before a joint session of Congress and a nationwide
audience to present his speech Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   But beginning last fall, Republicans began to worry they would be ignored by
a public more tuned in to the State of the Union address and a double-barreled
fight for the 2000 presidential nominations in the early primary and caucus
states.
</P>
<P>
	   With control of the House at risk in the fall elections, they concluded they
could not wait until Congress returned to work to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
	   Their first salvo came the first week of the new year, when Hastert and
several other leaders held a news conference to sketch a program for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert talked in vague terms about eliminating the $3.7 trillion government
debt held by the public, as has the administration. Another $2 trillion in
federal debt is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders also announced that in contrast to last year's veto fight
over a huge tax cut, they would attempt to place a smaller bill on Clinton's
desk that would deal solely with easing the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year we will continue to fight for tax relief for working families,''
the speaker said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas mentioned trade legislation. Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., discussed bills dealing with technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The House GOP whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, announced plans for an effort
to attack wasteful government spending, and was expected to discuss the issue
further in a speech on Thursday that an aide said would serve as a
conservative's state of the union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The political context for the jockeying is clear in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the topic is taxes, health care, gun control or Social Security, the
overarching issue of the coming congressional session will be the battle for
control of the House in the November elections. A gain of five seats would give
Democrats control.
</P>
<P>
	   They appear bullish about their prospects, and Republicans have seen the
polling that suggest the public favors Democrats over Republicans on many
high-profile issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling shared recently with several GOP lawmakers suggests Republicans open
``a new issue front'' on subjects such as the national debt and government
waste, and attempt to reframe existing issues more to the public's liking.
</P>
<P>
	   That is what they are doing. At the same time they look ahead to trying to
forge compromises with Clinton on tax cuts, a minimum wage increase and health
care legislation that would blunt the claims of Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt
of a ``do nothing Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Republicans and Democrats will both be back in 2001, this is Clinton's
final year in office.
</P>
<P>
	   He is not going quietly, either.
</P>
<P>
	   By White House reckoning, the health care plan announced during the day was
the 22nd item on a list of proposals that runs from money for biomedical
research to a plan to clean up the Great Lakes to $280 million to expand
firearms enforcement programs.

<HEADLINE> Rio Oil Spill Called Region's Worst  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- At least 130,000 gallons of crude oil spewed
out of a broken pipeline, polluting beaches and endangering plant and animal
life in what authorities called the worst ecological disaster to hit Rio de
Janeiro state in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill occurred Tuesday, when part of a 12-mile pipeline from the Duque
de Caxias refinery sprung a leak near the coast, causing the oil to gush onto
beaches and into Guanabara Bay, said Petrobras, the government-owned oil
company.
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials said the leak was caused because Petrobras'
pipelines are old and poorly maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill, the equivalent of 315 barrels of oil, covered at least three
miles of coastline, affecting at least two beaches and a mangrove swamp rich in
animal and plant species, Petrobras said.
</P>
<P>
	   The affected area could be even larger, said Andre Correia, the head of the
state's Environmental Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The experience of our technicians tells us the spill was a lot larger,''
he said. ``Its extent was significant, and we have to act urgently.''
</P>
<P>
	   As much as 1 million gallons may have spilled into the bay, the O Globo news
agency reported, citing information from the State Environmental Engineering
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is Rio de Janeiro's worst ecological disaster in 10 years,'' Carlos
Minc, president of the state legislature's Environmental Affairs Committee told
the Jornal do Brasil newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras said an investigation into the cause of the spill would be
completed later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the spill is contained in Guanabara Bay and is not a danger to Rio's
well-known beaches, such as Copacabana and Ipanema.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The spill is at the mercy of tides and winds that could spread it to other
beaches and mangrove swamps,'' said biologist Mario Moscatelli of the
Environmental Affairs Department. ``The varied ecosystem of these swamps could
be irreparably damaged.''
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras said the cleanup would take at least 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Boosting Oxygen Helps in Post-Op  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Talk about an ounce of prevention: A study found that a few pennies' worth
of oxygen can cut the risk of surgical infections in half.
</P>
<P>
	   That can mean thousands and thousands of dollars less in medical bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Air is about 21 percent oxygen. But patients routinely get 30 percent oxygen
during and after surgery, because the lungs do not work well under anesthesia.
The study tested whether a richer mixture would improve the outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Boosting the oxygen level to 80 percent made a big difference. Twenty-eight
of 250 patients on the standard mix developed infections, compared with only 13
out of 250 who got extra oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and
was led by Dr. Daniel I. Sessler of the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is significant because it shows an easy, inexpensive way to make a
big cut in medical bills, said Dr. Avery Tung, an assistant professor of
anesthesia at the University of Chicago's medical school.
</P>
<P>
	   According to another study, postoperative infections add an average of
$12,500 to the cost of cancer surgery. The only cost to the richer-oxygen
treatment is about three cents' worth of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a matter of setting two knobs in different positions. Both knobs
need to be set anyway, and you just turn them a little more to get more oxygen,"
Sessler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have worried that extra oxygen might make the lungs more likely to
collapse. However, he said, a study of his last year in the journal
Anesthesiology found no difference in the percentage of such collapses on high
and normal doses of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   There was also an unexpected benefit -- patients who got extra oxygen were
half as likely to be nauseated after surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was conducted at the Donauspital in Vienna, Vienna General
Hospital and University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists already knew that the white blood cells known as neutophils use
oxygen to kill germs. And they knew that high levels of oxygen in body tissues
help prevent infection and that breathing higher levels of oxygen put more
oxygen into the tissues. What they did not know was whether it made a difference
in patients' healing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This shows it's not just a theoretical benefit but a real benefit, and that
it's much greater than you might have expected," Sessler said. "It's an enormous
benefit for no cost and effort and risk."
</P>
<P>
	   The study looked at bowel surgery patients because they have the highest
risk of infection. The findings might have even greater implications for burn
units, since infections cause most deaths there, said Tung, head of his
hospital's burn unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I had a wish list of another study I'd like to see, I'd like to see the
effect of this on preventing infections other than wound infections," he said.
"Or whether oxygen therapy might be used to speed healing" of other infections.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Vitamin E Veracity  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A large study casts doubt on the widely held belief that daily vitamin E
pills help ward off heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the study is unlikely to settle the question, it found no evidence
over 4 1/2 years that the pills do any good.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier research suggested that vitamin E may lower the risk substantially
in people who already have heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study of 9,541 high-risk patients looked at whether vitamin E or a
widely used blood pressure pill, called an ACE inhibitor, could prevent heart
attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACE inhibitor was very effective, and those results were reported when
the results were announced at a medical conference in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and
led by Dr. Salim Yusuf of Hamilton General Hospital in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   Yusuf said that vitamin E has been shown to help against prostate cancer but
that four earlier studies about vitamin E and heart problems were conflicting.
He said this might have been because of small doses, small numbers of heart
problems overall, or short treatments.

<HEADLINE> Cataract Surgery Pre-Tests Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The tests routinely given to patients before cataract surgery do not make
the operation any safer, and Medicare could save nearly $150 million a year if
they were conducted only when needed, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood tests and electrocardiograms are routinely done on cataract patients
because they tend to be older and are likely to have a number of illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, nine hospitals and walk-in clinics randomly assigned 19,250
cataract surgery patients to the test or no-test group. Patients in the no-test
group could be given medical tests only if their doctors saw a new medical
problem or an ailment that was getting worse.
</P>
<P>
	   Each group had just over 31 complications for ever 1,000 operations. The
numbers during surgery and those after surgery also were about the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and
was led by Dr. Oliver D. Schein, an ophthalmology professor at Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
	   Schein said such tests should be done only if a patient's medical history or
physical examination indicates they are needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The study "confirms what many of us have believed from several other trials
that have gone before," said Dr. Joseph Foss, head of the University of Chicago
hospital's clinic for patients who are about to go into or have just come out of
surgery. "Routine tests, without any reason other than the patient falls into a
certain category, don't seem to have a lot of value."
</P>
<P>
	   Foss said the study should not be taken to mean that all tests are
unnecessary. He noted that about 15 percent to 20 percent of the people treated
at his hospital are poor and may not have seen a doctor for years before showing
up for a cataract operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their eyes get bad enough, they come in -- and, lo and behold, they have a
myriad of other diseases. We end up being the entry point into the medical
system for those patients," Foss said.

<HEADLINE> Dust Mites May Exacerbate Asthma  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As doctors struggle to understand why asthma is rising at
an alarming rate, a report released Wednesday concludes microscopic dust mites
that lurk in carpets and bedding can push children who are susceptible to asthma
-- but don't yet have it -- to develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 17.3 million Americans have asthma, a respiratory disease that leaves
sufferers coughing, wheezing and gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
	   Cases of asthma have risen about 75 percent since 1980, particularly among
blacks and poor, inner-city populations, says the report released by the
prestigious Institute of Medicine that studied just how big a role the air
inside people's homes can play in the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have long warned that certain allergens can worsen patients' asthma,
triggering or exacerbating attacks of breathlessness.
</P>
<P>
	   But no one can explain why new cases are rising so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a major problem," said Dr. Richard B. Johnston of the University of
Colorado, who chaired the Institute of Medicine committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are genes that affect your susceptibility to asthma, but the genes
could not have changed over that period of time," he said. "Something else has
changed. It leaves something in the environment."
</P>
<P>
	   His committee didn't solve that mystery, or make any startling discoveries.
But the new report may serve as a practical guide to what in the indoor
environment is really proven to affect asthma, and what practical steps could
ease symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   The conclusion: Dust mites, cockroaches, cat dander and, for preschool
children, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke are the proven culprits in making
asthma worse for those who already have the disease. There is suggestive
evidence, but not proof, that mold, dog dander and pollution from poorly burning
gas stoves also play a role in worsening asthma.
</P>
<P>
	   The mere existence of dust mites cannot be the sole cause of a person's
asthma, because mites live in nearly all homes. But in children genetically
susceptible to asthma, exposure to dust mites can lead to the disease, the
report says. Secondhand smoke may prove to be a similar trigger for young
children, it says.
</P>
<P>
	   People have suspected that fragrances, formaldehyde and other chemicals that
can build up in indoor air may also play a role in asthma, but the report
concluded there is little evidence yet.
</P>
<P>
	   As for those expensive gadgets that claim to filter impurities out of indoor
air, there's also little evidence they do much good, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the report recommends simpler strategies to ease asthmatics'
symptoms, ones many allergy sufferers will find familiar:
</P>
<P>
	   --Encase mattresses and pillows in plastic covers, opt for leather sofas
instead of upholstery, and get rid of carpets, all favorite hideouts for dust
mites.
</P>
<P>
	   --Never allow smoking inside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   --Remove pets and then thoroughly clean to remove their dander.
</P>
<P>
	   --Exterminate cockroaches as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   --Control indoor humidity, because dust mites particularly, but also
cockroaches, thrive in humid conditions. Moisture easily builds up inside homes,
especially newer, well-insulated ones that have poor ventilation. For some
homes, opening windows an hour a day during dry seasons could be enough to help.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report's overarching conclusion is that "more research is
desperately needed" to understand how environmental conditions affect asthma.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Bid for Warner-Lambert Doubted  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street on Wednesday downplayed the chances that
consumer products titan Procter &AMP; Gamble would make a white-knight bid for drug
maker Warner-Lambert. Instead, skeptical investors brushed off reports of
high-level talks between the companies as an attempt by Warner-Lambert to
pressure Pfizer to raise its $79 billion hostile takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert Co. were up more than 5 percent in betting that the
raging takeover fight would lead to higher bids.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert said last week that -- despite its $57 billion merger deal
with American Home Products Corp. -- it would talk to Pfizer Inc. about its
richer bid. But executives at Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert also
started knocking on the doors of several rivals in hopes of finding a better
offer, according to two people involved in meetings, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions with Procter &AMP; Gamble have been the most serious. The
Cincinnati-based company also has entertained the idea of acquiring both
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, said one of the sources.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G, with sales of $38 billion, is looking for more profitable products to
complement its established, but slow-growing consumer brands like Tide, Crest
and Pampers.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert not only makes the best-selling anti-cholesterol drug
Lipitor, but also makes a host of consumer goods that would fit nicely under
P&AMP;G's umbrella, including Certs breath mints, Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash,
and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., makes Premarin, a hormone
replacement drug, and over-the-counter aids like Advil and Anacin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Procter &AMP; Gamble has been looking to add to its pharmaceutical business,
which is small, and they have the flexibility to acquire a pharmaceutical
company and have it work," said Michael Kagan, portfolio manager for the Salomon
Brother Fund, which owns shares in P&AMP;G, Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products. "A Warner-Lambert or an American Home Products is a good fit. They
have the pharmaceutical and the consumer products fit."
</P>
<P>
	   But he added "Any responsible CEO is going to have to gulp real hard before
they get involved in a bidding process. I think Pfizer needs (Warner-Lambert)
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Pfizer can hardly afford to lose. New York-based Pfizer has a
co-marketing agreement to sell Warner-Lambert's Lipitor, which is worth billions
to both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you lay out the numbers, it really feels that Pfizer has the upper
hand" over a potential bid from Procter &AMP; Gamble, Jeff Chaffkin, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "There will be more cost savings in the Pfizer-Warner-Lambert than
in P&AMP;G-Warner-Lambert."
</P>
<P>
	   And, ultimately, he added, "Pfizer needs the deal more than P&AMP;G, which means
they'll go much father to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer is best known for its Viagra impotence-treatment drug, but also makes
the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as Visine and BenGay.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the companies declined to comment on the talks, which first were
reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Many pharmaceutical companies are looking for partners to share the expenses
of funding research for new medicines. On Monday, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham announced a $76 billion merger that would create the world's largest
drug company. And last month, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced a $27 billion merger
with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most likely scenario is Warner-Lambert is just putting pressure on
Pfizer to raise its bid," Chaffkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Wednesday, Warner-Lambert said profit for the fourth quarter
jumped 40 percent to $487.3 million, or 55 cents a share, beating estimates by 3
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $3.53 billion, up 16 percent from the $3.04
billion year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of last year, earnings rose to $1.73 billion, or $1.96 a share, from
$1.27 billion, or $1.45 a share. Sales surged 20 percent to $12.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's shares rose $4.81 1/4 to $94.81 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange, where P&AMP;G's shares were off $1.43 3/4 at $115.18 3/4. Pfizer's stock
was up 50 cents at $37. American Home Product's shares were up $1.81 1/4 cents
to $46.

<HEADLINE> U.S. ABM Test Failure Is Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The breakdown of two heat-seeking devices aboard a U.S.
missile interceptor apparently is to blame for its failure to hit its target 140
miles above the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night, a senior military officer said
Wednesday in a preliminary assessment of the $100 million test.
</P>
<P>
	   The two devices, which sense temperature differences in order to ``see'' the
intended target, apparently malfunctioned, even while most of the rest of the
interceptor test sequence played out as planned, the officer said. He discussed
the preliminary assessment on condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The failed intercept is likely to deepen the divide between critics of
missile defense and supporters who assert America urgently needs a shield
against a potential attack from North Korea. The military officer who briefed
reporters Wednesday did not suggest that the failure was a major technological
setback.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the interceptor was ``extremely
close'' to hitting its target Tuesday night but missed at the last moment. It
might take several weeks to get a full understanding of the reasons, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately eight
minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific the
indications were that the interceptor would hit its target, the officer said.
The malfunctioning of the heat-seeking devices, technically called infrared
sensors, meant the interceptor could not ``see'' the target well enough to steer
itself into the target's path.
</P>
<P>
	   Private experts had said before the test that whatever the outcome, the
missile defense debate would continue to rage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Critics will say it proves the system is not ready, and supporters will
leap on it as proof that the program needs more money,'' said Loren Thompson,
head of national security programs at the Lexington Institute, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both of those assertions are true.
</P>
<P>
	   The failure of the Raytheon Corp.-built interceptor to hit its target -- a
mock warhead launched into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. --
demonstrates what the Pentagon already knew: more testing is needed, the project
is bound to encounter setbacks, and its eventual success is far from assured.
</P>
<P>
	   As missile defense doubter Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., put it, ``Obviously
this is a setback for the program. It demonstrates that the technology does not
exist yet to give anybody any confidence that this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration intends to ask Congress to add $2.2
billion to the coming year's budget to pay for more testing and to expand the
number of interceptors that would be fielded. So far, the administration
estimates that building the missile defense system will cost $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves at least two critical questions yet to be answered:
</P>
<P>
	   --Can the Pentagon build a national missile defense that can be counted on
to work in the event of an actual missile attack?
</P>
<P>
	   --Is there enough of a threat of attack -- whether from North Korea or any
other country -- to justify the cost, both in national treasury and diplomatic
complications with Russia and China, which oppose the project and assert that
building it will trigger a new and dangerous arms race? Many critics say no.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans dating back to Ronald Reagan have been pushing for a national
missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration argued for a number of years that there was no
threat that required an immediate push for a system. But in the past year, the
administration decided it should move ahead, although on a version significantly
scaled down from Reagan's vision of a space-based ``Star Wars'' defense.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is scheduled to make a formal decision by late summer on
whether to go ahead with deploying a system designed to protect all 50 U.S.
states against a limited ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The focus of missile defense in the 1980s, when President Reagan initiated a
crash development program, was the Soviet nuclear missile threat. Now that the
Soviet Union is history, attention has turned to so-called ``rogue'' nations
like North Korea that are said to be trying to build long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> USDA Announces Aid for Dairy Farmers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department Wednesday announced $125
million in direct cash payments to dairy farmers hurt by low prices, and
$500,000 to help small farmers and ranchers market and export their products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dairy farmers are being squeezed by market conditions that don't allow
them a fair price for their product,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
``This assistance is sorely needed to help keep many small- and medium-size
dairy producers in business until prices stabilize.''
</P>
<P>
	   The money is in addition to $200 million distributed last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dairy Market Loss Assistance program provides payments based on an
operation's milk production in 1997 or 1998. Eligible dairy farmers who did not
participate in the program last summer must sign up at their local Farm Service
Agency offices or USDA Service Centers from Jan. 24 to Feb. 28, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA also announced it would provide $500,000 to help small farmers
develop new ways to market their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Under USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program, the
University of Vermont, University of Nebraska, University of Georgia, and Utah
State University will select and assist new marketing projects such as direct
selling to restaurants and institutions, agri-tourism and pick-your-own farms.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA will also provide technical assistance to help small farmers and
ranchers form cooperatives to export crops and livestock to international
markets.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Touch Post-Gulf War High  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Petroleum prices surged Wednesday to the highest levels seen
since the Gulf War, raising concerns about worsening inflation and a possible
threat to the economies of poor, oil-importing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices turned lower later in the day for North Sea Brent oil but continued a
rally for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in oil reflects signs that OPEC is planning to extend production
limits as well as a cold snap in the northeastern United States that stoked
demand for heating oil and natural gas. Industry analysts said that even though
crude oil prices have more than doubled in the past year, countries dependent on
imported oil should be able to avoid severe economic pain, barring another big
and sustained spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the late retreat, crude contracts in London reached their highest
price since Jan. 16, 1991, on the eve of the air and missile offensive launched
against Iraq by U.S.-led forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the speculative buying is a result of expectations that ministers of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree in March to
extend the production limits adopted last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of tight supplies came in an industry report Wednesday of the
steepest annual decline in U.S. crude oil inventories in at least a half
century.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. oil inventories declined by more
than 136 million barrels in 1999, a 12.7 percent plunge from the previous year
and the biggest drop for a full calendar year in API records going back to 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Contracts for Brent oil for March delivery jumped 25 cents per barrel to
peak at $26.30 in early trading on the London International Petroleum Exchange,
before slipping to close down 21 cents from Tuesday at $25.84.
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery shot up to a new
nine-year high, rising as high as $29.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, before giving up some ground. It closed up 69 cents at $29.54 a
barrel, a level last surpassed at the onset of the Gulf War..
</P>
<P>
	   "These higher oil prices put inflation back on the corner of the radar
screen," said Peter Gignoux, managing director of the petroleum desk at Salomon
Smith Barney Citibank in London.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gignoux dismissed the run-up in prices as "a blip on the weekly chart,"
saying, "I think you need to see prices at this level for six months before you
start to get concerned."
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the oil market snapped a six-day losing streak when oil ministers
from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela began talking about extending OPEC's production
cuts of 4.3 million barrels a day beyond an expected March expiration date.
</P>
<P>
	   Gareth Lewis-Davies, an oil analyst at Lehman Brothers, argued that OPEC
would have to boost output to protect its own interests. By pumping more oil,
OPEC could trim prices and thereby discourage non-OPEC members from flooding the
market with their own crude and causing prices to crash.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a question of timing as to when OPEC will increase output. I foresee
it happening sooner rather than later," Lewis-Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that oil prices could fall as soon as this spring, when warmer
weather typically causes the seasonal demand for heating oil to wane.
</P>
<P>
	   If prices defy such forecasts and stay firm, oil-importing countries in
Latin America and Asia would have the most to lose, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand and India already have expressed concern over crude prices and are
discussing ways to limit any damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai politicians are weighing whether to cut taxes on gasoline to help
maintain the country's delicate recovery from the Asian financial crisis of
1997. The Indian government is considering raising tariffs on imported oil in an
effort to discourage its use, Lewis-Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Copper, Crude Oil, Corn All Soar  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Copper prices leaped Wednesday to their highest level since 1997 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by government statistics showing a surge in
U.S. housing construction last month.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a good day for other 'c' commodities, too -- crude oil roared to
another nine-year high, and corn hit a three-month high.
</P>
<P>
	   Copper, already on the rise due to an increase in aluminum and other
factors, was boosted to a 26-month high after the Commerce Department reported
that housing construction rose 7.1 percent in December. Copper is used in
electrical and plumbing industries and rises and falls with construction
industry demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Milder weather than usual helped explain the surprisingly high increase,
along with the zooming U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The housing starts were above expectations and were one more bullish mark
for copper," said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Copper for March delivery settled up 2 percent at 88.25 cents a pound after
hitting a high of 88.30 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude plowed unrestrained toward the $30-a-barrel mark as extra-frigid
weather in the northeastern United States spurred demand for heating oil. The
near-term contract for crude, for February delivery, hit a high of $29.68 a
barrel on the New York Merc before settling at $29.54, up 69 cents for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time oil closed above $30 was nine years ago this week on Jan. 16,
1991. American-led Allied forces bombed Iraq that night, and crude fell $10 the
next day.
</P>
<P>
	   After the close of regular trading, the American Petroleum Institute
released its weekly inventory report showing increases in crude and gasoline
stocks that were in line with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose by 812,000 barrels to 294.585 million barrels
in the week ended Jan. 14. U.S. gasoline stores rose 1.003 million barrels to
196.613 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
	   Refineries operated at 86.3 percent capacity, up from 85.8 percent the
previous week, but well below 95.5 percent in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil surged 4 percent, with the February contract rising 2.99 cents
to 80.03 cents a gallon. February natural gas rose 3.4 cents to $2.417 per 1,000
cubic feet, while February unleaded gas fell .46 cent to 76.74 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, North Sea Brent for February delivery fell 21 cents to $25.84 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn inched higher, with the near-term contract posting its highest close in
three and a half months. Another report suggesting that U.S. corn stocks are
shrinking for the first time in years helped buoy the price.
</P>
<P>
	   March corn settled up  3/4 cent at $2.20 3/4 a bushel. Other grains also
were up slightly on the Chicago Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Suits Concern Employers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than one-third of employers in a new survey say they
would probably cut off health benefits to their workers if Congress passes a law
allowing patients to sue managed care plans for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
	   The employers apparently fear the legislation could open the door to the
same kinds of suits against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies are already struggling to contain rising health costs and deal
with disgruntled workers who complain that managed care blocks their access to
care.
</P>
<P>
	   "Employers are asking themselves if this all worth it, if they are subject
to liability awards of frightening magnitude," said Jack Bruner, a consultant
with Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm that conducted the survey
of 600 large U.S. employers in September.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report released Wednesday about 36 percent of respondents said they
would probably drop health benefits for their workers if they were subject to
malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move would be a drastic change for many large employers, which have
made health insurance a basic benefit for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One big factor protecting workers is today's tight labor market, in which
companies are reticent to cut any benefits for fear of losing workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without the liability fears, some large companies have begun to look at
how they can reduce their role in providing health benefits. That was a common
theme at a meeting of corporate employee benefits officials at a New York
conference Wednesday sponsored by the Conference Board, a business research
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Some large companies are considering a voucher system, in which they give
their worker a set amount of money each year and let them buy coverage on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   But employee benefits experts said Wednesday companies would not move to a
voucher system until they could be assured health plans would charge the workers
a reasonable premium, and the plans would not discriminate against people with
chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Administering and paying for health insurance have become a distraction for
many businesses, said Steve Wetzell, executive director of Buyers Health Care
Action Group, a coalition of large Minnesota companies that jointly purchases
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The liability factor would give companies one more reason to stop providing
coverage, he said. "Its a huge issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Making their case, employers point to large jury awards handed down against
HMOs in states that already allow lawsuits. For instance, a California jury last
year ordered Aetna to pay a record $120.5 million in damages to a woman whose
husband fought until his death for coverage of experimental cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the House of Representatives passed HMO patient protection
legislation that included giving patients the power to sue their HMO. The Senate
version did not include the right-to-sue provisions. A Senate-House conference
committee is now trying to work out a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Although companies have relied on health maintenance organizations and other
types of managed care firms to control costs through most of the 1990s, the
Hewitt survey showed employers have serious concerns about the health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   About 37 percent of respondents said managed care has hurt the quality of
care, 60 percent said the health plans have restricted access to care and 62
percent said the plans have damaged consumer satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Navy Restores Ties With Tailhook  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Wednesday it is restoring relations with
the Tailhook Association, the naval aviators group whose 1991 Las Vegas
convention produced a sex scandal that forced the resignation of the Navy's
civilian chief and focused attention on sexual harassment in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've concluded that the time is right to restore ties,'' Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig said in announcing the decision, which was made jointly with the
Navy's top officer, Adm. Jay Johnson, and the commandant of the Marine Corps,
Gen. James Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means Navy and Marine Corps aviators will once again be allowed
to attend Tailhook conventions and professional development seminars on official
military business. Ties were severed in October 1991 after word got out about
drunken sexual debauchery at the Las Vegas convention a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Female officers were groped by aviators attending parties during the
three-day conference at the Las Vegas Hilton hotel. The Defense Department
inspector general implicated 117 officers in various offenses, ranging from
sexual assault to indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's
leaders for failing to stop the behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, then the chief of naval
operations. It also led to lawsuits, multiple investigations and changes in the
Navy -- including more emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an
opening of more aviation opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig had laid the groundwork for Wednesday's action by deciding last year
to send official Navy and Marine Corps representatives to the Tailhook
Association's August convention in Nevada to observe the proceedings. The
officers who attended recommended to Danzig that he restore official ties to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig, Johnson and Jones met with Tailhook officials in the Pentagon to
tell them of the decision and to caution that if their organization embarrasses
the Navy again, their relationship will be severed permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tailhook Association leadership is committed to the changes they have
made,'' Johnson said. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said, ``They have made
reforms and deserve our renewed support.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Finds Bodies of Businessmen  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police discovered 10 bodies on Wednesday, bound hand
and foot, strangled and left in a coal bin and garden of an Istanbul house,
reportedly by militants trying to form an Islamic state in a Kurdish region of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies, believed to be those of kidnapped businessmen, were found after
police questioned two senior members of the militant group Hezbollah captured
following a shootout in Istanbul this week. The group is not related to the
Lebanese militia of the same name.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they suspected the victims, who had been missing for weeks, were
kidnapped and killed by Hezbollah for supporting rival Islamic factions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Anatolia news agency said some of the bodies had broken legs or arms,
signs the men may have been tortured.
</P>
<P>
	   The businessmen were all connected to an Islamic charity group and
disappeared after allegedly leaving for meetings with members of Hezbollah. It
was not clear why the men agreed to attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mehmet Farac, an expert on radical Islamic groups, said Hezbollah typically
punishes its opponents by kidnapping them, imprisoning them and occasionally
putting them to death after a trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, police have been cracking down on Hezbollah, which draws
its support from poorly-educated rural Kurds and is believed responsible for
hundreds of killings in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Some experts and foreign diplomats accuse Turkey's government of giving the
group support and training in the 1980s in exchange for help in the fight
against Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has killed about 60 members of the PKK, but has never carried out
an attack on police or other officials, focusing instead on attacking its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our zealous authorities preferred to turn a blind eye to Hezbollah when
they were killing PKK members,'' columnist Oktay Eksi wrote in the Hurriyet
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Police killed Hezbollah's leader, Huseyin Velioglu, in a shootout in
Istanbul on Monday. Authorities found Velioglu's hide-out after discovering
repairs at the house were paid for with credit cards taken from the missing
businessmen, the Radical newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police discovered heavy machine guns, hand grenades and dynamite at the
house, reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to intelligence reports, the group was trying to shift activities
to the west of the country to escape strict police surveillance in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Suleyman Ekizer, head of the police anti-terror department, said Velioglu
was trained in Iran. However, visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
that Tehran supports the group. ``They are claims without proof,'' private NTV
television quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say they have detained more than 1,200 Hezbollah members in the past
year, most after Ocalan's capture in February. The group is believed to have
several thousand members.
</P>
<P>
	   Five Hezbollah militants were arrested in Ankara on Wednesday along with
material used to make explosives, the Anatolia news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Fed Lawsuit Filed in Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno declared last week that the boy's status was an
immigration matter, solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was picked up off the
Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno had overruled a ruling from a Miami family court judge delaying the
boy's return. But Reno postponed an INS deadline to return the boy to his father
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned trying to
reach the United States, and the boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after
he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father,
and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in
the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or
not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to give
Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts have insisted since the fervor over the case began that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no standing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative. That is the father,'' said David
Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, called Elian's
Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their attempts to
keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government, showing
disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of several U.S. groups that want Elian returned to his father have
warned they will call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child
is not sent back soon. The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation
that would grant U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said Wednesday: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS's ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress
has rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill
and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's sister Juanita Castro, who left Cuba in 1964 and now lives in
the Miami area, said she hopes the matter can be decided justly in court. She
would not say whether she thinks the boy should stay or be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope what happens is the best for him, for his destiny, for his
future,'' she said. ``This case, everything that has happened, makes me very
sad.''

	   Dow Ends Off 71.36; New Nasdaq High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose to a new high
today even as investors punished Microsoft for a profit report that
met published estimates but failed to impress some Wall Street
analysts. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.36 to 11,489.36.
The Nasdaq rose 20.48 to 4.151.29, its first record since it closed
at 4,131.15 on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft Leads Dow Decline
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft contributed most to the decline today
in the Dow Jones industrial average. Late yesterday, the company
said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its fiscal
second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. But traders said
Microsoft's ``whisper number'' -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as
49 cents per share, setting up some investors for disappointment.
Also, Microsoft officials warned of a potential slowdown in demand
for personal computers. Plus some analysts suggested Microsoft had
benefited from strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than
strength in the software business. ``Microsoft made their numbers
and did not change the guidance, but they got there in a very
different way than expected,'' said Don Young, a Microsoft analyst
at Paine Webber.

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, fueled by robust consumer
spending and rejuvenated manufacturing, continues to fire on all
cylinders, the Federal Reserve said today. Economists are taking
the report as further evidence that the Fed will boost interest
rates next month. In its most recent snapshot of the nation's
economic activity, the Fed reported ``strong economic growth in
December and January.'' Hardy consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of all economic activity, contributed to the strong
growth, as did a broad-based rebound in manufacturing as overseas
demanded increased.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising mortgage rates didn't stop home
building in December. The Commerce Department said home
construction shot up 7.1 percent, its biggest jump in more than a
year. Builders, aided by better-than-normal weather, began work on
new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71 million
units last month, the largest monthly increase in housing starts
since a 7.7 percent gain in October 1998. December's performance
surprised analysts, who were expecting a smaller rise of 0.6
percent.

	   Oil Prices Touch Post-Gulf War High
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Petroleum prices surged today to the highest
levels seen since the Gulf War, raising concerns about worsening
inflation and a possible threat to the economies of poor,
oil-importing nations. Prices turned lower later in the day for
North Sea Brent oil but continued a rally for the U.S. benchmark
West Texas Intermediate crude. The rebound in oil reflects signs
that OPEC is planning to extend production limits, as well as a
cold snap in the northeastern United States that stoked demand for
heating oil and natural gas. Industry analysts said that even
though crude oil prices have more than doubled in the past year,
countries dependent on imported oil should be able to avoid severe
economic pain, barring another big and sustained spike in prices.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The parents of United, American and America West
airlines today reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall

had projected, and the company's chairman said performance
``clearly was well below an acceptable level.'' All were affected
by rising fuel prices. UAL Corp. said net income for the
October-December period was $259 million, or $2.14 a share. AMR
Corp, the parent of No. 2-ranked American Airlines, reported
operating earnings of $105 million, or 69 cents a share. US Airways

announced restructuring to focus on business and government sales.
The Santa Clara-based company, known for its ads featuring naked

number of union members was 16.5 million in 1999, an increase of
265,000 workers from the year before, the Department of Labor's
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. However, the overall
percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at 13.9
percent. Nevertheless, union leaders said they believe the numbers
will translate into more political clout for organized labor in the
presidential election.

beating analysts' estimates by a penny. The company earned $622
million, or 65 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1998.
FleetBoston, however, took a one-time charge of $760 million during

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office has
established guidelines to clarify its arrangement with television
shows and other media outlets that want government financial
credits for inserting anti-drug messages into their programs. Under
the rules, the government will not review program episodes for such
credits until after the program episodes have aired or been
published. The office also will would keep the process of granting
financial credits separate from simply offering guidance to
networks or producers who seek advice on how to portray drug-abuse
situations. The arrangement has drawn criticism from some who say
the government is intruding on the independence of networks.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Vs. Major Currencies  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against major currencies Wednesday,
falling against the yen as speculation shifted direction about whether the Group
of Seven industrialized nations would help Japan weaken its currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell slightly against the euro as the British pound's rise
against the dollar helped weaken the U.S. currency against other European
currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0128, up from $1.0127
Tuesday, and the dollar was quoted at 105.36 Japanese yen, down from 105.72. The
British pound rose to $1.6439 from $1.6372.
</P>
<P>
	   During Asian trading, the dollar was up against the yen in Tokyo as
investors speculated that finance ministers at the G7 meeting this weekend would
issue a statement supporting the weakening of the yen. A strong yen hurts
Japanese export sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar's rally came as Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
reiterated the government's hopes that foreign-exchange rates top the agenda at
Saturday's G7 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dollar fell in subsequent trading in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without any new news, people began to think about the process" and recalled
that in September the G7 issued a statement supporting weakening the yen "and
they didn't do anything" to back up the statement, said Lisa Finstrom, a senior
currency futures analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   "Moreover, the market started focusing today on rumors the US might not be
supportive this time around" because Japan isn't taking big enough steps to
reform its finance system to extract the country from its worst recession in
decades, Finstrom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5944 Swiss francs, up from 1.5928, and
1.4525 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4502.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Tuesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9312 German marks, down from 1.9313; 6.4770
French francs, down from 6.4773; and 1,911.89 Italian lire, down from 1.908.97.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Supreme Court Action  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court took these actions Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Heard arguments on whether a Colorado law violates anti-abortion
protesters' free-speech rights by limiting ``sidewalk counseling'' in the name
of protecting patients' privacy. The law requires protesters to stay 8 feet away
from people entering healthcare clinics unless the person consents.
</P>
<P>
	   --By a 5-4 vote, made it easier for court-appointed lawyers to refuse to
file appeals for criminally convicted clients whose claims they think are
frivolous. The justices upheld California's rules on what court-appointed
lawyers must do in such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled unanimously that criminal defendants' convictions need not be thrown
out whenever a trial judge mistakenly fails to remove a potential juror who
showed signs of bias. Such errors do not violate fair-trial rights if defendants
use automatic challenges to remove such people and then are convicted by juries
with no biased members, the court said in an Arizona case.
</P>
<P>
	   --Upheld, 5-4, the death sentence of a man who murdered a Virginia state
trooper. The court said the sentencing jury was adequately instructed, although
the four dissenting justices said the jurors who sentenced the killer likely
wanted to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled that Guam Gov. Carl Gutierrez was lawfully re-elected in 1998 and
need not face a runoff vote. The unanimous ruling reversed a lower court
decision that said a runoff would have to be held.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Reports $238.8M Loss  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. lost $231.8 million in
the fourth quarter as the cost of transforming the one-time aerospace giant into
an entertainment and Internet services company undercut a 54 percent rise in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss translates to 58 cents per share -- a penny better than the 59-cent
loss that analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted -- and
compared with earnings of $123.1 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares rose $2.25 to $121.25 in late New York Stock Exchange trading.
Hughes is a subsidiary of General Motors Corp., but its shares trade separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes announced last week it would sell its satellite manufacturing
business to Boeing in a $3.75 billion cash deal. The sale will take the company,
which once built airplanes and spy satellites for the U.S. government, out of
the aerospace business.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will focus on its DirecTV wireless television service and new
ventures to provide high-speed wireless Internet and other communications
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Results reported Wednesday do not include revenues from satellite
manufacturing. Those figures were excluded as required by accounting standards,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth quarter earnings were hurt by other changes designed to facilitate
Hughes' transformation: a $272 million pretax charge from a decision to
discontinue mobile cellular and other telephone services, and depreciation and
amortization expenses related to its 1999 acquisition of the U.S. Satellite
Broadcasting Co. and Primestar satellite-to-home TV networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter loss, excluding the effect of GM purchase accounting
adjustments, was $226.7 million, compared with earnings of an adjusted $128.2
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, up 54 percent from $1.11 billion
a year ago. The growth was driven by DirecTV, which added more than 651,000
subscribers in the United States and Latin America during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Hughes lost $291.3 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with
earnings of $250.7 million, or 68 cents a share in 1998. After the accounting
adjustment, the 1999 loss was $270.3 million compared with earnings of $271.7
million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the year were $5.56 billion, up 60 percent from $3.48 billion
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Dietary Standards Target Fat  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nutrition experts revising the government's dietary
guidelines want to tell Americans to limit sugary drinks and sweets and cut down
on foods rich in saturated fats such as meat and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines also would specify for the first time who might benefit from
moderate consumption of alcoholic drinks -- primarily middle-aged men and women
-- according to a draft of the new standards obtained by The Associated Press
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised standards also will put more emphasis on eating whole grains,
fruits and vegetables and will include a special section on food safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "These guidelines will be better than they have ever been," said Margo
Wootan, a senior scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
nutrition advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
	   Federally funded nutrition programs, including school lunches and Meals on
Wheels, are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are also widely
used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually when they come up for review it seems like an opportunity for the
food industry to weaken them," Wootan said. "This time I think the dietary
guidelines will actually ... provide consumers advice that's a little stronger
and more straightforward."
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member advisory committee that's writing the new guidelines is
including a subtle change in wording meant to make the standards more palatable
to consumers: The current guidelines recommend that people follow a diet that is
low in total fat. The new recommendation is for a diet that is "moderate in
total fat," but low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommended maximum fat intake won't change -- it will remain 30 percent
of total calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000 calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
	   But research by the food industry indicates consumers are put off by the
term low-fat and see a moderate-fat diet as easier to follow, even if the fat
content is the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "The goal is not to get people to eat no fat," said Susan Borra, a dietitian
with the International Food Information Council, the food industry's consumer
research arm. "The goal is to get people to manage their fat, to control their
fat. We need to find the word that communicates that."
</P>
<P>
	   Wootan said the wording change emphasizes that "what's really important is
to cut back on is saturated fat."
</P>
<P>
	   As for alcohol intake, the existing guideline says "moderate drinking is
associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals."
The draft guideline specifies who those individuals are -- men over 45 and women
over 55 -- and says there is "little health benefit for younger people."
Moderate drinking is defined as one drink a day for women and no more than two
daily for men.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the guidelines become official, they must be approved by the
departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. The departments
typically go along with the advisory committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   Panel members either declined comment on the draft or did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments were recently sued by the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine and other groups that contend the committee is stacked with
scientists biased toward meat and dairy products because of their ties to those
industries through research or advisory work.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, which seeks to block the committee from releasing its
recommendations, alleges that the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat,
dairy and egg products, ignoring the special dietary needs of minority groups.
Many blacks, for example, are lactose intolerant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, it looks to me as if they were written with health interests only
about half weighed-in and the remaining part was written with an eye to the meat
and dairy industries," said Neil Barnard, president of the physicians group.
</P>
<P>
	   The food industry isn't necessarily happy with the committee's work,
however. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Pork
Producers Council opposed the emphasis on saturated fat, telling the committee
that it "unfairly indicts all foods of animal origin as bad."
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the industry also wanted to eliminate the section on sugar. The
current recommendation is for a diet "moderate in sugars." Instead, the section
is expected to be tightened. In its draft, the committee suggests people limit
their intake of foods with added sugars, including desserts, fruit punch and
lemonade.
</P>
<P>
	   The sugar guideline should be left the way it is, said Lisa Katic, director
of scientific and nutrition policy for Grocery Manufacturers of America, saying
there has been no significant scientific research that would support targeting
added sugars.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton said he was taking on the burden of
nudging Syria and Israel along their path to peace, and that neither country is
giving up despite the suspension in talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in New Hampshire, meanwhile, Republican presidential hopeful
George W. Bush said the United States should not impose a Mideast settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no lasting peace if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel
like they must accept an agreement because it makes us happy,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank have been assigned to the
Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and part of Israel's
capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Albright at her home in the
Georgetown section of the capital before seeing Clinton at the White House in
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> West Sees Changes With Mild Winter  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE VOGT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- It's been raining in Aspen. Bears haven't been able to sleep
in California. And skiers are going mountain-biking and horseback-riding
instead.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been an unseasonably warm and dry winter across much of the West so
far, worrying ski resorts and other businesses that depend on snow.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ski resort town of Aspen, Colo., it rained this week -- only the
second January rain in the 7,930-foot-high town since 1950. In Park City, Utah,
ski resort runs are covered in wet, heavy snow instead of the typical calf-deep
powder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lake Tahoe area along the Nevada-California line got up to 2 feet of
snow last weekend, helping some ski resorts finally reach or approach full
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, said it is
too soon to write off the season. Poor conditions ``could fall into a distant
memory if it snows in the last two-thirds of the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no consensus among forecasters on how long the mild weather may
last.
</P>
<P>
	   The delayed winter has interrupted hibernation patterns for black bears in
Nevada. The bears typically ease toward hibernation between Thanksgiving and
Christmas. But with above-normal temperatures and scant snow, the bruins have
continued roaming mountains and neighborhoods in search of food.
</P>
<P>
	   As of early January, 15 bears tracked by Nevada state biologists were still
active.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of moisture has some cattle ranchers fearing it could lead to poor
feed this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, resorts in the Northwest have piles of snow. On Monday, crowds
at Schweitzer Mountain Resort near Sandpoint, Idaho, enjoyed 100 inches of snow
on top of the mountain -- the deepest snowpack on a list of 66 resorts in
Colorado, California, Utah and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   The warm and dry weather has been a mixed blessing in the Colorado resort
town of Durango. The city set a record Sunday with a high temperature of 56
degrees, which forced an ice skating rink to close and the Purgatory Resort to
halt snowmaking operations.
</P>
<P>
	   But ``it's been great for us,'' said Kim Baird at Southfork Outfitters,
which operates outdoor excursions. ``We've been doing lots of horseback rides
because people can't ski.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Sit-In Ends  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two black lawmakers ended their sit-in at the
lieutenant governor's office Wednesday, saying Gov. Jeb Bush agreed to delay
implementation of his executive order ending affirmative action so public
hearings could be held on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kendrick Meek of Miami and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville, both
Democrats, spent the night in Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan's office after failing to
persuade Bush and Brogan to rescind the order Tuesday. They left about 24 hours
after the sit-in began.
</P>
<P>
	   The two lawmakers issued a written statement outlining an agreement reached
after they met with Bush about his plan to replace affirmative action with what
the governor calls his ``One Florida'' program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush contends his plan will increase minority enrollment in state
universities. It guarantees admission to some state universities to the top 20
percent of the state's high school seniors, adds $20 million to the state's
financial aid budget and makes it easier for minority businesses to be certified
to work across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of the governor's willingness to take these affirmative steps,
we've agreed to rescind our demand that the governor immediately suspend the One
Florida executive order,'' the lawmakers said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Bush agreed to a formal meeting with the Black Caucus and other
interested lawmakers and to delay a Board of Regents vote on the program until
Feb. 17. The Regents, who oversee the state university system, had been
scheduled to act on the proposal Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement also calls for three public hearings. In addition, the
lawmakers said, Bush agreed to a good-faith review of their written comments and
recommendations for improving One Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We informed the governor of our strong support for affirmative action and
the potential harm to our communities if the One Florida initiative rolls back
or repeals the gains made possible by our existing affirmative action law,'' the
legislators said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
	   They also apologized ``for any inconvenience our actions have caused.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest escalated Wednesday as 20 more lawmakers and about 100
protesters, including many students from predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M
University, crowded the Capitol hallways outside the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of miles away in Miami about 100 students, teachers and employees
at Florida International University protested outside Bush's South Florida
office.
</P>
<P>
	   They carried signs that read, ``Stop racism,'' and chanted, ``Shame on
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest of Bush's executive order ending racial preferences in hiring
and university admissions overshadowed the unveiling of the governor's proposed
budget for the next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush apologized at Wednesday's budget news conference for a widely televised
remark the night before in which he told an aide to ``kick their asses out'' in
reference to reporters covering the sit-in. Shortly after noon Wednesday, agents
from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement removed nine reporters,
</P>
<P>
	   ``I made a statement that I'm not going to repeat because my mother wouldn't
like me to say the 'A word,''' Bush said. ``I apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before it ended, Bush had denounced the sit-in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be as if I sent Frank Brogan over to Senator Meek's office and
said 'Until you change your position on a particular subject and support me,
we're not going to leave the office,''' Bush said.

<P>
	   The bank company said earnings in its fourth quarter rose 46 percent to
$1.97 per share, easily exceeding analysts' forecasts of $1.32 per share. Chase
said investment banking fees rose 31 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper company earned 81 cents per share in the quarter, below First

<HEADLINE> Navy Restores Ties With Tailhook  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Wednesday it is restoring relations with
the Tailhook Association, the naval aviators group whose 1991 Las Vegas
convention produced a sex scandal that forced the resignation of the Navy's
civilian chief and focused attention on sexual harassment in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've concluded that the time is right to restore ties,'' Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig said in announcing the decision, which was made jointly with the
Navy's top officer, Adm. Jay Johnson, and the commandant of the Marine Corps,
Gen. James Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means Navy and Marine Corps aviators will once again be allowed
to attend Tailhook conventions and professional development seminars on official
military business. Ties were severed in October 1991 after word got out about
drunken sexual debauchery at the Las Vegas convention a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Female officers were groped by aviators attending parties during the
three-day conference at the Las Vegas Hilton hotel. The Defense Department
inspector general implicated 117 officers in various offenses, ranging from
sexual assault to indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's
leaders for failing to stop the behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, then the chief of naval
operations. It also led to lawsuits, multiple investigations and changes in the
Navy -- including more emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an
opening of more aviation opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was molested at the convention, filed
a lawsuit and received $400,000 from the Tailhook Association and $6.8 million
from Hilton Hotels. Her attorney Dennis Schoville, said in an interview
Wednesday that he understands why the Navy wants to restore ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it needs to be properly monitored,'' he said. ``Hopefully people
learned lessons from this and they must not let it happen again.'' He said Ms.
Coughlin was declining requests for interviews on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig had laid the groundwork for Wednesday's action by deciding last year
to send official Navy and Marine Corps representatives to the Tailhook
Association's August convention in Nevada to observe the proceedings. The
officers who attended recommended to Danzig that he restore official ties to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig, Johnson and Jones met with Tailhook officials in the Pentagon to
tell them of the decision and to caution that if their organization embarrasses
the Navy again, their relationship will be severed permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tailhook Association leadership is committed to the changes they have
made,'' Johnson said. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said, ``They have made
reforms and deserve our renewed support.''
</P>
<P>
	   The association is named for the hook on an aircraft that snags an arresting
cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier. As of last year, it had about
10,000 members, down from a 1991 peak of about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its annual conventions, which include professional seminars, the
group sponsors college scholarships for children of former naval aviators and
publishes a magazine on carrier aviation called Hook.

<HEADLINE> Justices grill lawyers over abortion notification law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State Supreme Court justices want to know why
young, pregnant girls desiring an abortion are treated differently than girls
who want to continue a pregnancy, under the state's parental notification law.
<P>
	   They also asked abortion-rights lawyers whether certain changes would make
the law less burdensome to young girls.
</P>
<P>
	   The questions to lawyers on both sides of the issue came during a 90-minute
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The notification law requires doctors of girls under 17 to tell one parent
at least 48 hours before having an abortion. The law was to take effect on Sept.
26, but legal challenges have kept it from being implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's highest court will decide whether the act is constitutional. The
justices gave no indication when they would decide.
</P>
<P>
	   The law is supposed to protect minor girls from their own immaturity by
getting parents involved in her decision to have an abortion. It is also
supposed to protect parents' rights to be involved with their children's choices
and encourage family communication.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union, representing abortion providers,
contends no evidence proves the law accomplishes any of these objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Dalven, ACLU attorney, said the law should be stricken because it
invades girls' privacy and it discriminates against girls who want an abortion
versus those who want to carry a pregnancy to term.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the law places burdens on young girls, the state must prove the law
does more good than harm, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no evidence that this act actually protects teen-agers," said
Dalven. "The evidence shows that it, in fact, harms teen-agers."
</P>
<P>
	   But Michael Haas, assistant attorney general, said the only evidence the
justices need can be found in rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts
that have found the laws serve a compelling public interest.
</P>
<P>
	   "What New Jersey did here was right in the mainstream of legislative action
in this country," Haas said. "Court decisions throughout the country have
already addressed all these issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Gary Stein disagreed. He told Haas that the U.S. Supreme Court,
which has upheld parental involvement laws, never grappled with some issues
being raised in New Jersey, including the question of whether the law
discriminates against girls seeking abortions. He also said some states have
struck down the laws.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is the 41st state to enact a parental involvement law.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if it's fair to represent the issue as if it's cut and dried,"
Stein said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said evidence is accumulating, now that the laws have been in effect
for several years, that show they can be harmful to teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Tasy, director of New Jersey Right To Life, who attended Wednesday's
hearing, said afterward that she believes the laws actually encourage
communication between teen-agers and their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices also wanted to know why the law excludes girls who want to
carry their pregnancy to term.
</P>
<P>
	   Haas said the state has an interest in making sure these girls get early
prenatal care, implying that if they have to tell their parents about a
pregnancy, they would delay seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the exact argument the ACLU and abortion rights advocates have been
making since the law was first introduced. Outside the courtroom, Haas denied
his statement bolsters the ACLU's argument.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices also focused on the law's "judicial bypass" provision, which
allows minors to ask a judge to allow them to skip telling their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Reading from the record, Stein quoted judges from other states saying they
always granted the bypass requests and the proceedings were meaningless
formalities.
</P>
<P>
	   If that's the case, Stein questioned, then how does the law serve the
state's interest of protecting minors from their own immaturity.
</P>
<P>
	   Haas said all minors affected by the law should be considered. So, in some
cases, the law may prompt an immature girl to talk to her parents. He also said
the law is intended to protect parents' rights to know about their daughters'
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices also asked Dalven whether there were ways to make the judicial
bypass less burdensome to young girls. Under the law, girls would have to make
several trips to the courthouse and provide their name and address.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the process were made less onerous, would you find that constitutionally
acceptable?" Chief Justice Deborah Poritz asked.
</P>
<P>
	   No, Dalven said, because the law would still treat girls who want to have an
abortion differently than those who want to have a child.

<HEADLINE> White House Creates Drug Guidelines  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office set guidelines Tuesday
to clarify its arrangement with broadcasters who want government financial
credits for inserting anti-drug messages into their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new rules, the government will not review program episodes for
such credits until after the episodes have aired or been published. The office
also said it would keep separate its process for granting financial credits from
its role in advising networks and producers on how to portray situations
involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the change should put ``the
program on a track where it will get universal support.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've revised their policy to no longer look at scripts or do changes in
programming for credit before a program is finished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The office was responding to recent fallout from the disclosure that the
government used financial incentives to get TV networks to include anti-drug
messages into their shows, in some cases even reviewing the scripts before the
programs aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement has been criticized as government intrusion on the
independence of networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines set out Tuesday are an effort ``to eliminate any
misunderstandings and prevent any inference of federal intrusion in the creative
process,'' said Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new parameters still require a 100 percent match for every dollar the
federal government spends on media outlets and continue to allow broadcast
executives to decide how to meet this requirement. Namely, networks can still
receive financial credit for the content of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the drug office said it would still make available scientific
and technical experts to the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have forged a strong partnership with the entertainment and media
community and look forward to continuing to strengthen those ties,'' said
McCaffrey. The office plans to periodically seek the advice of the entertainment
industry on the credit process as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial spot bought by
the government with a free one. Since the program started, however, the
government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as the
networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that evaluation will take place after the programs have been aired,
according to the office.
</P>
<P>
	   Network executives said any guidelines that more clearly defined the
relationship between the media outlets and the government would be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it can only help in clarifying how the process works,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Shirley Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also asserted that NBC never did anything it considered
inappropriate. In cases where the network did send the drug office scripts for
shows, those programs already were complete, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scripts ``were never sent for approval or input,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce Committee's
telecommunications panel, still wants to hold hearings on the matter this
spring, despite the establishment of the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to allow the federal government to become a censor,'' said
Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Tax Plan Not Fully Disclosed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- John McCain's presidential campaign said Wednesday
his tax plan has not been fully disclosed, even as aides disputed George W.
Bush's claim that the proposal would raise taxes by $40 billion on American
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican contenders' tax war was highlighted by an odd confrontation
at McCain's headquarters outside Washington. It occurred after a McCain aide
offered on national television to permit Bush supporters to examine the
senator's tax plan in detail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush backers who showed up a few hours later, Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio,
and economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, were turned away minus the details they
had sought on a provision ending exemptions on some fringe benefits provided by
employers -- a provision that presumably would make those benefits taxable as
income.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur acknowledged that campaign documents listing
$151 billion in tax loopholes were not complete but insisted that details would
soon be forthcoming to show that the fringe benefit item would raise $3.9
billion, not $40 billion as Bush claims. In addition, Schnur said the plan
actually includes more exemptions for such employer-provided benefits as
continuing education, group life insurance, dependent care and health care that
have been targeted by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our original plan does include other exemptions,'' Schnur told Lindsey and
Portman. ``I hope you'll take my word for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about that comment, Lindsey said, ``There are many things I'm willing
to take on faith, but what we were reading was the plain English of the McCain
tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   To the Bush campaign, McCain's refusal to release the details demonstrates
that the Arizona senator's five-year, $237 billion tax proposal was not
thoroughly worked through. Bush, who has a much larger five-year, $483 billion
tax cut, is airing TV ads in New Hampshire slamming McCain's loophole closure as
a tax increase on workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I'm doing is talking about what he put down on paper,'' Bush, the
Texas governor, said while campaigning at a restaurant in Plaistow, N.H. ``If
what he's saying is 'I'm changing it,' then I look forward to hearing what the
changes are. He had a chance in the debate in Iowa to set the record straight. I
asked him.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, continued to criticize the Bush ads as a distortion of
his tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whenever you run an ad that's inaccurate, it's wrong,'' McCain said in New
York after a meeting with the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations. ``I'm worried about the trend. ... This has been a very high
level of debate, and one that's been characterized by respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the rhetoric, independent experts said it was difficult to determine
exactly what McCain's loophole elimination proposal would do because of the lack
of detail. Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director now
with the Brookings Institution, said it would be difficult for McCain's loophole
closures to add up to $151 billion without the $40 billion in fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's not $40 billion, how does McCain get to that level?'' Reischauer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign also released documents from the Joint Committee on
Taxation, which provides official estimates of tax bills for Congress, listing
the employer-provided fringe benefits that could become taxable under McCain's
plan: health care, adoption assistance, group life insurance, dependent care
assistance and meals or lodging provided for the employer's convenience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'd love to see the numbers,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides, meanwhile, produced a letter from Fiscal Associates, Inc. --
an independent economic consulting firm in Arlington, Va. -- saying that the
senator's tax plan ``proposed no change'' in current rules exempting many fringe
benefits from taxation. But they would not release the details needed to examine
that claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp did offer to hold a second meeting with Bush's economic
team, saying the senator's senior advisers were not available on short notice
Wednesday to go over the numbers.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore picks up, Bush GOP choice among New Yorkers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A neck-and-neck battle for the New York presidential
vote may hinge on what happens in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac College Polling Institute survey released Wednesday found that
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley remain in a
statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
	   But either Democrat would have an edge in a general election against
Republican favorites George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute, emphasized that a big
win by Bradley in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary could pay off in unstoppable
momentum for the former New York Knicks star for New York's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've always known we'd face a tough fight in Bill Bradley's backyard,"
said Gore spokesman Peter Ragone, "and Al Gore intends to fight his heart and
soul out for every vote in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   "Polls go up and polls go down," said Julia Rothwax of the Bradley campaign,
downplaying the slight rise for Gore. The former senator has consistently polled
well against Republicans, so the picture in New York is no surprise, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll questioned 812 registered voters in the state from Jan. 11-17. It
found Gore and Bradley in a statistical tie: 44 percent for Gore, 39 percent for
Bradley. In December, the same pollsters found Gore supported by 42 percent and
Bradley by 39 percent - again, a statistical tie. Bradley led in November,
however, 47 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll released Wednesday has a margin of error of 3 percentage points
when both Republicans and Democrats were questioned. The margin of error
increased to 5.5 percentage points for the answers from the 330 Democrats
questioned, and to 6 percent for the responses of the 246 Republicans
questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, maintained a solid lead in the Republican race
with 47 percent to 28 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's primary is seen as a critical test for Bradley because of his
almost favorite-son status here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led Bush 52 percent to 35 percent, according to the poll. Gore had a
47 percent-to-39 percent lead over the Texas governor, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore would beat McCain 47 percent to 38 percent and Bradley would beat
McCain 49 percent to 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac pollster.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a Democratic town," Carroll said, referring to the state. "And
Bradley looks better with independents."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not surprising," said Daniel Allen, spokesman for the state Republican
Committee of the Democrats' apparent narrow edge. He said the front-runner is
often the target of other candidates and reporters and that can hurt Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there's time before the primary, Allen emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Bush has a message that really resonates with the families of New
York more than Gore or Bradley," he said.

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court bars lawyers from working both sides of street  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Municipal courts could find themselves scrambling
to hire prosecutors, under a state Supreme Court decision handed down Wednesday
that said, in effect, that New Jersey lawyers can't work both sides of the
street.
<P>
	   Attorneys who serve as municipal prosecutors cannot also act as criminal
defense attorneys in any court - superior or municipal - in the same county
where they are prosecutors, the justices ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending criminal suspects pays more for these part-time prosecutors, but
the justices said that could cause a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dual representation in the same county therefore presents a significant
possibility of conflict that could impair a defendant's right to a fair trial,"
the justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   They said, for example, that a municipal prosecutor might have to conduct a
direct examination on a police officer in municipal court as a prosecutor and
the next day cross-exam that same officer in a Superior Court as a defense
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Since many of the state's 537 prosecutors also do defense work, the ruling
is expected to cause many lawyers to choose the more lucrative defense work.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to lose some very experienced municipal prosecutors," predicted
William Kearns, counsel for the New Jersey League of Municipalities. "They're
going to opt to do their defense work. It will hurt the system."
</P>
<P>
	   But John Dangler, president of the County Prosecutors Association of New
Jersey, said some attorneys have welcomed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are many attorneys who would love to get their foot in the door as a
municipal prosecutor," he said. "I don't think they're going to have a hard time
filling the positions. There are 71,000 lawyers in New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   Kearns and Dangler agree, though, that towns are sure to lose veteran
prosecutors and have to replace them with rookies.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing the upheaval the ruling will cause, the court effectively gave
towns until the end of the year to abide by the ruling, which expands an appeals
court decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The appellate decision only barred attorneys from defending cases in the
superior courts, while the Supreme Court broadened that to prevent them from
defending cases in either municipal or superior courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the ruling, municipal prosecutors were barred from acting as defense
lawyers only in cases originating in the towns where they prosecute.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court also reinstated the conviction that caused the issue to come
to the court's attention in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   That case involved a 1994 conviction of a Middlesex County man, Robert F.
Clark, who did not know that his defense lawyer moonlighted as a municipal
prosecutor. Clark, found guilty of molesting two girls in Jamesburg, is serving
a 20-year term.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court reversed that conviction because of the potential for
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   But, the Supreme Court said the defense attorney's dual role did not prevent
Clark from getting a fair trial and upheld his conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rule takes effect immediately, but the court allowed current
municipal prosecutors to finish their terms, even if they handle defense work in
the same county. It gives towns the rest of the year to respond to the new rule.
</P>
<P>
	   It also does not make the new rule retroactive, which could have affected
hundreds of convictions and cases still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Attorney General's office supported the ruling, despite the upheaval it
will cause in the court system.
</P>
<P>
	   "We viewed this, frankly, as a close call, because it will have an
unsettling effect on some practices," said Attorney General John Farmer. "But in
our view, given the fact that municipal courts have become involved in much more
complicated cases, we felt it was imperative that those court processes be above
reproach."

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 71.36; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose to a new record Wednesday
even as investors punished Microsoft for a profit report that met published
estimates but failed to impress some Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 20.48 to 4,151.29, its first new record since it closed at
4,131.15 on Jan. 3. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.36 to 11,489.36, a
decline that came almost entirely from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 0.76 to
1,455.90.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 8 5/16 from its 4 p.m. price Tuesday to 107. Late Tuesday,
the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per share, in its fiscal
second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said Microsoft's "whisper number" -- an unofficial prediction
circulated on the Internet and on trading floors -- was as high as 49 cents,
setting up some investors for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Microsoft were also pressured by company officials' warning of a
potential slowdown in demand for personal computers. What's more, some analysts
suggested Microsoft had benefited from strong gains in its equity portfolio
rather than strength in the software business.
</P>
<P>
	   "Microsoft made their numbers and did not change the guidance, but they got
there in a very different way than expected," said Don Young, a Microsoft
analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   While they shunned Microsoft, investors returned to some big-name technology
stocks that flourished in 1999. Qualcomm rose 7 9/16 to 146 5/8 and Yahoo!
soared 22 13/16 to 364 as of 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a weaker market, Microsoft would have hurt the rest of the techs," said
Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities in Boca Raton,
Fla. "That was not the case today."
</P>
<P>
	   The fever for technology stocks that began last year helped boost business
for online brokerages ETrade Group and DLJdirect Inc., which both reported
narrower-than-expected losses on Wednesday. ETrade fell 1 3/4 to 26 3/16 and
DLJdirect gained 1 5/8 to 14 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, more traditional financial companies found their sterling profit
reports tarnished by continued worries about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase Manhattan rose 3 1/8 to 74 1/8 and Bear Stearns rose 1 to 43 after
reporting earnings that easily beat expectations. But analysts said their gains
were contained by concern that rising interest rates will eventually cut into
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their good numbers are for the past," Kaltbaum said. "Interest rates are on
the rise, and that squeezes margins and puts companies' future earnings into
question."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday the U.S. economy, fueled by robust
consumer spending and rejuvenated manufacturing, grew strongly in December and
in the beginning of January.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, known as the beige book, showed that while labor markets
remained tight around the country, there was still no sign that employers were
giving workers big wage increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts said the continued momentum of the economy suggests the Fed
will boost interest rates next month. The Fed raised interest rates three times
in 1999, and is widely expected to resume raising rates in an effort to prevent
inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange. On the Nasdaq, 11 stocks rose for every nine that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.06 billion shares, compared with 1.01 billion the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.56 to 520.02, a new
record of its own.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent. European markets
were mixed. Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 finished down 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Suits Concern Employers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than one-third of employers in a new survey say they
would probably cut off health benefits to their workers if Congress passes a law
allowing patients to sue managed care plans for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
	   The employers apparently fear the legislation could open the door to the
same kinds of suits against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies are already struggling to contain rising health costs and deal
with disgruntled workers who complain that managed care blocks their access to
care.
</P>
<P>
	   "Employers are asking themselves if this all worth it, if they are subject
to liability awards of frightening magnitude," said Jack Bruner, a consultant
with Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm that conducted the survey
of 600 large U.S. employers in September.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report released Wednesday about 36 percent of respondents said they
would probably drop health benefits for their workers if they were subject to
malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move would be a drastic change for many large employers, which have
made health insurance a basic benefit for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One big factor protecting workers is today's tight labor market, in which
companies are reticent to cut any benefits for fear of losing workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without the liability fears, some large companies have begun to look at
how they can reduce their role in providing health benefits. That was a common
theme at a meeting of corporate employee benefits officials at a New York
conference Wednesday sponsored by the Conference Board, a business research
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Some large companies are considering a voucher system, in which they give
their worker a set amount of money each year and let them buy coverage on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   But employee benefits experts said Wednesday companies would not move to a
voucher system until they could be assured health plans would charge the workers
a reasonable premium, and the plans would not discriminate against people with
chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Administering and paying for health insurance have become a distraction for
many businesses, said Steve Wetzell, executive director of Buyers Health Care
Action Group, a coalition of large Minnesota companies that jointly purchases
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The liability factor would give companies one more reason to stop providing
coverage, he said. "Its a huge issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Making their case, employers point to large jury awards handed down against
HMOs in states that already allow lawsuits. For instance, a California jury last
year ordered Aetna to pay a record $120.5 million in damages to a woman whose
husband fought until his death for coverage of experimental cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the House of Representatives passed HMO patient protection
legislation that included giving patients the power to sue their HMO. The Senate
version did not include the right-to-sue provisions. A Senate-House conference
committee is now trying to work out a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public
Health, issued Wednesday, found most voters favored the right to sue HMOs. But
only half of those surveyed say they'd still want that right if premiums jumped
as a result.
</P>
<P>
	   Although companies have relied on health maintenance organizations and other
types of managed care firms to control costs through most of the 1990s, the
Hewitt survey showed employers have serious concerns about the health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   About 37 percent of respondents said managed care has hurt the quality of
care, 60 percent said the health plans have restricted access to care and 62
percent said the plans have damaged consumer satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Three die in New York's bone-chilling weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was so cold a homeless man froze to death.
<P>
	   And Mary Varriale, diagnosed with a brain tumor and feeling disoriented in a
Queens hospital, just wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
	   So in the middle of the night, the 75-year-old grandmother climbed out of
her bed. In robe and slippers, she wandered up to the roof. The door locked
behind her, leaving her in the 9-degree temperature made deadly cold by wind.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't survive.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doll lady," as she was dubbed by neighborhood children for whom she
crocheted the toys, would never return.
</P>
<P>
	   For many, this week's bone-chilling temperatures meant extra layers of
clothing and chattering teeth. But for Mrs. Varriale and at least two other
people, the chill spelled death.
</P>
<P>
	   Two homeless people also have died and the medical examiner was performing
an autopsy on an elderly woman in the Bronx, possibly another victim of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the city enjoyed what seemed - by contrast - like a heat wave,
with temperatures pushing 30 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast snow
for Thursday, but temperatures remaining in the 20s or 30s through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The warm-up came too late for Mrs. Varriale, the brain tumor patient who
died on the roof of the Flushing Hospital Medical Center. "Something went
definitely, radically wrong in that place," said her husband, Tullio Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   During the weekend, Mrs. Varriale had to be restrained because she had
become confused and tried to leave the hospital to go home to her Astoria
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   At about 3 a.m. Monday, a nurse noticed that she was missing from her bed.
Police helped hospital security officers look for her. They found her dead at
about 8 a.m. on the roof. During the night, an icy wind had pushed the
temperature to gusts of 34 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't gotten the whole story yet," her husband said. "I just don't
understand how something like this could happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Pedersen, a hospital spokesman, said the death was under investigation.
He said that, in general, patients are allowed to walk on the floor where Mrs.
Varriale was hospitalized. "It is not like a locked prison."
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital issued a statement saying the staff was "devastated by this
outcome and expresses condolences to the patient's family."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Varriale was admitted to the hospital last week, after she felt dizzy,
got disoriented and had problems walking. A CAT scan revealed the brain tumor,
said her son, Edward Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they had a situation where they had to put her in restraints, why
weren't they watching her more closely?" asked Tullio Varriale. "I lost my wife
of 50 years."
</P>
<P>
	   The cold also proved fatal for the two homeless men.
</P>
<P>
	   One, in his 40s, was found on a loading dock in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay
section on Monday afternoon. The temperature had reached 19, but with a wind
chill of minus 16.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 3 degrees in Central Park at 6 a.m. -
the coldest in six years. A 55-year-old man died while trying to keep warm in
the back of a parked station wagon in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   Identities for the two men were still unavailable on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the slight thaw, the lingering cold was still causing other
problems. In Farmingdale, Long Island, frozen pipes burst at The American
Airpower Museum at Republic Airport, destroying photographs, books and records
of aviation history dating back to World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 gallons of water cascaded from one floor to another
overnight, washing away decades of records that may never be replaced, said
museum spokesman Gary Lewi.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the damaged items was a lithograph showing Charles Lindberg's "Spirit
of St. Louis" taking off from Republic air field.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Earnings Fall 11 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems reported its fourth-quarter
earnings fell 11 percent but still managed to beat analysts' expectations. The
former General Motors subsidiary increased its sales to new customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest auto parts maker said it earned $269 million, or 48
cents a share in the three months ending Dec. 31, 1999, compared to $298
million, or 53 cents a share at the same time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The results were 2 cents a share higher than Wall Street predictions,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Delphi's 1998 results were reported on a pro forma basis, which assumes the
company, which GM spun off as a separate company in May 1999, was publicly
traded in the year-earlier period. That provides a basis of comparison for its
latest results.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of $7.25 billion for the quarter were down from $7.8 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1998, when GM was rebuilding its stock following a strike in
the third quarter of 1998. Sales to customers other than GM totaled $1.89
billion -- a 12 percent increase, while sales to GM were $5.36 billion, down 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Delphi is focusing on increasing sales to customers besides GM. During the
past year it said it signed contracts with companies including Ford, Ferrari,
DaimlerChrysler, Caterpillar, Opel and Volkswagen. The company's goal has been
to increase its non-GM business at least 10 percent a year; for 1999, the
increase was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Delphi said it earned $1.1 billion, or $1.92 per share on
sales of $29.2 billion, compared with earnings of $439 million, or 78 cents per
share, on sales of $28.5 billion the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Year-earlier results were also reported on a pro-forma basis. The 1998
results reflect a strike at GM that halted parts production.
</P>
<P>
	   Delphi, based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, employs about 203,000 workers
in 37 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Delphi fell 87 1/2 cents to $17.75 in trading at 5:15 p.m.
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Profits Rise 42 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at The Boeing Co. rose 42 percent
from the year-ago period, easily surpassing Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The aerospace giant also announced that annual profits rose by $1.2 billion,
a 106 percent increase from a disappointing 1998, even though revenues rose only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   In the three months ended Dec. 31, Boeing earned $662 million, or 74 cents
per share, on $15.2 billion in revenues. That's compared to profits of $465
million, or 48 cents per share, on $17.1 billion in revenues in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted
fourth-quarter earnings of 69 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's stock price rose $2.62 1/2 a share to $47.62 1/2 in trading at 5:15
p.m. Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, the company earned $2.3 billion, or $2.49 per share, on $57.9
billion in revenues, compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.15 per share, on $56.2
billion in revenues in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Last year was all about performance," Boeing chairman Phil Condit said. "We
stated our business goals, and we met them. We delivered on commitments to our
customers. We teamed together and won significant new business."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the keys of Boeing's turnaround was the renewed profitability of its
commercial jetliners. Boeing Commercial Airplane Group's operating earnings for
1999 exceeded $2 billion, compared with a loss of $266 million in 1998. Boeing
was helped by the economic rebound in Asia, where the company experienced
renewed growth in orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Boeing delivered a record 620 planes last year, but for the first
time received fewer orders for planes than European rival Airbus Industrie.
Boeing booked 388 orders in 1999, compared with 417 for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits were down 7 percent in military business, from $1.28 billion in 1998
to $1.19 billion last year. Boeing's space unit and commercial financing unit
posted small gains.
</P>
<P>
	   With the sharp rise in overall profits, Boeing's cash flow grew to $4.7
billion for the year. The company had $3.5 billion in cash and short-term
investments after buying back 69 million shares of company stock for $2.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   After the disappointments of 1998, the company reorganized its business
units, streamlined production and trimmed its work force by more than 30,000
workers last year. As many as 10,000 more jobs could get cut this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Boeing announced plans to acquire the space and communications
arm of Hughes Electronics Corp. for $3.75 billion in cash, giving the company a
complete package of rocketry and satellite services. Boeing officials said the
acquisition will be reflected in second-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> 30s, 40s Film Star Hedy Lamarr Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Hedy Lamarr, the exotic, dark-haired beauty who
epitomized sultry glamour in a string of films in the 1930s and '40s with
leading men like Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, was found dead in her home
Wednesday. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austrian-born Miss Lamarr was once billed as the world's most beautiful
woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Her pale skin, almond eyes and dark hair gave her an exotic look, and her
films included ``Tortilla Flat,'' in which she played a part-Mexican woman;
``White Cargo,'' playing the slave woman Tondelayo; and ``Lady of the Tropics.''
</P>
<P>
	   But she claimed to scorn the glamorous image. In a 1942 Associated Press
interview, she showed a reporter her house, complete with hen house and homemade
curtains, and implored: ``Now you will not write I am a glamour girl?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any girl can be glamorous,'' she once said. ``All you have to do is stand
still and look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among Miss Lamarr's leading men were William Powell (``Crossroads,'' ``The
Heavenly Body''); Tracy (``Boom Town,'' ``Tortilla Flat''); Gable (``Comrade
X,'' also in ``Boom Town''); Robert Taylor (``Lady of the Tropics''); and Ray
Milland (``Copper Canyon'').
</P>
<P>
	   She was reputedly producer Hal Wallis' first choice for the heroine Ilsa in
the 1943 classic ``Casablanca,'' the part that eventually went to Ingrid
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
	   She first achieved international fame and notoriety as a result of the 1933
Czech film ``Ecstasy,'' in which she acted in a steamy love scene and appeared
nude in a 10-minute swimming sequence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood was decades away from such frankness, but it knew a beautiful face
and it knew the value of the publicity ``Ecstasy'' engendered.
</P>
<P>
	   After a few years away from the camera as the wife of Fritz Mandl, an
Austrian munitions magnate, Miss Lamarr was signed by MGM and brought to the
United States in 1937. Her real name was Hedwig Kiesler, and her screen name was
said to be an homage to the 1920s screen beauty Barbara La Marr.
</P>
<P>
	   Her American film debut came in 1938 with ``Algiers,'' co-starring Charles
Boyer. She played a wealthy adventurer and became a box-office sensation despite
grousing by Boyer that she couldn't act.
</P>
<P>
	   In its review, the show biz paper Variety disagreed. ``She brings to the
picture an abundance of good looks, acting talent and enticement,'' its review
said, praising her mastery of English and adding that with a little
encouragement, ``nothing apparently stands between her and success in Hollywood
films.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of her most successful films was the 1949 ``Samson and Delilah,''
directed by Cecil B. DeMille, with Victor Mature as Samson. She got a rare
chance to try her hand at comedy in ``My Favorite Spy,'' a 1951 Bob Hope film.
</P>
<P>
	   Her career faded in the mid-'50s, when she appeared in some Italian
productions. Her last film was ``The Female Animal'' with Jane Powell in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her career suffered because she wouldn't sleep with a VIP just to
get ahead. ``My problem is I'm a hell of a nice dame,'' she said in a 1970
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lurid 1966 autobiography ``Ecstasy and Me,'' filled with sexy anecdotes,
some of them involving other women, became a best seller. But she later sued,
saying the manuscript prepared by the ghostwriter was full of distortions and
errors.
</P>
<P>
	   Another side of her was described in the 1992 book ``Feminine Ingenuity.''
Drawing on her knowledge of military products that she picked up while married
to Mandl, Lamarr came up with the idea of a radio signaling device that would
reduce the danger of detection or jamming. She and a friend, composer George
Antheil, developed the idea further and received a patent in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   The method was not used at the time, during World War II, but since the
'80s, high-tech versions of the concept, called ``spread spectrum,'' have been
used in some cordless phones, military radios and wireless computer links.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Lamarr is a ``huge part of the history of this industry,'' Proxim Inc.
chief executive David C. King told The Wall Street Journal in 1997. His company
introduced a circuit board with spread spectrum in 1989 and later put out
hundreds of products using the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The daughter of a banker, Miss Lamarr was born on Nov. 9, 1913, although
some references say 1914 or 1915. Discovered as a teen-ager by Austrian director
Max Reinhardt, she began in films as a script secretary and bit player.
</P>
<P>
	   She was married and divorced six times -- to Mandl, screenwriter Gene
Markey, actor John Loder, nightclub owner Ernest Stauffer, oil millionaire W.
Howard Lee, and lawyer Lewis W. Boies Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, Anthony and
Denise.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of shoplifting arrests -- neither of which resulted in convictions --
caused headlines in her later years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sick and tired of being in the limelight,'' Miss Lamarr told a New
York radio station after the second incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, the once-celebrated movie queen lived quietly in a four-bedroom
house in a middle-class subdivision in Orlando. Neighbors said they only saw her
when she retrieved her mail under the cover of night, grasping a cane in one
hand and a flashlight in the other.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds evacuated from college dorm fire, three students dead and  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, rousting hundreds of sleeping students who crawled
through thick smoke and flames or jumped out windows in their pajamas to safety.
<P>
	   Three male students were killed and 62 people injured in the blaze at the
Roman Catholic university. Six students were critically burned, including one
who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 prank alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. "We are taking statements from
individuals who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge, although it
is prohibited. Campolo declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have
caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said. Their names were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one fire extinguisher; he didn't know
many were in the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected
recently and were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was extinguished quickly. Three female students walked out of the
dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
the university planned a service for the dead later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was
a home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<HEADLINE> Mandela Spotlights Burundi War  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Nelson Mandela directed the world's attention
Wednesday to the small nation of Burundi, where a brutal civil war that has gone
largely unnoticed outside Africa is threatening to destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing the Security Council as part of a new effort to revive peace
talks, Mandela chided Burundi's leaders for failing to stem a conflict that has
claimed 200,000 lives and left thousands of people living in inhumane conditions
in government camps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The misery of the Burundian people affects us all and diminishes the
humanity of all of us,'' said Mandela. ``Where even one single human being, one
group of people, one nation, one part of the world, labors under preventable
suffering, it is the concern of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The former South African president was invited to address the ambassadors to
highlight the volatile situation and give impetus to the peace process. Mandela,
81, was appointed by African leaders in December to mediate Burundi's stalled
peace talks and use his widely admired diplomatic skills to bring an end to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Burundi's civil war between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-led government has
raged for six years. The majority of Burundi's 6.5 million people are Hutu, but
Tutsis have dominated the government, the military and the economy since
independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has gone largely unnoticed outside of Africa, which in the past
decade has seen similar conflicts but on larger scales in Rwanda and Congo.
International aid to Burundi is about 17 percent of what is needed, and Mandela
urged donors to not abandon the country. Holbrooke pledged $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the council that it cannot afford to
ignore Burundi, saying, ``Of all the many crises and conflicts confronting us in
Africa today, perhaps none is more urgent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly, in no other country is it so easy to imagine a repetition of
what we have all sworn must never be repeated: ethnic killing on a genocidal
scale,'' Annan said, referring to Rwanda's 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela made his first foray into the troubled peace process on Sunday,
admonishing Burundi's leaders gathered at the site of the talks in Arusha,
Tanzania for having failed their own people and all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela repeated much of the same criticism on Wednesday, but also indicated
there was reason for optimism, saying he came away from the Arusha meeting
convinced that Burundi's leaders had the capacity ``to reach compromises and
agreements that can at last lead to peace and stability in that country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Security Council members gave their unanimous support to Mandela, adopting a
resolution endorsing his new post, condemning the continued violence in the
country and expressing its support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the council did not condemn in any way the widely criticized
``regroupment camps'' that the Burundian government has set up around the
country. The government hopes to clear the countryside of all but the Hutu
insurgents in order to pursue them freely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tutsi-led army has herded an estimated 350,000 people, most of them
Hutus, into 58 camps across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials say the conditions in the camps are dreadful, with rampant
malnutrition and death rates that are unacceptably high.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan called the policy ``inhumane and illegal,'' and warned the government
it alone bore responsibility for ensuring its citizens rights were being
protected.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Burundi's foreign minister, Severin Ntahomvukiye, said the camps
were being set up as a legitimate way to control violence. He did, however,
announce that 10 camps would be closed in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> New Compounds Lift Spinal Cord Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By ALEX DOMINGUEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Researchers have used proteins called nerve growth factors to repair damaged
nerves in rats, raising hopes that the technique could someday be used to
restore mobility in paralyzed people and help others recover from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The nerve growth factors were given to rats whose nerve roots had been
crushed. The nerves eventually reconnected to the spinal cord, restoring the
animals' ability to sense heat and pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The British researchers are now conducting experiments to determine if older
injuries can be healed using the compounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do know the acute injuries in rat are treatable. So, we are not without
hope in that respect," said Dr. Matt Ramer, one of the authors of the study,
published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramer said nerves outside the central nervous system are able to regenerate,
but the central nervous system's environment keeps nerves cut off at the root
from doing so for reasons that are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramer and his colleagues at St. Thomas' School of Biomedical Sciences in
London said the nerve growth factors appeared to boost the nerves' repair
abilities enough to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The work is not the first with the proteins, but shows that different growth
factors encourage different types of nerve cells to grow, and demonstrates the
effectiveness of a previously untested growth factor, GDNF, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The research involved about 100 rats whose sensory nerves that receive
information from the front paws were crushed at their junction with the spinal
cord. One of the growth factors or a dummy solution was then pumped into the
spinal cord near the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the animals that received the dummy solution, nerve regeneration stopped
at the spinal cord. The rats that received the growth factors showed varying
signs of nerve regrowth. The researchers found GDNF was among the most
successful in stimulating nerve regrowth.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact the growth factors prompted the nerve roots to reconnect to the
central nervous system is encouraging, said Dalton Dietrich, scientific director
of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually, they don't like to do that," Dalton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The results hold promise for human spinal cord repair, the researchers and
others said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Wise Young, director of the W.M. Keck Center for Collaborative
Neuroscience at Rutgers University, said nerve growth factors could also speed
recovery and eliminate pain in the estimated 325,000 patients a year who undergo
operations for slipped discs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is practical therapy which could go to clinical trial," Young
said. "And if it proves to be effective, it could affect a great many people."

<HEADLINE> Spain Plans Appeal on Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
   By ADAM BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The judge seeking the extradition of Augusto Pinochet
asked Spain's government Wednesday to file an immediate appeal if Britain
decides to free the former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   The request by Baltasar Garzon sets the stage for more friction between him
and the Spanish government, which has opposed his efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 in London based on an arrest warrant
issued by Garzon, who wants to try the Chilean general on human rights charges.
British officials have upheld the extradition request, but recently indicated
that Pinochet, 84, is unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the Pinochet saga, the Spanish government has said it respects
the judicial process, but has done little to help Garzon, reluctantly passing on
documents to Britain only as called for under protocol.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon told British prosecutors on Wednesday that he plans to appeal if Home
Secretary Jack Straw decides that Pinochet is too ill to stand trial. Straw said
last week that he was inclined to release Pinochet based on a report from
doctors who examined the general. A ruling by Straw can automatically be
appealed to the British High Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon passed on a request to the Spanish government on Wednesday to process
his appeal. A copy of his request was obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a human rights lawyer close to Garzon said British authorities had
told them Wednesday that a decision on whether to extradite Pinochet would be
based on ``judicial arguments'' and not political considerations.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Joan Garces said such a ruling would enable Garzon to appeal
through the British legal system.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon wants to try Pinochet for alleged torture that occurred during his
1973-1990 rule of Chile. British judges have backed Garzon's stance that
Pinochet does not have diplomatic immunity from such charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw said last week that he was considering freeing Pinochet but asked for
opinions from Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland. The latter three also have
extradition proceedings pending against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   Garces said he received a fax from the British Home Office on Wednesday
saying Straw would make a decision in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the Spanish government reluctantly passed on a request from
Garzon for Britain to submit Pinochet to a second medical examination.
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is eager to protect diplomatic and
trade ties with Chile, and says a trial of Pinochet would ruffle political
sensitivities in a country still divided by the legacy of the Pinochet
dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> Utility to sell off four power plants in multi-state deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DOVER, Del. (AP) - Conectiv is looking to shed four of its older power
generation plants in a deal worth $800 million.
<P>
	   Howard E. Cosgrove, Conectiv chief executive, said Wednesday he has an
agreement to sell the four plants, and Conectiv's shares in two others, to NRG
Energy of Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Northern States Power Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will need the approval of state and federal regulators, and isn't
expected to be complete until late in the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosgrove said Conectiv wants to drop its "baseload" plants, which burn 80
percent of the time, in favor of what are known as "mid-merit" plants. These are
plants which can be switched on and off, depending on customer demand for power.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, Conectiv announced plans to sell its share of three nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really the response to the restructuring of the energy business,"
Cosgrove said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Conectiv, which is headquartered in Wilmington, has 1 million power and
telecommunication customers in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia - all
states which have taken steps toward deregulating their power markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators are worried that Conectiv may not be able to meet the demands of
its customers, particularly the 450,000 who live on the Delmarva Peninsula, if
the company continues to sell power generating plants.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're talking about is a lot of these power generating plants being
sold are on the peninsula. It's important to have that generation right here on
the Delmarva," said Bruce Burcat, executive director of the Delaware Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   But Conectiv executives said the company will be able to buy the power it
needs. And Cosgrove said Conectiv isn't moving out of the power-generating side
of the utility business.
</P>
<P>
	   Conectiv plans to use some of the $800 million to cover the costs of
expanding its New Castle County gas-fired plant, a project expected to cost $300
million. Cosgrove also said Conectiv could buy or build more "mid-merit" plants.
</P>
<P>
	   In the proposed sale, which would transfer 1,875 megawatts of power
generation, NRG would take control of the B.L. England and Deepwater plants in
New Jersey; Indian River, in Millsboro; and Vienna Station, on Maryland's
Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
	   NRG is also buying Conectiv's shares in Keystone Station, in Shelocta, Pa.,
and Conemaugh Station, in New Florence, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Conectiv was created in 1998 by the merger of Delmarva Power &AMP; Light Co. and
Atlantic Energy Co.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Finds Racial Profiling  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A six-month Energy Department investigation has found
evidence of racial profiling and an ``atmosphere of distrust and suspicion''
toward Asian Americans at nuclear weapons labs because of the uproar over
alleged Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, vowing to stamp out such profiling,
insisted Wednesday that Taiwan-born scientist Wen Ho Lee was never singled out
or fired from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory because of his race.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Asian-American scientists widely believe they have been
unfairly targeted because of their race since Lee's dismissal last March for
security violations, according to a task force report on racial profiling in the
department.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, at the center of a three-year espionage investigation, was indicted in
December for copying top-secret nuclear weapons files and remains in jail,
awaiting trial. He has denied giving secrets to China or anyone else. While not
charged with espionage, Lee could face life in prison if found guilty of the
security violations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While specific incidents and examples of racial profiling may differ from
site to site, the general concerns and issues were virtually identical
department wide,'' said the report, ordered by Richardson last summer when the
uproar over alleged Chinese espionage at weapons labs was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite directives from Richardson against racial profiling, managers and
supervisors at the weapons labs -- Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore --
and other DOE facilities were found to question ``the loyalty and patriotism of
some employes based upon racial factors,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Lee, a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and a task force
member, said there is ``a general sense of fear'' among Asian-Americans of being
unfairly targeted. They cited as an example, she said, a practice by the FBI to
call Asian-American scientists simply because of their race ``to see if they
knew Lee.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Tamura, another task force member, said Asian-American scientists
related how counterintelligence officials joked about the Chinese connection in
briefings to scientists. The briefers would ask the scientists whether they knew
why there were so many Chinese restaurants in town. ``Why for spying of
course,'' the briefer would say, according to Tamura.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said no specific case of racial profiling has been proven but
``we're admitting to a problem, a problem of perception, of mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
	   To emphasize that such profiling ``is never welcome'' Richardson said there
would be a department-wide satellite-linked ``stand-down'' in the coming weeks
so employees can focus on the issue and discuss their concerns. Richardson also
appointed Jeremy Wu, former deputy director of the Office of Civil Rights, as a
department ombudsman on worker issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Wen Ho Lee's indictment on Dec. 10, a growing number of Asian-American
groups have come to Lee's support, creating a defense fund and scheduling
rallies. These groups claim Lee was singled out because of his race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject the view that racial profiling was present in this case,''
Richardson said, referring to the Lee dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Lee, the civil rights commissioner, said she's reserving judgment on
the matter. ``None of us can say (at this point) this is racially motivated,''
she said of the Los Alamos case.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said one thing is certain. ``Asian-American employes are feeling the
sting.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Richardson said the impact could be long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This perceived hostile work environment imperils an invaluable partnership
between the Energy Department and Asian Pacific Americans. Worse...(it) can
foment a dangerous `brain drain' where we lose our best scientists, hobbling our
research quality, leading edge science and ultimately our national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Already, he added, ``we are not having as much success in recruiting top
flight scientists.''

<HEADLINE> Honeywell Profits Rise 13 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Honeywell International Inc., created last year by the merger of Honeywell
and AlliedSignal, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profits rose 13 percent from
a year ago and matched analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The manufacturer of automated controls and other industrial systems said net
income for the October-December quarter was $630 million, excluding
merger-related charges, or 78 cents a share. That's what analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, net income excluding one-time items was $561 million, or 69
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including merger-related charges, fourth-quarter earnings this year were $7
million, or 1 cent a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $6.16 billion in the October-December quarter, down from $6.22
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Honeywell were priced at $54.25 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York
Stock Exchange, down $4.75 or 8 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Honeywell's chief executive, Michael R. Bonsignore, said in a statement
accompanying the report that he expected annual revenues to grow 8 percent to 10
percent in coming years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Revenue growth in 2000 will come from continued strength in the aerospace
aftermarket and turbochargers; improvements in industrial control, specialty
chemicals and polymers businesses; and new products in turbogenerators and chip
packaging," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects to realize savings of $250 million this year
because of the merger and $750 million by 2002. Honeywell announced last month
it was laying off about 8,000 employees worldwide this year, 3,500 more than it
announced shortly after its merger was completed Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for all of 1999, excluding merger-related items, was $2.17
billion, or $2.68 a share. This compared with $1.91 billion, or $2.34 a share in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including adjustments, net income was $1.54 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $23.74 billion in 1999, up about 1 percent from $23.56 billion in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Fed Lawsuit Filed in Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno declared last week that the boy's status was an
immigration matter, solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was picked up off the
Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   No hearing date was immediately set.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno had overruled a ruling from a Miami family court judge delaying the
boy's return. But Reno postponed an INS deadline to return the boy to his father
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned trying to
reach the United States, and the boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after
he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father,
and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in
the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or
not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to give
Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts have insisted since the fervor over the case began that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no standing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative. That is the father,'' said David
Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, called Elian's
Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their attempts to
keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government, showing
disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of several U.S. groups that want Elian returned to his father have
warned they will call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child
is not sent back soon. The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation
that would grant U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said Wednesday: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS's ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress
has rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill
and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's sister Juanita Castro, who left Cuba in 1964 and now lives in
the Miami area, said she hopes the matter can be decided justly in court. She
would not say whether she thinks the boy should stay or be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope what happens is the best for him, for his destiny, for his
future,'' she said. ``This case, everything that has happened, makes me very
sad.''

<HEADLINE> FleetBoston Profits Rise 17 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- FleetBoston Financial reported a 17 percent jump in operating
profits in the fourth quarter, driven by higher income from stock and bond
underwriting and credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston reported operating profits of $726 million, or 76 cents a share,
beating analysts' estimates by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company earned $622 million, or 65 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston, however, took a one-time charge of $760 million during the
fourth quarter of 1999 to cover the cost of its merger with BankBoston Corp.
Including that charge, the bank posted a net loss of $34 million, or 5 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Total revenues for the quarter were $3.64 billion, or 15 percent higher than
the year-ago figure of $3.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Terrence Murray, said,
"Our continued strong results bear out the power of our diversified franchise
and the momentum sustained during the integration of two great franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our merger is very much on course," Murray said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleet's takeover of BankBoston received regulatory clearance in September,
making the united bank the eighth largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full-year, operating earnings were $2.8 billion, or $2.91 a share, a
14 percent increase over 1998 when the bank's profits totaled $2.5 billion, or
$2.55 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including merger-related costs, net income for the year $2.04 billion, or
$2.10 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $2.41 per share for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, revenues were $13.75 billion vs. $11.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Total assets on Dec. 31, 1999 were $190.7 billion, up $12.8 billion from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston shares fell 75 cents to $31.12 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m.
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Continental Starts Fuel Surcharge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines has begun adding a $10 surcharge for
one-way flights and $20 for round trips in an attempt to recoup spiraling fuel
costs. The move was quickly matched by United Airlines and American Airlines,
the nation's top two carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials for No. 5 Continental said Tuesday that the surcharge applies to
domestic flights on Feb. 1 and afterward. Tickets purchased before Tuesday will
not include the surcharge. The move to adopt the surcharge spread Wednesday to
No. 1 United and No. 2 American.
</P>
<P>
	   The charge appears on the face of the ticket and will be included in
advertised fares, said Karla Villalon, a spokeswoman for Houston-based
Continental.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our cost for aircraft fuel in the fourth quarter of 1999 rose 49.7 percent
over 1998," Ms. Villalon said. The company spent $259 million on fuel in the
last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased fuel costs are a direct result of the highest oil prices in nearly
a decade, spawned by production cutbacks by foreign oil powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Villalon said the airline acted independently of other carriers, who
also are reporting reduced profits because of expensive fuel.

<TEXT>
<P>
    HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at United Technologies Corp.
plunged due a restructuring plan. Excluding the one-time charges, however, the
results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   UTC earned $56 million on revenue of $6.51 billion for the fourth quarter.
In the year-ago period, UTC earned $287 million on revenue of $5.99 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The results include a $486 million pre-tax charge for restructuring and
other items.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding this, United earned $362 million, or 70 cents a share, for the
quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected
earnings of 67 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of United fell $2.06 1/4 to $60.68 3/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hartford-based building systems and aerospace company plans to eliminate
14,500 jobs worldwide over the next three years because of a downturn in the
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, United earned $1.53 billion, up from $1.26 billion in 1998.
Its 1999 financial report includes a $650 million after-tax gain on the sale of
the company's automotive unit.
</P>
<P>
	   It took in revenues of $24.13 billion for 1999, up 6 percent from $22.81
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engines division and Sikorsky helicopter
division have both announced major realignments of work among plants and will
move thousands of both white- and blue-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continued to deliver consistent earnings growth and strong cash
generation in 1999, despite the impact of the aerospace cycle, ongoing
challenges in the Asia Pacific region, and an economic slowdown in Latin
America," George David, UTC's chairman and chief executive officer said
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> FDX Changes Name to FedEx Corp.  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFFREY BAIR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- FedEx threw the weight of its brand name behind home
delivery Wednesday and said it would try to woo Internet shoppers by scheduling
drop-offs and keeping its drivers working later each day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Memphis, Tenn.-based FDX will now be known as FedEx Corp. as a result of
the name change it announced. The name change will also be reflected in the
names of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx's business service, for example, will become FedEx Express.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time to leverage and extend one of our greatest assets, the FedEx
brand," said Frederick Smith, chairman, president and chief executive of the
parent company.
</P>
<P>
	   Its RPS Inc. division, a small package delivery, business-to-business
deleivery service based in Pittsburgh, is being renamed FedEx Ground, which will
also be responsible for the new residential delivery service called FedEx Home
Delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   The new business starts March 13 with FedEx Ground offering delivery times
of two to five days.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx Home Delivery should be up and running in March. The company will try
to get its delivery option on Web sites for Internet retailers and listed in
major catalogs, FedEx Ground CEO Dan Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal is to deliver to homes in 98 percent of the nation within four
years in trucks with the company's new purple and green logo, said Sullivan. The
company will need another 240 distribution centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way people are shopping is changing, and we have to respond to that,"
Sullivan said today.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery will have 67 shipping centers in 38
states across the country and use FedEx's electronic package tracking.
</P>
<P>
	   Delivery times will range from overnight to five days, Sullivan said.
Ninety-four percent of packages will be shipped by truck, with the rest going
cross-country by train.
</P>
<P>
	   The new hires include 500 drivers who will wear FedEx Ground's new
purple-and-green logo on their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx has delivered to homes for years but mainly markets its overnight
shipments to businesses. It wants to compete with United Parcel Service, the
U.S. Postal Service and capitalize on the popularity of Internet retailers,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's the old saying, 'Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery'?"
said Steve Holmes, a UPS spokesman in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   He said UPS ships everywhere in the United States and will cover the land
that FedEx's new service does not reach.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people will test them," said Mason Kauffman, a former FedEx
executive and founder of the AccuSHIP.com shipping technology company in
Memphis, Tenn. "Most people are in a monopoly situation with UPS right now, and
they don't like to be held hostage. They will have to decide if the service or
the overall image of FedEx means that much to them."

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Profits Double  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser Co. fourth-quarter earnings more
than doubled, but still fell short of analysts' earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the three months ended Dec. 26, Weyerhaeuser made $179 million, or 81
cents per share, on $3.43 billion in sales, compared to earnings of $75 million,
or 38 cents per share, on $2.75 billion in revenue in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding items in both quarters, Weyerhaeuser earned $174 million, or 78
cents per share, compared to earnings of $30 million, or 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of
92 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its quarterly earnings were affected by lockouts at some
British Columbia ports and by continued cleanup costs in the wake of Hurricane
Floyd in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   It took a $5 million charge on its fourth quarter earnings associated with
the acquisition of Canadian timber company MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   Weyerhaeuser shares fell $3.06 1/4 to $63.50 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Weyerhaeuser earned $681 million, on sales of $12.26 billion,
up from earnings of $339 million on revenue of $10.77 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Accused of Racial Bias  </HEADLINE>
    By JAY HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- Even as Mitsubishi officials earned praise from court
monitors overseeing efforts to end sexual harassment of women at their auto
plant here, a lawsuit contends the company turned a blind eye toward
discrimination against black workers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a federal class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday, nine black employees allege
that managers and other workers "made it clear that African-Americans were
unwanted and despised" through the use of racial slurs and symbols of
"African-American torture and destruction."
</P>
<P>
	   The workers claim they were denied raises, promotions and job training
because of their race and were often given the least desirable assignments. They
say Ku Klux Klan initials were scribbled on walls at the plant, nooses were hung
in public areas and one worker found a doll's head tied to a toy truck,
mimicking the dragging death of a black man in Texas, left outside his home.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America instituted policies to
stamp out sexual harassment as part of a $34 million settlement with female
workers, the workers claim, the company has "refused to acknowledge, let alone
remedy" racial discrimination at the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different type of discrimination, a different kind of attitude,"
said Patricia Benassi, one of the lawyers representing the workers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prepared statement, Mitsubishi said discrimination of any kind has no
place in the plant and "policies to support zero tolerance are working."
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokeswoman Gael O'Brien refused to discuss specific allegations of
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Zero tolerance is applicable to discrimination or harassment of any kind,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Tuesday only names nine plaintiffs but was filed on behalf
of all black employees who have worked at the plant over the past two years. In
addition, Benassi said, 18 of 21 plaintiffs in a civil rights lawsuit filed
against the plant in 1999 have asked her to represent them, and she hopes to
join the two lawsuits together.
</P>
<P>
	   Benassi, who represented the female workers in the sexual harassment suit,
said she has no explanation for the alleged treatment of black employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Who knows. Why did the first thing happen?" she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, a three-member review panel assigned by a federal judge
reported that Mitsubishi was doing a good job of complying with conditions of
the settlement of the sexual harassment lawsuit, which was filed by the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1996 after female employees
complained of being subjected to lewd jokes and groping. Those conditions
included maintaining a policy forbidding sexual harassment and providing sexual
harassment training for all employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel praised the company for being "aggressive in emphasizing its
commitment to enforcing the zero-tolerance policy."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien said the plant employs about 3,100 people, but refused to say how
many of the workers are minorities. Benassi said she believes there are about
200 black workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers allege they filed complaints with their supervisors, with a
department within the company that was instituted to handle complaints and
through their union, the United Auto Workers, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials refused to discuss complaints filed at the plant. UAW
officials in Normal and Detroit refused to comment on any grievances handled
through the union.

<HEADLINE> Big Movers in the Stock Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank company said earnings in its fourth quarter rose 46 percent to
$1.97 per share, easily exceeding analysts' forecasts of $1.32 per share. Chase
said investment banking fees rose 31 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper company earned 81 cents per share in the quarter, below First
Call/Thomson Financial's consensus view of 92 cents. Weyerhaeuser cited effects
of a lockout at some British Columbia ports and Hurricane Floyd-related cleanup
costs in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said fourth-quarter motorcycle sales increased 17.9 percent to
$530.2 million from the final quarter of 1998. For the year, motorcycle sales
rose 18.5 percent to $1.89 billion. The company cited increased production
capacity and popular new lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The company hired Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. to advise its board on strategic
options, which may include the possible sale or merger of the company. Mark IV
is a manufacturing company focused on power transmission and components for
industrial and automotive markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from Bank of Scotland
PLC, said Wednesday that there was "little indication" of how the Scottish
bank's proposal to spend money on NatWest branches would enhance revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday, the company said it earned $2.44 billion, or 44 cents per
share, in its fiscal second quarter, compared to the 42 cents predicted by
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. But some analysts suggested
Microsoft had benefited from strong gains in its equity portfolio rather than
strength in the software business.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 31 cents a share in the fourth quarter, above estimates
of 27 cents a share. Broadcom, a leading supplier of chips used in cable modems,
also announced a 2-for-1 stock split. The stock price had run up sharply ahead
of the earnings announcement, prompting some profit-taking after the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of America and Robertson Stephens cut their ratings on Galileo. Several
other brokerages released positive notes on Galileo, a maker of digital
semiconductor devices used in network systems.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Discusses China Trade Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton convened a rare Cabinet meeting to
review administration goals for his final year in office, particularly the
strategy for winning congressional approval of normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All hands will be needed on deck,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary William Daley urged opponents of the deal to consider the
economic benefits that greater access to the Chinese market would offer U.S.
businesses, especially in the agricultural industry. China, with more than 1
billion people, is the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an extremely good deal for American interests,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the group also discussed new
health care proposals, which the president announced after the meeting, and
several points to be covered in his State of the Union speech Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   But a significant part of the discussion focused on China, participants
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are expected to vote by late spring on whether to grant China
permanent normal trading relations with the United States as part of a deal to
allow China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal Clinton administration officials made with China was one source of
controversy behind the large protests that disrupted the WTO meeting in Seattle
in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke at some length to the Cabinet about the implications of the
agreement on foreign policy and the American economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Republicans have suggested putting off the vote until August, an idea
Daley rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It must be sooner than that,'' he said. ``Some of this is obviously out of
our control but as you get later in the year it will probably be much more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	   While vowing to push ahead with a China vote, the administration was much
less certain about the timing for another major trade issue on its agenda -- the
start of a new round of global trade talks. The 135-nation WTO tried but failed
to launch a new negotiating round in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky offered a pessimistic
assessment of the chances for getting those negotiations started any time soon,
given the wide differences that remain over what should be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the extent that countries remain inflexible, the predicate for
launching a round will simply not be there,'' Barshefsky told reporters
following a meeting Wednesday with Mike Moore, the head of the Geneva-based WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky said she and Moore agreed to continue searching for ways to
resolve the differences between the United States and its major trading
partners, but she offered no timetable on when trade ministers would reconvene
to try again to launch a new trade round.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials say that until Congress returns to Washington later
this month they will not have a full assessment of the China deal's chances for
passage. But given the vocal opposition of labor and environmental they
obviously were girding for a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   Daley said that every Cabinet member had a role to play in reaching out to
opposition groups and pushing the trade deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton does not meet frequently with his Cabinet, preferring to deal
individually or in small groups with the secretaries who lead federal agencies.
The last Cabinet meeting was Nov. 9 to discuss priorities for the fiscal 2001
budget.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices finished higher Wednesday, apparently following
the lead of the European fixed income markets, which also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note ended with a gain of  3/8 point, or $3.75 per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to
6.71 percent, down from 6.75 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's yield was the highest level since touching 6.78 percent on June
30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. bond markets bounced back after two successive days of losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high yields during the two most recent sessions and Wednesday's
mild reversal, investors remain wary of the bond market, fearing that Federal
Reserve Board policy makers plan to increase interest rates at their next
meeting in February in an attempt to stave off inflation amid rampant U.S.
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said professional money managers are apparently avoiding the bond
markets as they wait for signs that the Fed is satisfied with interest rate
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bond prices, since bonds pay a fixed rate of
return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities were up by
between 1/32 point and 3/32 point, and intermediate maturities rose  1/8 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.50 percent as the discount fell
0.03 percentage point to 5.35 percent. Six-month yields were 5.76 percent, as
the discount fell 0.01 at 5.52 percent. One-year yields were 6.08 percent as the
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 5.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
traded at 5.44 percent from 5.94 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield of the Bond Buyer index for municipal funds was unchanged at 6.31
percent.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Women's I.D. Finally Discovered  </HEADLINE>
   By DANNY M. BOYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A woman who had been in an almost vegetative state for
two years, with hospital officials never knowing her name, kept repeating four
numbers when asked for a Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, when a persistent nurse's technician asked again, she recited all
nine.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers unlocked Mary Joyce Howard's identity and officials hope to see
the 39-year-old reunited soon with family in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Howard's lost years began on Feb. 13, 1998, when she was run over and
left for dead on Interstate 40 in far western Oklahoma. Authorities had reports
of a person walking along the road, sometimes in traffic, and found her
unconscious. She had no identification, so they named her Jane Doe.
</P>
<P>
	   After surgeries and hospital stays, she was confined to a nursing home in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
	   She began talking in July. Her speech is slow and hard to understand, but
she got the nurses' attention when she objected to the name Jane Doe. She told
them she was ``Joyce.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest breakthrough came when she was transferred to Presbyterian
Hospital with pneumonia. Nurse technician Jamie Carey befriended her and talked
to her daily. When she asked for a Social Security number, Ms. Howard mumbled
four digits. Ms. Carey kept asking.
</P>
<P>
	   A week ago, Ms. Carey clocked out but decided to look in on Ms. Howard
before she left, and she got the answer she wanted -- all nine digits of her
Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think everything was starting to come back to her day by day,'' Ms.
Carey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation took fingerprints, which the FBI
matched Tuesday, said Lorna Palmer, a spokeswoman for state investigators. The
FBI was unable to find a match two years ago, said Rick Spence, a criminalist
supervisor for the state agency. This time, the Social Security number led to
her identity, and authorities tracked down her father in High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Presbyterian Hospital and Skyview Nursing Center are raising money to have
Ms. Howard transferred to a North Carolina nursing home. Ms. Howard also said
she has a daughter and two brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Carey said Ms. Howard talked to her father Wednesday and looked forward
to seeing him. The hospital wouldn't provide his name, saying he didn't want to
be contacted.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is sure how Ms. Howard got to Oklahoma or of the circumstances that
led to the hit-and-run that nearly killed her. Ms. Carey said the family
indicated Ms. Howard left North Carolina 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Howard speaks a little bit more as time goes on, but her recovery will
likely be limited, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked the year, she first said 1998 and even gave her age as what she
would have been two years ago, but she comprehends the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She won't get a lot better,'' said hospital spokesman Dennis Gimmel.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Carey said Ms. Howard told her, ``I never thought I'd make it this
far.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Prowls for Dollars  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In New York on an East Coast fund-raising trip, Sen. John
McCain said Wednesday he would keep fighting state GOP leaders for a place on
the Republican primary ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he liked his chances of beating Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New
York's March 7 primary -- if voters get the chance to choose him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely I expect to be fighting in New York state for the nomination,''
McCain told reporters after meeting with Jewish leaders in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   He quipped, ``Every time I look at Governor Bush's money, I'm reminded of
the words of Chairman Mao, who said 'It's always darkest before it's totally
black.''' But he added, ``I'm very happy in the progress we've been making.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain thanked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- a Bush backer -- for supporting his
fight to keep his name on the ballot statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very grateful that Rudy Giuliani, in his characteristic style, showed
the courage to stand up for what is right,'' McCain said. ``The days of one
candidate appearing on a ballot disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of the state's
31 congressional districts, contending he failed to obtain the required number
of signatures from party members. McCain is suing in an effort to get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is not competing in Iowa, is trolling for dollars along the East
Coast this week while most of his competitors focus on the Midwest state ahead
of the nation's first caucuses there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   His money tour started with three New York events on Tuesday, including one
for which Seagram executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. was host and another sponsored by
financial news service founder Michael Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was attending a Wednesday evening fund-raiser for which State Street
Bank Chairman Marshall Carter was host in Boston, and another on Thursday at the
Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO President John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   He was tapping more than just Republican money -- both Bronfman and
Bloomberg also give to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group that studies campaign finance
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That is sure to raise objections from conservatives who believe McCain
compromises too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's East Coast trip also highlights the tricky issue of collecting
money from individuals whose businesses are regulated by his Senate Commerce
Committee. The problem has dogged McCain for weeks and highlights the hazards of
crusading against a system in which he takes part.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, says such controversy can't be
avoided because 80 percent of the nation's businesses are overseen in some
fashion by the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's fund-raising ability has mirrored his rise in the polls in states
holding early primaries. He raised more than $6.1 million in the last three
months of 1999, twice as much as he took in during the preceding three months.
He reported $13.6 million in donations for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   At his meeting with Jewish leaders, McCain focused on foreign policy, saying
there are still major obstacles in the peace negotiations between Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised as president to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, an
idea that is important to some Jewish groups but opposed by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   But he took issue with his audience on another topic, saying he would not
offer clemency to convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, whose freedom has been
demanded by some Jewish activists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not release Jonathan Pollard because I believe that he betrayed
our nation and he betrayed his obligations to our government,'' McCain said.
``The evidence is overwhelming and abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Israel Miller, former chairman of the conference, said he disagreed
with McCain on Pollard but ``I was impressed by his not pandering to the
crowd.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Continue Help in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TANAGUARENA, Venezuela (AP) -- The United States will keep helping victims
of Venezuela's deadly floods despite President Hugo Chavez's recent decision to
reject hundreds of American military engineers, a U.S. diplomat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving ahead. There is work to be done. Relations are good,''
Ambassador John Maisto told The Associated Press during a helicopter tour of the
coastal zone most heavily damaged by last month's massive flooding and
landslides that killed as many as 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the U.S. relief effort is less ambitious than it would have
been had the army engineers been allowed to come. There are about 120 U.S.
soldiers in Venezuela whose main mission is to help provide clean drinking water
to survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 450 Marine and Navy engineers had been expected to help rebuild the
coastal road, an essential link for the region's transportation and commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Chavez said last week that he did not want the American soldiers
in his country, U.S. officials ordered a U.S. Navy ship that was en route to
Venezuela to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they were dismayed by Chavez's announcement, since
Venezuela's defense minister had requested the help in a letter on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambassador Maisto toured the disaster area -- a swath of coastal communities
just north of the capital of Caracas -- on a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is playing a major role in purifying water from the ocean
and contaminated rivers to give to mudslide survivors. Eighteen machines -- half
from the U.S. Army and half from a private firm contracted by the U.S.
government -- are purifying some 500,000 gallons of water a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Other countries, including Israel, France, Uruguay and Spain, have brought
their own water purification machines in Vargas state, where massive avalanches
of mud and water on Dec. 15 came crashing down the mountain that separates
Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The catastrophe took on new dimensions from the vantage point of a
helicopter. Where entire communities of homes, schools and shops once stood,
there is now nothing but strewn boulders and tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
	   In the devastated town of Caraballeda, housewife Josefina Rodriguez, 50,
said she was grateful to the United States for providing drinking water to her
family, and criticized Chavez's decision to reject the U.S. military engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was help for the state of Vargas,'' she said. ``I don't know why
Chavez sent them away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who broke into Venezuela's political scene
eight years ago by staging a failed military coup, remains popular among
Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
	   He has thanked the United States for its assistance, but he often speaks of
the need to reduce U.S. domination in the world. He has also raised some concern
in Washington for his growing alliance with Cuba's Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. volunteers and soldiers interviewed Wednesday said that continuing
rains were hampering relief efforts, and that the possibility of further
catastrophes was a concern.
</P>
<P>
	   In the coastal city of Tanaguarena, U.S. soldiers were forced to move water
purifying machines after heavy rains this week caused a river to change course.

<HEADLINE> China Defends Tibetan Policies  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's top official in Tibet defended government control
over religious positions in Tibet Wednesday, saying official recognition of a
child Buddhist leader this week was not connected to the dramatic exit of a
revered teen-age monk from Tibet a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a rare news conference called by the Chinese Embassy, Sun Qi
Wen, vice chairman of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, said the 14-year-old
Karmapa Lama is expected to return to China, where he will be welcome. His
arduous eight-day journey across the Himalayas from Tibet to Dharamsala, India,
ended Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Chinese government on Sunday sanctioned ordination of
2-year-old Soinam Puncog as the seventh incarnation of the Reting Lama, another
key religious position, at a sacred ceremony in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no direct connection between the incarnation of the Reting Lama
and the Karmapa Lama's departure,'' Sun said. He rejected suggestions that China
was trying to increase its control over Tibet by sanctioning young monks who
eventually would identify a new Dalai Lama to lead Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun said China was merely following ``historical convention'' in sanctioning
Tibetan religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any installation not ratified by the central government is considered
illegal,'' he said, reflecting growing Chinese efforts to control religious
practices across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The office of the Dalai Lama, top leader of Tibetan Buddhists, has rejected
the ordination of a new Reting, saying the Reting Lama has not yet been reborn.
Tibetan Buddhists believe high lamas are reborn over and over to help mankind.
Their incarnations are identified by other monks through mystical clues.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama interrupted a two-month meditative retreat to meet privately
with the Karmapa when he arrived in India. Both the Dalai Lama and the
government had recognized the Karmapa as a true reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
	   Avoiding any criticism of the Karmapa for his escape to India, Sun repeated
government claims that the Karmapa left a letter which declared he would not
betray the monastery, the country or its leaders and was traveling to India to
recover sacred artifacts essential to his office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe the Karmapa will keep his promise,'' Sun said. He said the
young monk would be welcome to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about another leading child Tibetan monk recognized by the Dalai Lama,
the Panchen Lama, Sun said he was ``just like other children in China, receiving
an education and leading a happy life.'' Since 1995, China has refused to say
where the boy is, however, and followers say he is believed to be under house
arrest. The government approved a rival Panchen incarnation who has not been
widely accepted by Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun denied the Karmapa's departure would have any impact on China's
relations with India, saying the Karmapa is ``only a child'' and could not
affect the two country's ties. Chinese officials have avoided any request that
India refuse the youth sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Dalai Lama's efforts to negotiate with China over Tibet's future, Sun
repeated his government's position that it is open to talk as long as the Dalai
Lama, who is both a religious and political leader, first accepts Chinese
sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet four decades
ago, runs a government in exile in Dharamsala.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun accused the Dalai Lama of deceptively calling for dialogue only when it
suits him and avoiding it when he feels it would not be to his advantage.

<HEADLINE> Fed Lawsuit Filed in Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno declared last week that the boy's status was an
immigration matter, solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was picked up off the
Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   No hearing date was immediately set. The Justice Department and the INS said
in statement they were prepared to respond quickly and would ask the court ``to
expeditiously address this matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important for the well-being of Elian Gonzalez that the status of
this 6-year-old boy be resolved as quickly as possible,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno had brushed aside a ruling from a Miami family court judge delaying the
boy's return. But she postponed an INS deadline to return the boy to his father
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned trying to
reach the United States, and the boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after
he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father,
and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in
the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or
not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to give
Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts have insisted since the fervor over the case began that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no standing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative. That is the father,'' said David
Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, called Elian's
Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their attempts to
keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government, showing
disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of several U.S. groups that want Elian returned to his father have
warned they will call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child
is not sent back soon. The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation
that would grant U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said Wednesday: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS's ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress
has rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill
and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's sister Juanita Castro, who left Cuba in 1964 and now lives in
the Miami area, said she hopes the matter can be decided justly in court. She
would not say whether she thinks the boy should stay or be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope what happens is the best for him, for his destiny, for his
future,'' she said. ``This case, everything that has happened, makes me very
sad.''

<HEADLINE> Rise in Tortilla Prices Said Illegal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Plans by a group of tortilla producers to raise the price
of the Mexican dietary staple by more than 14 percent were declared illegal by
the Mexican government, which says it may file price-fixing charges against the
producers.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexicans were outraged this week when the Corn-Tortilla Chain Club, a group
of 15 million producers of corn and tortillas, said it would boost the price of
tortillas from the equivalent of 17 to 20 U.S. cents a pound in Mexico City.
Outside the capital, it said it would raise prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Tuesday, six Cabinet members and the governor of the Bank of
Mexico said the price increase may violate federal regulations prohibiting
monopolies. The price of tortillas, once set by the government, was left to the
markets a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the producers group had claimed the cost of making tortillas
had risen above the selling price.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said Tuesday he didn't believe those
figures, and that he was studying the possibility of filing price-fixing
charges. He said the penalty could be up to 10 years of prison and a fine of up
to $1.5 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Relative Surrenders to Cops  </HEADLINE>
   By DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A nephew of Robert F. Kennedy was charged
Wednesday with bludgeoning a girl to death with a golf club in 1975 when he was
15, providing the long-awaited break in a case that frustrated police in wealthy
Greenwich and raised suspicions of a Kennedy cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Skakel, 39, flew to Connecticut from his home in Florida and
surrendered at Greenwich police headquarters after a warrant was issued for his
arrest in the slaying of Martha Moxley. Because of Skakel's age at the time of
the crime, the case will be handled, at least initially, in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Michael has stated all along he did not do this,'' said his lawyer,
Michael Sherman. ``He had no knowledge of it. He had no part in it. He is not
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because Skakel was a juvenile at the time of the crime, it was not
immediately clear Wednesday what penalty he could face.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha was beaten with a 6-iron and stabbed in the throat with a piece of
the club's shattered shaft. The club was quickly matched to a set owned by the
Skakel family, who lived across the street in Belle Haven, an exclusive gated
community in the rich New York suburb of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigation kept hitting dead ends, and police were accused of
apathy and ineptitude. A special prosecutor quit partly in frustration over
unproven claims there had been payoffs aimed at thwarting the probe. Skakel's
father, Rushton, is the brother of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
	   As the years went by and no arrests were made, rumors of a Kennedy cover-up
circulated in Greenwich. The idea that someone might have gotten away with
murder in this community of wealth and privilege made the case the subject of a
TV movie and inspired the the novel ``A Season in Purgatory'' by Dominick Dunne
in 1993 and the nonfiction book ``Murder in Greenwich,'' by former Los Angeles
Detective Mark Fuhrman, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators got their big break during the past year, when a one-man grand
jury heard testimony from former patients at the Elan school, a substance abuse
treatment center in Maine that Skakel attended from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors
filed court documents that said Skakel admitted killing Martha to fellow
students at Elan.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict said juvenile law prevented him from
identifying the suspect. But Sherman confirmed it was his client.
</P>
<P>
	   The case could get stalled in juvenile court for a year or more if Skakel's
lawyer fights prosecutors' bid to transfer the case to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha was killed on Oct. 30, 1975. She had visited the Skakel home along
with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks. She left,
apparently bound for home, but never made it. Her body was found the next
afternoon under low-hanging fir trees on her family's property.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel and his older brother Thomas, then 17, were considered
possible suspects, along with others, including a tutor who had just moved into
the Skakel house the day of the killing. The Skakel family stopped cooperating
with police in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   For a long time, authorities focused on Thomas. It was not until years later
that they took a second look at Michael, after he changed his story about his
movements the night of the killing. In 1995, in an interview with private
investigators hired by his family, Skakel placed himself near the murder scene
at about the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Fuhrman, the detective who investigated the O.J. Simpson case but
was dogged by accusations of racism, wrote a book that suggested that Michael
Skakel murdered Martha in a fit of jealousy after seeing Thomas kissing her.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have dismissed any suggestion that Fuhrman's book helped them
solve the case. Fuhrman did not return calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after Fuhrman's book was published, Superior Court Judge George Thim
was appointed to serve as a one-man grand jury. He interviewed more than 40
witnesses, including Skakel's former schoolmates in Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, released Wednesday, the judge said he found grounds to bring
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a wonderful day,'' Martha's mother, Dorthy Moxley, told the Daily
Record of Morris County, N.J., while sitting at a dining room table beneath a
large painting of her daughter. ``I just hope that they find him guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martha's brother, John Moxley, said he believed police made mistakes in the
investigation and showed deference to the Skakels because of the Kennedy
connection.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lawyer bristled at any suggestion that the Kennedy connection had
any influence on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a Kennedy trial. ... It's not an O.J. trial,'' Sherman said.
``It's a trial of a young man charged with killing his next-door neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the family didn't have money and if they weren't Kennedys he would have
been caught years ago,'' said Alba Fox, a town resident.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's arrest adds to the long history of legal problems for the Kennedy
clan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1969, a Kennedy campaign aide drowned after Sen. Edward Kennedy drove his
car off a bridge at Chappaquiddick in Massachusetts. In 1991, the senator's
nephew William Kennedy Smith was acquitted of rape in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   It was during that trial that investigators in Connecticut formally reopened
the Moxley case, after rumors circulated that Smith had been at the Skakel home
the night of Martha's killing. The rumors were unfounded.

<HEADLINE> Book Recalls Sins of U.S. Media  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A story about a seduction by King Louis XIV helped bring
the suppression of the first newspaper in what is now the United States,
according to a new book from the Newseum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Officials, upset by a French sex scandal and other reports, kill(ed) the
paper after one edition, calling it `a great inconvenience,''' notes the first
entry in the book published by the journalism museum. ``Inconvenience'' was a
much stronger denunication in 1690 than it is today.
</P>
<P>
	   The account tells of Benjamin Harris, publisher of ``Publick Occurrences,''
the first of 285 American news figures profiled in a volume called ``Crusaders,
Scoundrels, Journalists.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those troubled by conflicting news items, Tim Russert of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' tells a story from ancient Egypt in the book's foreword.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The almighty Pharaoh had to assign four scribes to write about an
important trial, hoping the truth would somehow emerge from their varying
reports,'' Russert said.
</P>
<P>
	   The text divides the personalities, whom it calls ``The Newseum's Most
Intriguing Newspeople'' into 10 groups: newsmongers, crusaders, political
animals, humorists, war reporters, media moguls, sleuths, barrier breakers,
photographers and literary journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them:
</P>
<P>
	   --Nellie Bly -- real name Elizabeth Cochran -- who not only circled the
world in 72 days but in 1884, writing for the New York World, exposed conditions
at a woman's asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   --K.W. Lee, whose stories in the Sacramento Union helped win the release of
a wrongfully convicted immigrant in 1983, and who went on to found Koreatown,
the first national Korean-American paper.
</P>
<P>
	   --Mark Kellogg who went into the Battle of Little Bighorn with Lt. Col.
George Custer. His final dispatch to The Associated Press on June 24, 1876,
said: ``By the time this reaches you we will have met and fought the red devils,
with what result remains to be seen. I go with Custer and will be at the
death.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Forum, which opened the Newseum in Arlington, Va., in 1997, is a
nonpartisan foundation that advocates speech and press freedoms.

<HEADLINE> Democrats: Bush Could Steal Edge  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats have the advantage on many issues the voters
say are top priorities -- such as education, health care and Social Security,
says a new bipartisan poll that also shows that edge being threatened by
Republican George W. Bush's moderate message and overall popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democrats have to watch that Republicans don't steal our issues,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who conducted the bipartisan Voter.com
Battleground Survey with GOP pollster Ed Goeas. It was sponsored by the Internet
political site.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP;
the Press found that Vice President Al Gore is starting to redefine himself with
the public as a moderate, while his Democratic opponent Bill Bradley is now
viewed as more liberal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Battleground Poll found voters fairly satisfied with the direction of
the country, with half saying it's headed in the right direction, and Democrats
and Republicans facing each other on a relatively level playing field.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll suggested the tension between the roaring economy and anxiety about
the nation's moral values continues to be a defining theme of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country has moved from things are moving in the wrong direction six
months ago, to things are moving in the right direction,'' said Lake, looking
for bright spots for Democrats. ``The concern about declining morality and
values is there, but it's one of many issues and doesn't dominate the agenda
like it did last June.''
</P>
<P>
	   She noted Democrats don't compete well with Republicans on moral and family
values issues, especially in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Public concern over President Clinton's personal behavior -- 66 percent
disapproved of him personally -- has dampened the impact of his 59 percent job
approval rating in the nationwide survey, Goeas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Things were different for the GOP front-runner, with Bush viewed favorably
by 62 percent of those polled and unfavorably by 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was viewed favorably by 47 percent and unfavorably by 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore is doing fairly well with Democrats (with three-fourths viewing him
favorably),'' Goeas said. ``That's basically all he's getting, the Democratic
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Republicans can benefit from Bush's emergence as a popular leader
who can unite the Republican Party and help define their agenda, and as one who
fares well with the public on many issues, including topics Democrats are
usually favored on like education and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Republicans have gone for seven years without a spokesman,'' Goeas said,
noting that 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole was unable to play that role
effectively because he was so battered in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also focused on Hispanics and found that the group, which
traditionally has leaned Democratic, favored Bush by 13 points against Gore --
51 percent to 38 percent, the same margin between the two men overall.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush continues his substantial advantage over Gore on most issues and
with potential voters in every region of the country, Lake cautioned that ``the
presidential race is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll see a fundamental change in the dynamic once Gore becomes the
Democratic nominee,'' said Lake, who has advised the vice president's campaign.
And she noted that Democrats have fewer open seats in the House of
Representatives, which is an advantage in a pro-incumbent environment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Battleground Poll of 1,000 likely voters was taken Jan. 3-5 and has an
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore may be starting the process of redefining himself now that the
public is beginning to pay attention, according to the Pew poll of 1,091 adults
taken Wednesday through Sunday. It had an error margin of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The campaign has begun to kick in,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Pew Research Center. ``People are paying more attention now than four years ago
and eight years ago, and the basic perceptions of Bradley's and Gore's ideology
are changing.''

<HEADLINE> History of 24-Year-Old Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CRARY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The 24-year hunt for Martha Moxley's murderer was slowed by false turns and
dead ends, but the weapon -- a shattered 6-iron -- pointed in one direction all
along: the Skakel home nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Summoned on Halloween in 1975, in response to the first murder in Greenwich,
Conn., in 30 years, police swiftly determined that the 15-year-old girl had been
bludgeoned by a golf club, then stabbed with its broken shaft.
</P>
<P>
	   By the next day, in a gated shoreline enclave in one of America's wealthiest
towns, police had found the rest of the high-priced set of clubs. They were in
the mansion of Rushton Skakel, brother of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, investigators were accused of apathy and ineptitude. A
special prosecutor quit the case partly in frustration over unproven claims
there had been payoffs aimed at thwarting the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, at last, a murder warrant was issued, and a defense lawyer
said Michael Skakel -- one of Rushton's sons -- was being charged with the
killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael, like Martha Moxley, was 15 at the time of her death. He and his
brother Thomas, then 17, both had a romantic interest in their popular, blond
neighbor -- an ``A'' student voted ``best personality'' in her junior high
school class.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder investigation began vigorously, with Michael and Thomas among the
suspects, but it ran out of steam after the Skakel family ceased cooperating
with police in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest revived in 1991, partly because of false rumors there was a
connection with William Kennedy Smith, another Kennedy cousin who was then
facing a rape charge in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1998, the Moxley case had been the subject of a made-for-TV movie and
several books, including one by Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles detective
whose racial attitudes became pivotal in the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In ``Murder in Greenwich,'' Fuhrman suggested that Michael Skakel murdered
Martha in a fit of jealousy after seeing Thomas kissing her. Fuhrman claimed
police did not aggressively pursue Michael because they were cowed by the
Skakels' wealth and Kennedy connections.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1998, a month after Fuhrman's book appeared, Connecticut authorities
appointed a grand jury, consisting of a single judge, to hear testimony from
principals in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 18 months, ending Dec. 10, Superior Court Judge George Thim heard
testimony from more than 40 witnesses in closed sessions. Some were friends who
were with Martha the night she died; others were former students at a
residential school and substance abuse treatment center in Maine that Michael
Skakel attended from 1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, several former students at the school indicated Skakel had
made admissions there regarding the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael's father, Rushton Skakel, lost a long legal battle and reluctantly
joined the parade of witnesses before Thim last September. But it was unclear if
the elder Skakel even remembered the night in question; his lawyers said he
suffered from a form of dementia and was unfit to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Oct. 30, 1975, was ``Mischief Night'' in Greenwich, and Martha was out with
two friends on a brisk Halloween Eve, engaging in some mild pranks.
</P>
<P>
	   The youths stopped by the Skakel home, and around 9:45 p.m. Martha left for
her own house, 150 yards away. She never made it; her body was found the next
afternoon under a fir tree in the Moxleys' backyard.
</P>
<P>
	   She had been struck at least a dozen times in the head and stabbed five
times, including once through the neck, with a jagged piece of the golf club
shaft. Her jeans and panties were down at her ankles, though police found no
evidence of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-iron came from a set of clubs owned by Anne Skakel, the mother of
Michael and Thomas who had died of cancer two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Police initially focused their attention on Thomas, the last person seen
with Martha, and on Kenneth Littleton, a 24-year-old tutor living with the
Skakels.
</P>
<P>
	   Littleton, a science teacher at a Greenwich private school, was baby-sitting
the Skakel children because Rushton Skakel was out of town. Only in 1998, when
he was granted immunity, was Littleton effectively cleared of suspicion; last
July, he was hospitalized in Massachusetts with what his girlfriend said were
self-inflicted stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Rushton Skakel, who had allowed police to search his home and look at school
and medical records, abruptly halted access to the family on Jan. 22, 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   That same day, the elder Skakel was admitted to Greenwich Hospital with
chest pains. He told neighbors he had received some bad news. He hired an
attorney, who advised the family and their employees not to speak to the police.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, the Skakels hired private investigators in a bid to clear Thomas
and Michael. But a report by the investigative firm, Sutton Associates, instead
revealed that the brothers changed their stories about their movements the night
Martha was killed.

<HEADLINE> HUD official attacks GOP senator over hearings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo went on the offensive
Wednesday in the skirmish over New York City homeless funds. One of Cuomo's top
aides accused a Republican senator of launching a hearing into the dispute for
politically-motivated reasons.
<P>
	   Cuomo made waves in GOP circles when he announced recently that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development would bypass Republican Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and distribute some $60 million in federal homeless funds
directly to advocacy groups in New York City. Cuomo is a close ally of Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Giuliani is all but certain to face Mrs. Clinton in New York's
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani cried foul over Cuomo's takeover, and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
announced Tuesday that he would hold a Congressional hearing to see whether the
shift was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Senator Bond didn't complain when HUD took enforcement actions against
Democratic elected officials and supporters," HUD spokesman David Egner said

repeatedly seeking documentation supporting the agency's decision to take

</P>
<P>
	   A request to speak to Cuomo was declined. He has said in the past that he
stepped into the funding issue because a federal court ruling recently found

the mayor. The Giuliani administration's actions in turn cost the agency, called

<HEADLINE> HUD official attacks GOP senator over hearings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo went on the offensive
Wednesday in the skirmish over New York City homeless funds. One of Cuomo's top
aides accused a Republican senator of launching a hearing into the dispute for
politically-motivated reasons.
<P>
	   Cuomo made waves in GOP circles when he announced recently that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development would bypass Republican Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and distribute some $60 million in federal homeless funds
directly to advocacy groups in New York City. Cuomo is a close ally of Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Giuliani is all but certain to face Mrs. Clinton in New York's
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani cried foul over Cuomo's takeover, and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
announced Tuesday that he would hold a Congressional hearing to see whether the
shift was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Senator Bond didn't complain when HUD took enforcement actions against
Democratic elected officials and supporters," HUD spokesman David Egner said
Wednesday. "He's operating under a double standard because he only calls for
hearings when HUD acts to halt improper conduct by a Republican."
</P>
<P>
	   Egner said Cuomo has led a bipartisan crackdown to eliminate waste, fraud
and abuse by HUD officials nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street doubts P&AMP;G will be 'white knight' for Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street on Wednesday downplayed the chances that
consumer products titan Procter &AMP; Gamble would make a white-knight bid for drug
maker Warner-Lambert. Instead, skeptical investors brushed off reports of
high-level talks between the companies as an attempt by Warner-Lambert to
pressure Pfizer to raise its $79 billion hostile takeover offer.
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert Co. were up more than 5 percent in betting that the
raging takeover fight would lead to higher bids.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert said last week that - despite its $57 billion merger deal
with American Home Products Corp. - it would talk to Pfizer Inc. about its
richer bid. But executives at Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert also
started knocking on the doors of several rivals in hopes of finding a better
offer, according to two people involved in meetings, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions with Procter &AMP; Gamble have been the most serious. The
Cincinnati-based company also has entertained the idea of acquiring both
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, said one of the sources.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G, with sales of $38 billion, is looking for more profitable products to
complement its established, but slow-growing consumer brands like Tide, Crest
and Pampers.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert not only makes the best-selling anti-cholesterol drug
Lipitor, but also makes a host of consumer goods that would fit nicely under
P&AMP;G's umbrella, including Certs breath mints, Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash,
and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., makes Premarin, a hormone
replacement drug, and over-the-counter aids like Advil and Anacin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Procter &AMP; Gamble has been looking to add to its pharmaceutical business,
which is small, and they have the flexibility to acquire a pharmaceutical
company and have it work," said Michael Kagan, portfolio manager for the Salomon
Brother Fund, which owns shares in P&AMP;G, Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products. "A Warner-Lambert or an American Home Products is a good fit. They
have the pharmaceutical and the consumer products fit."
</P>
<P>
	   But he added "Any responsible CEO is going to have to gulp real hard before
they get involved in a bidding process. I think Pfizer needs (Warner-Lambert)
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Pfizer can hardly afford to lose. New York-based Pfizer has a
co-marketing agreement to sell Warner-Lambert's Lipitor, which is worth billions
to both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you lay out the numbers, it really feels that Pfizer has the upper
hand" over a potential bid from Procter &AMP; Gamble, Jeff Chaffkin, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "There will be more cost savings in the Pfizer-Warner-Lambert than
in P&AMP;G-Warner-Lambert."
</P>
<P>
	   And, ultimately, he added, "Pfizer needs the deal more than P&AMP;G, which means
they'll go much father to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer is best known for its Viagra impotence-treatment drug, but also makes
the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as Visine and BenGay.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the companies declined to comment on the talks, which first were
reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Many pharmaceutical companies are looking for partners to share the expenses
of funding research for new medicines. On Monday, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham announced a $76 billion merger that would create the world's largest
drug company. And last month, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced a $27 billion merger
with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most likely scenario is Warner-Lambert is just putting pressure on
Pfizer to raise its bid," Chaffkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Wednesday, Warner-Lambert said profit for the fourth quarter
jumped 40 percent to $487.3 million, or 55 cents a share, beating estimates by 3
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $3.53 billion, up 16 percent from the $3.04
billion year-earlier total.	   For all of last year, earnings rose to $1.73
billion, or $1.96 a share, from $1.27 billion, or $1.45 a share. Sales surged 20
percent to $12.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 5:15 p.m. EST, Warner-Lambert's shares rose $4.81 1/4 to $94.81 1/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where P&AMP;G's shares were off $1.25 at $115.37 1/2.
Pfizer's stock was up 50 cents at $37. American Home Product's shares were up
$1.81 1/4 cents to $46.

<HEADLINE> Three die in New York's bone-chilling weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was so cold a homeless man froze to death.
<P>
	   And Mary Varriale, diagnosed with a brain tumor and feeling disoriented in a
Queens hospital, just wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
	   So in the middle of the night, the 75-year-old grandmother climbed out of
her bed. In robe and slippers, she wandered up to the roof. The door locked
behind her, leaving her in the 9-degree temperature made deadly cold by wind.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't survive.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doll lady," as she was dubbed by neighborhood children for whom she
crocheted the toys, would never return.
</P>
<P>
	   For many, this week's bone-chilling temperatures meant extra layers of
clothing and chattering teeth. But for Mrs. Varriale and at least two other
people, the chill spelled death.
</P>
<P>
	   Two homeless people also have died and the medical examiner was performing
an autopsy on an elderly woman in the Bronx, possibly another victim of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the city enjoyed what seemed - by contrast - like a heat wave,
with temperatures pushing 30 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast snow
for Thursday, but temperatures remaining in the 20s or 30s through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The warm-up came too late for Mrs. Varriale, the brain tumor patient who
died on the roof of the Flushing Hospital Medical Center. "Something went
definitely, radically wrong in that place," said her husband, Tullio Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   During the weekend, Mrs. Varriale had to be restrained because she had
become confused and tried to leave the hospital to go home to her Astoria
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   At about 3 a.m. Monday, a nurse noticed that she was missing from her bed.
Police helped hospital security officers look for her. They found her dead at
about 8 a.m. on the roof. During the night, an icy wind had pushed the
temperature to gusts of 34 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't gotten the whole story yet," her husband said. "I just don't
understand how something like this could happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Pedersen, a hospital spokesman, said the death was under investigation.
He said that, in general, patients are allowed to walk on the floor where Mrs.
Varriale was hospitalized. "It is not like a locked prison."
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital issued a statement saying the staff was "devastated by this
outcome and expresses condolences to the patient's family."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Varriale was admitted to the hospital last week, after she felt dizzy,
got disoriented and had problems walking. A CAT scan revealed the brain tumor,
said her son, Edward Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they had a situation where they had to put her in restraints, why
weren't they watching her more closely?" asked Tullio Varriale. "I lost my wife
of 50 years."
</P>
<P>
	   The cold also proved fatal for the two homeless men.
</P>
<P>
	   One, in his 40s, was found on a loading dock in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay
section on Monday afternoon. The temperature had reached 19, but with a wind
chill of minus 16.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 3 degrees in Central Park at 6 a.m. -
the coldest in six years. A 55-year-old man died while trying to keep warm in
the back of a parked station wagon in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   Identities for the two men were still unavailable on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the slight thaw, the lingering cold was still causing other
problems. In Farmingdale, Long Island, frozen pipes burst at The American
Airpower Museum at Republic Airport, destroying photographs, books and records
of aviation history dating back to World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 gallons of water cascaded from one floor to another
overnight, washing away decades of records that may never be replaced, said
museum spokesman Gary Lewi.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the damaged items was a lithograph showing Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit
of St. Louis" taking off from Republic air field.

<HEADLINE> Disclosures Barred in Diallo Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A jury will not be allowed to hear that three of the
four police officers accused of fatally shooting an African immigrant were
involved in past shootings, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Joseph C. Teresi also rejected a motion filed by eight news
organizations seeking to open all hearings and papers to the press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be horrific to have similar circumstances concerning publicity
occur again,'' he wrote. An appeals court moved the trial to Albany from New
York because of pretrial publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss were
indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they fired 41 bullets at
Diallo while searching a New York City neighborhood. Defense attorneys claim the
officers mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   According to past reports, a grand jury cleared Boss of wrongdoing after he
shot and killed an armed man in 1997. In 1998, a suspect shot at Carroll and
Carroll fired back, but missed. McMellon wounded an armed man in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Treason Trial Riot in Tanzania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) -- Police and political supporters of 18 men charged
with treason clashed Wednesday outside the Zanzibar High Court, leaving 29
people injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports that one of the injured civilians had died could not immediately be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Zanzibar police said Wednesday evening that 15 civilians and 14 police were
injured in the two-hour melee and 40 people were arrested. They were to appear
in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Shops in Zanzibar's historic Stone Town closed down, and tourists were
pursued by thugs and thieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred members of the opposition Civic United Front had gathered
outside the court Wednesday for the scheduled opening of the trial of 18 members
of the group, who have been held without bail for more than two years in
Kiinuamiguu maximum security prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused them entry, saying there was not enough room, and forced them
back 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge postponed the opening of the trial to Jan. 27 after the prosecution
asked for more time to prepare its case. Prosecutors have asked for a least half
a dozen postponements to prepare, and several judges have been hearing the case,
which originally was set to go to trial in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18 defendants were arrested on charges they conspired to overthrow
President Salmin Amour of the semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the Indian
Ocean off mainland Tanzania. Four of the suspects are members of Zanzibar's
50-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Civic United Front claims Amour's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party
rigged October 1995 elections in which the opposition officially won 24 of the
parliamentary seats. Amour won 50.2 percent of the presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's deputy secretary-general, Nassor Seif Amour, was arrested with
12 others in November 1997 after telling people at a political rally to prepare
for bloodshed. Five more party members were arrested in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The president and the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party are seeking to change
Zanzibar's constitution to allow him to run for an unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
	   Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of
Tanzania after a bloody revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan and Omani Arabs
who ruled the island.

<HEADLINE> Many in Seton Hall dorm thought fire alarm was a prank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Pete Tornatore heard the fire alarm and
thought it was like all the others. He turned over and went back to sleep. It
was 4:30 a.m.
<P>
	   "I thought it was a joke," he said. Eighteen prank alarms had rung at Seton
Hall University's freshman dormitory since the students arrived in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Yatin Patel learned the alarm was no joke after opening his door on the
third floor of Boland Hall. He saw flames licking at the ceiling tiles in the
hallway and thick smoke. "Pitch black," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel put a wet towel under his door, kicked out his window screens and
threw mattresses to the ground in case he would have to jump.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters soon came and got him and his roommate. They crawled down the
hall on their hands and knees in a human chain, one person holding the next
person's leg and made it down the stairwell to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, Mike Williams woke up to frantic students banging on his
door, pleading for help. He went to his back yard and got his ladder.
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving before the fire department, Williams and three students hoisted it
up 10 feet to a lower roof, then put it up to a third-floor window where the
students were hanging out, screaming.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were like, 'Please help us. Somebody save us,"' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   He pulled about 14 students out from the dormitory, sliding some down the
last 10 feet on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was one kid that came out and he had inhaled a lot of smoke. I had to
carry him down," Williams said. "He didn't have anything but his T-shirt and
some shorts. I put my coat around him because he was freezing."
</P>
<P>
	   At least two students jumped before help came, including Nicholas Donato,
19, of Sparta. Nicholas, a team manager for Seton Hall's basketball team, broke
his wrist and ankle after leaping from the third floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said the smoke was so intense, he knew where the exit was and he could
not find it," said Anthony Donato, Nicholas' father. "So he went back into his
room, closed the door, opened the window and jumped out."
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of students staggered out into the freezing cold, some barefoot,
some in pajamas, others wrapped in blankets to protect them against the
subfreezing temperature.
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber saw one student in a T-shirt and boxers, skin completely
blackened by fire. "His skin was, like, smoking," she said. "He just had ashes
everywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Three students were killed and six critically burned in the fire that began
in the third-floor student lounge. Sixty-two people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The students had become used to false alarms. The university had offered a
reward to anyone who would help find pranksters who had set off the building's
alarms seven times during finals week, students said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They pull fire alarms all the time. No one even gets out," said Kristin
Ewall, 19, of Long Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornatore, 18, of Manalapan, ran outside and met a firefighter with a
ladder. He held the bottom while the firefighter climbed up to pull students
from windows above.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornatore said he later put an oxygen mask on the face of a student who had
serious burns to his hands and face. Later, after learning that three classmates
had died, he realized this was the farthest thing from a joke.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before, it wasn't scary. Before, I thought it was going to be all right,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Chase Profits Top Estimates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. reported profits surged more than 45
percent in the fourth quarter, blowing past analysts' estimates, as the nation's
third-largest bank posted huge gains from its investments in Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase had operating profits of $1.68 billion, or $1.97 a share, for the
quarter ended Dec. 31, far above Wall Street's forecast of $1.32 a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Including a one-time gain, Chase
posted net income of $1.69 billion, or $1.98 a share, in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase had operating profits and net income of $1.15 billion, or $1.31 a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based bank has made smart investments in small Internet
companies through Chase Capital Partners. Several of those companies went public
in the fourth quarter, including Cobalt Networks, Triton PCS, and Telecorp. And
the bank still owns stakes in hundreds of companies that are still in the early
stages of development.
</P>
<P>
	   "This quarter's number is not a one-time thing," said Dina Dublon, chief
financial officer of Chase.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase made $1.31 billion from its equity investments in the fourth quarter,
up fivefold from $244 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank, which acquired the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist investment bank last year,
saw fees from trading and underwriting stocks and bonds jump 31 percent to $499
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter totaled $ 6.27 billion, a 24 percent increase over
the $5.06 billion in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors reacted by bidding up Chase's stock $3.12 1/2 to $74.12 1/2 at
5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, despite the company's gains, its shares are down 5 percent from
January last year.
</P>
<P>
	   To boost its shares, Chase said it would buy back up to $5 billion of its
shares. Share repurchase programs often improve stock prices by reducing the
number of shares outstanding, which improves the company's earnings-per-share
ratio.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Chase posted operating earnings of $5.39 billion, or
$6.21 a share, compared with $4.02 billion, or $4.51 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including all one-time charges and gains, net income for the year was $5.45
billion compared with $3.78 billion in 1998. Revenues totaled $22.98 billion
versus $19.61 billion.

<HEADLINE> Two Airlines Adding Fuel Surcharge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- The nation's two largest airlines are matching No. 5
Continental Airlines in adding a fuel surcharge of $20 per round trip, and
analysts were waiting to see whether the increase would stick.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental on Tuesday announced it is imposing the surcharge on travel
beginning Feb. 1. The surcharge spread Wednesday to United Airlines, the
country's biggest carrier, and No. 2 American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The charge appears on the face of the ticket and will be included in
advertised fares, said Karla Villalon, a spokeswoman for Houston-based
Continental.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, however, said the increase was not immediately evident on travel
agents' computer screens.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're doing it without announcing it," said Terry Trippler of
1travel.com, an online seller of discount travel tickets. "The only way to know
for sure is to book a trip. Is this the new wave of price increases? I hope
not."
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials and Wall Street analysts said the surcharge was warranted.
Continental said its jet fuel costs in the fourth quarter came to $259 million,
50 percent higher than in the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines held the average increase of its fuel in the fourth
quarter to 16 percent by hedging -- it bought about half its fuel with options
it had purchased when fuel was cheaper -- said Gerard Arpey, the Fort Worth,
Texas-based airline's executive vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Arpey added that the airline has managed to "somewhat offset" the fuel cost
increase by reducing commissions paid to travel agents, which it has
accomplished by selling more Internet and paperless tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased fuel costs are a direct result of the highest oil prices in nearly
a decade, spawned by production cutbacks by foreign oil powers. The price of the
benchmark U.S. crude oil climbed above $29 a barrel on Wednesday, reaching the
highest level since the Gulf War and more than double its level of about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have a cost double on a year-over-year basis, you have to cover
it," said Candace Browning, an airlines analyst with Merrill Lynch. She said,
however, that the surcharge will fail if other major carriers refuse to match
it.
</P>
<P>
	   By late Wednesday, Delta, Northwest, TWA and US Airways had not adopted the
surcharge. Spokesmen at Northwest and TWA said they were studying the increase,
and a US Airways spokesman declined to comment. Delta said it has yet to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   The surcharge of $10 one-way and $20 roundtrip applies evenly to all
domestic flights, regardless of length. It doesn't apply to international
flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Trippler said United was slow to inform travel agents of the surcharge and
American had still not notified agents through computer systems as of late
Wednesday. He gave grudging credit to Continental: "At least they were upfront
about it."

<HEADLINE> Fed Notes Good Business Conditions  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, fueled by robust consumer spending and
rejuvenated manufacturing, continues to fire on all cylinders, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday in a report that economists said is further evidence that
the Fed will boost interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In its most recent snapshot of the nation's economic activity, the Fed
reported "strong economic growth in December and January."
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, contributed to the strong growth. Retailers reported strong holiday
sales with purchases of electronics, toys and jewelry especially high nationwide
and expected robust sales early this year, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad-based rebound in manufacturing also contributed to the growth as
overseas demand, which had been dampened by the Asian currency crisis, continued
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are laying the foundation for another tightening move in February,"
said Mark Zandi, economist with Regional Financial Associates. "The report shows
that the economy is not slowing. It is booming."
</P>
<P>
	   Labor markets remained tight around the country, meaning that employers have
difficulty finding workers to fill job openings, something that economists fear
could lead to wage and price inflation in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fed said there was still no sign that employers were giving workers
big wage increases. And, the Fed said that "most consumer prices appear to be
holding steady in much of the country, although a few districts reported
moderate increases."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's survey, known as the "beige book" for the color of its cover, will
be used when Fed policy-makers meet next on Feb. 1-2 to review the central
bank's stance on interest rates. The survey is based on reports from the Fed's
12 regional banks from information collected before Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Fed will boost interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point at the February meeting, citing continuing strong economic
growth. The Fed's latest survey supports such a move, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The beige book simply confirms what the Fed already knows: that momentum is
too strong and has to be slowed," said Tim O'Neill, economist for Bank of
Montreal and Harris Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
sizzling economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists fear that the booming economy could spark inflation down the
road, but the Fed's report indicated that thus far prices remain stable. Given
that, the Fed is likely to follow up February's meeting with several small
increases rather than big ones, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Fed, in a move designed to reduce confusion about its
intentions for interest rates, said beginning at the February meeting it will
discuss the outlook for inflation or economic growth, rather than make specific
references to the prospects of interest rate changes in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, construction of new homes and apartments surged to a
13-year high in 1999 helped along by a 7.1 percent jump in December, a sign of
the housing sector's resilience even as mortgage rates rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, builders started construction on 1.66 million new units, a
3 percent gain from 1998, pushing total housing starts to the highest level
since 1986, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, builders, aided by better-than-normal weather, began work on
new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71 million units.
</P>
<P>
	   The growth in December's and last year's housing starts came despite the
upward climb of mortgage rates and reflects the nation's good economic times,
economists said. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and a strong
stock market helped make Americans feel wealthy and in the buying mood last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists, however, predict slower growth this year as mortgage rates
continue to rise. In December, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage was 7.9 percent, up from 6.7 percent in December 1998. Last week,
mortgage rates climbed to 8.18 percent, the highest level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect total housing starts to go down by 8 percent in 2000, but that
will still leave things pretty healthy," said the association's economist
Michael Carliner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, in its survey, said the Year 2000 computer changeover did not cause
major disruptions to the U.S. banking system or other parts of the economy. "Few
future disruptions are anticipated and few problems concerning Y2K-related
inventories are expected," the Fed said.

<HEADLINE> Industry Gets 'C+' for Minority Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A coalition of Hispanic and black broadcasters gave the
advertising industry a "C+" Wednesday for its efforts to increase advertising
among minority media. The grade comes nearly two years after a notorious ad
agency memo surfaced calling black consumers "suspects, not prospects."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Al Sharpton, the fulcrum of an unprecedented coalition of Hispanic
and black media owners and advertisers, gave the grade at a news conference
following the second annual Invitational Summit on Multicultural Markets and
Media.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton offered the middling ranking even as he announced agreements
between his Madison Avenue Initiative and Macy's, PepsiCo Inc. and
Colgate-Palmolive to redirect their advertising budgets toward black and
Hispanic firms.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison Avenue only got a "C+" "because we are dealing with a multi,
multibillion-dollar industry," that should be targeting minority communities
that spend money on products whose current advertising excludes them, Sharpton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That exclusion was graphically displayed in May 1998 when an ad agency's
memo materialized advising clients that "advertisers want prospects, not
suspects" and advocated using ad budgets to reach "the more important 'white'
segment of the population."
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage in 1998 lead to the first summit conference in February 1999, which
was backed financially by the industry then and again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's probably a pretty fair rating," said O. Burtch Drake, president and
chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the
nation's largest trade group representing advertising agencies. The Four As, as
the group is known, is a co-convenor of the summit.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a difficult area for the industry but inherent in the Reverend's
rating is that it was better than it was a year ago," Drake said. "We are making
progress."
</P>
<P>
	   But that kind of statement, along with others made at the conference, didn't
sit well with many in the audience. The Four As provided speakers, one of whom
said that diversifying ad dollars hasn't been on the industry's radar. Another
said that media buyers and sellers weren't aware that Asians, Latinos and blacks
make up a roughly trillion dollar market.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've heard this for 30 years!" an outraged Sanford Moore, managing
director of Minority Media Management Services Inc., said in comments from the
floor directed to panelists.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore got a round of applause then and also when he asked the moderator,
Charles Ogletree of Harvard Law School, if he would consider a federal suit
against the industry. Ogletree told Moore to see him afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked later if suing is an option, Sharpton said "everything is a viable
option until we obtain parity."
</P>
<P>
	   Sometime in the spring, the MAI will issue a Top 20 and Bottom 20 of
advertising agencies and their efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   While no dollar figures were available, the MAI said Macy's will increase
its advertising in minority media by 24 percent; Colgate-Palmolive will spend an
additional 22 percent; and PepsiCo will increase its minority radio presence by
20 percent, magazines by 86 percent, newspapers by 233 percent and television by
73 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov.: Must Move Confederate Symbol  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gov. Jim Hodges said Wednesday that the Confederate
battle flag should be removed from the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the governor's boldest statement yet on the issue and came two days
after nearly 50,000 people rallied on the Statehouse lawn, urging the
Legislature to bring the flag down.
</P>
<P>
	   In his State of the State address, Hodges said it was time to resolve a
matter that led a national civil rights group to boycott South Carolina amid
charges of racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must move the flag from the dome to a place of historical significance
on the Statehouse grounds,'' Hodges, a Democrat, said in a prepared copy of his
speech. ``The debate over the Confederate flag has claimed too much of our time
and energy.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a state legislator, Hodges supported previous attempts to remove the
flag, and earlier this year he said he personally did not think it should fly
above the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   The flag was raised in 1962 to commemorate the Civil War centennial, and
South Carolina's Legislature has the sole power to remove it. Legislative
leaders have said in recent days that the question is no longer if it will come
down, but where on Statehouse grounds the flag will be displayed afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of what to do about the Confederate flag, which supporters say
honors the state's heritage, is one of South Carolina's thorniest issues.
Hodges' predecessor, Republican Gov. David Beasley, has said his public support
for removing the flag was partly to blame for his election loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges did not offer a specific plan for what to do with the flag, and he
waited until the end of the 4,700 word speech to call for its removal.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP, which helped organize Monday's Martin Luther King Day rally, has
urged tourists to boycott South Carolina because it flies flag, which the group
considers a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The entire nation is watching and listening to us,'' Hodges said. ``Most
importantly, South Carolina's children are watching and listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges also said South Carolina should recognize King Day as an official
state holiday. It is currently an optional holiday for state employees, who also
can pick several Confederate holidays or a day of their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, the wife of Republican presidential candidate and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush rejected arguments that the flag is racist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a symbol of racism,'' Laura Bush told television station WOLO as
she campaigned in South Carolina for her husband. ``I grew up in south Texas.
It's just a time in our history that we can't erase.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that the president
``thinks the flag shouldn't be flown.''

<HEADLINE> Study Says Apples Help Breathing  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Eating at least five apples a week could help you breathe
more easily, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, published this week in the British medical journal Thorax, found
that men who ate nearly an apple a day had slightly stronger lung function than
those who excluded the fruit from their diets.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not clear why the apple-eaters could breathe more effortlessly, but
apples contain antioxidants, which experts believe may ward off disease by
combatting oxygen's damaging effect on the body. Scientists have found that
antioxidants have the same effect on women as on men.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists previously have found that better lung function is linked to
eating fresh fruit and taking antioxidant vitamin pills and that lung disease
and lung cancer are seen less frequently in people who eat lots of hard fruit
such as apples.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study strengthens the argument that eating fresh fruit, and apples,
may be good for you," said Cora Tabak of the National Institute of Public Health
and Environment in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, researchers from St. George's Hospital in London examined the
health records of 2,500 Welsh men aged 45-59 who had been followed by other
scientists for five years. They had been questioned about their eating habits
and made to blow as hard as they could into a machine for one second to measure
lung capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   The test, known as an FEV, for forced expiratory volume, measures how much
air someone can exhale in one second.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers adjusted their results to eliminate the potential influence
of other factors, such as smoking, exercise habits, the total amount the men ate
and socioeconomic class.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that the apple eaters could exhale 138 milliliters more air in
one second than those of the same age and height who ate no apples, which
indicated their airways had fewer obstructions and were therefore healthier.
</P>
<P>
	   An average man of that age usually has a score of about 4,000 milliliters,
Tabak said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also confirmed earlier findings that vitamin E is associated with
easier breathing, but the connection was weaker than for apples.
</P>
<P>
	   It also looked at the influence of vitamin C, beta carotene, citrus fruit
and fruit juices. None of those seemed to improve lung function.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul A. Lachance, executive director of the Nutraceutacals Institute at
Rutgers University in New Jersey, said it was plausible the benefit came from
the antioxidants in apples, but that it was unlikely only a single antioxidant
was at work.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe apples are loaded with several hundred healthy compounds and
it may be the unique combination of those nutrients that creates the effect, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Official Visits Turkey  </HEADLINE>
   By SUZAN FRASER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- George Papandreou arrived Wednesday in Turkey on the
first official visit by a Greek foreign minister since 1962, another sign of
warming relations between the Mediterranean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey and Greece have nearly gone to war three times during the past 25
years, but have steadily improved relations since they rushed aid to each other
following devastating earthquakes last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem greeted Papandreau at the airport,
pointing out the time lapse since the last official visit by a Greek foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope, in fact we are sure that, it will not be such a long time before
the next visit,'' said Cem, who is expected to visit Athens next month.
</P>
<P>
	   During his four-day stay, Papandreou is expected to meet the prime minister
and sign a series of agreements for cooperation in fighting terrorism and
organized crime, as well as deals on tourism, environment and the protection of
investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreements are small, but are designed to build confidence between the
two sides by avoiding contentious issues, such as the divided island of Cyprus
and territorial disputes in the Aegean. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when
Turkey sent in troops after a short-lived coup by backers of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to take cautious steps so that this newborn optimism is
established on solid ground,'' Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
	   Papandreou told Turkey's Anatolia news agency he would propose reactivating
a defunct committee that consisted of experts from both countries trying to
resolve disputes over boundaries in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Greece lifted its long-standing objections to Turkey's candidacy
for European Union membership. In return, Turkey agreed that Cyprus could
eventually join the EU, and also agreed to possible international arbitration of
some territorial disputes if the two sides fail to solve them by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Cyprus government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou hoped Papandreau's visit
will develop in the spirit of last month's EU summit agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Papandreou paid an unofficial visit to Turkey in October when he gave a
series of conferences in Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Bid for Warner-Lambert Doubted  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street on Wednesday downplayed the chances that
consumer products titan Procter &AMP; Gamble would make a white-knight bid for drug
maker Warner-Lambert. Instead, skeptical investors brushed off reports of
high-level talks between the companies as an attempt by Warner-Lambert to
pressure Pfizer to raise its $79 billion hostile takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert Co. were up more than 5 percent in betting that the
raging takeover fight would lead to higher bids.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert said last week that -- despite its $57 billion merger deal
with American Home Products Corp. -- it would talk to Pfizer Inc. about its
richer bid. But executives at Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert also
started knocking on the doors of several rivals in hopes of finding a better
offer, according to two people involved in meetings, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions with Procter &AMP; Gamble have been the most serious. The
Cincinnati-based company also has entertained the idea of acquiring both
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, said one of the sources.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G, with sales of $38 billion, is looking for more profitable products to
complement its established, but slow-growing consumer brands like Tide, Crest
and Pampers.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert not only makes the best-selling anti-cholesterol drug
Lipitor, but also makes a host of consumer goods that would fit nicely under
P&AMP;G's umbrella, including Certs breath mints, Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash,
and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., makes Premarin, a hormone
replacement drug, and over-the-counter aids like Advil and Anacin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Procter &AMP; Gamble has been looking to add to its pharmaceutical business,
which is small, and they have the flexibility to acquire a pharmaceutical
company and have it work," said Michael Kagan, portfolio manager for the Salomon
Brother Fund, which owns shares in P&AMP;G, Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products. "A Warner-Lambert or an American Home Products is a good fit. They
have the pharmaceutical and the consumer products fit."
</P>
<P>
	   But he added "Any responsible CEO is going to have to gulp real hard before
they get involved in a bidding process. I think Pfizer needs (Warner-Lambert)
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Pfizer can hardly afford to lose. New York-based Pfizer has a
co-marketing agreement to sell Warner-Lambert's Lipitor, which is worth billions
to both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you lay out the numbers, it really feels that Pfizer has the upper
hand" over a potential bid from Procter &AMP; Gamble, Jeff Chaffkin, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "There will be more cost savings in the Pfizer-Warner-Lambert than
in P&AMP;G-Warner-Lambert."
</P>
<P>
	   And, ultimately, he added, "Pfizer needs the deal more than P&AMP;G, which means
they'll go much father to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer is best known for its Viagra impotence-treatment drug, but also makes
the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as Visine and BenGay.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the companies declined to comment on the talks, which first were
reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Many pharmaceutical companies are looking for partners to share the expenses
of funding research for new medicines. On Monday, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham announced a $76 billion merger that would create the world's largest
drug company. And last month, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced a $27 billion merger
with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most likely scenario is Warner-Lambert is just putting pressure on
Pfizer to raise its bid," Chaffkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Wednesday, Warner-Lambert said profit for the fourth quarter
jumped 40 percent to $487.3 million, or 55 cents a share, beating estimates by 3
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $3.53 billion, up 16 percent from the $3.04
billion year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of last year, earnings rose to $1.73 billion, or $1.96 a share, from
$1.27 billion, or $1.45 a share. Sales surged 20 percent to $12.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 5:15 p.m. EST, Warner-Lambert's shares rose $4.81 1/4 to $94.81 1/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where P&AMP;G's shares were off $1.25 at $115.37 1/2.
Pfizer's stock was up 50 cents at $37. American Home Product's shares were up
$1.81 1/4 cents to $46.

<HEADLINE> States Pressure Congress on Gas  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight Northeastern states stepped up pressure Wednesday
for Congress to give them greater authority to regulate a gasoline additive that
helps clean the air but is posing a threat to lakes, steams and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   The air pollution control officials from the eight states from New York to
Maine urged Congress, when it reconvenes next week, to move aggressively to lift
a requirement for specific oxygen levels in gasoline and allow states more
leeway to regulate MTBE, the oxygen additive now widely used.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, was the additive of choice for the
petroleum industry as it sought to comply with federal requirements to have at
last 2 percent oxygen in gasoline in areas with major air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called reformulated gasoline, which includes MTBE, is used in all or
part of 16 states and accounts for a third of the gasoline sold in the country,
including much of the gasoline sold in the Northeast. Its use reduces releases
of smog-causing and toxic chemicals into the air from automobile tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
	   But last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency in a major reversal of
environmental policy, urged that MTBE use be sharply curtailed because of
worries that it is polluting waterways and aquifers used for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   A blue-ribbon advisory panel said that while current levels of MTBE in water
do not pose a health risk -- although some levels of water contamination have
been detected in most states -- the government should abandon its widespread use
of the additive to prevent a potential environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
	   But since the report was issued, Congress has not addressed the issue,
leaving states ``in the unacceptable position of being unable to respond to a
serious public concern,'' said Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast
States for Coordinated Air Use Management.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, based in Boston, represents the eight states' air pollution
control administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said only congressional action ``can provide an adequate solution
to concerns over current levels of MTBE use.'' It said without changes in the
federal law ``states are effectively prohibited from addressing this significant
public concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   For example, said Grumet, Maine no longer participates in the federal
reformulated gasoline program because of concern over MTBE, but oil companies
still can sell gasoline containing MTBE in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the states planned to contact others -- from environmental groups to
members of Congress -- ``in hopes of building a broad and bipartisan coalition''
to push for congressional repeal of the oxygen requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur Rocque Jr., Connecticut's top environmental protection official, said
that the challenge is to find a way to reduce the environmental risks pose by
MTBE, while preserving the air quality improvement benefits of reformulated
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal mandates ... are barriers to that goal,'' said Rocque.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Varney, the commissioner in charge of environmental protection in New
Hampshire, said his state wants the freedom to regulate gasoline content ``to
respond to our region's environmental and economic needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a report last summer, the Boston group representing the region's air
pollution control administrators, said that low levels of MTBE have been found
in 15 percent of the drinking water tested in the Northeast, in most cases less
than 2 parts per billion. Water begins to pose a health concern and tastes or
smells bad at 30 to 70 parts per billion, the report said. About 1 percent of
the water supplies tested in the Northeast had concentrations above 35 parts per
billion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been few health studies conducted on ingesting MTBE, although one
Italian study found that mice, given high levels of MTBE, contracted cancer. The
study has been criticized because of the high doses that were given.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight Northeastern states involved are New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Move Slave Labor Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Veterans who were prisoners of war in World War II
have withdrawn a New Mexico lawsuit accusing Japanese companies of using them as
slave labor, saying they stand a better chance in California, where a state law
supports their cause.
</P>
<P>
	   The California law, enacted last year, allows for such claims by veterans to
be filed until the end of 2010. New Mexico law limits such damage claims to
three or four years after injuries occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, 10 veterans and one civilian sued five companies in federal
court in Albuquerque, saying the companies all were descendants of businesses
that made up the Japanese war machine.
</P>
<P>
	   The ex-POWs sought an apology and compensation for their injuries and labor
while working in mines, shipyards and factories.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs chose the New Mexico court partly because so many Bataan
Death March survivors live in the state. But it quickly became apparent that
California was a preferable venue, and the lawsuit was withdrawn Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The original defendants of the Albuquerque lawsuit are Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, Ltd.; Mitsui and Co. Inc.; Mitsubishi International Corp.; Nippon
Steel Corp.; and Showa Denko and related companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In court documents, the defendants contend the issue of war reparations was
covered in the 1951 peace treaty between the United States and Japan. The
Japanese government and U.S. State Department have supported that view.

<HEADLINE> Police Charge Pa. Lawmaker in Death  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM STRADER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A state lawmaker was charged Wednesday with
vehicular homicide in a hit-and-run that killed a pedestrian last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Thomas Druce, 38, said he left the scene of the July 27 crash after
thinking he struck a sign. Kenneth Cains, 42, was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Druce, a four-term lawmaker from Bucks County, was released on $20,000
unsecured bail. He declined to answer questions after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Druce was charged with vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a fatal
accident, insurance fraud, tampering with evidence, failure to render
assistance, failure to notify police of a fatal accident, careless driving and
driving at an unsafe speed.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted on all charges, he could face a maximum 21 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Druce said that after hitting what he thought was a sign, he drove to the
Capitol about a mile away to check his vehicle for damage. He said he did not
know anyone had been killed until he was notified recently by police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police, however, said the legislator's explanation was inconsistent with
what appeared to be blood, skin, hair found on the Jeep Grand Cherokee he was
driving.
</P>
<P>
	   The sport utility vehicle had been repaired and returned to the dealership
where Druce had leased it. He said he turned it in and started a lease on a new
vehicle Aug. 3 to avoid charges for high mileage.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation had stalled until police received an anonymous tip
recently about the leased Jeep and Druce's whereabouts on the day Cains was
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   A witness said the vehicle was speeding and that the driver turned a corner
and left the scene after the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Druce, a Republican from Warminster, just outside Philadelphia,
said he would take responsibility for what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very tragic accident,'' Druce told The Intelligencer Record of
Doylestown. ``There was nothing malicious on my part. I was the driver of the
vehicle. I must take responsibility, and I intend to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, killing three students, injuring 62 and sending
terrified, bleary-eyed students crawling in pajamas through choking smoke into
the freezing cold outside.
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned at the Roman Catholic university,
including one who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 prank alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. Investigators are interview people
"who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge. Campolo
declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have caused the fire.
Smoking is prohibited in dorm lounges and hallways but permitted in certain
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said. Their names were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one of the 55 fire extinguishers in
the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected recently and
were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was extinguished quickly. Three female students walked out of the
dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
the university planned a service for the dead later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was
a home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old males were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine and they are very heavily sedated," Mansour
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<HEADLINE> White House Creates Drug Guidelines  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office has set guidelines to
clarify its arrangement with broadcasters who want government financial credits
for inserting anti-drug messages into their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new rules, the government will not review program episodes for
such credits until after the episodes have aired or been published. The office
also said it would keep separate its process for granting financial credits from
its role in advising networks and producers on how to portray situations
involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the change should put ``the
program on a track where it will get universal support.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've revised their policy to no longer look at scripts or do changes in
programming for credit before a program is finished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The office was responding to recent fallout from the disclosure that the
government used financial incentives to get TV networks to include anti-drug
messages into their shows, in some cases even reviewing the scripts before the
programs aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement has been criticized by some as government intrusion on the
independence of networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines set out Tuesday are an effort ``to eliminate any
misunderstandings and prevent any inference of federal intrusion in the creative
process,'' said Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new parameters still require a 100 percent match for every dollar the
federal government spends on media outlets and continue to allow broadcast
executives to decide how to meet this requirement. Namely, networks can still
receive financial credit for the content of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the drug office said it would still make available scientific
and technical experts to the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have forged a strong partnership with the entertainment and media
community and look forward to continuing to strengthen those ties,'' said
McCaffrey. The office plans to periodically seek the advice of the entertainment
industry on the credit process as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial spot bought by
the government with a free one. Since the program started, however, the
government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as the
networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that evaluation will take place after the programs have been aired,
according to the office.
</P>
<P>
	   Network executives said any guidelines that more clearly defined the
relationship between the media outlets and the government would be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it can only help in clarifying how the process works,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Shirley Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also asserted that NBC never did anything it considered
inappropriate. In cases where the network did send the drug office scripts for
shows, those programs already were complete, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scripts ``were never sent for approval or input,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Fox and CBS declined to comment immediately, saying they hadn't
yet reviewed the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce Committee's
telecommunications panel, still wants to hold hearings on the matter this
spring, despite the establishment of the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to allow the federal government to become a censor,'' said
Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Fed Revises Announcement Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to clear up confusion in financial markets, the
Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it was putting in place a new disclosure
policy on the information it will release following its regular deliberations to
set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new process, which will take effect at the next Fed meeting Feb.
1-2, the central bank will announce at the end of its deliberations how Fed
policy-makers view the balance of risks facing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statement will replace the old policy directive, also known as the
policy bias, which expressed whether the central bank was leaning toward raising
rates or cutting them or holding rates steady.
</P>
<P>
	   In the place of the policy directive on rates, the Fed said it will release
a statement that attempts to summarize the central bank's views without linking
those views to any specific change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statement will be issued after every meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, the group of Fed board members in Washington and central bank
presidents from the Fed's 12 regional banks, who meet eight times a year to set
interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed is concerned about inflation, the statement will say that ``the
committee believes that the risks are weighted toward conditions that may
generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
	   If those concerns continued, the Fed could be expected to raise interest
rates at future meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed is worried about spreading economic weakness, which it could
fight by lowering interest rates to spur increased business activity, the
statement would say, ``the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly
toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FOMC might also adopt a statement saying that future economic risks are
equally balanced, the status the Fed is always striving to obtain, meaning that
there would be no change in rates either up or down.

<HEADLINE> Challenge Comes in Fla. Death Law  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL KACZOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A new state law designed to limit death penalty
appeals to shorten the time between conviction and execution drew a legal
challenge Wednesday, five days after Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-nine death row inmates are challenging the Death Penalty Reform Act of
2000 in the Florida Supreme Court. The suit was filed on their behalf by Neal A.
Dupree, who works for one of three regional state agencies that handle
post-conviction appeals for Florida death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit maintains the law changes court rules and procedures that are the
sole responsibility of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates also allege the statute violates due process, equal protection
and other constitutional rights and principles ``too numerous to catalogue in a
short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
	   In its zeal to strap convicts ``onto a gurney and `rock and roll' in
Florida's lethal injection chamber, the Legislature has abdicated its
constitutional responsibilities and ensured that the death penalty process in
Florida will be mired in yet more legal challenges,'' the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates asked the Florida justices to overturn the law and reinstate the
court rules it repealed. They also want all appeals delayed until the challenge
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's press secretary, Liz Hirst, declined to comment, saying the
governor's office had not yet received a copy of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The new law limits death row inmates to two appeals in state courts in most
cases, and the second appeal must be filed within six months of the first
appeal. One exception is cases in which the inmate claims innocence rather than
appealing on a technicality.

	   ``A small group of approximately 20 people could, because of their position
(as Reform Party leaders), literally destroy the party,'' National Chairman Jack
Gargan said Wednesday from Florida, referring to supporters of party founder
Ross Perot. ``If we could get rid of those 20 people, that would solve
everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not likely, said the No. 2 official on the executive committee, vice
chairman Gerald Moan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tell Jack it is none of our faults that we got elected,'' Moan said from
his home in Arizona. ``He is not the kingmaker and he has to realize that. If he
doesn't, then the members will take the appropriate action, which would be his
removal.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's a relatively polite exchange between the two camps, considering the
fiery e-mail and telephone conference calls during which the party's 11-member
executive committee conducts party business -- or tries to.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan and his supporters hung up on a telephonic executive board session
Tuesday night after it devolved from planning the face-to-face meeting in
Nashville on Feb. 12 to yet another blowup over rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee nonetheless approved the meeting, at which the Reform Party's
National Committee will vote, once and for all, on the most hard-fought issue
separating the sides: Where to hold their national convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan and his supporters want the convention held in the home state of the
party's highest-ranking official, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Moan, who scoffs
at Ventura's clout, wants it held in Long Beach, Calif. Each side claims a
legitimate vote has been taken supporting their plan, and that they have signed
contracts for convention sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The seemingly petty issue has taken on huge significance as the sides drift
farther apart over more and more disputes -- mostly over insults and different
interpretations of party rules and procedure. Gangs of Reform Party members from
each side are even trying to gather enough support to oust Gargan and Moan.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Committee, composed of three members from each state, will vote
in Nashville on the convention site, officials on both sides confirmed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But, like virtually everything else about the Reform Party, even that vote
is likely to be disputed. Several seat-holders who represent states like
Connecticut and New Jersey have been challenged by Gargan's supporters who say
they were wrongly awarded.
</P>
<P>
	   It's enough for members to wonder if the party will be paralyzed in the
presidential election. That concern is the only item on which the sides agree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that we'll do nothing but continue the open warfare,''
said Moan, a Perot loyalist. ``Everybody's annoyed at all of us for not getting
together.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could become very bad for the party,'' Gargan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Verney, Gargan's predecessor and a Perot employee, said he knew of
no action the Texas tycoon has taken to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the wrangling, the Reform Party and its $12.6 million in federal
matching funds have drawn high profile prospects for its presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform candidate Pat Buchanan's crusade for votes and money took him to
Arizona's border with Mexico on Wednesday as part of a two-day push for
immigration controls. Buchanan plans to attend the Florida Reform Party's state
convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A likely opponent, billionaire developer Donald Trump, will not attend, but
reached out to party leaders in the same state last Friday with a reception at
his swank Palm Beach club. Trump, if he decides to run, will announce his bid
around Feb. 15 at Trump Tower in New York, and spend $100 million of his own
money on the campaign. He would use a tenth of that amount -- or $10 million --
to fight Buchanan for the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court upholds conviction of woman in controversial drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld the conviction
of a Detroit woman whose case generated a national furor when a judge first
threw out the evidence against her then changed his mind after criticism from
the White House.
<P>
	   In ruling, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge
Harold Baer Jr. did not error by refusing to recuse himself from the case or by
changing his mind and restoring evidence against Carol Bayless after the
controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court also said it did not decide the most difficult issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not determine when, if ever, criticism of an unpopular decision
becomes so severe as to constitute grounds for recusal of the judge who made
that decision," it wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The case stemmed from the April 21, 1995 arrest of Mrs. Bayless, 44, in the
Washington Heights section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   She was arrested after police stopped her rental car and found $4 million in
drugs, including 75 pounds of cocaine and 4 1/2 pounds of heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   Baer, appointed for life in 1994 by President Clinton, sparked a national
debate when he tossed out the evidence, finding that police in Washington
Heights had arrested Mrs. Bayless improperly.
</P>
<P>
	   Baer said it was not unusual for civilians to flee police in a community
damaged by police corruption. He added, "What I find shattering is that in this
day and age blacks in black neighborhoods and blacks in white neighborhoods can
count on little security for their person."
</P>
<P>
	   Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other House Republicans called on
Clinton to seek Baer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry called the ruling "wrongheaded" and said
Clinton could ask for Baer's resignation. Later, the White House retreated,
saying it supported an independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Amidst the uproar, four senior judges for the appeals court in Manhattan
even took the unusual step of writing a statement saying the idea of removing
Baer "threaten to weaken the constitutional structure of this nation."
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of federal prosecutors, Baer then held an unusual second
hearing on the admissibility of the evidence in the case and reversed himself,
saying police acted properly.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ruling against Mrs. Bayless, her lawyers said Baer should have
withdrawn from the case because of the political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the appeals court said Baer was "forced to decide whether to
disqualify himself when doing so could readily have been perceived as a
capitulation to political pressure - a capitulation, moreover, that might well
have encouraged such pressure on judges in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said it was also proper of Baer to uphold the arrest,
finding that the men who loaded the defendant's car with drugs acted oddly,
behavior which "makes factors such as the high-crime neighborhood and flight
more significant."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bayless is now free after serving a 4 1/2 year prison sentence. She
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other drug charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for her did not immediately return a phone message for comment on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Flextronics Buying Cabletron  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Cabletron Systems Inc. said Wednesday it has reached
an agreement for Flextronics International Ltd. to take over its manufacturing
operations in New Hampshire and Ireland in a deal valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal concerns Cabletron's manufacturing and repair plants and inventory
in Rochester and Limerick, Ireland.	   Cabletron stock was up 25 cents Wednesday
to $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Flextronics stock also improved 25
cents to $45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Flextronics, which is based in Singapore and has its main U.S. offices in
San Jose, Calif., has also promised to hire 1,000 Cabletron employees who work
at the plants. Cabletron will then contract with Flextronics to manufacture its
computer networking products.
</P>
<P>
	   Flextronics also promised to make a substantial investment in the plants,
where it could manufacture computer components for other companies as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabletron Chief Executive Piyush Patel said the deal completes Cabletron's
plan to get out of manufacturing and focus on its core business: designing and
installing top networking systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel said the partnership also would enable Cabletron to get its products
to market faster, while improving quality and cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, Cabletron announced a similar deal to sell its Rochester plant
to Celestica Inc., of Toronto, but scaled back the arrangement three months
later.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Cabletron said Celestica would only manufacture about 40 percent of
its products at an existing Celestica plant in Exeter. Meanwhile, Cabletron kept
the Rochester plant open while it looked for other vendors.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the last decade, Cabletron was a major player in the network
hubs market, selling the powerful processors that link computers and related
equipment into one local network.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1997, its stock began to slide as hubs became obsolete, replaced by
faster routers and switches that transmit data across networks. Companies like
Cisco Systems that jumped on the new technology grew by leaps and bounds, while
Cabletron's stock fell to just above $7 per share early last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Cabletron bought Yago Systems, which designs advanced routing devices.
Its "layer 3" switches are cheaper and faster than earlier products and work
especially well over Internet systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Its stock has climbed steadily since co-founder Craig Benson stepped down as
chief executive last June and promoted Patel, former chief executive of Yago, to
the job.

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, killing three students, injuring 62 and sending
terrified, bleary-eyed students crawling in pajamas through choking smoke into
the freezing cold outside.
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned at the Roman Catholic university,
including one who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 prank alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. Investigators are interview people
"who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge. Campolo
declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have caused the fire.
Smoking is prohibited in dorm lounges and hallways but permitted in certain
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. Their home
towns were not released.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one of the 55 fire extinguishers in
the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected recently and
were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was extinguished quickly. Three female students walked out of the
dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
the university planned a service for the dead later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was
a home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old males were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine and they are very heavily sedated," Mansour
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<HEADLINE> Russia Steps Up War on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military redoubled its drive to conquer
Chechen rebels on Wednesday, with troops fighting street by street in the
capital Grozny while helicopter gunships and cannons relentlessly pounded the
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, Russia's deputy chief commander in Chechnya,
announced Wednesday that the war was expected to be over by Feb. 26, although
``nobody is giving the forces any firm deadlines for ending the operation,'' the
Interfax news agency reported. He did not explain how he arrived at that date.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal forces pushed toward the center of Grozny from several directions,
trying to squeeze rebel fighters into an ever-tightening circle, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was impossible to verify the army's claims of progress. Reporters are
constrained from moving freely about the capital because of the danger and the
restrictions imposed by both the Russian and Chechen sides.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Associated Press reporter watched Wednesday as Russian forces in a
northwestern neighborhood called Mikrorayon-3 seized several shell-punctured,
five-story apartment buildings. They failed to take nearby nine-story buildings,
from which Chechen snipers kept up a steady barrage of bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's military command said 23 soldiers were killed and about 50 wounded
in the past three days of fighting in Grozny, the ORT television channel
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian jets rained bombs on the city throughout the day, sending deafening
roars echoing through empty streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny has been a bastion of rebel resistance throughout the war, which has
entered its fifth month, and its capture would give the Russian forces a boost
after a series of surprise counterattacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   But control over Grozny could backfire, as it did during the 1994-96
bloodshed in Chechnya. During that war, Russians took the city and held it for
more than a year, but lost it to the Chechens in a humiliating and bloody
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   After facing relatively little resistance in Chechnya's northern lowlands,
Russian forces have been stalled at Grozny for months and only recently began
pressing into rebel strongholds in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, the Russian bureau of Interpol issued an international arrest
warrant for Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev and 79 other rebels, saying they may
try to flee to neighboring countries, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The list included Chechens suspected of bombing apartment buildings in
Moscow and other Russian cities in August, killing about 300 people, and
militants who took part in an incursion into the neighboring region of Dagestan.
Russian security forces moved into Chechnya following these events, saying they
had to halt terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Gordiyenko, head of Russia's Interpol branch, said all the wanted
men are now in southern parts of Chechnya beyond the front lines of Russia's
army, but ``some of them might turn up in Azerbaijan, Georgia or Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Russian helicopter gunships and artillery pounded the steep,
wooded mountain slopes near the mouth of the strategic Argun Gorge, about 30
miles south of Grozny. An AP reporter took shelter behind some rocks on the edge
of the village of Dachu-Borzoi as helicopters swooped down to strafe the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven civilians were killed Tuesday in an air raid against Dachu-Borzoi,
including seven members of the family of local administrator Alu Khasayev.
</P>
<P>
	   At the edge of the nearby village of Duba-Yurt, a knot of elders crowded
around Russian officers on Wednesday, pleading for an end to shelling. Adam
Akhyazov, chief administrator of the village, said three civilians had been
killed in Duba-Yurt over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When people want to leave the village, the Russians prevent them,
promising not to target the village,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a pro-Moscow Chechen leader claimed Wednesday to be mediating in
talks between several Chechen warlords and federal authorities. Malik
Saidullayev said the talks were proceeding ``with difficulty,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. He refused to say which federal agencies were involved in
the alleged negotiations or to name the Chechen commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The federal authorities) need to carry out a political dialogue with
these people, which is what I'm doing,'' Saidullayev told Echo of Moscow radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov confirmed that four Chechens had
arrived in Moscow for talks on conditions for civilians in the breakaway
republic, but said they did not constitute an official delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations are held continually,'' Korotkov told the AP. ``As for these
envoys, we don't know whom they represent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops marched into Chechnya in late September after rebels staged
armed incursions into the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan and allegedly
organized the bombing of several apartment buildings, which killed about 300
people.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Warn on La Nina  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unusual weather driven by La Nina cooling in the Pacific
Ocean may be part of a larger, longer-lasting climate shift, researchers said
Wednesday after analyzing new satellite data.
</P>
<P>
	   If the interpretation is correct, the Southern states, as well as the
Southwest, could be in for 20 years or more of mild and relatively dry winters
while the Pacific Northwest and the East could get socked by strong winter
storms.
</P>
<P>
	   Measurements of sea surface temperature show warm water has been developing
for the last 1 1/2 years in the North, West and South Pacific. La Nina and El
Nino, its warmer cousin, affect water only near the equator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The persistence of ... warmer and colder than average ocean temperatures,
tells us there is much more than an isolated La Nina occurring in the Pacific
Ocean,'' said William Patzert, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacific Ocean's surface water temperature is a dominant force behind
storm intensity as well as the path of the jet stream. The new satellite data
suggest a shift in the water temperatures. Every 20 years or so, dominant warm
or cool water flip-flops for reasons still unclear, changing weather, especially
in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   One result of the shifts is that conditions favor either El Nino or La Nina.
Since the 1970s, the ocean has been in what is called a positive phase, marked
by warm surface water in the tropics and cooler water in the North Pacific. El
Ninos are more common.
</P>
<P>
	   But many experts argue it's too early to make any conclusions. The unusual
ocean temperatures may be from a lingering La Nina and not necessarily a sign
the Pacific is entering a negative phase of cool tropical water and warm North
Pacific temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The point is it won't be for another 10 years before we can say with
confidence that we've undergone a regime shift,'' said Wayne Higgins, senior
meteorologist at the U.S. Climate Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   David Battisti, atmospheric sciences professor at the University of
Washington, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not at all clear that the pattern that is seen this particular
winter is part of a decadal change, he said.

<HEADLINE> Campaigns have raised $20 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Setting a scorching pace in what is likely to be one of
the most expensive Senate races ever, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign
committee said Wednesday that it had raised $12 million in 1999, and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's committee said it had collected $8 million in six
months.
<P>
	   If the two continue raising money this fast, their tallies will dwarf the
amount raised in the 1997 contest between Al D'Amato and Sen. Chuck Schumer, who
raised a combined $38 million over the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani figures are especially startling because just weeks ago
Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said the goal for the entire campaign
against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to raise $15 million to $20
million. Additionally, Giuliani has gone on relatively few fundraising trips and
has only a bare-bones campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're certainly encouraged by the exceptional fund raising," said
Teitelbaum, whose fundraising goal for 1999 had been $8 million. "But given the
Clinton pledge of raising well over $25 million, we expect their fundraising
machine to raise considerably more than we've been able to raise."
</P>
<P>
	   Bill de Blasio, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said he was happy about the
first lady's numbers because the Giuliani team got a head start in the
fundraising race and the Clinton campaign accepted donations of only $1,000 or
less until October 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're particularly pleased because we started only a few months ago," he
said. "The response has been fantastic."
</P>
<P>
	   De Blasio said he was not surprised at Giuliani's fundraising prowess.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expected him to be very competitive," he said. "The mayor has clearly
tapped into a national network of well-funded right-wing donors intent on
keeping Hillary Clinton's progressive policies from the Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani campaign however, said that a total of 90,000 donors gave an
average of $110, and 63 percent of those donors gave $100 or less.
</P>
<P>
	   A list of donors from either campaign was not available Wednesday. Both
campaigns are required to report their 1999 fundraising totals to the Federal
Elections Commission by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're going to see here in the end is both sides raising $25 million
in this thing," said Lee Miringoff, polling director for Marist Institute of
Public Opinion. "What makes it particularly interesting is that even though it
is an open Senate seat, they are like two incumbents in a way."
</P>
<P>
	   Currently the Clinton campaign has $4.5 million to $5 million on hand, while
the Giuliani campaign - which has spent heavily on direct mail operations - has
about $7 million to $8 million.

<HEADLINE> Plenty of blame to spread around in auto emissions dilemma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - So who is to blame?
<P>
	   Angry motorists have endured woefully long lines since a new enhanced auto
emissions test was implemented a little more than a month ago. Each day seems to
bring a new problem: computer glitches, not enough workers on the job,
malfunctioning machines, frozen hoses gumming up the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Through it all, Gov. Christie Whitman has grown from angry to really angry
to really, really angry at the private contractor her administration hired to
operate the centralized inspection lanes.
</P>
<P>
	   As New Jersey drivers fume, Whitman points the finger of blame directly at
Parsons Infrastructure and Technology. This places Parsons spokesman Carl
Golden, Whitman's former chief spokesman, in the uncomfortable position of
having to respond to his former boss.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden says he understands Whitman's anger. He acknowledges the firm hired
to a $400 million, seven-year contract to remake the auto inspection process in
the name of cleaning the air has struggled mightily.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is plenty of blame to spread around in New Jersey's car inspection
dilemma. Nearly everyone involved - the contractor, the federal government,
lawmakers, Whitman, state officials of the distant past - had a spot on the
assembly line that created this lemon.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons so far hasn't lived up to its promise to implement the auto
inspection system smoothly at 32 centralized stations. The company pledges to
fix things by hiring more workers and de-glitching new equipment that now tests
for asthma-causing smog. Whitman vows to deduct $580,000 from Parsons' payments,
saying long delays at stations violate the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The company went after the big bucks contract in 1998 even though it stayed
out when New Jersey bid the contract a year earlier. At that time, Parsons
officials said they felt there was no way the company could meet the Whitman
administration's strict timetable set in the bid. After the only bid submitted
that year was rejected by the Whitman administration, Parsons then submitted the
lone 1998 bid, even though the timetable was even tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   That strict timetable has been cited as one reason for the troubles.
Division of Motor Vehicles Director Richard Kamin says the sophisticated new
testing system was never allowed to go through a "shakedown run" because it had
to start Dec. 13 to stop the federal Environmental Protection Agency from
siphoning federal highway funds.
</P>
<P>
	   That deadline, however, didn't come overnight at the whim of the EPA. The
feds had already given New Jersey about five years' worth of extensions. During
that time, Whitman struggled with federal officials, and lawmakers from both
parties did all they could to delay implementation. Politics in car-crazy New
Jersey infused the issue at every step.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Clean Air Act was signed in 1990, New Jersey officials figured
they could meet federal environmental mandates with a tougher emissions tests on
cars. That decision, first made by Democratic Gov. Jim Florio, was later
accepted by Whitman.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in Whitman's first term, Democrats - whose party has generally been
more sympathetic to environmental causes - decided this was an issue they could
use against a popular governor. They took a party position that the plan would
do nothing but harm New Jersey drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican lawmakers who oppose federal mandates had to be cajoled by
Whitman to accept the plan. But they later gained an 18-month delay from Whitman
when the politics became too heated. That steamed the EPA, and pushed New Jersey
higher on their list of states to sanction.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA, however, gave fuel to the politicians' proclivity for
procrastination by first pushing an even tougher test and then changing the
rules when other states rejected it. Pennsylvania, for example, installed a
testing system and then scrapped it, at a cost of $145 million.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey then lost nearly two full years because of the cumbersome bidding
process that stalled the test during Whitman's 1997 re-election year. Another
two months were lost when lawmakers had questions about Parsons and held
hearings about the contract they had previously given the Whitman administration
the power to sign. Whitman had earlier made the decision that hiring a private
company was the way to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons now says the administration must share some of the blame, charging
late changes ordered by the state after the contract was signed led to some of
the computer problems.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also the role of lawmakers from yesteryear. More than 60 years ago,
the state decided New Jersey motorists would get the unusual perk of having free
car inspections at centralized stations. That led to generations of drivers
growing up with the belief that a free car inspection was the one state service
they could count on. It also meant few motorists pay to get their inspections at
private garages.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, tax dollars pay for the "free inspections." And the expensive new
equipment has forced the price of an inspection at a private garage even higher,
putting even more pressure on those ever-growing lines at the centralized lanes.

<HEADLINE> FCC Likely To OK Small Stations  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are poised to move ahead with a plan
that would create at least 1,000 low-power FM stations run by community groups,
churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal expected to win approval Thursday by the Federal Communications
Commission would mark one of the most significant changes in FM radio in
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   It would let groups obtain noncommercial licenses for 10-watt and 100-watt
stations and tailor their broadcasts to the interests of people in their
listening areas.
</P>
<P>
	   One strong proponent is the FCC chairman, Bill Kennard, who hopes the plan
would allow for greater diversity on the airwaves at a time when the media
industry is consolidating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The airwaves can accommodate lots of voices,'' Kennard said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes the low-power stations ``will allow some of these nontraditional
voices to speak to their community.''
</P>
<P>
	   For example, high schools could set up their own radio stations or local
broadcasters could serve non-English speaking groups or distinct musical
interests in their regions, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 100-watt station, using a 100-foot antenna, could serve a 7-mile area,
according to FCC officials. Smaller stations of 10 watts would cover a 4-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard estimates these power levels will allow for at least 1,000 new
stations to spring up around the country. The plan will contain some limitations
on the number of licenses a single entity can own and will have some
requirements to ensure that license holders have a base in the local community,
according to Kennard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to maximize the opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan has faced opposition from commercial broadcasters, who fear
low-power stations will interfere with existing FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Broadcasters and others have commissioned
studies to document what they say would be the degradation in service to
listeners that could result from such low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've provided what we believe is unassailable evidence that low-power
stations will add to the interference on an already congested radio band,''
association spokesman Dennis Wharton said. ``Thousands of people won't be able
to hear their hometown radio stations because of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard has said he would not do anything to interfere with standard FM
service. The FCC as well as other low-power radio proponents have commissioned
their own studies and say they are confident low-power stations can coexist with
full-power FM stations -- that can range from 6,000 watts to 100,000 watts.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to help regular FM stations grow and become financially solid,
the FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio stations around 1978. But once
the commission offered a proposal to reintroduce low-power stations last year,
it was flooded with thousands of comments from interested parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups like the Louisiana Music Commission say low-power stations could
showcase the diverse regional music offerings, from cajun to swamp pop to jazz,
and build regional support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of Louisiana music falls through the cracks because of commercial
radio programming,'' said Steve Picou, assistant director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Public interest groups say they will welcome the opportunity for more people
to have access to the airwaves, but stress that it's only one step.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish this could address all of the concerns about mass media
consolidation,'' said Cheryl Leanza of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm. ``It's a meaningful step, but it's certainly not a complete
answer.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pakistan PM Charged With Crimes  </HEADLINE>
   By ZAHID HUSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- An anti-terrorist court charged Pakistan's ousted
prime minister with kidnapping, hijacking and terrorism Wednesday, more than
three months after an army coup ended civilian rule in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Nawaz Sharif and his six codefendants pleaded innocent to the charges, which
also included attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif countered that coup leader Gen. Pervez Musharaf had staged the
hijacking of an airplane Oct. 12 and in the process ``hijacked democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 26 in the southern city of Karachi. All
but the attempted murder charge carry the death penalty or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The army had originally accused Sharif of treason, but the court did not
include that charge. There was no explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants are accused of barring a commercial airliner with Musharraf
among the 198 people on board from landing in Karachi. Musharraf now rules
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Pakistan International Airlines plane did land, it allegedly had
only seven minutes of fuel remaining. By that time, the army was in charge and
Sharif was in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   In court Wednesday, Sharif accused Musharraf of staging the hijacking as a
ploy to justify the end to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was Gen. Musharraf who not only hijacked the plane, but he hijacked
democracy in Pakistan,'' he said. ``He unlawfully put a prime minister under
detention. I was detained without being charged or without a trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif arrived at the courthouse in an armored personnel carrier amid tight
security. Musharraf's army-led government has promised to ensure that the trial
is ``open, transparent and fair'' and the hearing was held in a large venue to
allow observers, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-terrorist courts were set up by Sharif during his tenure to hand out
quick justice and to avoid the lengthy delays in Pakistan's traditional legal
system. The courts' judges are expected to try to finish cases within seven
days.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die, 58 Hurt in Seton Hall Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Fire broke out at a university dormitory early
Wednesday as hundreds slept, killing three people, injuring 62 and sending
terrified students crawling in pajamas through smoke into the freezing cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Six Seton Hall University students were critically burned. One of them
suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 residents of Boland Hall went back to sleep when they first
heard the alarm about 4:30 a.m., thinking it was another in a string of 18 false
alarms set off in the six-floor building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   But many soon heard screams for help and smelled the smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I opened the door just to check,'' Yatin Patel said. ``All the ceiling
tiles were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was panic. Everybody was just, `Go! Go! Go!''' said Nicole McFarlane,
19. She was treated for exposure because she left her room in only a short
nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The tragedy cast a pall of grief over the campus of the Roman Catholic
school 15 miles southwest of New York City. Classes for the 10,000 students were
canceled for the week. A memorial service was planned for later Wednesday.
Sports events also were postponed through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's not much you can say at this time,'' said Newark Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick, who came to offer support. ``We're glad we're people of
faith. The mystery of God's work is always a great mystery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Patel, who lives on the third floor down the hall from the lounge where the
blaze broke out, said he put a wet towel under his door, kicked out his window
screens and threw his mattresses on the ground in case he had to jump.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two students did jump, witnesses said. Tim Van Wie, 18, of
Flanders, said a friend jumped from the third floor and suffered a broken wrist
and sprained ankle. Others tied sheets together to climb down from the windows,
but firefighters arrived and rescued them by ladder.
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one fellow student shivering in a T-shirt and boxers,
his skin completely blackened by burns. ``His skin was, like, smoking,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the three male students killed were found in the lounge and the other
was found in a bedroom nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. Their home
towns were not released. Two firefighters and two police officers were among
those hurt. The injuries ranged from exposure and smoke inhalation to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze was largely confined to the lounge. Students said they frequently
saw people smoking in the lounge, even though it is prohibited in lounges and
hallways.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo said he did not have any
information about whether the fire was suspicious. He would not comment on
whether careless smoking may have caused the blaze. The Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms was assisting in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a painstaking investigation,'' he said. ``We are taking
statements from individuals who may have witnessed the fire or the moments
leading up to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and extinguishers
but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before they were
required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire hoses inside the building had been disconnected because the equipment
was obsolete, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The smoke alarms and extinguishers had passed inspection recently and at
least one extinguisher was used during the blaze, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students lined up in the student center to
comfort each other and call parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Three roommates on the ground floor slept through the fire and were not
hurt. They woke up more than two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them, Erica McGlone, 18, peeked out her window and startled a
firefighter outside. ``We said, `Like, excuse me, sir, what's going on?' And he
said, `Get out.' They came in and dragged us out of there,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 30s, 40s Film Star Hedy Lamarr Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Hedy Lamarr, the exotic, dark-haired beauty who
epitomized sultry glamour in a string of films in the 1930s and '40s with
leading men like Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, was found dead in her home
Wednesday. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austrian-born Miss Lamarr was once billed as the world's most beautiful
woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Her pale skin, almond eyes and dark hair gave her an exotic look, and her
films included ``Tortilla Flat,'' in which she played a woman who was
part-Mexican; ``White Cargo,'' playing the slave woman Tondelayo; and ``Lady of
the Tropics.''
</P>
<P>
	   But she claimed to scorn the glamorous image. In a 1942 Associated Press
interview, she showed a reporter her house, complete with hen house and homemade
curtains, and implored: ``Now you will not write I am a glamour girl?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any girl can be glamorous,'' she once said. ``All you have to do is stand
still and look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among Miss Lamarr's leading men were William Powell (``Crossroads,'' ``The
Heavenly Body''); Tracy (``Boom Town,'' ``Tortilla Flat''); Gable (``Comrade
X,'' also in ``Boom Town''); Robert Taylor (``Lady of the Tropics''); and Ray
Milland (``Copper Canyon'').
</P>
<P>
	   She was reputedly producer Hal Wallis' first choice for the heroine Ilsa in
the 1943 classic ``Casablanca,'' the part that eventually went to Ingrid
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
	   She first achieved international fame and notoriety as a result of the 1933
Czech film ``Ecstasy,'' in which she acted in a steamy love scene and appeared
nude in a 10-minute swimming sequence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood was decades away from such frankness, but it knew a beautiful face
and it knew the value of the publicity ``Ecstasy'' engendered.
</P>
<P>
	   After a few years away from the camera as the wife of Fritz Mandl, an
Austrian munitions magnate, Miss Lamarr was signed by MGM and brought to the
United States in 1937. Her real name was Hedwig Kiesler, and her screen name was
said to be an homage to the 1920s screen beauty Barbara La Marr.
</P>
<P>
	   Her American film debut came in 1938 with ``Algiers,'' co-starring Charles
Boyer. She played a wealthy adventurer and became a box-office sensation despite
grousing by Boyer that she couldn't act.
</P>
<P>
	   In its review, the show biz paper Variety disagreed. ``She brings to the
picture an abundance of good looks, acting talent and enticement,'' its review
said, praising her mastery of English and adding that with a little
encouragement, ``nothing apparently stands between her and success in Hollywood
films.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of her most successful films was the 1949 ``Samson and Delilah,''
directed by Cecil B. DeMille, with Victor Mature as Samson. She got a rare
chance to try her hand at comedy in ``My Favorite Spy,'' a 1951 Bob Hope film.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was one of the most beautiful women in film and a great pleasure to
work with,'' Hope said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her career faded in the mid-'50s, when she appeared in some Italian
productions. Her last film was ``The Female Animal'' with Jane Powell in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her career suffered because she wouldn't sleep with a VIP just to
get ahead. ``My problem is I'm a hell of a nice dame,'' she said in a 1970
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lurid 1966 autobiography ``Ecstasy and Me,'' filled with sexy anecdotes,
some of them involving other women, became a best seller. But she later sued,
saying the manuscript prepared by the ghostwriter was full of distortions and
errors.
</P>
<P>
	   Another side of her was described in the 1992 book ``Feminine Ingenuity.''
Drawing on her knowledge of military products that she picked up while married
to Mandl, Lamarr came up with the idea of a radio signaling device that would
reduce the danger of detection or jamming. She and a friend, composer George
Antheil, developed the idea further and received a patent in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   The method was not used at the time, during World War II, but since the
'80s, high-tech versions of the concept, called ``spread spectrum,'' have been
used in some cordless phones, military radios and wireless computer links.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Lamarr is a ``huge part of the history of this industry,'' Proxim Inc.
chief executive David C. King told The Wall Street Journal in 1997. His company
introduced a circuit board with spread spectrum in 1989 and later put out
hundreds of products using the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The daughter of a banker, Miss Lamarr was born on Nov. 9, 1913, although
some references say 1914 or 1915. Discovered as a teen-ager by Austrian director
Max Reinhardt, she began in films as a script secretary and bit player.
</P>
<P>
	   She was married and divorced six times -- to Mandl, screenwriter Gene
Markey, actor John Loder, nightclub owner Ernest Stauffer, oil millionaire W.
Howard Lee, and lawyer Lewis W. Boies Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, Anthony and
Denise.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of shoplifting arrests -- neither of which resulted in convictions --
caused headlines in her later years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sick and tired of being in the limelight,'' Miss Lamarr told a New
York radio station after the second incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, the once-celebrated movie queen lived quietly in a four-bedroom
house in a middle-class subdivision in Orlando. Neighbors said they only saw her
when she retrieved her mail under the cover of night, grasping a cane in one
hand and a flashlight in the other.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: FCC Must Explain Action  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker challenged federal regulators Wednesday to
explain how a recent decision involving religious broadcasters will not suppress
their freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La., asked for answers to 33 questions on a commission ruling he fears could
restrict the content of religious programming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, I do not understand how the new policy can possibly be squared
with our nation's traditional commitment to freedom of religious expression,''
wrote Tauzin, chairman of the House Commerce Committee's telecommunications
panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy centers on additional guidance offered by the FCC in
December for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for specially reserved
educational TV channels. To qualify for such licenses, the FCC determined that
broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly scheduled air time to
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also said that programming ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs generally would not qualify as 'general educational' programming.'' In a
footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify as ``general
educational'' programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The language has set off a storm of protest among religious broadcasters.
Tauzin is considering holding hearings on the matter this spring, said spokesman
Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Simply put, big brother is casting a big shadow over free speech,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked more broadly about the fallout since the ruling, the FCC's Kennard
said he was worried about misinterpretation of the commission's action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concerned about some of the misunderstanding,'' the chairman said in
an interview. Kennard said he wants to engage in more outreach to help defray
false fears about the decision. He has noted that the ruling does not apply to
the majority of religious broadcasters, who operate on commercial channels.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who do seek special educational station licenses, they only have
to meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Tauzin asked that all five commissioners respond to his queries in
the next two weeks. Among the questions he posed:
</P>
<P>
	   --Why scripture readings which might be part of a worship service do not
contribute to the educational needs of the public?
</P>
<P>
	   --Why did the commission single out religious programming for additional
guidance?
</P>
<P>
	   --What percentage of the population must be interested in a matter before
the FCC will consider a program as serving the community's education and
cultural needs?
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the Pittsburgh religious broadcaster who had sought to acquire an

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Presidential Days Dwindle  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jan. 20. The anniversary of President Clinton's
inauguration and one year to the day when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will certainly mark the day,'' Clinton said Wednesday on the eve of that
benchmark. ``I mean, I'll just be conscious of it in all kinds of little ways.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he does often these days, Clinton took a moment to remark on his waning
time in office with both enthusiasm and a bit of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, when I go in a room in the White House now, I look around more
carefully,'' to make sure he hasn't missed anything for memory, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You'd be amazed when you're living a busy life and you're working really
hard -- I bet it happens to you too -- how many times you walk in and out of a
room and you'll see something in a room that you've been in the room for five
years you never noticed before,'' Clinton mused. ``So, I'm sensitive to all
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview for Thursday editions of the Christian Science Monitor,
Clinton said his last year would be his ``most ambitious'' since his first 12
months in office and that he would offer ``a couple of things that will be quite
new'' in his State of the Union address next week.
</P>
<P>
	   He also suggested that he may grant more pardons this year, despite the
controversy over clemency he gave to several Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Wednesday that he is pleased with the nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So, I'm feeling good and grateful and I just want to milk every last
moment of every day,'' Clinton said. ``The only thing I wish -- I didn't have to
sleep at all for a year. I wish that God would give me the capacity to function
for a year without sleep. That would make me very happy. But I think it highly
unlikely, therefore, I will keep trying to get some.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Revises Announcement Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to clear up confusion in financial markets, the
Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it was putting in place a new disclosure
policy on the information it will release following its regular deliberations to
set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new process, which will take effect at the next Fed meeting Feb.
1-2, the central bank will announce at the end of its deliberations how Fed
policy-makers view the balance of risks facing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statement will replace the old policy directive, also known as the
policy bias, which expressed whether the central bank was leaning toward raising
rates or cutting them or holding rates steady.
</P>
<P>
	   In the place of the policy directive on rates, the Fed said it will release
a statement that attempts to summarize the central bank's views without linking
those views to any specific change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statement will be issued after every meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, the group of Fed board members in Washington and central bank
presidents from the Fed's 12 regional banks, who meet eight times a year to set
interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed is concerned about inflation, the statement will say that ``the
committee believes that the risks are weighted toward conditions that may
generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
	   If those concerns continued, the Fed could be expected to raise interest
rates at future meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed is worried about spreading economic weakness, which it could
fight by lowering interest rates to spur increased business activity, the
statement would say, ``the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly
toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FOMC might also adopt a statement saying that future economic risks are
equally balanced, the status the Fed is always striving to obtain, meaning that
there would be no change in rates either up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr., who headed the working group that
studied the issue, said that the central bank believed the new disclosure policy
would help clear up market confusion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have adjusted the language because we found that markets focused too
much on the probability of a rate change when the goal of the committee was to
convey what risks it perceives in the period ahead,'' Ferguson said in an
interview.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton said he was taking on the burden of
nudging Syria and Israel along their path to peace, and that neither country is
giving up despite the suspension in talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The peace process was on the agenda for a brief Oval Office meeting between
Clinton and the crown prince of Bahrain on Wednesday evening, National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy said. Leavy did not provide specifics about the
15-minute session with Sheikh Sulman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, except to say the
discussion touched on Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Bahrain is a key U.S. ally and is the regional base for the U.S. Navy's 5th
Fleet. It is a major regional financial center for a number of international
banks, oil companies and service companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in New Hampshire, meanwhile, Republican presidential hopeful
George W. Bush said the United States should not impose a Mideast settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no lasting peace if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel
like they must accept an agreement because it makes us happy,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank have been assigned to the
Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and part of Israel's
capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Albright at her home in the
Georgetown section of the capital before seeing Clinton at the White House in
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unhappy With Japan Offer  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed unhappiness
Wednesday with Japan's offers to reduce charges imposed on U.S. and other
foreign telecommunications companies trying to break into the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the Japanese government
is not living up to commitments it made in a deregulation agreement with the
United States in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Japan's proposed action on this issue would adversely affect Japanese
consumers and raises serious questions about Japan's commitment to market
opening deregulation,'' Barshefsky told reporters following two days of meetings
with Japanese officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute concerns how Japan will implement pledges to cut hookup charges
that Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp., the former Japanese government phone
monopoly, imposes on U.S. and other foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher, who led the U.S.
negotiating team, said Japan was proposing ``inadequate'' reductions in those
rates, which are four times higher than similar rates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 agreement was part of a major deregulation effort announced by
President Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher refused to discuss whether the United States would consider bringing
a trade case against Japan before the World Trade Organization. Barshefsky said
that while no further meetings were scheduled in the telephone dispute, she
expected both sides would get together again to try to resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   The telecommunications dispute is just one of a number of trade tensions
between the two nations as America's deficit with Japan has widened considerably
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The two countries are scheduled to meet Feb. 2 to review the whole range of
issues covered under the deregulation talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks, known as the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and
Competition Policy, seek to cut Japanese regulations and make it easier for
American companies to compete for business in Japan in such areas as housing,
retailing, energy and construction standards.

<HEADLINE> Video, Computer Game Sales Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Americans bought far fewer violent video games during
1999, but analysts said that may have more to do with the phenomenal popularity
of "Pokemon" than concern over tragedies such as the Columbine High School
massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of video and computer games with "Mature" ratings for violence,
language or sexual content fell from 2.6 million units in 1998 to 1.2 million in
1999, according to figures compiled by the NPD Group and released Wednesday by
the Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the industry enjoyed robust sales during 1999. The number of copies
of video and PC games rose 20 percent to 215 million. Revenues increased 14
percent to $6.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pokemon" games dominated 1999 sales, with more than 12 million copies sold.
The most popular selling "M" rated game was "Half Life," which sold 495,086
copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamela Eakes, founder of Mothers Against Violence in America, attributed the
shift in part to Pokemon games, based on the animal-like creatures that also
have inspired a popular card game, cartoons and a feature film.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eakes said also she believed parents were paying attention to ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more adult purchasers know what's age appropriate, the smarter
decisions will be," she said. "We can't hold our breath and think we've done it.
We've got to continue to give the best information available to parents," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings at Columbine, in Littleton, Colo., last April prompted a
nationwide debate on the influence of video game violence on young people.
Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and
a teacher on April 20 before killing themselves. In a videotape made before the
rampage, the teens make repeated references to the shoot-'em-up video game Doom.
</P>
<P>
	   Others said the shift in sales most likely was simply the result of game
companies' search for the next big hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think necessarily it's a conscious trend either of game companies
or consumers," said Joe Funk, editorial director of CD Game Group, publisher of
Electronic Gaming Monthly and other game magazines. "Right now Pokemon is hot
and those sort of games are hot. It's not to say that the industry doesn't have
a conscience, but I think this is incidental."
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest single moneymaker of 1999 was "Donkey Kong 64," which recorded
$86.4 million from 1.4 million copies sold.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pokemon Blue" was second with $80 million in sales, but four other Pokemon
titles were among top 20 moneymakers. Together, they accounted for more than
$355 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message here is that this is a very vibrant, diverse market. A large
majority of sales come from titles that have little or no problematic content,"
said Douglas Lowenstein, the association's president . "But this is a content
industry. There is a range of content available."
</P>
<P>
	   Games with the "M" rating have always made up a small percentage of video
and computer game sales, typically appealing to an older audience, Lowenstein
said. More than 70 percent of those who frequently play such games are more than
18 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   Diminished sales of "M" games may also reflect a broadening of the audience.
As technology improves, more people are being drawn to games that simulate
real-world hobbies, Funk said.
</P>
<P>
	   He pointed to "Bass Fishing," a new game that requires a controller that
looks and operates like a fishing reel. The player feels the tug of the virtual
fish as he tries to reel it in.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's gong to draw in a fisherman in Tennessee who otherwise might not buy
a video game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, the association has worked during the past year to increase
awareness of the ratings system, which it established in 1994, Lowenstein and
Eakes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratings include: Adults Only, considered suitable for players 18 and older,
for graphic depictions of sex or violence; Mature, 17 or older, for violence,
language or sexual themes; Teen, 13 or older, for violence, mild or strong
language and sexual themes; Everyone, ages 6 and older, for minimal violence and
comic mischief; and Early Childhood, considered suitable for children 3 and
older.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Charged in Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
    By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted Mitsubishi Corp. and a
former executive of the world's largest producer of graphite electrodes
Wednesday, accusing them of taking part in a price-fixing conspiracy that led to
higher costs in the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. steel industry.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate indictments filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Mitsubishi
was charged with aiding and abetting a conspiracy to stifle competition in the
graphic electrode industry, and an executive from UCAR International Inc. was
charged with taking part in the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year investigation has already garnered $300 million in criminal
fines and also led to charges against nine other companies or individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Georges Schwengler, a former European export sales director at UCAR,
conspired in violation of the Sherman Act to eliminate competition in the
industry here and abroad from March 1992 until January 1997, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, steelmakers paid higher prices for graphite electrodes used to
melt scrap and refine steel for a variety of business and consumer items.
Graphite electrodes are huge carbon columns that serve as the heat source for
"mini-mill" furnaces, which now account for half of U.S. steel production.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Mitsubishi and Schwengler each are subject to the maximum
penalty for violating the Sherman Act -- a $10 million fine for a corporation,
and three years in jail and a $350,000 fine for an individual.
</P>
<P>
	   Total U.S. sales of graphite electrodes were more than $1.7 billion over the
course of the conspiracy, during which graphite electrode customers were hit
with significant price increases that far outpaced inflation, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
	   To date, the Justice Department's antitrust division has brought cases
against seven corporations and four executives and obtained more than $300
million in criminal fines from its ongoing investigation of price-fixing in the
graphite electrode industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "The department continues to seek out and prosecute all those who
participate in, or knowingly aid, international conspiracies that increase
prices for consumers and unfairly impede free and open competition," said
Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Mitsubishi denied the charges and said it would "vigorously
defend against those charges in court."
</P>
<P>
	   "Specifically, we deny aiding and abetting UCAR International Inc. ... or
anyone else to engage in any unlawful conduct," said the statement released by
attorneys Kekst and Co. "We look forward to presenting our case in federal
district court in Philadelphia, and to clearing our good name."
</P>
<P>
	   Formerly based in Danbury, Conn., UCAR recently moved its headquarters to
Nashville. Company spokesman Joel Hawthorne said UCAR did not want to comment on
the suit because it did not involve the company itself, which had agreed to
plead guilty in April 1998 and paid a then-record $110 million fine for the same
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, SGL Carbon AG, a German corporation, was sentenced to pay a $135
million fine in the case. Two former UCAR executives have agreed to plead guilty
and serve time in prison. SGL's chief executive, Robert J. Koehler, was
sentenced to pay a $10 million fine, the largest ever imposed on an individual.

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, killing three students, injuring 62 and sending
terrified, bleary-eyed students crawling in pajamas through choking smoke into
the freezing cold outside.
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned at the Roman Catholic university,
including one who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 prank alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. Investigators are interview people
"who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge. Campolo
declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have caused the fire.
Smoking is prohibited in dorm lounges and hallways but permitted in certain
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol, which did not
disclose home towns.
</P>
<P>
	   A cousin of Caltabilota said he lived in West Long Branch, Monmouth County.
The relative declined to give her name or comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta lived in Vineland, where a person answering a family phone said they
would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A home town for Karol could not immediately be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one of the 55 fire extinguishers in
the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected recently and
were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was extinguished quickly. Three female students walked out of the
dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
the university planned a service for the dead later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was
a home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old males were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine and they are very heavily sedated," Mansour
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chicago Treasurer Gets New Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday ordered a new trial for
former city Treasurer Miriam Santos, saying her extortion trial was marred by an
``avalanche of errors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Five hours after the decision, Santos walked out of the federal prison camp
where she had been serving a 40-month sentence since October. City officials
were investigating a state law that could require the city to give Santo back
her job because of the reversed conviction, and possibly back pay. But they were
not certain how it would apply in her case.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they would ask the appeals court to either
reconsider its decision or bring Santos to trial a second time, possibly with
the addition of new charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized U.S.
District Judge Charles Norgle, the trial judge, citing numerous errors. Among
them was Norgle's refusal to delay the trial while Santos' original attorney
finished another case, forcing Chris Gair to take over on short notice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although the evidence against Santos was considerable, the case was not so
completely one-sided against her that we can call the veritable avalanche of
errors that we have identified harmless,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santos, 44, the Democratic candidate for state attorney general in 1998, was
convicted of threatening to bar Fuji Securities from doing business with the
city unless it contributed $10,000 to the Democratic Party of Illinois. She was
also convicted of forcing treasurer's office staff to do campaign work on city
time.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Test 'Marijuana Patch'  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL GORMLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A "marijuana patch" similar to the patches that help
smokers kick the habit could help relieve the pain and side effects of cancer,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Cancer Society is funding a three-year, $361,000 grant for
research into a "marijuana patch" that is being announced Thursday at the Albany
College of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
	   A patch could provide an alternative to smoking marijuana for medical
purposes, which has been approved in some states but remains a controversial
issue nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The patch could ease the pain, nausea and vomiting that chemotherapy
patients can suffer, said Gail Tyner-Taylor of the American Cancer Society of
New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   No such patch exists but research by Dr. Audra Stinchcomb, an assistant
professor who researches medications transmitted through the skin, will explore
whether it is feasible.
</P>
<P>
	   The concept is similar to patches that deliver controlled doses of nicotine
to help people quit smoking tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   An advocate for the use of medicinal marijuana criticized the patch concept
as another in a long line of less-effective alternatives to smoking the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "The American Cancer Society has always been on record against people
smoking tobacco and marijuana," said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in Washington, D.C. "This
is a way to assuage opponents."
</P>
<P>
	   Previous research included pills, suppositories, eye and ear drops and even
talk of creating a marijuana vapor, said St. Pierre. Smoking, however, is a
faster way to get the drug into the system, an important factor in controlling
nausea.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health and an affiliate of the National Academy
of Sciences have concluded that the active ingredients in marijuana can ease the
pain, nausea and vomiting of cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   A half-dozen states have offered ballot measures to legalize marijuana as
medication, but the drug is banned by federal law and doctors hesitate to
prescribe it, even in states that legalized its medical use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department is challenging voter-approved laws in Alaska,
Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington. Maine voters approved a medical
marijuana law last year and the law went into effect last month.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Blasts Elian's Relatives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- A top Cuban legislator blasted attempts by the Miami
relatives of Elian Gonzalez to keep the 6-year-old in the United States on
Wednesday and cast doubt on the idea that the boy's grandmothers will go to pick
him up.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly, was interviewed on
government television after the boy's U.S. family members announced they would
sue in federal court to keep the boy permanently in the United States, but
before the action was filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon described Elian's Miami relatives as ``a bunch of kidnappers'' and
said their attempts to keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American
government, showing disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no other immediate reaction to the Miami family's lawsuit, filed
Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Miami challenging the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's determination -- backed by both Attorney General
Janet Reno and President Clinton -- that Elian be reunited with his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   With the presence of Fidel Castro, hundreds of Cuban jurists gathered in
Havana on Wednesday afternoon for the latest in a series of government rallies
pressing for Elian's return. Elian's maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez and
paternal grandmother Mariela Quintana were special guests at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen rescued Elian off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after a boating
accident that killed his mother and 10 others during an apparent illegal attempt
to enter the United States. Ever since, Elian has been the coveted prize in a
tug-of-war between his relatives and anti-Castro activists in Miami and the
boy's father and government in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In his interview with Cuban television earlier Wednesday, Alarcon cast doubt
on a possible trip to the United States by the boy's grandmothers, both of whom
have said repeatedly in recent days that they were willing to go to Miami to
claim Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone has to turn them over,'' Alarcon said, referring to the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday that the chief of the U.S. Interests
Section, Vicky Huddleston, had discussed the issue of the grandmothers with
Cuban officials in Havana on Monday. But they indicated that no decision had
been made and said that the grandmothers had not applied for visas.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon denied that the international custody case demonstrated a difference
between the U.S. and Cuban governments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this moment there is no controversy between the governments of Cuba and
the Untied States,'' said Alarcon. He said Washington officials ``very clearly
have recognized that this child should be returned to his father as quickly as
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Declare Fishery Failure  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- The federal government on Wednesday declared a
fishery disaster for West Coast groundfish, opening the way for future relief to
fishermen whose catches have been severely limited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This determination is the first step in the process of securing funds from
Congress to assist fishermen who have been hit hard in the past several years,''
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar declarations were made after disastrous declines in the New England
cod and Northwest salmon fisheries in the mid-1990s. The federal government
provided $25 million to buy back New England fishing boats, as well as other
economic relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's declaration put the direct loss suffered by West Coast fishermen
at $11 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The catch fishermen are permitted to bring in was reduced because scientists
believe the fish population is too depleted. Limits to catches of groundfish,
which are bottom-dwelling ocean species including ling cod, rockfish and
bocaccio, were reduced 30 to 50 percent each of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad something is coming about,'' said Steve Bodnar, executive
director of the Coos Bay Trawlers Association in Oregon. ``Fishermen have been
asking for years for something to be done besides more regulations causing them
to throw fish overboard.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Restores Ties With Tailhook  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Wednesday it is restoring relations with
the Tailhook Association, the naval aviators group whose 1991 Las Vegas
convention produced a sex scandal that forced the resignation of the Navy's
civilian chief and focused attention on sexual harassment in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've concluded that the time is right to restore ties,'' Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig said in announcing the decision, which was made jointly with the
Navy's top officer, Adm. Jay Johnson, and the commandant of the Marine Corps,
Gen. James Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means Navy and Marine Corps aviators will once again be allowed
to attend Tailhook conventions and professional development seminars on official
military business. Ties were severed in October 1991 after word got out about
drunken sexual debauchery at the Las Vegas convention a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Female officers were groped by aviators attending parties during the
three-day conference at the Las Vegas Hilton hotel. The Defense Department
inspector general implicated 117 officers in various offenses, ranging from
sexual assault to indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's
leaders for failing to stop the behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, then the chief of naval
operations. It also led to lawsuits, multiple investigations and changes in the
Navy -- including more emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an
opening of more aviation opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was molested at the convention, filed
a lawsuit and received $400,000 from the Tailhook Association and $6.8 million
from Hilton Hotels. Her attorney Dennis Schoville, said in an interview
Wednesday that he understands why the Navy wants to restore ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it needs to be properly monitored,'' he said. ``Hopefully people
learned lessons from this and they must not let it happen again.'' He said Ms.
Coughlin was declining requests for interviews on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig had laid the groundwork for Wednesday's action by deciding last year
to send official Navy and Marine Corps representatives to the Tailhook
Association's August convention in Nevada to observe the proceedings. The
officers who attended recommended to Danzig that he restore official ties to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Armed Services seapower
subcommittee, said she had sought assurances from Danzig that the association
would enforce policies against sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this ... announcement, I trust the Secretary has received this
commitment and hope his decision sets the bar high enough to ensure the dignity
of our military members and the effectiveness of our armed forces,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig, Johnson and Jones met with Tailhook officials in the Pentagon to
tell them of the decision and to caution that if their organization embarrasses
the Navy again, their relationship will be severed permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tailhook Association leadership is committed to the changes they have
made,'' Johnson said. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said, ``They have made
reforms and deserve our renewed support.''
</P>
<P>
	   The association is named for the hook on an aircraft that snags an arresting
cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier. As of last year, it had about
10,000 members, down from a 1991 peak of about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its annual conventions, which include professional seminars, the
group sponsors college scholarships for children of former naval aviators and
publishes a magazine on carrier aviation called Hook.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Iowa Won't Hurt in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALEM, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley said Wednesday he is running strong in New
Hampshire and doesn't think a caucus defeat by Al Gore in Iowa -- ``a state that
rewards entrenched power'' -- would dampen his prospects in the first
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's advisers, meanwhile, said their own polling shows the vice president
with a slight New Hampshire lead over Bradley for the first time in weeks. Most
recent public polls show a dead heat, and advisers in both campaigns agree the
race is still a tossup.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominant in Iowa and magnanimous in tone, Gore said the close contest in the
first primary state was evidence of his rival's skills.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it says more good things about him than I think it says bad things
about me,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the two had a cross-state argument about health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's eyes brimmed with tears at a preschool in Salem after a working
mother and a teacher told of the woes of getting care for uninsured children. He
said he was going ``straight ahead'' on the issue because of people like them.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore kept up his criticism of Bradley's proposal for near universal health
insurance coverage, saying it would pose risks to Medicaid and the future
financing of Medicare, points Bradley earlier denied, again.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said in Lebanon that if a Republican had proposed the
limits he says Bradley would put on Medicaid care for the needy, ``every
Democrat in America would be up in arms about it.'' Bradley insists he would be
providing a better alternative to the current system.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also said Bradley is not offering a comprehensive agenda for the
future, on such topics as foreign policy and the economy. ``We haven't turned
our backs and walked away from any of the important challenges facing the
American people,'' Gore said. ``You've got to attack lots of different
challenges at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic rivals made forays in New Hampshire before turning full-time
to the campaign for the Iowa caucuses next Monday night. Then they'll both be
back for an intensive final week of campaigning for the opening primary on Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
	   Each gained the endorsement of a governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont joined the Gore camp, appearing with the vice
president in Lebanon, on the river border of his own state. Dean, a physician,
said one reason he endorsed Gore was that the vice president's health care
proposals are more realistic than Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon announced he is supporting Bradley, citing
health care and the environment as two issues that led to his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   During a campaign appearance in Stratham, Gore pleaded with a crowd of about
400 people for their votes. ``I need your help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To those of you who are undecided in the New Hampshire primary I want you
to vote for me,'' Gore told workers at the Timberland Co. after saying he liked
their boots and appreciated the tan sports shirt he was wearing, which the
company had given him.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking questions, he was asked what priority he'd give to campaign finance
reform if elected president. ``Ten,'' Gore said instantly. ``And I didn't start
talking about this when I began running for president,'' he added in a swipe at
his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he doubted that the verdict in Iowa, where his people argue
that 30 percent of the vote would represent success, would have an impact on his
showing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think there will be a direct connection,'' he said. ``I think that
New Hampshire voters are independent, they make their judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, he said, the Iowa caucuses are an organizational contest in which
the Democratic Party establishment, largely on Gore's side, is a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power,'' he said. ``We are
working very hard there, and I think we've been making progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pollsters put Gore ahead by margins of 20 percentage points and more in
advance of the caucuses, in which Democrats will meet by precinct Monday to
choose sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed the idea that the contest for the nomination is all but
settled for Gore. ``That's, I guess, a spin that's out there today,'' he told
reporters when the question was raised. He said it sounds like a wish from the
other side, ``certainly not the reality.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Iowa and New Hampshire are the opening acts in what will become
a national campaign five weeks later, with a March-long crush of big state
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the resources to wage both campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Wonder Years Learning Center, Bradley listened as a former teacher
and a mother described their problems in getting medical care for sick children
who are not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   When he stood to say that his health care plan would deal with that, his
eyes were glistening with tears. He blinked them back, and told Cathy Perry of
Pelham that in a Bradley administration her four uninsured children would have a
right to medical care, and wouldn't have to apologize for the expense of getting
sick. She said her son had told her he was sorry when they had to go to a doctor
for his strep throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Ruddig of Concord, a former teacher, told of piling coats in the back
of an elementary school classroom so that an ill child could lie down, and of
taking a student and his mother to a doctor when the family couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes it's important when reality enters a political campaign,''
Bradley said. ``I think we've heard that reality today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, meanwhile, Bradley unveiled a new television ad that praises
positive campaigning. In the fight over health care, farm policy and other
issues, he says he has taken the high road.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The radical premise of this campaign is you can go out and tell people
what you believe and win,'' Bradley says in the new 30-second ad. ``That you
don't have to go out and ... smash the other guy so that people will vote
against him. But that you can go out and give people a positive vision of where
you want to take the country and they'll have something to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
	   He ends with a plea for supporters to go to the caucuses and support him.
``I need your help. I need your help,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Criticized by Koch  </HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Mayor Ed Koch criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
Wednesday for sharing a dais at a Martin Luther King Day event with an Austrian
political leader who once praised the policies of Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is that a place to celebrate Martin Luther King Day, to be on the same
dais as the leader of the neo-Nazi Party in Austria?'' Koch said at a news
conference. ``Why didn't he denounce Joerg Haider? Why didn't he order Joerg
Haider out of the hall?''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and Haider, the leader of Austria's anti-immigrant Freedom Party,
sat with about 80 others at a dinner Monday night given by the Congress of
Racial Equality, which is led by conservative black activist Roy Innis.
</P>
<P>
	   Innis said Wednesday that he had invited Haider to the King dinner to ``show
that he has distanced himself'' from his past remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the others on the dais were Republican presidential candidate Sen.
Orrin Hatch, photographer Gordon Parks and pop singer Brandy Norwood.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, who has attended the annual fund-raising dinner honoring King for
six years, did not know Haider was there, said the mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny
Mindel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mayor was invited, and, as he always does, he came,'' Mindel said.
``He didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the dinner, Giuliani -- a likely Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate
-- gave a brief speech about King's legacy, and Hatch accepted an award on
President Reagan's behalf naming Reagan CORE's ``Man of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has vehemently denied being racist, but he gained international
attention several years ago for praising Hitler's ``decent employment policies''
and later, for describing veterans of the Nazi dictator's elite Waffen SS troops
as ``men of character.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's proximity to Haider put him in a particularly awkward situation
because his campaign chief, Bruce Teitelbaum, had criticized Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the mayor's likely rival for the Senate, for appearing at a King day
event in which a minister told the audience he once was fired by ``two Jews.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not hear the remarks, but criticized them afterward.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno declared last week that the boy's status was an
immigration matter solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was found floating on an
inner tube off the Florida coast Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit names as defendants Reno, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, INS
District Director Rober Wallis, the Department of Justice and the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   It accuses the government of violating Elian's rights to due process of law
and asks the judge to prevent the INS from returning the boy to Cuba before the
agency gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   No hearing date was immediately set. The Justice Department and the INS said
in statement they were prepared to respond quickly and would ask the court ``to
expeditiously address this matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important for the well-being of Elian Gonzalez that the status of
this 6-year-old boy be resolved as quickly as possible,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno had brushed aside a ruling from a Miami family court judge delaying the
boy's return. But she postponed an INS deadline to return the boy to his father
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned trying to
reach the United States, and the boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after
he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father,
and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in
the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or
not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to give
Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts have insisted since the fervor over the case began that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no standing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative. That is the father,'' said David
Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, called Elian's
Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their attempts to
keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government, showing
disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of several U.S. groups that want Elian returned to his father have
warned they will call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child
is not sent back soon. The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation
that would grant U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said Wednesday: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS's ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress
has rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill
and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's sister Juanita Castro, who left Cuba in 1964 and now lives in
the Miami area, said she hopes the matter can be decided justly in court. She
would not say whether she thinks the boy should stay or be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope what happens is the best for him, for his destiny, for his
future,'' she said. ``This case, everything that has happened, makes me very
sad.''

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Sit-In Ends  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two black lawmakers ended their sit-in at the
lieutenant governor's office Wednesday after Gov. Jeb Bush agreed to delay his
executive order ending affirmative action so public hearings could be held on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kendrick Meek of Miami and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville, both
Democrats, spent the night in Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan's office after failing to
persuade Bush and Brogan to rescind the order Tuesday. They left about 24 hours
after the sit-in began.
</P>
<P>
	   The two lawmakers and Bush signed a statement outlining an agreement reached
after they discussed the governor's plan to replace affirmative action in hiring
and university admissions with what the governor calls his ``One Florida''
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush contends his plan will increase minority enrollment in state
universities. It guarantees admission to some state universities to the top 20
percent of the state's high school seniors, adds $20 million to the state's
financial aid budget and makes it easier for minority businesses to be certified
to work across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of the governor's willingness to take these affirmative steps,
we've agreed to rescind our demand that the governor immediately suspend the One
Florida executive order,'' the lawmakers said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush agreed to a formal meeting with the Black Caucus and other interested
lawmakers and to delay a Board of Regents vote on the program until Feb. 17. The
Regents, who oversee the state university system, had been scheduled to act on
the proposal Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to require more dialogue, which I am prepared to do,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement also calls for three public hearings. In addition Bush agreed
to a good-faith review of the lawmakers' written comments and recommendations
for improving One Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We informed the governor of our strong support for affirmative action and
the potential harm to our communities if the One Florida initiative rolls back
or repeals the gains made possible by our existing affirmative action law,'' the
legislators said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
	   They also apologized ``for any inconvenience our actions have caused.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest escalated Wednesday as 20 more lawmakers and about 100
protesters, including many students from predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M
University, crowded the Capitol hallways outside the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of miles away in Miami about 100 students, teachers and employees
at Florida International University protested outside Bush's South Florida
office.
</P>
<P>
	   They carried signs that read, ``Stop racism,'' and chanted, ``Shame on
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush apologized Wednesday's for a widely televised remark the night before
in which he told an aide to ``kick their asses out'' in reference to reporters
covering the sit-in. Shortly after noon Wednesday, agents from the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement removed nine reporters, including one from The
Associated Press, who has stayed with the lawmakers in Brogan's office through
the night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I made a statement that I'm not going to repeat because my mother wouldn't
like me to say the `A word,''' Bush said. ``I apologize for that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton said he was taking on the burden of
nudging Syria and Israel along their path to peace, and that neither country is
giving up despite the suspension in talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The peace process was on the agenda for a brief Oval Office meeting between
Clinton and the crown prince of Bahrain on Wednesday evening, National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy said. Leavy did not provide specifics about the
15-minute session with Sheikh Sulman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, except to say the
discussion touched on Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Bahrain is a key U.S. ally and is the regional base for the U.S. Navy's 5th
Fleet. It is a major regional financial center for a number of international
banks, oil companies and service companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in New Hampshire, meanwhile, Republican presidential hopeful
George W. Bush said the United States should not impose a Mideast settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no lasting peace if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel
like they must accept an agreement because it makes us happy,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank have been assigned to the
Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and part of Israel's
capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at her home in the Georgetown section of the capital before seeing
Clinton at the White House in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Iowa result won't hurt in New Hampshire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SALEM, N.H. (AP) - Bill Bradley said Wednesday he is running strong in
New Hampshire and doesn't think a caucus defeat by Al Gore in Iowa - "a state
that rewards entrenched power" - would dampen his prospects in the first
presidential primary.
<P>
	   Gore's advisers, meanwhile, said their own polling shows the vice president
with a slight New Hampshire lead over Bradley for the first time in weeks. Most
recent public polls show a dead heat, and advisers in both campaigns agree the
race is still a tossup.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominant in Iowa and magnanimous in tone, Gore said the close contest in the
first primary state was evidence of his rival's skills.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it says more good things about him than I think it says bad things
about me," the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the two had a cross-state argument about health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's eyes brimmed with tears at a preschool in Salem after a working
mother and a teacher told of the woes of getting care for uninsured children. He
said he was going "straight ahead" on the issue because of people like them.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore kept up his criticism of Bradley's proposal for near universal health
insurance coverage, saying it would pose risks to Medicaid and the future
financing of Medicare, points Bradley earlier denied, again.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said in Lebanon that if a Republican had proposed the
limits he says Bradley would put on Medicaid care for the needy, "every Democrat
in America would be up in arms about it." Bradley insists he would be providing
a better alternative to the current system.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also said Bradley is not offering a comprehensive agenda for the
future, on such topics as foreign policy and the economy. "We haven't turned our
backs and walked away from any of the important challenges facing the American
people," Gore said. "You've got to attack lots of different challenges at the
same time."
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic rivals made forays in New Hampshire before turning full-time
to the campaign for the Iowa caucuses next Monday night. Then they'll both be
back for an intensive final week of campaigning for the opening primary on Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
	   Each gained the endorsement of a governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont joined the Gore camp, appearing with the vice
president in Lebanon, on the river border of his own state. Dean, a physician,
said one reason he endorsed Gore was that the vice president's health care
proposals are more realistic than Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon announced he is supporting Bradley, citing
health care and the environment as two issues that led to his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   During a campaign appearance in Stratham, Gore pleaded with a crowd of about
400 people for their votes. "I need your help," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "To those of you who are undecided in the New Hampshire primary I want you
to vote for me," Gore told workers at the Timberland Co. after saying he liked
their boots and appreciated the tan sports shirt he was wearing, which the
company had given him.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking questions, he was asked what priority he'd give to campaign finance
reform if elected president. "Ten," Gore said instantly. "And I didn't start
talking about this when I began running for president," he added in a swipe at
his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he doubted that the verdict in Iowa, where his people argue
that 30 percent of the vote would represent success, would have an impact on his
showing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there will be a direct connection," he said. "I think that
New Hampshire voters are independent, they make their judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, he said, the Iowa caucuses are an organizational contest in which
the Democratic Party establishment, largely on Gore's side, is a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power," he said. "We are
working very hard there, and I think we've been making progress."
</P>
<P>
	   The pollsters put Gore ahead by margins of 20 percentage points and more in
advance of the caucuses, in which Democrats will meet by precinct Monday to
choose sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed the idea that the contest for the nomination is all but
settled for Gore. "That's, I guess, a spin that's out there today," he told
reporters when the question was raised. He said it sounds like a wish from the
other side, "certainly not the reality."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Iowa and New Hampshire are the opening acts in what will become
a national campaign five weeks later, with a March-long crush of big state
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the resources to wage both campaigns," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Wonder Years Learning Center, Bradley listened as a former teacher
and a mother described their problems in getting medical care for sick children
who are not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   When he stood to say that his health care plan would deal with that, his
eyes were glistening with tears. He blinked them back, and told Cathy Perry of
Pelham that in a Bradley administration her four uninsured children would have a
right to medical care, and wouldn't have to apologize for the expense of getting
sick. She said her son had told her he was sorry when they had to go to a doctor
for his strep throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Ruddig of Concord, a former teacher, told of piling coats in the back
of an elementary school classroom so that an ill child could lie down, and of
taking a student and his mother to a doctor when the family couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it's important when reality enters a political campaign," Bradley
said. "I think we've heard that reality today."
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, meanwhile, Bradley unveiled a new television ad that praises
positive campaigning. In the fight over health care, farm policy and other
issues, he says he has taken the high road.
</P>
<P>
	   "The radical premise of this campaign is you can go out and tell people what
you believe and win," Bradley says in the new 30-second ad. "That you don't have
to go out and ... smash the other guy so that people will vote against him. But
that you can go out and give people a positive vision of where you want to take
the country and they'll have something to vote for."
</P>
<P>
	   He ends with a plea for supporters to go to the caucuses and support him. "I
need your help. I need your help," he says.

<HEADLINE> Getting Personal With Mrs. Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The questions are getting more personal every day for
Hillary Rodham Clinton: Has she been unfaithful? Used drugs?
</P>
<P>
	   ``No'' and ``no,'' she said Wednesday, a day after being asked in a TV
interview if she really planned to leave her husband. It was ``no'' to that,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, submitting to more radio and TV interviews as she nears a
formal announcement that she is running for the Senate from New York, made it
clear she didn't appreciate the more personal lines of questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're going to hate me,'' said WGR-FM morning host Tom Bauerle in Buffalo
in introducing his question: ``Have you ever been sexually unfaithful to
(President Clinton) and specifically ... with you and (the late Deputy White
House Counsel) Vince Foster?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do hate you for that,'' Mrs. Clinton said, according to a tape of the
interview provided by the station. ``I think those questions are out of
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauerle asked again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course it's 'no,''' Mrs. Clinton said. ``At some point we all have to
say these questions, these speculations, really divert attention (from) what we
can do to work together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauerle's next question: ``Have you ever used pot or cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tom, what did you have breakfast for this morning?'' Mrs. Clinton
responded. ``No,'' she said. ``We ought to be talking about bringing good jobs
to western New York and health care and child care.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know that it's fair or unfair,'' Mrs. Clinton said later of the
questions. ``It is on some peoples' minds, but most of what people talk to me
about is the state of their families and their jobs and their schools and that's
what I'm going to be talking about.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said on Tuesday the nation's most famous ``commuter marriage''
will stay intact -- any rumors to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been
together -- this will be our 25th year of marriage -- and we have so much
between us and so many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I
certainly intend to spend the rest of my life with him,'' Mrs. Clinton told
Buffalo's WKBW-TV in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday on that station, she also defended the choices she has made in her
marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know people are interested, but this is something that -- I'm going to
have to live my own way and make my own decisions about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton told reporters that she would formally announce her candidacy
in Westchester County on Feb. 6. She recently moved into a $1.7 million house
she and the president purchased in the county just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said that after her announcement she would tour the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton campaign committee said it had
collected $8 million for the race in six months, while advisers for her likely
opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said he had raised $12 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The race is expected to be one of the costliest in history. Giuliani's camp
has said the goal is to raise between $15 million and $20 million for the entire
campaign, while Mrs. Clinton's advisers have pledged to raise more than $25
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, she and New York City's police commissioner, Howard Safir, are
having a disagreement about her motorcades.
</P>
<P>
	   Safir said Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton does not want her motorcade
accompanied by marked city police cars. Mrs. Clinton usually travels in a van
accompanied by several other cars carrying her campaign staff, Secret Service
agents and sometimes reporters. Typically, a city police car is at the front and
rear of the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to be expedited through the city, going through red lights,
closing off streets, it has to be done with marked cars so the public
understands it's a police operation,'' Safir said. ``You can't do that with
unmarked cars. And that's our problem with the Secret Service and Mrs. Clinton's
motorcade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's entourage does not routinely go through red lights or
commandeer lanes of traffic to speed her travel -- not even when she's running
late. In one instance she got out of her car and walked to a destination in
midtown because she was stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said he wants marked police cars to remain in his entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the NYPD,'' he said. ``I like the NYPD. I like people seeing the
NYPD is with me. I'm very proud of the New York Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, would not comment other than to
say: ``I don't think we will ever talk about her security arrangements.''

<HEADLINE> New gambling agency chairman takes over  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHICAGO (AP) - Members of the Illinois Gaming Board opened Wednesday's
meeting - the first since the board's previous chairman resigned under fire - by
restating their commitment to regulate the casino industry.
<P>
	   The comments by new chairman Gregory C. Jones and board member Joseph
Lamendella were welcomed by anti-gambling activists who had called for the head
of Robert Vickrey, the previous chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Vickrey resigned Jan. 6 in the wake of disclosures that the board approved
the sale of a Joliet casino to Las Vegas gambling figure Jack Binion's company
over objections from gaming board staff. Vickrey said he resigned because the
part-time work had become too time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to assure the public of this board's commitment to vigorously
protect and maintain the integrity of casino gambling in this state," said
Jones, an attorney and former federal prosecutor appointed to the board last
summer by Gov. George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, who abstained from the board's 3-1 vote Nov. 30 approving Horseshoe
Casino's purchase of the Joliet Empress, explained Wednesday that he did so to
avoid any appearance of conflict of interest because attorneys involved in the
sale were former colleagues who occasionally refer clients to him. He said he
would no longer take referrals from them while he is on the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamendella, the only no vote on the Horseshoe purchase, also alluded to the
recent controversy without getting into details.
</P>
<P>
	   "Propriety, openness, fairness, all will proliferate through the observance
of procedural safeguards. That's a mission of this board," Lamendella said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones also seemed to extend a direct peace offering to anti-gambling
activists by announcing the board will hold a special meeting to consider the
issue of problem gambling. Anti-gambling activists have deluged the board in
recent months with concerns about compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   Critic Tom Grey, who had criticized the board in recent meetings as a
cheerleader for the casinos, was clearly pleased with the comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that you will see pain and problems being equally addressed ... and
that was not the case in the past," said Grey, head of the National Coalition
Against Legalized Gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   After operating in relative obscurity for years, the board finds itself in
the middle of several controversial issues that have thrust it into the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Changes in state law eliminating cruising requirements for riverboat casinos
and opening them to nearly round-the-clock gambling prompted huge jumps in
gambling revenue, and also new complaints about compulsive gambling. The changes
in law also cleared the way for operators of a defunct East Dubuque riverboat to
move their license to the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, prompting criticism that
it was an insider deal.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawsuit challenging the Rosemont project threatens to overturn the
dockside gambling legislation, posing another dilemma for the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrah's Entertainment, majority owner of a Joliet casino, is seeking to buy
Players International, which operates the Metropolis casino. The deal would take
advantage of a change in the law that allows one company to own more than one
riverboat.
</P>
<P>
	   But regulators are concerned that the law might be overturned, and it's
unclear how they will treat Harrah's request to approve the sale at their
February meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrah's attorney George Loveland told the board Wednesday that they should
follow the law as written. But Lamendella wondered what would happen to the 800
employees at the Metropolis casino if the law is overturned and the board has to
revoke Harrah's license to operate Metropolis.
</P>
<P>
	   Loveland suggested Harrah's could prevent such a scenario by going to court
or seeking new legislation in the General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Woman's Shooting Blamed on Reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- An attorney for a man accused of fatally
shooting his ex-wife while a TV camera rolled told a jury Wednesday that his
client snapped because of a reporter's persistent questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Reemberto Diaz said during opening statements that Emilio Nunez, 40, became
angered by the questioning of reporter Ingrid Cruz.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Cruz was preparing a story for the Spanish-language network Telemundo
about the suicide of the couple's 15-year-old daughter. Ms. Cruz met Nunez at
his daughter's grave in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   While Nunez was being interviewed, his 33-year-old ex-wife, Maritza Martin,
arrived at the cemetery unexpectedly. Nunez accused her of causing their
daughter's suicide, saying Ms. Martin had slapped the girl after she became
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ms. Cruz tried to interview Martin on camera, Nunez pulled a gun, shot
Ms. Martin in the head and fired 11 more times as she lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Cruz and her cameraman ran for cover, but not before he captured much of
the shooting on tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Diaz said Ms. Cruz asked questions designed to get an emotional response
from Nunez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess (Telemundo) got what they wanted,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Telemundo spokesman Ted Guefen criticized Diaz's claim.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is irresponsible to suggest that Telemundo or Ingrid Cruz are in any
way responsible for this terrible tragedy,'' Guefen said. ``Ingrid Cruz is a
good journalist who was pursuing a story.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz testified Wednesday that she was speaking to Martin when Nunez pushed
her aside and shot his ex-wife. She cried as the videotape was played.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It happened very fast,'' Cruz said. She no longer works for Telemundo, but
the network said her departure was not related to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Nunez is charged with murder. The defense is trying to show that he acted
impulsively, which would make him guilty of manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Released From Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman left the hospital Wednesday, five days
after undergoing quintuple bypass surgery, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there must have been some kind of mixup. I went to the hospital to
get a face-lift," Letterman joked as he left the hospital, according to
spokesman Howard Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, was continuing to recuperate at an undisclosed location,
Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman had emergency heart surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on
Friday after tests showed that one of his arteries was clogged.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave has been an ideal patient," said his physician, Dr. Louis Aronne. "He
feels strong and strolled out of the hospital in great spirits. I am confident
his recovery will continue along the same path."
</P>
<P>
	   Rubenstein said he did not know when Letterman would be able to return to
the "Late Show." CBS is airing reruns while Letterman recovers.

<HEADLINE> School releases names of three freshmen killed in fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall University said the three students who
died in Wednesday's fire at Boland Hall were all residents of the third floor of
the freshmen dormitory, where the fire broke out.
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol, which did not
disclose home towns.
</P>
<P>
	   A cousin of Caltabilota said he lived in West Long Branch, Monmouth County.
The relative declined to give her name or comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta lived in Vineland, where a person answering a family phone said they
would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Karol lived in Green Brook, Somerset County, where his father, Joseph Karol,
52, said, "We're pretty devastated."
</P>
<P>
	   The elder Karol went to the dorm after hearing of the fire, and after not
finding his son, "I kind of figured that he might eventually be one of the
victims."
</P>
<P>
	   The teen was studying criminal justice and hoped to be a criminal profiler
for the FBI, Karol said. He had been an honor student at Watchung Hills High
School and won two scholarships to Seton Hall, the father said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was an athlete in high school and he was standout soccer player," Karol
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just truly a genuinely good kid. He was a wonderful, compassionate
human being and he cared a lot about friends," Karol said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his father, the student is survived by his mother and a
sister, the father said.

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, killing three students, injuring 62 and sending
terrified, bleary-eyed students crawling in pajamas through choking smoke into
the freezing cold outside.
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned at the Roman Catholic university,
including one who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 prank alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. Investigators are interview people
"who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge. Campolo
declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have caused the fire.
Smoking is prohibited in dorm lounges and hallways but permitted in certain
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol, which did not
disclose home towns.
</P>
<P>
	   A cousin of Caltabilota said he lived in West Long Branch, Monmouth County.
The relative declined to give her name or comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta lived in Vineland, where a person answering a family phone said they
would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Karol lived in Green Brook, Somerset County, where his father, Joseph Karol,
52, said, "We're pretty devastated."
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one of the 55 fire extinguishers in
the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected recently and
were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was extinguished quickly. Three female students walked out of the
dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
the university planned a service for the dead later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was
a home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old males were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine and they are very heavily sedated," Mansour
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<HEADLINE> Three die in New York's bone-chilling weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mary Varriale, diagnosed with a brain tumor and feeling
disoriented in a Queens hospital, just wanted to go home.
<P>
	   So in the middle of the night, the 75-year-old grandmother climbed out of
her bed. In robe and slippers, she wandered up to the roof. The door locked
behind her, leaving her in the 9-degree temperature made deadly cold by wind.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't survive.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doll lady," as she was dubbed by neighborhood children for whom she
crocheted the toys, would never return.
</P>
<P>
	   For many, this week's bone-chilling temperatures meant extra layers of
clothing and chattering teeth. But for Mrs. Varriale and at least two other
people, the chill spelled death.
</P>
<P>
	   Two homeless people also have died and the medical examiner was performing
an autopsy on an elderly woman in the Bronx, possibly another victim of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the city enjoyed what seemed - by contrast - like a heat wave,
with temperatures pushing 30 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast snow
for Thursday, but temperatures remaining in the 20s or 30s through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The warm-up came too late for Mrs. Varriale, the brain tumor patient who
died on the roof of the Flushing Hospital Medical Center. "Something went
definitely, radically wrong in that place," said her husband, Tullio Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   During the weekend, Mrs. Varriale had to be restrained because she had
become confused and tried to leave the hospital to go home to her Astoria
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   At about 3 a.m. Monday, a nurse noticed that she was missing from her bed.
Police helped hospital security officers look for her. They found her dead at
about 8 a.m. on the roof. During the night, an icy wind had pushed the
temperature to gusts of 34 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't gotten the whole story yet," her husband said. "I just don't
understand how something like this could happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Pedersen, a hospital spokesman, said the death was under investigation.
He said that, in general, patients are allowed to walk on the floor where Mrs.
Varriale was hospitalized. "It is not like a locked prison."
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital issued a statement saying the staff was "devastated by this
outcome and expresses condolences to the patient's family."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Varriale was admitted to the hospital last week, after she felt dizzy,
got disoriented and had problems walking. A CAT scan revealed the brain tumor,
said her son, Edward Varriale.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they had a situation where they had to put her in restraints, why
weren't they watching her more closely?" asked Tullio Varriale. "I lost my wife
of 50 years."
</P>
<P>
	   The cold also proved fatal for the two homeless men.
</P>
<P>
	   One, in his 40s, was found on a loading dock in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay
section on Monday afternoon. The temperature had reached 19, but with a wind
chill of minus 16.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 3 degrees in Central Park at 6 a.m. -
the coldest in six years. A 55-year-old man died while trying to keep warm in
the back of a parked station wagon in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   Identities for the two men were still unavailable on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the slight thaw, the lingering cold was still causing other
problems. In Farmingdale, Long Island, frozen pipes burst at The American
Airpower Museum at Republic Airport, destroying photographs, books and records
of aviation history dating back to World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 gallons of water cascaded from one floor to another
overnight, washing away decades of records that may never be replaced, said
museum spokesman Gary Lewi.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the damaged items was a lithograph showing Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit
of St. Louis" taking off from Republic air field.

<HEADLINE> Ford Sees Jump in Hybrid Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- The chairman of Ford Motor Co. says hybrid vehicles that
combine fuel engines with electric motors could account for 20 percent of new
vehicles in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford,
said in a speech to the Automotive News World Congress on Wednesday that hybrids
and vehicles powered by fuel cells will "finally end the 100-year reign of the
internal combustion engine as the dominant source of power for personal
transportation."
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel cells use a chemical reaction to create electricity. Most major
automakers have been doing research on such power sources; Honda and Toyota will
sell small numbers of hybrid vehicles in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also said Wall Street should re-evaluate automakers' stocks in light of
new Internet business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to be fully wired, and we have what every dot-com wants:
customers," Ford said.

<HEADLINE> Former Drug Agent Sentenced To Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former state anti-narcotics agent convicted of running
a multi-state drug distribution network was sentenced to life in prison
Wednesday and fined $16 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Richard Wayne Parker, 44, told U.S. District Judge Christina
Snyder that their client does not have the money to pay the fine and will appeal
his conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   The former California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement officer was convicted
of stealing 650 pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker in 1997 and selling it
in a cocaine operation that stretched from Honolulu to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker was convicted in a second trial after his first jury deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Richard Hamar, said after the sentencing that he would argue to
an appeals court that Parker was placed in double jeopardy because the first
jury was not ordered to continue its deliberations further before a mistrial was
declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker's sentence was mandated under federal law, as was the extraordinarily
large fine -- $4 million on each of four counts.
</P>
<P>
	   After Parker was convicted, authorities arrested his half-brother, former
California Highway Patrol officer George Michael Ruelas, and Parker's former
partner, Michael Wilcox, on charges of participating in the drug ring. Both were
charged and their cases are pending.

<HEADLINE> Fed Notes Good Business Conditions  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, fueled by robust consumer spending and
rejuvenated manufacturing, continues to fire on all cylinders, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday in a report that economists said is further evidence that
the Fed will boost interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In its most recent snapshot of the nation's economic activity, the Fed
reported "strong economic growth in December and January."
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, contributed to the strong growth. Retailers reported strong holiday
sales with purchases of electronics, toys and jewelry especially high nationwide
and expected robust sales early this year, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad-based rebound in manufacturing also contributed to the growth as
overseas demand, which had been dampened by the Asian currency crisis, continued
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are laying the foundation for another tightening move in February,"
said Mark Zandi, economist with Regional Financial Associates. "The report shows
that the economy is not slowing. It is booming."
</P>
<P>
	   Labor markets remained tight around the country, meaning that employers have
difficulty finding workers to fill job openings, something that economists fear
could lead to wage and price inflation in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fed said there was still no sign that employers were giving workers
big wage increases. And, the Fed said that "most consumer prices appear to be
holding steady in much of the country, although a few districts reported
moderate increases."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's survey, known as the "beige book" for the color of its cover, will
be used when Fed policy-makers meet next on Feb. 1-2 to review the central
bank's stance on interest rates. The survey is based on reports from the Fed's
12 regional banks from information collected before Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Fed will boost interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point at the February meeting, citing continuing strong economic
growth. The Fed's latest survey supports such a move, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The beige book simply confirms what the Fed already knows: that momentum is
too strong and has to be slowed," said Tim O'Neill, economist for Bank of
Montreal and Harris Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
sizzling economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists fear that the booming economy could spark inflation down the
road, but the Fed's report indicated that thus far prices remain stable. Given
that, the Fed is likely to follow up February's meeting with several small
increases rather than big ones, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Fed, in a move designed to reduce confusion about its
intentions for interest rates, said beginning at the February meeting it will
discuss the outlook for inflation or economic growth, rather than make specific
references to the prospects of interest rate changes in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, construction of new homes and apartments surged to a
13-year high in 1999 helped along by a 7.1 percent jump in December, a sign of
the housing sector's resilience even as mortgage rates rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, builders started construction on 1.66 million new units, a
3 percent gain from 1998, pushing total housing starts to the highest level
since 1986, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, builders, aided by better-than-normal weather, began work on
new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71 million units.
</P>
<P>
	   The growth in December's and last year's housing starts came despite the
upward climb of mortgage rates and reflects the nation's good economic times,
economists said. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and a strong
stock market helped make Americans feel wealthy and in the buying mood last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists, however, predict slower growth this year as mortgage rates
continue to rise. In December, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage was 7.9 percent, up from 6.7 percent in December 1998. Last week,
mortgage rates climbed to 8.18 percent, the highest level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect total housing starts to go down by 8 percent in 2000, but that
will still leave things pretty healthy," said economist Michael Carliner of the
National Association of Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, in its survey, said the Year 2000 computer changeover did not cause
major disruptions to the U.S. banking system or other parts of the economy. "Few
future disruptions are anticipated and few problems concerning Y2K-related
inventories are expected," the Fed said.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Relative Surrenders to Cops  </HEADLINE>
   By DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A nephew of Robert F. Kennedy was charged
Wednesday with bludgeoning a girl to death with a golf club in 1975 when he was
15, providing the long-awaited break in a case that frustrated police in wealthy
Greenwich and raised suspicions of a Kennedy cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Skakel, 39, flew to Connecticut from his home in Florida and
surrendered at Greenwich police headquarters after a warrant was issued for his
arrest in the slaying of Martha Moxley. Because of Skakel's age at the time of
the crime, the case will be handled, at least initially, in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Michael has stated all along he did not do this,'' said his lawyer,
Michael Sherman. ``He had no knowledge of it. He had no part in it. He is not
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of Skakel's status in juvenile court, it was not immediately clear
Wednesday what penalty he could face if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha, 15, was beaten with a 6-iron and stabbed in the throat with a piece
of the club's shattered shaft. The club was quickly matched to a set owned by
the Skakel family, who lived across the street in Belle Haven, an exclusive
gated community in the rich New York suburb of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigation kept hitting dead ends, and police were accused of
apathy and ineptitude. A special prosecutor quit partly in frustration over
unproven claims there had been payoffs aimed at thwarting the probe. Skakel's
father, Rushton, is the brother of Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
	   As the years went by and no arrests were made, rumors of a Kennedy cover-up
circulated in Greenwich. The idea that someone might have gotten away with
murder in the community of wealth and privilege made the case the subject of a
TV movie and inspired the novel ``A Season in Purgatory'' by Dominick Dunne in
1993 and the nonfiction book ``Murder in Greenwich,'' by former Los Angeles
Detective Mark Fuhrman, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators got their big break during the past year, when a one-man grand
jury heard testimony from former patients at the Elan school, a substance abuse
treatment center in Maine that Skakel attended from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors
filed court documents that said Skakel admitted killing Martha to fellow
students at Elan.
</P>
<P>
	   The case could get stalled in juvenile court for a year or more if Skakel's
lawyer fights prosecutors' bid to transfer the case to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel returned to his home in Hobe Sound, Fla., after posting $500,000 bond
in Greenwich. He is scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha was killed on Oct. 30, 1975. She had visited the Skakel home along
with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks with shaving
cream and toilet paper. She left, apparently bound for home, but never made it.
Her body was found the next afternoon under low-hanging fir trees on her
family's property.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel and his older brother Thomas, then 17, were considered
possible suspects, along with others, including a tutor who had moved into the
Skakel house the day of the killing. The Skakel family stopped cooperating with
police in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   For a long time, authorities focused on Thomas. It was not until years later
that they took a second look at Michael, after he changed his story about his
movements the night of the killing. In 1995, in an interview with private
investigators hired by his family, Skakel placed himself near the murder scene
at about the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 1998 book, Fuhrman, who investigated the O.J. Simpson case but was
dogged by accusations of racism, suggested that Michael Skakel murdered Martha
in a fit of jealousy after seeing Thomas kissing her.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have dismissed any suggestion that Fuhrman's book helped them
solve the case. Fuhrman did not return calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after Fuhrman's book was published, Superior Court Judge George Thim
was appointed to serve as a one-man grand jury. He interviewed more than 40
witnesses, including Skakel's former schoolmates in Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, released Wednesday in Bridgeport, the judge said he found
grounds to bring murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a wonderful day,'' Martha's mother, Dorthy Moxley, told the Daily
Record of Morris County, N.J., while sitting at a dining room table beneath a
large painting of her daughter. ``I just hope that they find him guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martha's brother, John Moxley, has said he believed police made mistakes in
the investigation and showed deference to the Skakels because of the Kennedy
connection.
</P>
<P>
	   That view is shared by some in Greenwich, a town of 60,000 where police
officers in white gloves direct traffic and schoolgirls in plaid jumpers window
shop at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the family didn't have money and if they weren't Kennedys he would have
been caught years ago,'' resident Alba Fox said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lawyer bristled at any suggestion that the Kennedy connection had
any influence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a Kennedy trial,'' Sherman said. ``It's a trial of a young man
charged with killing his next-door neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's arrest adds to the long history of legal problems for the Kennedy
clan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1969, a Kennedy campaign aide drowned after Sen. Edward Kennedy drove his
car off a bridge at Chappaquiddick, Mass. In 1991, the senator's nephew William
Kennedy Smith was acquitted of rape in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   It was during that trial that investigators in Connecticut formally reopened
the Moxley case, after rumors circulated that Smith had been at the Skakel home
the night of Martha's killing. The rumors were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, Skakel has worked on the political campaigns of Kennedy
family members, including former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II and Sen. Kennedy. He
also worked for Joseph Kennedy's Citizens Energy Corp., a nonprofit company that
delivers heating oil to poor people, Sherman said.

Government To Bring in Tough Cigarette Packaging Rules
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Photos of a diseased brain, of cancer tumours in a lung, and
a phallic cigarette drooping limply are among illustrations that would be
required on new cigarette packaging under regulations proposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Canadians who use tobacco products need to fully understand the serious
health hazard inherent in this lethal product,'' Health Minister Allan Rock said
as he delivered the long-promised anti-smoking strategy at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With these hard-hitting health messages and compelling graphics, we will
reach smokers directly and effectively.''
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations would also require tobacco companies to list toxic chemicals
present in cigarettes and in second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   They would be open for public comment and reviewed by the Commons health
committee before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
	    Liberal Backbenchers Criticize NHL Aid
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Industry Minister John Manley's effort to sell his hockey
bailout package as an all-Canada solution is facing a challenge from fellow
Liberals who think his vision doesn't extend beyond the national capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think there's any question that this has been tailor-made for the
Ottawa Senators,'' Brenda Chamberlain, who chairs the Ontario caucus of Liberal
MPs, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can accept that money almost immediately while other teams, if they
do want to, have to figure it out. The deal is not a good one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Manley announced Tuesday the government would offer millions in aid to
Canadian-based NHL teams -- on condition that municipal and provincial
governments and the league also chip in.
</P>
<P>
	   The other partners would carry most of the burden, with the federal share
capped at 25 per cent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bryden, the important part of the federal offer was Manley's agreement
to negotiate with each team separately.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal cabinet had previously insisted on a package deal. That meant no
money would go to any club unless agreement was reached with all six Canadian
teams, six municipalities and four provinces.

Saskatchewan Faces Eight-year Nursing shortage, report suggests
</P>
<P>
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Saskatchewan's beleaguered health-care system
got more troubling news Wednesday -- a new study projects its nursing shortage
could drag on for at least eight more years.
</P>

	   The report comes at a time when health districts across Saskatchewan are
struggling to fill more than 200 vacancies and nurses groan about overwork and

	   Canada Pension Plan Report Confirms Restructuring Works, Minister Says
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Restructuring undertaken two years ago has put the Canada
Pension Plan on solid footing, says the plan's annual report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report released Wednesday for 1998-1999 confirms a previous actuarial
report and an independent review which found the plan to be financially
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
	   To tackle the $460 billion in unfunded liability, the federal government
increased premiums and established the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, an
arms-length body in charge investing the money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The evidence, including the 1998-99 CPP Annual Report, indicates that the
changes put in place two years ago to sustain the CPP are working,'' Finance
Minister Paul Martin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means that Canadians can continue to count on strong pensions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, instituted in 1966, provides benefits to contributors and their
families.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 1998-1999 fiscal year it provided more than 3.4 million people
with $18.2 billion in retirement pensions, disability and survivors benefits as
well as benefits for dependent children.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, contributions to the CPP increased to $3.90 from $3.50 per $100
of insurable earnings.

Father, Stepmother Charged With Murder
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Police have laid first-degree murder charges against the
father and step-mother of a five-year-old girl whose body parts were found last
month at a scenic waterfront park.
</P>
<P>
	   Muhammad Arsal Kahn, 36, and Kaneez Fatima, 45, were arrested earlier in the
day at their home just minutes from the park where the grisly discovery was
made, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Fatima is the step-mother of the girl, whose name was Farah
Jahan-Kahn. She would have turned six next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Police, who were tipped off by school officials about a missing girl, say
they don't expect to make any further arrests in the case.

<HEADLINE> Fed Lawsuit Filed in Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
the 6-year-old boy must be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, filed the federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno declared last week that the boy's status was an
immigration matter solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was found floating on an
inner tube off the Florida coast Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit names as defendants Reno, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, INS
District Director Robert Wallis, the Department of Justice and the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   It accuses the government of violating Elian's rights to due process of law
and asks the judge to prevent the INS from returning the boy to Cuba before the
agency gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   No hearing date was immediately set. The Justice Department and the INS said
in a statement they were prepared to respond quickly and would ask the court
``to expeditiously address this matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important for the well-being of Elian Gonzalez that the status of
this 6-year-old boy be resolved as quickly as possible,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno had brushed aside a ruling from a Miami family court judge delaying the
boy's return. But she postponed an INS deadline to return the boy to his father
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned trying to
reach the United States, and the boy was rescued at sea by the Coast Guard after
he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father,
and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of
Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez. The INS ruled that only the boy's father can represent
his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in
the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or
not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to give
Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts have insisted since the fervor over the case began that
Elian's U.S. relatives have no standing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative. That is the father,'' said David
Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, called Elian's
Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their attempts to
keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government, showing
disrespect for its institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of several U.S. groups that want Elian returned to his father have
warned they will call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child
is not sent back soon. The groups denounced Congress for considering legislation
that would grant U.S. citizenship to the boy over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a resolution to grant
citizenship to the boy, said Wednesday: ``This is an issue about what his mother
wanted for the boy. ... To ignore her interests and her concern is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mack, interviewed on CBS's ``The Early Show,'' was reminded that Congress
has rarely granted citizenship; among the few recipients were Winston Churchill
and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winston Churchill and this little boy have a lot in common. They both
stood for freedom,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's sister Juanita Castro, who left Cuba in 1964 and now lives in
the Miami area, said she hopes the matter can be decided justly in court. She
would not say whether she thinks the boy should stay or be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope what happens is the best for him, for his destiny, for his
future,'' she said. ``This case, everything that has happened, makes me very
sad.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Die, 58 Hurt in Seton Hall Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Fire broke out at a university dormitory early
Wednesday as hundreds slept, killing three people, injuring 62 and sending
terrified students crawling in pajamas through smoke into the freezing cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Six Seton Hall University students were critically burned. One of them
suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 residents of Boland Hall went back to sleep when they first
heard the alarm about 4:30 a.m., thinking it was another in a string of 18 false
alarms set off in the six-floor building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   But many soon heard screams for help and smelled the smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I opened the door just to check,'' Yatin Patel said. ``All the ceiling
tiles were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was panic. Everybody was just, `Go! Go! Go!''' said Nicole McFarlane,
19. She was treated for exposure because she left her room in only a short
nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The tragedy cast a pall of grief over the campus of the Roman Catholic
school 15 miles southwest of New York City. Classes for the 10,000 students were
canceled for the week. A memorial service was planned for later Wednesday.
Sports events also were postponed through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's not much you can say at this time,'' said Newark Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick, who came to offer support. ``We're glad we're people of
faith. The mystery of God's work is always a great mystery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Patel, who lives on the third floor down the hall from the lounge where the
blaze broke out, said he put a wet towel under his door, kicked out his window
screens and threw his mattresses on the ground in case he had to jump.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two students did jump, witnesses said. Tim Van Wie, 18, of
Flanders, said a friend jumped from the third floor and suffered a broken wrist
and sprained ankle. Others tied sheets together to climb down from the windows,
but firefighters arrived and rescued them by ladder.
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one fellow student shivering in a T-shirt and boxers,
his skin completely blackened by burns. ``His skin was, like, smoking,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the three male students killed were found in the lounge and the other
was found in a bedroom nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. The office
did not release their home towns, but friends and relatives said all were from
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Two firefighters and two police officers were among those hurt. The injuries
ranged from exposure and smoke inhalation to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze was largely confined to the lounge. Students said they frequently
saw people smoking in the lounge, even though it is prohibited in lounges and
hallways.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo said he did not have any
information about whether the fire was suspicious. He would not comment on
whether careless smoking may have caused the blaze. The Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms was assisting in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a painstaking investigation,'' he said. ``We are taking
statements from individuals who may have witnessed the fire or the moments
leading up to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and extinguishers
but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before they were
required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire hoses inside the building had been disconnected because the equipment
was obsolete, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The smoke alarms and extinguishers had passed inspection recently and at
least one extinguisher was used during the blaze, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students lined up in the student center to
comfort each other and call parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Three roommates on the ground floor slept through the fire and were not
hurt. They woke up more than two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them, Erica McGlone, 18, peeked out her window and startled a
firefighter outside. ``We said, `Like, excuse me, sir, what's going on?' And he
said, `Get out.' They came in and dragged us out of there,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Urged To Crack Down on Drugs  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN PERRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera urged
Haiti's president Wednesday to take tough measures to fight a rising tide of
drugs flowing through this Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Drug traffickers have made Haiti a key transit point for the flow of drugs
from Colombia to Europe and the Untied States,'' Caldera said after what he
termed ``a very candid discussion'' with President Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said he encouraged Preval to push for laws to combat money
laundering and corruption and to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers
wanted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Drugs passing through countries like Haiti have the ``ability to corrupt
political institutions, including elected leaders, judges, police officers,
prosecutors,'' Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Umberg, a deputy director of the White House drug policy office,
estimated that 330 tons of cocaine head annually from South America to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   About 12 percent of that -- 3,600 tons -- transits the island of Hispaniola
which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Caldera met with Dominican
President Leonel Fernandez on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Haiti, with U.S. help, has reduced drug shipments by sea, Umberg said
there were more drug trafficking flights coming into the country. Haiti allows
U.S. ships and aircraft to pursue suspected drug vessels into Haitian waters and
airspace.
</P>
<P>
	   But Haiti's anti-drug efforts have been hampered by politics. After a
protracted dispute, Preval dissolved parliament last year, putting all
legislation on hold. New legislative elections are scheduled for March 19.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Haiti's legal system is notoriously ineffectual.

<HEADLINE> Helms To Visit U.N., Talk About Dues  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT NEUMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms' upcoming visit to the United
Nations will help ``reduce misunderstandings'' caused by Washington's handling
of its $1.5 billion in back dues, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the powerful Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, has been a long-time advocate of U.N. reform. He
will meet Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan before addressing the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden, Helms co-authored a bill setting
conditions on U.S. payments to the world body, which included a call for a
reduction in the U.S. share of U.N. budgets and better oversight on U.N.
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, which paid off only part of what the United Nations says it
is owed by Washington, calls for a reduction of the U.S. portion of the regular
budget to 20 percent from the current 25 percent and for a decrease in the U.S.
share of the peacekeeping bills to 25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many U.N. members resent such conditions, saying the United States is
seeking to impose conditions on them that it would never accept from any other
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke, however, said Helms's visit could improve the attitude of member
states, who will have to approve any reduction in the U.S. dues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has to help,'' Holbrooke told reporters. ``It has to reduce
misunderstandings. It has to increase understanding here in the U.N. of the
Helms-Biden benchmarks and I hope it will be a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Helms will be joined in New York by Biden and four other senators
for a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the Bar Association
of New York and a discussion with U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, lawmakers authorized payment of $926 million to pay off some
of the $1.5 billion the United Nations estimates Washington owes the
organization.

<HEADLINE> Book Recalls Sins of U.S. Media  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Technology has revolutionized news by making it possible
to bring together sources of information from around the world simultaneously,
broadcast journalist Ted Koppel told an audience of news people Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The group came together to mark the publication of a history of journalism
in North America, which tells the story through the pictures and brief sketches
of nearly 300 of its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
	   Koppel said his program, Nightline, was the first to take advantage of the
technology of satellite television to interview sources and allow them to debate
each other from different parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we for the first time could bring together a guest from Tehran, a guest
from Moscow, a guest from Washington, and have the three of them talk with
another, debate with one another. ... I think the technology was far more the
hero of that program than anything that the journalists did on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The book, ``Crusaders, Scoundrels, Journalists,'' goes back more than three
centuries to the account with a seduction by King Louis XIV. The report helped
bring the suppression of the first newspaper in what is now the United States,
according to a new book from the Newseum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Officials, upset by a French sex scandal and other reports, kill(ed) the
paper after one edition, calling it `a great inconvenience,''' notes the first
entry in the book published by the journalism museum. ``Inconvenience'' was a
much stronger denunication in 1690 than it is today.
</P>
<P>
	   The account tells of Benjamin Harris, publisher of ``Publick Occurrences,''
the first of 285 American news figures profiled in a volume called ``Crusaders,
Scoundrels, Journalists.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those troubled by conflicting news items, Tim Russert of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' tells a story from ancient Egypt in the book's foreword.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The almighty Pharaoh had to assign four scribes to write about an
important trial, hoping the truth would somehow emerge from their varying
reports,'' Russert said.
</P>
<P>
	   The text divides the personalities, whom it calls ``The Newseum's Most
Intriguing Newspeople'' into 10 groups: newsmongers, crusaders, political
animals, humorists, war reporters, media moguls, sleuths, barrier breakers,
photographers and literary journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them:
</P>
<P>
	   --Nellie Bly -- real name Elizabeth Cochran -- who not only circled the
world in 72 days but in 1884, writing for the New York World, exposed conditions
at a woman's asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   --K.W. Lee, whose stories in the Sacramento Union helped win the release of
a wrongfully convicted immigrant in 1983, and who went on to found Koreatown,
the first national Korean-American paper.
</P>
<P>
	   --Mark Kellogg who went into the Battle of Little Bighorn with Lt. Col.
George Custer. His final dispatch to The Associated Press on June 24, 1876,
said: ``By the time this reaches you we will have met and fought the red devils,
with what result remains to be seen. I go with Custer and will be at the
death.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Forum, which opened the Newseum in Arlington, Va., in 1997, is a
nonpartisan foundation that advocates speech and press freedoms.

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The wife of Republican presidential candidate and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush says she doesn't think the Confederate flag is a
symbol of racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I grew up in the South -- in Texas,'' Laura Bush said Wednesday while
campaigning here for her husband. ``It's just a time of our history that we
can't erase.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the flag does not offend her personally.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential candidates competing in next month's South
Carolina primary have sidestepped the issue of the Confederate flag flying atop
the Statehouse, saying it is an issue for South Carolinians to solve.

	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A national anti-abortion group and its New Hampshire
affiliate are running radio ads criticizing Republican presidential candidate
and Sen. John McCain for his opposition to negative political ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life Committee Inc. and Citizens for Life Inc. said
McCain wants to stifle free political speech by banning negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The first ad, scheduled to begin Wednesday, features a couple discussing
McCain's statement that negative ads do little to foster constructive political
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Speakers say his position is anti-Democratic, and encourage Republican
primary voters to ``Vote for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
	   The second ad cites a provision in some versions of the Senate campaign
finance bill he co-sponsored that would ban corporations -- except federally
registered political action committees -- from sponsoring ads that mention any
member of Congress by name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ad, a woman starts discussing the bill, but is handcuffed by a
``federal speech cop'' who advises her she has ``a right to remain ... silent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Rabuck, a member of McCain's New Hampshire Steering Committee, said the
ads ``have nothing to do with the right to life and everything to do with this
group's opposition to Senator McCain's principled position on campaign finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life Committee and its South Carolina affiliate also
said they are running radio ads in that state highlighting a statement by
McCain, who opposes abortion, that he would not support repealing the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion.

	   KITTERY, Maine (AP) -- Standing at the gates of the Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard, Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer accused his GOP rivals
Wednesday of underestimating the threat China poses to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   He also urged them to support a moratorium on future military base closings
and to reverse their support for normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer argued that any policy that ``involves a mantra of repeating the word
trade, trade, trade over and over again,'' will put the country at risk, and
suggested that his rivals disagree with him because they fear offending campaign
contributors.
</P>

	   ``I think one of the factors here is that a number of my opponents get a
large amount of money from executives of companies that are dreaming of great
riches from China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer also called rival Sen. John McCain's recent comments on the issue
``cavalier.''

	   ``I'm not going to make that determination now, but I will certainly do what

<HEADLINE> Fed: Little Role in Dorm Regulations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though college dormitories nationwide share the same
combustible ingredients -- densely packed young people, many of whom smoke or
cook on hot plates -- the federal government has little role in setting fire
safety regulations for the buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's one of those (areas) that's left to state and local authorities,''
said Gary Schwarzmueller, executive director of the Association of College and
University Housing Officers International.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, state fire officials and city building inspectors treat college
dormitories the same as apartment buildings, hospitals and other group
residences. Regulations and inspection schedules are tied more to a building's
age and height than to who lives there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It depends on the structure, not the fact that it's college housing of
some sort,'' said Julie Reynolds, spokeswoman for the National Fire Protection
Association, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit advisory agency on fire safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The association estimates that in a typical year between 1980 and 1996,
there were an average of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities and
sororities, one death, 70 injuries and $8.2 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicious activity caused about 29 percent of the fires from 1992 to 1996,
with cooking causing 15 percent and smoking, 10 percent. Other causes include
heating fixtures, electrical cords, appliances, open flames. The cause of 11
percent was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   New dormitories -- like new apartment buildings -- are generally required to
have advanced safety systems such as sprinklers. But such requirements are
rarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seton Hall University dormitory in New Jersey that burned early
Wednesday -- killing three and injuring at least 60 -- was built in 1952 and had
no sprinklers. Likewise, a Murray State University dormitory in Kentucky that
burned in 1998, killing one student, predated a state building code requiring
sprinklers in dorms taller than three stories.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1997 fire at Texas Tech University led Texas authorities to investigate
all high-rise dormitories -- seven stories or higher -- on 12 campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of them were built in the '60s and '70s, before sprinkler systems
were required,'' said Jim Davis, a spokesman for the Texas fire marshal. ``Some
of them had (sprinkler) systems installed since then, some had not. We issued an
order saying you had to have them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the interest of safety, colleges ban numerous activities and materials
from the dorms. For example, Rutgers University dorms in New Jersey ban such
things as space heaters, hot plates, immersion coils, candles, incense, wall
hangings made of burlap or other flammable material, paint thinner and extension
cords exceeding 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Many colleges are grappling with the question of smoking in rooms --
although mostly out of health concerns, not fire safety. Syracuse University in
New York announced last year that it would ban smoking in dormitories beginning
this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Through the years, campus fires have had a variety of causes. A 1949 fire
that killed nine students at Ohio's Kenyon College was blamed on a spark from a
fireplace. A 1987 dormitory fire that killed a student at Wesley College in
Delaware was started by a smoke bomb set off as a prank.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Tax Plan Not Fully Disclosed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- John McCain's presidential campaign said Wednesday
his tax plan was not initially disclosed in detail, even as aides disputed
George W. Bush's claim that the proposal would raise taxes by $40 billion on
American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican contenders' tax war was highlighted by an odd confrontation
at McCain's headquarters outside Washington. It occurred after a McCain aide
offered on national television to permit Bush supporters to examine the
senator's tax plan in detail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush backers who showed up a few hours later, Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio,
and economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, were turned away minus the details they
had sought on a provision ending exemptions on some fringe benefits provided by
employers -- a provision that presumably would make those benefits taxable as
income.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur acknowledged that campaign documents listing
$151 billion in tax loopholes were not complete but insisted that details would
soon be forthcoming to show that the fringe benefit item would raise $3.9
billion, not $40 billion as Bush claims. In addition, Schnur said the plan
actually includes more exemptions for such employer-provided benefits as
continuing education, group life insurance, dependent care and health care that
have been targeted by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our original plan does include other exemptions,'' Schnur told Lindsey and
Portman. ``I hope you'll take my word for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about that comment, Lindsey said, ``There are many things I'm willing
to take on faith, but what we were reading was the plain English of the McCain
tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the McCain campaign released a document stating that McCain's
proposal would only eliminate or reduce the deductibility for employers of
payments for employee parking, meals, transportation, health spas, sports
tickets, employee discounts and athletic facilities. Aides complained that Bush
was basing his criticism on a single line, not the full proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain's plan does NOT include any possibility of taxes on
employee child care benefits, health care benefits, adoption assistance benefits
and education and training benefits,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain ran into similar trouble when he announced his health care plan;
aides had to revise several spending figures. He recently postponed a
long-awaited education speech to fend off Bush's tax attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   To the Bush campaign, McCain's refusal to release the details demonstrates
that the Arizona senator's five-year, $237 billion tax proposal was not
thoroughly worked through. Bush, who has a much larger five-year, $483 billion
tax cut, is airing TV ads in New Hampshire slamming McCain's loophole closure as
a tax increase on workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I'm doing is talking about what he put down on paper,'' Bush, the
Texas governor, said while campaigning at a restaurant in Plaistow, N.H. ``If
what he's saying is 'I'm changing it,' then I look forward to hearing what the
changes are. He had a chance in the debate in Iowa to set the record straight. I
asked him.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, criticized Bush's own tax plan as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush said he supported tax deduction for long-term health care.
He has no provision for that. As far as single parents are concerned, he has no
provisions to help the single mother in his tax proposal. We do,'' McCain said
at a Boston fund-raiser Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   He also criticized as a distortion a Bush campaign ad criticizing his tax
plan and called on him to pull it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have shown through objective documents ... that Governor Bush's charges
are false,'' McCain said. ``He has an ad running that shows false information.
In the spirit of the handshake that we made he should withdraw that spot he's
running.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the rhetoric, independent experts said it was difficult to determine
exactly what McCain's loophole elimination proposal would do because of the lack
of detail. Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director now
with the Brookings Institution, said it would be difficult for McCain's loophole
closures to add up to $151 billion without the $40 billion in fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's not $40 billion, how does McCain get to that level?'' Reischauer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign also released documents from the Joint Committee on
Taxation, which provides official estimates of tax bills for Congress, listing
the employer-provided fringe benefits that could become taxable under McCain's
plan: health care, adoption assistance, group life insurance, dependent care
assistance and meals or lodging provided for the employer's convenience.

	   ``We'd love to see the numbers,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides, meanwhile, produced a letter from Fiscal Associates, Inc. --
an independent economic consulting firm in Arlington, Va. -- saying that the
senator's tax plan ``proposed no change'' in current rules exempting many fringe
benefits from taxation. But they would not release the details needed to examine
that claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp did offer to hold a second meeting with Bush's economic
team, saying the senator's senior advisers were not available on short notice
Wednesday to go over the numbers.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Fires Under Control  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Weary fire fighters battling a series of
blazes in Cape Town said they had brought most of the fires under control
Wednesday night, although a number of residential areas were still at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The fires, which started Saturday, have destroyed at least 70 homes and
caused millions of dollars of damage to wine farms and other property. There
have been no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, the smoke blocked out the sun as the blaze tore through huge
tracts of bushland and pine forests, and ash was scattered over the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's landmark Table Mountain was covered in a thick smoke blanket.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the several hundred people who had been evacuated had returned to
their homes, said Johan Minnie, a spokesman for the city's disaster management
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Wild fires have been raging in Cape Town for five days as temperatures have
soared, reaching 105 degrees Wednesday. Weeks of hot, dry weather has made the
vegetation tinder dry.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities on Wednesday evening declared the Cape metropolitan area a
disaster area, a move that frees up more money for fire fighting and relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials pleaded with volunteers to help fight the blaze, and all
off-duty firefighters, some of whom had worked 72-hour shifts, were called back
to work.
</P>
<P>
	   In the seaside suburb of Simon's Town, site of one of the country's biggest
naval bases, seven houses and three naval buildings were gutted. Shop owners
packed up their goods as the flames came to within yards of their stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Some residents were desperately watering down their lawns and thatch roof
houses, while others waited on the pavement with their possessions, ready to
flee.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in the upscale suburb of Constantia were evacuated, and five homes
there had been burnt, Minnie said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Prowls for Dollars  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In New York on an East Coast fund-raising trip, Sen. John
McCain said Wednesday he would keep fighting state GOP leaders for a place on
the Republican primary ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he liked his chances of beating Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New
York's March 7 primary -- if voters get the chance to choose him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely I expect to be fighting in New York state for the nomination,''
McCain told reporters after meeting with Jewish leaders in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   He quipped, ``Every time I look at Governor Bush's money, I'm reminded of
the words of Chairman Mao, who said 'It's always darkest before it's totally
black.''' But he added, ``I'm very happy in the progress we've been making.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain thanked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- a Bush backer -- for supporting his
fight to keep his name on the ballot statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very grateful that Rudy Giuliani, in his characteristic style, showed
the courage to stand up for what is right,'' McCain said. ``The days of one
candidate appearing on a ballot disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of the state's
31 congressional districts, contending he failed to obtain the required number
of signatures from party members. McCain is suing in an effort to get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is not competing in Iowa, is trolling for dollars along the East
Coast this week while most of his competitors focus on the Midwest state ahead
of the nation's first caucuses there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   His money tour started with three New York events on Tuesday, including one
for which Seagram executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. was host and another sponsored by
financial news service founder Michael Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Wednesday evening fund-raiser in Boston, hosted by attorney Ernest
Klein of Hale &AMP; Dorr, McCain said the spate of fund-raisers was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I need the money,'' he said. ``We just have to continue to raise funds. I
haven't had a fund-raiser in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the cocktail reception on the 33rd floor of the State Street Bank
overlooking Boston Harbor, McCain joked with supporters about his need for cash.
``The good news is we now have enough funds to finance our efforts in
Massachusetts. The bad news is that some of that money is still in your wallets
and purses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser Thursday at the Greenwich,
Conn., home of HBO President John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   He was tapping more than just Republican money -- both Bronfman and
Bloomberg also give to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group that studies campaign finance
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That is sure to raise objections from conservatives who believe McCain
compromises too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's East Coast trip also highlights the tricky issue of collecting
money from individuals whose businesses are regulated by his Senate Commerce
Committee. The problem has dogged McCain for weeks and highlights the hazards of
crusading against a system in which he takes part.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, says such controversy can't be
avoided because 80 percent of the nation's businesses are overseen in some
fashion by the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's fund-raising ability has mirrored his rise in the polls in states
holding early primaries. He raised more than $6.1 million in the last three
months of 1999, twice as much as he took in during the preceding three months.
He reported $13.6 million in donations for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   At his meeting with Jewish leaders, McCain focused on foreign policy, saying
there are still major obstacles in the peace negotiations between Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised as president to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, an
idea that is important to some Jewish groups but opposed by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   But he took issue with his audience on another topic, saying he would not
offer clemency to convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, whose freedom has been
demanded by some Jewish activists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not release Jonathan Pollard because I believe that he betrayed
our nation and he betrayed his obligations to our government,'' McCain said.
``The evidence is overwhelming and abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Israel Miller, former chairman of the conference, said he disagreed
with McCain on Pollard but ``I was impressed by his not pandering to the
crowd.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Thursday ahead of a
weekend meeting of finance officials from major industrial nations. Japanese
stocks rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.28 yen, down 0.24 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 105.36 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 147.42 points, or 0.78
percent, to 19,045.17 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the
average closed down 298.82 points, or 1.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders were expecting quiet trading ahead of the
meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors in Tokyo
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar on Wednesday fell to a low of 105.15 yen, but rebounded to 105.37
yen in early Asian trading on bids from some U.S. and Japanese investors ahead
of the G-7 meeting, traders said. Some investors expect the group to publicly
express concern about the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials have said the yen's rapid rise against the dollar will
hurt Japanese export sales and profits, and thus adversely affect the nation's
economy which has begun to recover from a long slump.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.44 yen, down from 107.06 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started higher as many investors were encouraged
by a new record close on the technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index in New York.
The Nasdaq index ended Wednesday at 4,151.27, its first closing record high
since Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   However, players in Tokyo cautioned that buy incentives were few. "Trading
is likely to be relatively light today," said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
Tokyo Securities' stock division.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.36
points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 11,489.36.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 6.91 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,638.19. The TOPIX closed down
34.56 points, or 2.07 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7500
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7550 percent. Its price rose 0.05 point to
100.43.

<HEADLINE> Census Director Kicking Off Count  </HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNALAKLEET, Alaska (AP) -- The U.S. Census Bureau director flew to a remote
Alaska village Wednesday to get a jump on the national head count and catch the
area's residents before the rivers begin to thaw and many Eskimos begin spring
fishing.
</P>
<P>
	   While the census count begins in most of the United States on April 1,
Census director Kenneth Prewitt is starting it early in Alaska because many
rural residents leave to hunt and fish when the temperature begins to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Spring also poses a challenge for census takers trying to reach Alaska's
most remote villages. Many are well off Alaska's limited road system and can be
more than a little difficult to reach once the ice begins breaking up on the
rivers, said Tony Vaska of the census office in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
	   As Prewitt stepped from the plane into a fresh layer of snow and
temperatures hovering around zero Wednesday, he was greeted by two dozen
elementary school children shouting: ``Welcome to Unalakleet, Census 2000!''
</P>
<P>
	   Bundled in a borrowed parka, he greeted the children, then stepped onto a
dog sled that whisked him into the tiny town of 800, about 400 miles northwest
of Anchorage, for an afternoon of Native dancing and a town meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt and a group of census workers will begin knocking on doors Thursday
in the mostly Eskimo village on Alaska's western coast. In many Alaska villages,
the homes are not numbered and the streets aren't named.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want Unalakleet to set a standard for the rest of the country,''
Prewitt said. ``The census is intended to be completely inclusive. It doesn't
work if somebody is left out.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau is hoping for a better response from Alaskans than it got
10 years ago, when the state had the distinction of having the worst census form
return rate in the nation. Only 52 percent of the state's residents returned
their mail-in questionnaires, compared to 65 percent nationally.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Finds Worker Comp Problems  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The workers compensation system, which is supposed to
provide a lifeline for people injured on the job, instead offers dramatically
inadequate coverage to some workers, according to a report Wednesday by Consumer
Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   But the insurance industry says the system has made great strides in
protecting the health and safety of American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are a series of laws passed in the early 1990s by state
legislatures around the country to cut insurers' costs and stamp out fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   "The new laws have generated profits for insurers and savings for employers
mainly at the expense of injured workers," writes Marlys Harris, a Consumer
Reports associate editor, in a six-page article filled with anecdotes about
grievously injured workers who have waged lengthy battles against their workers
compensation providers.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine accuses the insurance industry of old-fashioned stinginess in
pushing laws through 29 statehouses around the country that allow insurers to
require claimants to be treated by insurer- or employer-approved doctors. And
some states lowered the number of weeks that employees could collect benefits,
and stopped benefits when an employee could return to work, among other reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine reported that workers compensation benefits paid by insurers
and employer premiums, as a percentage of payroll, fell by more than 20 percent
from 1992 to 1996. It acknowledged that some of the decline came from new safety
measures by employers and a declining number of dangerous jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Hartwig, chief economist of the New York-based industry group
Insurance Information Institute, said the workers compensation system works well
for the vast majority of people injured on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to pay all legitimate claims. Millions of workers are processed
through the system expeditiously every year, and treated very fairly," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said insurers first priority is to save money by preventing
accidents, avoiding claims in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   One person cited in the magazine article was Lisa Wurgler, a 34-year-old
nurse from York, N.D. Wurgler has been fighting an acrimonious battle with her
state's workers compensation bureau ever since back injuries forced her to leave
her hospital job and start receiving benefits in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the state government, which in North Dakota handles workers comp
claims, readily paid for an operation on her back, but that it was unsuccessful
and doctors determined the damage to be irreparable.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has since discontinued her benefits and wants to send her to a
"pain-management" clinic, which she says isn't appropriate to her condition and
won't help her. She claims the state denies the severity of her injury and wants
to send her back to work -- something she says would be a medical impossibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "They do not want to acknowledge injury," she said. "They know you'll get
frustrated and just quit."
</P>
<P>
	   Gloria David, a spokeswoman for the state workers compensation bureau,
wouldn't discuss Wurgler's case, citing confidentiality rules. But she defended
her agency's integrity and said that of 20,000 claims last year, only 322 led to
court fights. She said the agency pays all reasonable claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our focus is not on shorting the persons who are affected by workplace
injuries," she said. "Everything we do is to help them get better and get back
on their feet."

   By The Associated Press Bettino Craxi
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who defied the United States and
stood up to Italy's powerful communists during a record term as premier, died
Wednesday in Tunisia, where he fled to avoid a prison sentence for corruption
convictions. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi died of a heart attack at his seaside villa in Hammamet, said his
lawyer, Giannino Giuso.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi was Italy's longest-serving premier of the postwar years, holding two
back-to-back terms from August 1983 to March 1987, a remarkable feat in a
country of ``revolving door'' governments.
</P>
<P>
	   He stood up to the United States in 1985, refusing to hand over the
Palestinian commandos who hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise ship and killed an
elderly American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Craxi also defied Italian communists -- the largest communist party in
the West and a big-vote getter in Italian politics -- by allowing NATO
nuclear-tipped missiles to be installed in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
	   Inquiries eventually uncovered a well-oiled system in which businessmen
filled party coffers or politicians' pockets with hundreds of millions of
dollars in exchange for deals with the sprawling state economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the scandal, Craxi maintained he was an innocent victim of a
vendetta by jealous politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   He fled Italy in 1994, and a year later a Milan court declared him a
fugitive from justice. Two convictions have been upheld by Italy's highest
criminal appeals court, with sentences of 5 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in corruption
cases.
Charles Imbrecht
</P>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Imbrecht, whose career as chairman of
California's Energy Commission was cut short by alcoholism, was found dead at
his apartment Tuesday by paramedics. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother said he had died several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For nearly 14 years, Imbrecht chaired the state commission responsible for
the licensing of power plants and the development of renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
	   He also was a state assemblyman from 1976 to 1982, before losing a bid for a
state Senate seat. He was appointed to the energy post the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   He resigned the energy post in January 1997, a month after being arrested
for alleged drunken driving.
Philip Jones
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Philip Jones, who held the top trumpet position in six London
orchestras and formed a brass ensemble that played for audiences worldwide, died
Monday. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
	   No cause or location of death was given.
</P>
<P>
	   He created the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble and led the group on tours of
more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   He played for the Royal Philharmonic from 1956-60, the Philharmonia from
1960-64, the London Philharmonic from 1964-65, the New Philharmonia from 1965-67
and the British Broadcasting Corp. Symphony Orchestra from 1960-71.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones formed his brass ensemble in 1951 as a quartet. The group added a
fifth member in 1961, and as the number of engagements grew so did the size. By
1970, the band consisted of 10 players.
</P>
<P>
	   They performed throughout Europe, the United States, Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1977, Jones was awarded an OBE, or Order of the British Empire. In 1986,
he was given the higher honor of a CBE, or Commander of the Order of British
Empire.
Hedy Lamarr
</P>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Hedy Lamarr, the exotic, dark-haired beauty who
epitomized sultry glamour in a string of films in the 1930s and '40s with
leading men like Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, was found dead Wednesday in her
home. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said the death was not
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
	   Her films included ``Tortilla Flat,'' in which she played a woman who was
part-Mexican; ``White Cargo,'' playing the slave woman Tondelayo; and ``Lady of
the Tropics.''
</P>
<P>
	   She first achieved international fame and notoriety as a result of the 1933
Czech film ``Ecstasy,'' in which she acted in a steamy love scene and appeared
nude in a 10-minute swimming sequence.
</P>
<P>
	   Her American film debut came in 1938 with ``Algiers,'' co-starring Charles
Boyer.
</P>
<P>
	   One of her most successful films was the 1949 ``Samson and Delilah,'' with
Victor Mature as Samson. She got a rare chance to try her hand at comedy in ``My
Favorite Spy,'' a 1951 Bob Hope film.
</P>
<P>
	   Her career faded in the mid-'50s, when she appeared in some Italian
productions. Her last film was ``The Female Animal'' with Jane Powell in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lurid 1966 autobiography ``Ecstasy and Me,'' filled with sexy anecdotes,
some of them involving other women, became a best seller.
Madame Ruhiyyih Rabbani
</P>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Madame Ruhiyyih Rabbani, wife of a late Bahai leader and a
senior figure in the faith, died Wednesday in the Israeli city of Haifa after a
long illness. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rabbani married then-world head of the Bahai faith, Shoghi Effendi
Rabbani, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
	   Following her husband's death in 1957, she helped establish the nine-member
Universal House of Justice that Rabbani had said should replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rabbani held several senior positions and played a major role in
increasing the Bahai faith to 5 million followers worldwide.
Dennis Severs
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Dennis Severs, an American who created an idiosyncratic
history museum at his London home, died Dec. 27 of cancer. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
	   He had transformed his 18th-century home into a museum using the lives of
the Jervis family of silk weavers, who Severs believed occupied the house for
generations.
</P>
<P>
	   For two decades, Severs led visitors through his darkened hall into a

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged today that Israel
and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the outline
of a final settlement of their long dispute. With Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat due to call at the White House tomorrow, State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said if Israel and the Palestinians delayed there would be no framework
agreement by Feb. 13 or a formal settlement by the fall, as planned. "It's our

the vice president with a slight New Hampshire lead over Bradley for the first
time in weeks. Most recent public polls show a dead heat, and advisers in both

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military on Wednesday redoubled its drive
to conquer Chechen rebels, with troops fighting street by street in the capital
Grozny while helicopter gunships and cannons relentlessly pounded the southern
mountains. Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, Russia's deputy chief commander in
Chechnya, announced that the war was expected to be over by Feb. 26, although
"nobody is giving the forces any firm deadlines for ending the operation," the

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Enlarge Presence in Congo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. chief on Wednesday recommended a dramatic
increase in the small U.N. contingent in Congo to better monitor a shaky
cease-fire and pave the way for an eventual U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Security Council deploy a total of
5,537 troops, up from the current 90 military liaison officers authorized.
</P>
<P>
	   The total would include 500 military observers and 3,400 soldiers to provide
security. Also included are two marine units to make use of Congo's inland
waterway system and logistical, medical and communications officers.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear whether the council would back Annan's
recommendation for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Congolese rebels seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila signed a
cease-fire agreement with the government last summer. But the two sides have
continued to fight in violation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement calls for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and the
withdrawal of foreign troops. The rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Kabila
is supported by Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials have estimated that as many as 25,000 peacekeeper would be
required to monitor the cease-fire in Congo.

<HEADLINE> Bruno pledges support for expanded program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate will pass a measure to double the
number of elderly New Yorkers eligible for a state-subsidized prescription drug
program, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno pledged Wednesday.
<P>
	   Recounting tales of seniors crossing the border to obtain affordable
medications, Bruno said, "New Yorkers don't need to go to Canada. They need to
stay in New York to buy prescriptions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate measure would raise income ceilings for eligibility in the
state's 12-year-old Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program (EPIC), which
subsidizes prescription drug costs for some senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors who earn less than $35,000 and couples who earn less than $50,000
would qualify for the program - doubling the eligibility pool to about 229,900
senior citizens statewide. The current cutoff is $18,500 for individuals and
$24,400 for couples. The proposal also cuts average out-of-pocket expenses for
seniors' pharmaceutical purchases from $549 to $429 - or by about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   New Yorkers age 65 and older are eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed dedicating $125 million of the state's settlement with
tobacco companies to pay for the program's expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an offer no one can refuse," said Sen. Thomas Morahan, the Rockland
County Republican who is cosponsoring the bill with Sen. George Maziarz, a
Niagara County Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the American Association of Retired Persons, Americans age 65
and older account for one third of all prescription drug spending, despite
making up only 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   Families USA, a consumer group based in Washington, found that the price of
the 50 prescription drugs most often used by senior citizens is rising at four
times the rate of the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
	   For the elderly, it can become a choice of "paying their bills or taking
their pills," AARP Spokeswoman Jo Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the bill sails through the Republican-controlled Senate next week,
its fate in the Democrat-controlled Assembly is unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Larrabee, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats have long advocated broadened EPIC and would be drawing up
their own suggestions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome the Senate aboard," Larrabee said. "The Assembly has been
working to make prescription drugs more affordable for years."
</P>
<P>
	   Though he did not include funding increases for EPIC in his 2000-01 budget
proposal, Gov. George E. Pataki is behind the Senate's efforts, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Bruno said the Senate would soon begin investigating
disparities between prescription drug prices in New York and in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, has filed a bill to prohibit
prescription drugs from being sold at prices higher in New York than in other
jurisdictions and nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want pharmaceutical manufacturers to explain to us why this is the
case," Bruno said.

<HEADLINE> McCain prowls for dollars, slams state GOP leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Swinging through New York on an East Coast fund-raising
trip, U.S. Sen. John McCain slammed state GOP leaders Wednesday for trying to
push him off the Republican primary ballot.
<P>
	   He said he liked his chances of beating Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New
York's March 7 primary - if voters get the chance to choose him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely I expect to be fighting in New York state for the nomination,"
McCain told reporters after meeting with Jewish leaders in Manhattan. "Every
time I look at Governor Bush's money, I'm reminded of the words of Chairman Mao,
who said 'It's always darkest before it's totally black.' But I'm very happy in
the progress we've been making."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain thanked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani - a Bush backer - for supporting his
fight to keep his name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very grateful that Rudy Giuliani, in his characteristic style, showed
the courage to stand up for what is right," McCain said. "I keep trying to
remind the governor and (state GOP Chairman William Powers) that the Berlin Wall
is down. The days of one candidate appearing on a ballot disappeared when the
Soviet Union collapsed."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, long a champion of campaign finance reform, is trolling for dollars
along the East Coast this week, while most of his competitors work crowds in
Iowa ahead of the nation's first caucuses there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   His money tour started with three New York events on Tuesday, including one
hosted by Seagram executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and another sponsored by
financial news service founder Michael Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday evening McCain attended a fund-raiser hosted by State Street Bank
Chairman Marshall Carter in Boston, and planned another on Thursday at the
Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO President John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   He is tapping more than just Republican money - both Bronfman and Bloomberg
also give to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit research group that studies campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That is sure to raise objections from conservatives who believe the maverick
McCain compromises too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's East Coast trip also highlights the tricky issue of collecting
money from individuals whose businesses are regulated by his Senate Commerce
Committee. The problem has dogged McCain for weeks and highlights the hazards of
crusading against a system in which he takes part.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, says such controversy can't be
avoided because 80 percent of the nation's businesses are regulated by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's fund-raising ability has mirrored his rise in the polls in states
holding early primaries, most notably in New Hampshire, where he has tied or
surpassed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He raised more than $6.1 million in the last three months of 1999, twice as
much as he took in during the preceding three months. He reported $13.6 million
in donations for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting in New York with members of the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish Organizations, McCain told reporters he didn't know whether the
Bush campaign was behind the state party's efforts to keep him off the primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just wish that he would be involved and say, 'Hey, this guy is a credible
candidate. ... Let him on the ballot.' The people and Republican voters of the
state of New York deserve to make the choice, not have that choice made for them
by the party apparatchiks."
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of the state's
31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required number of
signatures from party members. McCain is suing to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At his meeting with Jewish leaders, McCain focused on foreign policy, saying
there are still major obstacles in the peace negotiations between Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   He vowed as president to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem
"immediately," an idea that is important to some Jewish groups but opposed by
Palestinians who also make claims on the city.
</P>
<P>
	   But he took issue with his audience on another topic, saying he would not
offer clemency to convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, whose freedom has been
demanded by some Jewish activists.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would not release Jonathan Pollard because I believe that he betrayed our
nation and he betrayed his obligations to our government," McCain said. "The
evidence is overwhelming and abundantly clear."
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Israel Miller, former chairman of the conference, said he disagreed
with McCain on Pollard but appreciated the candidate's candor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was impressed by his not pandering to the crowd," Miller said. "We've had
a lot of candidates here who usually say what the crowd wants to hear."

<HEADLINE> Cataract Surgery Pre-Tests Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The tests routinely given to patients before cataract surgery do not make
the operation any safer, and Medicare could save nearly $150 million a year if
they were conducted only when needed, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood tests and electrocardiograms are routinely done on cataract patients
because they tend to be older and are likely to have a number of illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, nine hospitals and walk-in clinics randomly assigned 19,250
cataract surgery patients to the test or no-test group. Patients in the no-test
group could be given medical tests only if their doctors saw a new medical
problem or an ailment that was getting worse.
</P>
<P>
	   Each group had just over 31 complications for every 1,000 operations. The
numbers during surgery and after surgery were about the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and
was led by Dr. Oliver D. Schein, an ophthalmology professor at Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
	   Schein said such tests should be done only if a patient's medical history or
physical examination indicates they are needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The study "confirms what many of us have believed from several other trials
that have gone before," said Dr. Joseph Foss, head of the University of Chicago
hospital's clinic for patients who are about to go into or have just come out of
surgery. "Routine tests, without any reason other than the patient falls into a
certain category, don't seem to have a lot of value."
</P>
<P>
	   Foss said the study should not be taken to mean that all tests are
unnecessary. He noted that about 15 percent to 20 percent of the people treated
at his hospital are poor and may not have seen a doctor for years before showing
up for a cataract operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their eyes get bad enough, they come in -- and, lo and behold, they have a
myriad of other diseases. We end up being the entry point into the medical
system for those patients," Foss said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Continue Help in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TANAGUARENA, Venezuela (AP) -- The United States will keep helping victims
of Venezuela's deadly floods despite President Hugo Chavez's recent decision to
reject hundreds of American military engineers, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving ahead. There is work to be done. Relations are good,''
Ambassador John Maisto told The Associated Press during a helicopter tour of the
coastal zone most heavily damaged by last month's massive flooding and
landslides that killed as many as 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the U.S. relief effort is less ambitious than it would have
been had the army engineers been allowed to come. There are about 120 U.S.
soldiers in Venezuela whose main mission is to help provide clean drinking water
to survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 450 Marine and Navy engineers had been expected to help rebuild the
coastal road, an essential link for the region's transportation and commerce.
But after Chavez said last week that he did not want the American soldiers in
his country, U.S. officials ordered a U.S. Navy ship that was en route to
Venezuela to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they were dismayed by Chavez's announcement, since
Venezuela's defense minister had requested the help in a letter on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambassador Maisto toured the disaster area -- a swath of coastal communities
just north of the capital of Caracas -- on a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is playing a major role in purifying water from the ocean
and contaminated rivers to give to mudslide survivors. Eighteen machines -- half
from the U.S. Army and half from a private firm contracted by the U.S.
government -- are purifying some 500,000 gallons of water a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Other countries, including Israel, France, Uruguay and Spain, have brought
their own water purification machines in Vargas state, where massive avalanches
of mud and water on Dec. 15 came crashing down the mountain that separates
Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Venezuela has
asked the Organization of American States to investigate allegations of human
rights abuses during the floods.
</P>
<P>
	   In the aftermath of the mudslides, several human rights groups accused
security agents of killing and mistreating citizens in an apparent effort to
control widespread looting. An Associated Press reporter on the scene also saw
National Guardsmen beating accused looters.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel sent a letter Tuesday to OAS chief Cesar Gaviria asking for support
in ``analyzing the denunciations.'' For the President Chavez, the letter said,
``the topic of human rights is vital.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Chavez recently called the allegations by one human rights watchdog
group, Provea, ``suspicious and superficial.'' And during his nationally
broadcast radio program last Sunday, he attacked a series of articles by local
journalist Vanessa Davies, who witnessed the National Guardsmen's abuses
alongside the AP reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   The catastrophe took on new dimensions from the vantage point of a
helicopter. Where entire communities of homes, schools and shops once stood,
there is now nothing but strewn boulders and tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
	   In the devastated town of Caraballeda, housewife Josefina Rodriguez, 50,
said she was grateful to the United States for providing drinking water to her
family, and criticized Chavez's decision to reject the U.S. military engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was help for the state of Vargas,'' she said. ``I don't know why
Chavez sent them away.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. volunteers and soldiers interviewed Wednesday said that continuing
rains were hampering relief efforts, and that the possibility of further
catastrophes was a concern.
</P>
<P>
	   In the coastal city of Tanaguarena, U.S. soldiers were forced to move water
purifying machines after heavy rains this week caused a river to change course.

Clinton Touts $110B Health Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today unveiled a whopping $110 billion
package of health insurance initiatives for his final year in office, asking the
Republican-dominated Congress to approve the largest investment in health care
since Medicare was created in 1965. Less expensive versions of the programs died
last year, in part because of the president's own veto of the Republicans' $792
billion tax-cutting plan. "These proposals are a significant investment in the
health of Americans, another step toward giving every American access to quality
health care," the president said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on
Thursday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton said he was taking on the burden of
nudging Syria and Israel along their path to peace, and that neither country is
giving up despite the suspension in talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The peace process was on the agenda for a brief Oval Office meeting between
Clinton and the crown prince of Bahrain on Wednesday evening, National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy said. Leavy did not provide specifics about the
15-minute session with Sheikh Sulman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, except to say the
discussion touched on Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Bahrain is a key U.S. ally and is the regional base for the U.S. Navy's 5th
Fleet. It is a major regional financial center for a number of international
banks, oil companies and service companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in New Hampshire, meanwhile, Republican presidential hopeful
George W. Bush said the United States should not impose a Mideast settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no lasting peace if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel
like they must accept an agreement because it makes us happy,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, most of the Gaza Strip and 40 percent of the West Bank have been
assigned to the Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and
part of Israel's capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader will have lunch with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at her home in the Georgetown section of the capital before seeing
Clinton at the White House in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   With peacemaking between Israel and Syria indefinitely suspended, the
Clinton administration appears to be under added pressure to help produce an
accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks here in Washington last
month and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.

<HEADLINE> Figure in Terror Case Faces Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A man U.S. federal agents allege is linked to a plot
involving Algerian terrorists faces a court hearing Thursday on whether he will
remain in Canadian custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Mokhtar Haouari, 31, was indicted earlier this month by a U.S. federal grand
jury for violations of the federal law against providing support to terrorists.
He was charged along with Abdel Ghani Meskini, also 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari was arrested by Canadian authorities in Montreal on Jan. 10 under a
warrant seeking his extradition to the United States, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A bail hearing was scheduled for Thursday in Montreal for Haouari, an
Algerian national who came to Canada seeking political asylum in 1993. He is not
charged with any crimes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Crown will object to Mr. Haouari's bail,'' said police spokesman Leo
Monbourquette. Officials said an extradition hearing must be set by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the indictments unsealed in U.S. District Court in New York
late Tuesday, the terror plot stretched from coast to coast and into Canada and
dates to at least 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have not disclosed any potential targets of the alleged plot or
the scope of who might be involved. Suspects in the case have been linked to the
Armed Islamic Group, known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a The New York Times report Wednesday, prosecutors said Haouari
ordered Meskini to travel to Seattle last month to meet with Ahmed Ressam -- the
man whose arrest in Washington state on Dec. 14 sparked fears of a terrorist
attack perhaps timed to millennium celebrations. Ressam is accused of trying to
smuggle bomb-making materials into the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari and Meskini are accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen
U.S. immigration identity cards and passports of other countries, including
Canada and France. They were also accused of using fake credit, bank and charge
cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   According to documents filed in Montreal courts, Haouari said he fled to
Canada in 1993 because he was wanted by military police in Algeria over his
involvement with the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. He said he left the
group in 1992 because ``it is against my principals and religion to use any form
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested in New York City on Dec. 30 after authorities said they
had connected him to Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian who has pleaded innocent and
is jailed in Seattle. Meskini was traced to Ressam through a piece of paper the
Algerian had when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days after Ressam's arrest, a Canadian woman was arrested as she tried
to cross into the country at Beecher Falls, Vt. She was later linked by
prosecutors to both Meskini and Ressam through telephone records.

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook northwestern Laos and was
felt in northern Thailand early Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of
injury or serious damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thai government's earthquake monitoring center said the quake struck at
3:59 a.m. with a magnitude of 5.9. Its epicenter was in northern Laos, 340 miles
north of Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> No. 12 Okla. St. 73, No. 14 Texas 65  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Desmond Mason broke out of a slump by scoring 30
points Wednesday night and No. 12 Oklahoma State made clutch free throws in the
closing minutes to hold off No. 14 Texas 73-65.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason had totaled just 20 points in the Cowboys' three previous games
against Division I competition. But he had 14 straight during one first-half
stretch and scored the first eight of the second half to give Oklahoma State
(14-1, 3-0 Big 12) the lead for good. His total was two short of his career
high.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mihm, who fouled out in the final minute, had 24 points for Texas
(11-5, 3-1). Gabe Muoneke, coming off a 30-point effort against Oklahoma, and
Darren Kelly each had 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason's 14-point surge in the first half included 11 in a three-minute span
during which the Cowboys turned a 17-10 deficit into a 21-18 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason didn't score over the final 9:16 of the half, however, when the
Cowboys struggled to find open shots and made just three field goals. They
trailed 30-29 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mason made sure to get the ball early in the second half. He opened with
two free throws, added a baseline jumper off an inbound pass, another baseline
shot two minutes later and a jumper from the right wing that made the score
37-30.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mason was heating up, Texas was going nearly four minutes without a
basket -- three missed shots and three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Glendon Alexander, who scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half, had a
3-pointer in transition and two free throws to give the Cowboys their biggest
lead, 54-41 with 6:36 to play. Texas got as close as five twice in the late
going, but Oklahoma State sealed the victory by going 12-of-14 from the free
throw line over the final 1:48.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas shot just 44 percent and Oklahoma State 43 percent, no surprise
considering they are two of the top defensive teams in the Big 12.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chicago Treasurer Gets New Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday ordered a new trial for
former city Treasurer Miriam Santos, saying her extortion trial was marred by an
``avalanche of errors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Five hours after the decision, Santos walked out of the federal prison camp
where she had been serving a 40-month sentence since October. City officials
were investigating a state law that could require the city to give Santos back
her job because of the reversed conviction, and possibly back pay. But they were
not certain how it would apply in her case.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they would ask the appeals court to either
reconsider its decision or bring Santos to trial a second time, possibly with
the addition of new charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized U.S.
District Judge Charles Norgle, the trial judge, citing numerous errors. Among
them was Norgle's refusal to delay the trial while Santos' original attorney
finished another case, forcing Chris Gair to take over on short notice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although the evidence against Santos was considerable, the case was not so
completely one-sided against her that we can call the veritable avalanche of
errors that we have identified harmless,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santos, 44, the Democratic candidate for state attorney general in 1998, was
convicted of threatening to bar Fuji Securities from doing business with the
city unless it contributed $10,000 to the Democratic Party of Illinois. She was
also convicted of forcing treasurer's office staff to do campaign work on city
time.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Calls for Reassessment  </HEADLINE>
    By SCOTT NEUMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The World Trade Organization needs to think about
doing things "differently" in the wake of talks in Seattle that ground to a halt
in the wake of anti-WTO protests, the organization's director-general said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   There would be no "short-term fix" to the problems highlighted at Seattle,
said Mike Moore after addressing a U.N. senior management meeting chaired by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days following the Nov. 29 opening of the WTO's meeting in Seattle,
an estimated 45,000 people took to the streets to rally against the trade
organization's policies. Hundreds of people were arrested as police in riot gear
fired tear gas in an effort to restore order to the downtown area, where some
shops were vandalized.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the protesters were angered by the WTO's refusal to link trade with
worker rights, environmental protection and human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is enormous anxiety about globalization -- the good sides of it and
the bad sides of it -- and there is a growing feeling of isolation, even
polarization from this process," Moore admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   He said organizations such as the WTO should heed at least part of the
message presented by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are things we have to do differently," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not all the folk who were criticizing what's happening were wrong," he
said, adding that the Seattle demonstrators were "on every possible issue ... as
though the WTO had authority over all these issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore said he was disappointed that Annan -- who was unable to leave his
hotel because of the Seattle protests -- was forced to cancel his speech to the
trade body, but joked that during Wednesday's meeting he and Annan "shared a few
good-natured moments about Seattle."

<P>
    WACO, Texas (AP) -- Lynn Pride scored 21 of her 25 points in the second half
to lift No. 23 Kansas to an 81-67 victory over Baylor Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Jayhawks (12-4, 3-1 Big 12) struggled in the first half, trailing
24-23 at the break before putting away the Bears (5-10, 0-5) by shooting 55
percent in the second half.

lead. Monica Arnold's jumper then brought Baylor within 43-39 but the Bears got
no closer.

Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Utah Jazz 91-88 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>

most coming on mid-range jumpers over the outstretched arms of Karl Malone.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Ransack Indonesian Island  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MATARAM, Indonesia (AP) -- With almost all tourists evacuated, hotels on
Lombok island proclaimed themselves ``Muslim-owned'' on Wednesday in hopes of
warding off possible attack by Islamic gangs.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobs have trashed and burned dozens of Christian churches, homes and
businesses on the island for three straight days.
</P>
<P>
	   One five-star resort was adorned with large banners that read: ``Islam'' and
``God is great'' in Arabic and other languages. Other establishments displayed
Islamic prayer mats at their barricaded and guarded entrances or hung them from
balconies.
</P>
<P>
	   No hotels have been directly threatened by Muslim groups. But several bars
and restaurants in the main tourist area of Senggigi were burned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The island was calm Thursday morning after police warned they would shoot
troublemakers on sight and Muslim clerics appealed to their followers to stop
attacking Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   Squads of soldiers and police patrolled the streets of the main town of
Mataram and nearby Ampenan where dozens of Christian-owned homes and businesses
along with Protestant and Roman Catholic churches were ransacked and burned over
the previous three days.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents began to clean up their neighborhoods some of which had been
strewn with debris and the ashes of burned out buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign vacationers were taken by ferry or plane Tuesday and Wednesday to
the nearby Hindu-dominated island of Bali, Indonesia's main tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going. It is too risky on Lombok for we Chinese people right now,''
said one businessman, who identified himself only as Joni, as his family joined
hundreds at the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of riot police and troops have been ordered to quell the
destruction. Even so, crowds of men wearing white Muslim caps blocked access
roads to Lombok's Lembar ferry terminal Wednesday. Some said they were checking
cars for Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 Christians, many of them ethnic Chinese, have reportedly sought
refuge in military and police bases on Lombok. Indonesia's Chinese are prominent
in business and industry and are often the target of popular resentment by the
Islamic majority.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said three people were fatally shot when Lombok's unrest erupted
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble started after Islamic activists protested against the
government's failure to curb violence between Muslims and Christians in the
Maluku archipelago in eastern Indonesia. Clashes there have claimed 2,000 lives
in the past year and the carnage has triggered a national outcry.
</P>
<P>
	   Christians used to have a small majority in Maluku and North Maluku
provinces, which collectively were known during Dutch colonial rule as the Spice
Islands, or Moluccas. An influx of Muslims from other islands in the past two
decades has changed the religious makeup and fueled tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior security minister Gen. Wiranto told reporters that the violence was
under control and that it ``will not spread to other regions.''
</P>
<P>
	   But media reports said that in Sulawesi, Muslims on Wednesday barricaded
several streets in the capital, Makassar, and attacked non-Muslim residents.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid, a moderate Islamic leader, has condemned
growing calls for a holy war against the Christian minority. He also played down
rumors of a coup and ordered military leaders to investigate whether some of its
ranks on Lombok instigated the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, military officials said 16 people were killed in four
separate clashes in the western province of Aceh, where rebels are fighting for
independence from Indonesia. Separatists in the oil-rich province accuse the
central government of siphoning off the region's wealth.

<HEADLINE> UMass Revises Admissions Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Starting next fall, race and SAT scores will have less
impact on which freshmen are admitted to the University of Massachusetts,
administrators announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The change in the admissions process grew from concerns that the school's
old system of affirmative action was susceptible to court challenges. Similar
policies have been struck down by courts around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system considers income and other factors, such as grades, state
residency and personal achievement in deciding who will be admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   When it was proposed last year, hundreds of students protested on campus.
Wednesday, when the administration announced the final policy, most students
were away on winter break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I definitely think that we are stepping back into our past,'' said Asif
Sayani, a junior from Pakistan, who predicted a stir when students return next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Administrators concede that the new process could lower undergraduate
minority enrollment from the current 17.8 percent, but they said they hope it
won't, given expanded efforts to attract and keep minority students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must continue to admit a diverse student body, not only for the benefit
of students, but also for the good of the campus and for the good of the economy
in an ever more diverse world,'' said Chancellor David K. Scott.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new process, candidates with the highest grade point averages and
SAT scores typically will be admitted, and candidates with the lowest grades and
test scores typically will be rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a middle group, equal to about 30 percent of applicants, a point
system will be used to decide who is admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   The point system ignores SAT scores -- the achievement test has been
criticized as unfair to minorities -- and instead gives a maximum of 75 percent
weight to grades and 25 percent weight to state residency, personal achievement
and potential contributions to diversity on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration spokeswoman Kay Scanlan said the factors can potentially
boost minority applicants, such as the rule that up to 5 percent of an

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Fire ravaged a freshman dormitory at Seton
Hall University Wednesday, killing three students, injuring 62 and sending
terrified, bleary-eyed students crawling in pajamas through choking smoke into
the freezing cold outside.
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned at the Roman Catholic university,
including one who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 students at the six-story Boland Hall said they thought the
4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a string of 18 false alarms that have rung
in the building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to stay in there sleeping," said Julio Olivo, 19, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   But they soon heard fellow students scream for help, smelled the choking
smoke and saw flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one of her classmates shivering in a T-shirt and
boxers, his skin completely blackened by burns. "His skin was, like, smoking,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire started and was largely contained in a third-floor student lounge,
said Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said, who said he did not
have any information that it was suspicious. Investigators are interviewing
people "who may have witnessed the fire or the moments leading up to it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the agencies investigating are his office, State Police, U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local police and fire departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they frequently saw people smoking in the lounge. Campolo
declined to comment on whether careless smoking may have caused the fire.
Smoking is prohibited in dorm lounges and hallways but permitted in certain
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the victims were found in the lounge and another person was found in
a nearby bedroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. The office
did not disclose home towns.
</P>
<P>
	   A cousin of Caltabilota said he lived in West Long Branch, Monmouth County.
The relative declined to give her name or comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta lived in Vineland, where a person answering a family phone said they
would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Karol lived in Green Brook, Somerset County, where his father, Joseph Karol,
52, said, "We're pretty devastated."
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers, but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before
they were required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses designed for firefighters' use inside the building had been
disconnected because the equipment was no longer of use, said Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider. Campolo said South Orange firefighters generally use
their own hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campolo said someone emptied at least one of the 55 fire extinguishers in
the building. The smoke alarms and extinguishers had been inspected recently and
were in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and victims' relatives still said the university could have been
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you have students living in the dorms and not have the proper
equipment needed?" said Shirley Babilonia, 24, of Paterson. "We want some
answers from the governor."
</P>
<P>
	   Babilonia's brother, 18-year-old Alvaro Loanas, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees in the fire, she said. He had attended Seton Hall on
a first-semester scholarship for disadvantaged youth provided by the New Jersey
Nets, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire occurred less than a week after the 10,000-student university
returned from winter break and sent hundreds of half-dressed, bleary-eyed
students scrambling through smoky halls outside to a subfreezing predawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said they crawled, some with clothing over their noses, on hands
and knees in human chains down the fiery hallway to safety. Witnesses said at
least two students jumped from upper floors, including one who broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, 'Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit. She was later treated for exposure because she left her room in only
a short nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider, the school's spokeswoman, said one of the dorm's resident assistants
- sophomore Daniel Nugent - returned to the burning building several times to
bring more than a dozen students to safety and perform CPR.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those are the kind of people that are in this community," Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had tied sheets together to climb down from windows, but
firefighters arrived in time and rescued them by ladder, said 18-year-old Jake
Archer of Trenton, who fled from his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, said she saw a
burned young man moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he had
painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was under control within 10 minutes after South Orange firefighters
arrived and extinguished shortly thereafter. Three female students walked out of
the dorm as late as 6:45 a.m., Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students milled around the student center, some
wearing pajamas and bundled in overcoats or wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week.
Wednesday's women's basketball game at Boston College was postponed, as was a
home wrestling match against Rutgers University scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight of the injured were students. Forty-two had been treated and
released by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Two firefighters and two police
officers were also hurt. The injuries ranged from smoke inhalation and exposure
to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old men were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine and they are very heavily sedated," Mansour
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick was among those who came to the
university to offer support.
</P>
<P>
	   He presided over a memorial service Wednesday evening at the school chapel,
where crowds of students gathered inside to hear his blessing while about a
hundred others stood outside in the bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."

<P>
	   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Jaquay Walls scored 19 of his 28 points in the second
half and Colorado upset No. 17 Oklahoma 88-80 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado (10-6, 1-3 Big 12) outshot the Sooners 55 percent to 47 percent and
made critical free throws down the stretch after Oklahoma (14-3, 2-2) fell
behind by 12 points with 8:21 left and was forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
	   Walls had 17 points over the final 10:42, including 13 of 14 free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamahl Mosley added 19 points and Will Smith had 15 for the Buffaloes, who
snapped an 11-game losing streak to Oklahoma and who had lost 37 of their
previous 39 games to the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
	   Eduardo Najera had 17 points and 14 rebounds for Oklahoma. Freshman guard
Hollis Price, who fouled out late in the game, scored 15 points for the Sooners
and Tim Heskett had 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma, which trailed 44-38 at halftime, mounted a 7-0 run early in the
second half and got within two points, but could get no closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Fox's layup, Walls' two free throws and Smith's free throw gave
Colorado its biggest lead, 68-56.
</P>
<P>
	   Price and Heskett hit 3-pointers as the Sooners cut the deficit to 70-66
with 4:48 left, but Walls countered with a 3-pointer from the corner and a
running bank shot for a 75-66 lead with 3:28 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma's Kelly Newton hit two 3-pointers, but Colorado went 11-of-12 from
the line over the final 1:19.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado outscored Oklahoma 26-11 over the last 12 minutes of the first half
to take its six-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma jumped ahead early with four straight 3-pointers, including three
by Heskett, during a 12-2 run that produced a 27-18 lead with 12:07 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
	   But Colorado then made eight consecutive baskets, including two by Mosley
and capped by two from Smith. That spurt highlighted an 18-8 run that gave
Colorado a 36-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   After Najera's 3-pointer with 9:00 left in the half, the Sooners made only
two field goals the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Mosley had 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting in the half as the Buffaloes shot 58
percent compared to the Sooners' 48 percent. Najera led the Sooners with 13
points and six rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 91, Jazz 88  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 31 points and Bobby Jackson
added 18, splitting the lane for two uncontested layups in the last 1:01 as the
Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Utah Jazz 91-88 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, starting in place of injured Terrell Brandon, added eight assists.
Malik Sealy scored 19 points and made 3-of-4 from the free-throw line in the
last 22.7 to help Minnesota snap Utah's nine-game homecourt winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett, who scored a career-high 37 in a 101-100 victory at Indiana on
Monday, had 13 points in the third quarter. He shot 6-of-8 during the period,
most coming on mid-range jumpers over the outstretched arms of Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
	   John Stockton led the Jazz with a season-high 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting
with 12 assists. He also hit a 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds remaining, pulling
Utah within the final margin but the Jazz didn't foul on the inbound play.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone scored 21 points and Bryon Russell added 12 for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota has won 13 of its last 16, losing only to division leaders Miami
(twice) and the Los Angeles Lakers. This time, the Timberwolves beat Midwest
Division-leading Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   After Minnesota lost a 12-point first-quarter lead, it turned into a game of
swings with the teams combining for 12 lead changes and seven ties.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was Garnett, who led Minnesota with 10 rebounds, stealing the show to
demonstrate why he received more votes in All-Star balloting than any other
Western Conference forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, a distant fifth behind Garnett in the voting, scored seven in the
third as the two dueled at both ends. But the Timberwolves began to take over
when Garnett hit an 18-footer with 5:01 remaining for a 79-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the margin was narrow, Minnesota appeared to have control until the
Jazz tied it with a free throw by Stockton and Armen Gilliam's fastbreak dunk
with 2:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves, scoreless for almost three minutes, answered with a 6-0
burst and went ahead 85-81 with 1:01 to play when Jackson blew past Stockton for
an easy layup.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz came up empty during that stretch because Malone, posting up
against Garnett, was called for traveling and missed inside on another
possession.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton hit a 3-pointer with 47.6 to play, pulling the Jazz within 85-84,
but Jackson beat him again for another driving layup after Garnett went onto the
wing to clear out the lane.

<HEADLINE> Mashburn, Hughes Trade Near  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Miami and Philadelphia were close to a five-player
trade Wednesday night that would send Jamal Mashburn to the 76ers for Larry
Hughes, Billy Owens and two other players, three league sources told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade was expected to be completed Wednesday but was not yet approved by
club executives on both sides. The sources, who had knowledge of the trade and
spoke on condition of anonymity, said an announcement could come as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Hughes and Owens, the Sixers would trade two more players to
make the deal work under salary cap rules, one source said. Mashburn makes $5.6
million, Owens $2.1 million and Hughes $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the deal sent shockwaves through the Sixers locker room after a
107-89 victory over Atlanta. General manager Billy King declined comment through
club spokespeople, and Larry Brown wouldn't comment, either. The players did the
talking.
</P>
<P>
	   "I say Larry is going to be right here with this team," said Allen Iverson,
Hughes' mentor and best friend on the team. "I mean, why wouldn't they tell me
if something like that was going to happen?"
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Geiger, who also has been named in other trade rumors, said, "We're
improving every night and it's not a smart decision to try to stir something up
like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, a 6-foot-5 guard who turns 21 Sunday, said he'd heard about the
possibility of going to Miami for Mashburn -- but not from anyone in charge with
the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, who scored 18 points Wednesday night, said he talked with King on
Wednesday, but "not about anything going down."
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked. There's no bad blood," Hughes said. "We speak every day. I'm in
a tough situation, they're in a tough situation. There's no bad blood."
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn, a 27-year-old small forward, is the Heat's second-leading scorer
with 17.3 points per game. He is the kind of swingman and scorer the Sixers
believe they need to advance in the playoffs. The 6-foot-8 Mashburn is in his
seventh year and has played for Dallas and Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes has been an enigmatic talent since Philadelphia drafted him eighth
overall in 1998. A natural No. 2 guard, Hughes doesn't fit the Sixers' plans
because Iverson prefers to play there instead of the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, nicknamed "Smooth" for his silky style, is close friends with
Iverson but has quietly clashed with Brown -- specifically over his defensive
play. Hughes is averaging 10.6 points and 22 minutes per game, but his playing
time has steadily declined. He logged only six minutes Saturday in Atlanta and
11 last Friday against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   Owens, a 30-year-old small forward, was acquired from Orlando on Aug. 14 for
Harvey Grant and Anthony Parker. He is averaging 6.6 points and 22 minutes a
game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sixers hosted the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. Hughes came off the
bench in the second quarter and scored 12 points. Iverson and Hughes, known in
Philadelphia as the "Flight Brothers," mistimed an alley-oop in the final
seconds of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was not on the bench in the second quarter, but he had the stomach
flu. Asked to comment on the trade as he left the postgame news conference,
Brown declined. The Heat had the night off.

<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. chief on Wednesday recommended a dramatic
increase in the small U.N. contingent in Congo to better monitor a shaky
cease-fire and pave the way for an eventual U.N. peacekeeping force.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Security Council deploy a total of 5,537
troops, up from the current 90 military liaison officers authorized. The total
would include 500 military observers and 3,400 soldiers to provide security.
Also included are two marine units to make use of Congo's inland waterway system

Researchers Warn on La Nina

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unusual weather driven by La Nina cooling in the Pacific
Ocean may be part of a larger, longer-lasting climate shift, researchers said
Wednesday after analyzing new satellite data. If the interpretation is correct,
the Southern states, as well as the Southwest, could be in for 20 years or more
of mild and relatively dry winters while the Pacific Northwest and the East
could get socked by strong winter storms. The Pacific Ocean's surface water
temperature is a dominant force behind storm intensity as well as the path of

Clinton Touts $110B Health Plan

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton Wednesday unveiled a whopping $110
billion package of health insurance initiatives for his final year in office,
asking the Republican-dominated Congress to approve the largest investment in
health care since Medicare was created in 1965. Less expensive versions of the
programs died last year, in part because of the president's own veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax-cutting plan. "These proposals are a significant
investment in the health of Americans, another step toward giving every American
access to quality health care," the president said.

Chechnya, announced that the war was expected to be over by Feb. 26, although
"nobody is giving the forces any firm deadlines for ending the operation," the

on Wednesday night. With Jordan and President Clinton watching from the owners
box and security keeping fans at bay, Washington fell behind and lost for the
eighth time in nine games. Fans held up "Welcome Michael" signs, but booed the
Wizards throughout the game. Michael Finley scored 23 points to lead the
Mavericks.
