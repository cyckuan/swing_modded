<HEADLINE> PUK Declares Unilateral Cease-fire in N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) has declared a unilateral cease-fire in northern
Iraq starting from Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The PUK called in a press release the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP), a rivaling Kurdish group, to make a similar decision
to help reach a peace settlement of their disputes, the Iraqi News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the KDP to help end the Turkish interference in
the affairs of northern Iraq and preserve Iraqi sovereignty and
political independence.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the KDP accepted the cease-fire Friday.
It said in a statement that, from now on it would "refrain from
launching a counter-attack."
</P>
<P>
The truce was reportedly mediated by the United States, Britain
and Turkey, the three sponsors of the two-year-old Ankara
process.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Turkey bombed PUK-controlled areas in its
military operations in northern Iraq against Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). The KDP, backed by Turkey, has been
fighting against the PKK in the area alongside with Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
The PUK, led by Jalal Talabani, and the KDP, headed by Massoud
Barzani, have been fighting against each other for the control of
northern Iraq after President Saddam Hussein failed to exert
effective influence in the area due to a crushing defeat in the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted last week between the two groups
following the failure of the talks they held in London with
observers from the United States, Britain and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> WHO Assists Zimbabwe In Curbing Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's malaria control
program received two million Zimbabwe Dollars (160,000 U.S.
Dollars) from the World Health Organisation, Secretary of
Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Ministry Paulinius Sikosana
said today.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 cases of malaria and 3,000 deaths were reported
throughout the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Sikosana said incidence of malaria dropped by about
30 percent this year while mortality had fallen by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
''This was due to a combination of factors, including improved
financial and material resources, intensification of spray
programmes and community awareness programmes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said icon, a pyrethroid insecticide which had been used to
successfully control malaria in a number of countries, had
received favourable response from local communities throughout
the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Likely to Rule Out First-Wave EMU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government is on
the verge of ruling out the possibility of Britain joining the
European Monetary Union (EMU) in the first wave, according to a
report in today's Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Times, British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown gave the strongest signal
so far that Britain would not join the single European currency
named euro before its official launch date on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is commonly regarded a pro-European, said that it
was "highly unlikely" that Britain would enter in 1999 and he
would not be forced into a decision for "short-term political
reasons" and would concentrate first on achieving "sustainable
growth."
</P>
<P>
"If we do not join in 1999, our task will be to deliver a
period of sustainable growth, tackle the long term weaknesses of
the UK economy and to continue to press for reform of Europe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators predict that the Chancellor is expected
to formally announce that Britain would not join the first wave of
the single European currency over the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Landmines to Be Cleared in Northeast Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
soon launch a major project to clear a potentially dangerous
minefield along the northeastern border, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project financed by the European Union and the Ministry of
Defence is already inviting international tenders to undertake
the task.
</P>
<P>
About two million anti-personnel landmines were planted in
seven minefields in the country since 1963 till to independence,
particularly on the northern border with Zambia and the eastern
and northeastern border with Mozambique. The landmines were
planted as part of the military strategy supporting continued
white minority rule in the country which ended with independence
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), there are an estimated 20 million mines in southern
Africa, one fifth of those in the world, representing a direct
threat to the health, welfare and survival of many millions of
people, mainly in the worst affected nations of Angola and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Anti-personnel mines constitute a major obstacle to
post-conflict reconstruction and development in southern Africa,
hence the resolve by the Zimbabwean government to rid the country
of these weapons of destruction.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe recently signed a treaty in support of a global ban
on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel landmines.

<HEADLINE> ANC Supports Mandela's Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) today threw its weight behind South African
President Nelson Mandela's state visit to Libya next week.
</P>
<P>
"The African National Congress fully supports President Nelson
Mandela's visit to north African countries including Egypt and
Libya," a statement of the ANC said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after criticisms of the visit from
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
National Party spokesman Boy Geldenhuys said Friday that
Mandela should cancel his visit to Libya as it held serious
detrimental consequences for South Africa's national interests.
</P>
<P>
The visit would not only put South Africa on a collision
course with the mainstream of international politics, but could
also damage relations with the United States which regards Libya
sponsor of international terrorism and seeks to isolate it both
politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said at the same day that
Mandela's visit was another foreign relations embarrassment for
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The visit violates several U.N. resolutions and jeopardizes
our friendly relationship with countries like the United States
and Britain," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response, the ANC statement said: "The ANC urges President
Mandela not to entertain concerns from parties of apartheid --
the Democratic Party and the National Party -- in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"South Africa as a new democratic country should not allow its
foreign policy to be guided by apartheid perceptions of foreign
relations," it added.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view as the ANC that South Africa should
continue to develop and cultivate relations that will lead to
understanding and cooperation among countries of the continent of
Africa."
</P>
<P>
Washington, as expected, also expressed disapproval of
Mandela's visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Thursday: "We
would reiterate the fact that, according to U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 748 and 883, flights into Tripoli are a violation of
sanctions. So I think that would be a very specific concern."
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that diplomatic contacts (with Libya) ought
to be maintained at a low level, and we would be disappointed
with the visit of any head of state."
</P>
<P>
But South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Swanepoel
said Mandela's visit to Libya would not violate UN Sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will travel to Tripoli from southern Tunisia by road.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said: "the president won't be breaking any
sanctions, he's not flying in and out."
</P>
<P>
He said that nor the visit would affect South Africa's
relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is well aware of the position of
the United States, but South Africa also has bilateral ties with
Libya, which is a fellow member of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"Through the (U.S.-South Africa) Bilational Commission we keep
one another informed of our different positions," Swanepoel said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations banned flight to Libya after Tripoli's
refusal to extradite two suspects for the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The bombing killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Obviously in response to Washington's comments on Mandela's
visit, the ANC statement said: "Solutions to international
problems and Africa in particular cannot be based on views of a
few countries, but should allow all countries of the world
including South Africa to contribute meaningfully towards their
resolution."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has insisted on developing relations with Libya,
Iran and Cuba, defying pressure from Washington, which is South
Africa's biggest donor.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to visit Libya and Egypt on his way to a
Commonwealth meeting of heads of government in Edingburg,
Scotland on October 24-27.

VIENNA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Chen Lu won the women's
singles at Karl Schafer Memorial Cup skating event Saturday and
qualified for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The first seven ladies all qualified for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Chen, the world champion in 1995 and runner-up
in 1996, led in both short and long programs to take the No. 1
overall.
</P>
<P>
Tonia Kwiatkowski of the United States, despite the same score
in the short program as Chen's, finished second, followed by
Azerbaijan's Yulia Vorobieva.
</P>
<P>
Chen, suffering right-foot injury after last year's world
championships, failed to qualify with a dreadful 25th place in
Zurich earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But her blank performance in the competition boosted her

"I am look forward to the Nagano Olympics," Chen said after the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Anti-TB Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ruling Zanu (PF)
today launched its anti-tuberculosis campaign when the disease
has manifested itself as the country's major problem with 36,000
new cases recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Launching the campaign here under the theme " Tuberculosis is
preventable and curable, let us join the fight against TB", Oppah
Rushesha, party secretary for health said, " These are indeed
depressing statistics, especially when we are told that TB is
preventable and curable. Clearly there is a problem. Why are the
cases continuing to rise? "
</P>
<P>
While the HIV/AIDS pandemic has had an impact on the rise in
new cases, Rushesha said it should not be so as TB in an
HIV-infected person was curable.
</P>
<P>
" We all have a role to play in the fight against TB. This is
not the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. We as political
leaders must join the fight against TB," Rushesha said.
</P>
<P>
Politicians could contribute in the fight against the disease
by being role models for behavioral change in order to reduce the
HIV epidemic which is fueling the TB problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
There was also need to assist the medical fraternity with the
directly observed treatment, short course (dots) to enhance the
cure rate and decrease infection, she said.
</P>
<P>
Improved housing, sanitation and nutrition, could also help in
containing the TB epidemic, Rushesha said.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Press for Solution to Mass Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The mass deportation of
Somalis by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been felt in
the Somali capital with strong reactions coming from various
civil societies and local human rights organization.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the local human rights organization,
Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center, said it has been terrified and
condemned the Saudi Arabian security forces for what they called
their inhumane and degrading acts committed against the Somalis
in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, the Saudi security forces have begun
what they called a collective punishment by cutting off both
electricity and water in the areas where the Somalis live.
</P>
<P>
The center whose condemnation was prompted by Somalis who
gathered outside their place in north Mogadishu Friday said
women, children and the elderly have been affected by the
collective punishment imposed by Saudi Arabia on the Somalis when
there's no government who would speak on behalf of them at this
crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd that gathered outside the human rights center
were victims of torture in Saudi prisons, mal-nourished people
and others who caught different sickness in the Saudi jails.
</P>
<P>
The center said they have also received deported school
children who were caught in the streets of Jeddah as they came
back from school to their home and were deported straight to
Somalia without the knowledge of their parents.
</P>
<P>
According to the human rights center, more than 3,200 deported
people from Saudi Arabia have reached here in Somalia and the
last deportee that arrived at Ballidogle Airport, 90 km southwest
of the capital, included a woman who died on the way inside the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi security personnel have also collected women who
just gave birth at the hospitals for deportation, while their
other children and husbands were left behind, the center noted.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center also expressed concern over the fate
of thousands of Somalis who are now stranded in the dessert in an
attempt to escape the security forces and others who are still
absconding.
</P>
<P>
The center has proposed that the Saudi authorities should come
up with planes to cope with the crises regarding the Somalis and
their human rights be respected.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the international community, the Arab
League, international watch dog organizations and regional
organizations to give the Somalis a special consideration when
there isn't a government to represent their interests.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Tourism Promotion Campaign in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan delegation left
here today for a week-long tourism sales, marketing and
promotional campaign in Europe in a bid to stem further drop in
tourist bookings.
</P>
<P>
The delegation composed of representatives from government
departments and the private sector is scheduled to visit Germany,
Italy, Switzerland and France.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, violent actions in
the tourist resort of Mombasa and its environs which claimed
more than 60 lives had led to massive cancellation of tourist
bookings on the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, coastal hotels in the violence affected areas
suffered an unprecedented drop in bed occupancy rates which
declined from a peak of 80-90 percent to a record low of 0-25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the delegation led by
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and
Wildlife S.M. Mbova is designed to arrest further decline in tourist
bookings.
</P>
<P>
Local press attributed the sharp drop to the consistent
reports by west media that the East African country was not a
safe travel destination.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will meet with key tour operators, travel
agents, charter flight operators and media representatives and
tell them Kenya was safe.
</P>
<P>
The team will also seek to reassure European tourists that
calm had been restored and life returned to normal in Mombasa and
its environs.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Kenya's biggest foreign exchange earner with 493
million U.S. Dollars fetched last year.

<HEADLINE> 6 Killed in Flooding in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were
killed and four others missing today in car accidents and severe
floods across Israel caused by storm slashing the country over
night, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Thunder storms and pouring rains hit the country from Friday
night till this afternoon from the Lake Kinneret (Galilee Sea) in
the north to the southern city of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed in car accidents on flooding roads
throughout the country. In a serious car accident near Ein Gedi
off the shore of the Dead Sea, three people were killed and three
others including two children were rescued, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
One man escaped from a car accident in flood near Arad in the
southern Negev desert, but his two fellows were missing, according
to the radio.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter was dispatched to rescue one man and one woman who
were injured when their car swept off the road broken down in the
floods in the Ein Gedi Natural Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain caused severe floods in wadis and canyons in the
West Bank and Negev Desert, posing threats to the life of hikers,
Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
One of the hikers was killed in the Nahal Qumeran Canyon, east
to Jerusalem, overnight in flooding. Two others went missing in
storms in the Beit Shean area in the West Bank. And 28 people were
rescued by a helicopter sent to them, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Storms also led to power failure, which, in one case, forced
the Allenby border crossing between Israel and Jordan to be closed
overnight and passengers were transferred to another checkpoint in
the south.

<HEADLINE> UAE Reiterates Commitment to OPEC's Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today reiterated its commitment to the oil output quota of
some 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, UAE's Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir said that his
country, an important OPEC member, would not ask for higher
production ceiling unless the majority of other OPEC members do
so.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OPEC member states have reached consensus to
maintain the current oil output ceiling during last June's
meeting and any new development in the field will be discussed
at the next meeting due in November.
</P>
<P>
The current OPEC ceiling, which was set in September 1993 with
the exception of Iraq's, stands at 25.03 million bpd and has
remained unchanged since then.
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC's reports show that the actual output now is
running nearly 2 million barrels a day in excess of the
ceiling because many members are known to have been exceeding
their quotas.
</P>
<P>
The UAE oil minister called on the OPEC producers to
conscientiously maintain their oil production quotas to shore up
oil prices and stablize the world crude market. "This would
benefit themselves," he said.

<HEADLINE> Merger Wave Knocks at US Accounting Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The merger wave which has
recently swept across several industries of the United States and
Europe is likely to hit two major U.S. accounting and consulting
firms, creating the world's largest accounting company.
</P>
<P>
KPMG and Ernst &AMP; Young, already the world's giants in the
industry, are expected to merge into a business with a combined
revenue of 15.3 billion U.S. dollars and 11,712 partners, the New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
With this deal, said to be announced next week, "the Big Six"
accounting firms in the U.S., a result of the merger from "the Big
Eight" in the late 1980s, will become "the Big Four" if the
September announcement of another merger of two accounting firms
is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse are discussing to become
one with revenue expanding to 11.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two merger plans unvealed in a relatively short period
involve a total revenue of over 27 billion dollars, or 62 percent
of the total "Big Six."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the merger action shows the efforts the accounting
firms are making to seek ways of reducing costs and expanding
international operations in a globalization trend which also
affects the services industry.
</P>
<P>
U.S. accounting firms are reporting slowing business on their
traditional lines and auditing has become fiercely competitive.
</P>
<P>
U.S. accounting businesses have largely gone abroad, but they
want to stride more rapidly by forming stronger alliances.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the current "Big Six" have a combined
overseas revenue of 25.66 billion dollars, against 17.4 billion
dollars for the U.S. market, at already a six to four ratio.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Bahrain to Set up High-Level Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Bahrain today
decided to establish a joint committee to strengthen their ties,
the Bahraini news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin
Mubarak al-Khalifa and visiting Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh agreed to set up the committee which would be led by
prime ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed bilateral relations and agreed to further
exchange high-level visits in order to boost coordination between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh arrived in Bahrain today for a two-day visit which
was considered part of Jordan's efforts to improve its relations
with Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with the Gulf states were cut off due to
the kingdom's support for Iraq during the Gulf War crisis caused
by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan's ties with the Gulf states have been improved in
recent years as Jordan distanced itself from Iraq. In the past
years, Jordan has sent many senior officials to make diplomatic
shuttles in the oil-rich region. King Hussein of Jordan has also
visited some Gulf states in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Harassment Against its Ambassador Must Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foregin Minister Amr
Moussa said today the alleged campaign of harassment against
Egypt's Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouni must stop.
</P>
<P>
"Such provocations should not happen again," Moussa told
reporters. He is expected to raise the issue during a lightning
visit to Israel to take part in the opening of the Middle East
Peace Institute Monday.
</P>
<P>
But when assessing the issue, Moussa said, Egypt will take into
consideration the Israeli official apology for the alleged
harassment against Bassiouni.
</P>
<P>
Moussa has met with Bassiouni after the latter returned home
Monday for a short stay. Bassiouni, who has served as Egypt's top
diplomat to Israel for 17 years, complained that he has been
bothered by Israeli officials and threatened to go home.
</P>
<P>
He had protested against a series of threatening calls on his
home phone and what he said was a decision by Israeli authorities to
allow a demonstration outside his residence.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that his official car was searched by Israeli
border guards at the Rafah crossing from the Gaza Strip into Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign
Minister David Levy had spoken to the ambassador to reassure him
that he had their respect and his accusations would be taken
seriously, according to the Middle East Times.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli Foreign Ministry denied there was any
official harassment of Bassiouni and expressed "regrets" over the
Rafah incident.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's visit comes at the invitation of former Israeli prime
minister Shimon Peres, who is the founder of the peace institute.
</P>
<P>
The visit "testifies to Egypt's adherence to peace and keenness
on pushing forward the peace-advocate trend inside Israel," Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will hold a number of meetings during his
few-hour visit to Israel without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state and has played a significant role in mediating the
Israeli-Arab peace talks.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Moves for Fresh Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has reacted to a call by west African foreign ministers for
fresh talks on resolving the country's crisis since the May 25
coup that ousted the legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
A junta spokesman said on Friday that the foreign minister of
the military regime, Alimamy Paolo Bangura, would lead a
delegation to neighboring Guinea next Wednesday to meet his west
African counterparts on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea,
Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, mandated by west African leaders to
handle the crisis, expressed their willingness to resume dialogue
with junta on peaceful settlement of the crisis in the country on
some conditions.
</P>
<P>
The previous dialogue broke down in July when the junta said
it needed four years to quit.
</P>
<P>
It seems that this time the junta is still reluctant to an
immediate hand-over to the ousted civilian government as required
by the United Nations which announced sanctions early this month.
</P>
<P>
Announcing next week's meeting with west African foreign
ministers, the junta spokesman said, "we are asking the UN and
rest of the international community to give us a transition
period during which we can organize fresh elections."
</P>
<P>
"We are assured of our security at the talks because the UN,
Commonwealth and Organization of African Unity will be sending
observers," Alliu Kamara said, quoted by a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which
embraces Sierra Leone, has imposed sanctions against the junta
since the coup, while holding talks with the coupists.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member sub-regional body also warned of possible use of
force to oust the junta if dialogue and sanctions fail.
</P>
<P>
Following the UN sanctions, ECOWAS foreign ministers gave
their conditions for resumed talks that representatives of the
illegal regime led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma must have
requisite mandate to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also demanded that the regime must negotiate in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the negotiations should strictly be within the
mandate of ECOWAS and the UN Security Council, which focuses on
the junta's immediate quit and return power to the ousted
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The call was followed by repeated clashes between the junta
and ECOWAS peacekeepers, which reached a new peak with the
country's telecommunications facilities and radio and television
stations in the capital Freetown damaged over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
As a result, hundreds of people fled Freetown and more are
expected to flee if next Wednesday's dialogue fails.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Establishing Arab Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
called on Arab countries today to boost economic cooperation and
establish an Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 7th Arab Businessmen
and Investors' Conference here, Hrawi said that the Arab world
should step up economic cooperation to protect their interests in
the region and in the world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the proposal to establish an Arab
common market was put forward 33 years ago, but it was still being
discussed today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference to promote Arab integration, which was
first held in 1982, was hosted by the 22-member Arab League, the
Federation of Arab Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Arab
Investment Insurance Organization.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 delegates, including ministers from Saudi Arabia,

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcies in California Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of Californians
seeking shelter from their debts declined in the third quarter,
breaking a nearly four-year string of soaring bankruptcies, a
research firm reported here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,650 personal bankruptcies were filed statewide in
the July-September period, 5.5 percent below filings in the second
quarter, according to statistics released by CDB Infotek in Los
Angelos.
</P>
<P>
The California figures follow the release earlier this week of
a report showing that personal bankruptcies nationwide also
decreased. A total of 335,218 people sought Bankruptcy Court
protection in the United States in the third quarter. That was
down 4 percent from the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe the new numbers indicate that an
improving economy and continued job growth are at last having a
positive effect on how households manage their debts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy entered its seventh year of unbroken growth --
its third-longest expansion since World War II, while its jobless
rate has been decreasing during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
However, personal bankruptcies in California as well as in this
country had doubled from the end of 1993 to this year's second
quarter, a phenomenon attributed to increasing debt loads and the
growing social acceptance of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, people seeking bankruptcy protection
have found it far easier to receive more credit after filing. Many
lenders have pushed to reform the nation's Bankruptcy Code to make
it more difficult for borrowers to shield certain assets from
creditors.
</P>
<P>
A federally appointed panel, the National Bankruptcy Review
Commission, on Monday will present its package of proposed changes
to Congress and the White House.

<HEADLINE> US Local Governments Act Against Genetic Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An individual's genetic
information could be misused by the insurance company and many
U.S. states are outlawing such a practice.
</P>
<P>
These states have found that some insurance and health firms
are requiring or using genetic information to deny coverage or
increase premiums of those people predisposed to develop a cancer
or other illnesses, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
At least 26 states have passed laws to prevent such instances
from happening, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some of these states have authorized criminal penalties or
lawsuits for damages following the unauthorized disclosure of
genetic information.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have complained that the Federal Government
acts "too slowly" in protecting the confidentiality of individual
genetic information.
</P>
<P>
A number of congressmen argue that they did not take
legislative action because they fear that it may hinder genetic
research and clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
At least one state has passed law defining genetic information
as personal property. Citing Oregon as an example, the Times said
some researchers and drug makers are seeing such a law
"premature."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is planning
to widen exploitation of natural gas to devote this natural
resource as the engine of domestic industrial growth, a senior
Saudi official said today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Industry and Electricity Minister Hashim Yamani made the
remarks while inaugurating a three-day seminar in Saudi western

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Attendance of Doha Conference Depends on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's participation in the
fourth Middle East and North Africa economic conference hinges on
whether or not a headway will be made in the Mideast peacemaking,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
"By headway, we do not mean the form which involves meetings
and handshakes but rather by this we mean success on all axes
especially the Palestinian track," Moussa said in statements to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"In more general words by progress, we mean how much Israel
is delivering on its previous and present promises regarding the
peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said the Israeli practices left little to be
optimistic about the economic conference slated for November
16-18 in the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say that the majority in Egypt, in the area and
outside it feel pessimistic about the peace process," he said,
commenting on Israel's declaration that it will not hand over
more land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the statement
hours before the arrival to the region by U.S. Mideast peace
coordinator Dennis Ross to advance the peace process that
jump-started after a seven-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said there are some U.S. initiatives to bring
Palestinians and Israelis to talk together but Cairo has to wait
and see.
</P>
<P>
"But as everybody is pessimistic and casts doubts on the
possibility of reaching tangible results, the most prevailing
words at present are that these meetings are useless and to no
avail," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has denied U.S. State Department reports that
U.S. received pledges from a number of Arab countries, including
Egypt, to take part in the conference and linked its
participation in a shift of the Israeli policy toward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process came to a halt in March after Israel
obstinately went ahead with the building of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem despite world outcry.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries have either rejected or threatened to
boycott the Doha conference which is to include Israel. But Qatar
said it expects 82 countries, including 12 Arab countries, at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the peace process that started in 1991,
the annual MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Amman and
Cairo since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Purchase Suburban Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Local consumers in Shanghai,
the most populous and industrial metropolis in China, are
purchasing a growing number of houses and apartments in suburban
areas, according to local experts.
</P>
<P>
In the first two quarters of this year alone, sales of houses
and apartments in the outskirts of the Pudong New Area and the
Xuhui, Minhang and Jiading districts accounted for 85 percent and
75 percent of the municipality's total housing sales.
</P>
<P>
The experts attributed the new trend to the improved
transportation conditions resulting from the completion of
infrastructure such as subways, bridges and other communication
facilities built in recent years, as well as relatively low
housing prices in the area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, new residential areas in Shanghai feature easy access
to post offices, schools, hospitals, shops and recreational
facilities, as well as an adequate green areas.

<HEADLINE> Top Swimming Official Reveals Secret of China's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese swimming
official said here on Sunday that the success of Chinese swimmers
in the past decade was made through hard efforts of several
generations of the people.
</P>
<P>
Guo Qinglong, President of the Chinese Swimming Association,
made these remarks at a press conference held right after the
final event of the swimming competition of the National Games.
</P>
<P>
He said the government showed a great concern for swimming and
more than 7,000 swimming pools have been built in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement in infrastructure provides material ensurance
for the development of swimming," Guo said. "Some 10,000 children
are undergoing systematic trainings in the country. We can choose
talents from such a big group of youngesters."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimming official also said there are some 3,000
coaches in the country and 80 per cent of them had their special
trainings in colleges.
</P>
<P>
He said scientific way helped coaches end the history that
swimmers were choosen by experience instead of scientific methods.
These specially-trained coaches have produced dozens of Olympic
and world champions since 90s.
</P>
<P>
Guo hit back at the rumours that Chinese swimmers' performance
was enhanced by banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
"That's a fabricate rumour," he said. "China will, as always,
support the anti-doping compaign. Any athletes who used banned
drugs to enhance their performance will be severely punished."
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers broke two world records and nine Asian marks
in the current Games. However, he said China can by no means get
proud of the achievements made in home competitions.
</P>
<P>
"We must look forward and aim at the World Swimming
Championships in January in Perth, Australia, and even the Olympic
Games in the year of 2000."
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to learn from other countries," he said.
"It's imperative for us to keep our eyes open at all time."

<HEADLINE> Currency Adjustment to Boost Exports: Pak Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar today defended the government decision of the adjustment
of the country's currency, saying it would boost exports and help
to compete with trading partners.
</P>
<P>
In an interview telecast by Pakistan Television here, Ishaq
said the adjustment of the rupee would not only focus on exports
but also increase GDP (gross domestic product) growth.
</P>
<P>
Ishaq said the devaluation of Pakistan rupee by 8.71 percent,
which was announced by the State Bank of Pakistan last week, would
also bring benefits to agricultural as well as industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
"This decision has been taken in the larger interest of the
country aimed at boosting exports and competing trading partners
actively", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the adjustment will also reduce the trade gap and help
bring inflation rate to a single digit.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question regarding external pressure to adjust
the currency, the commerce minister categorically rejected such
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The decision was not taken under any pressure from any quarter
but added it was a bold decision of the government to compete in
international market, Ishaq said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that some external factors forced the
adjustment of the currency but he declined to elaborate on them.
</P>
<P>
If the decision to adjust the currency had not been taken
exports of the country would have gone down, he said, adding
trading competitors including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
devalued their currencies by 20 to 40 percent in the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the stability of commodities' prices, he
assured they will remain stable and warned that the exploiters and
black-marketeers would be dealt with an iron hand.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Frees 80 Government Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan's Islamic opposition
forces released more than 80 government soldiers captured during
the five-year civil war, the Itar-Tass News Agency reported from
Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the opposition forces chief of staff Davlat
Usmon as saying that the act was a humanitarian action under the
peace agreement, signed by Tajik president Emomali Rakhmonov and
the opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The servicemen had been held by field commander Mirzo Ziyeyev
during the past two to three years in the Tavil Dara valley about
200 kilometers east of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
The freed soldiers and officers on Sunday morning moved from
Tavil Dara to Dushanbe under the convoy of peacekeeping troops and
U.N. military observers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tajik opposition forces still hold
about 250 captives at present.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Tajik government decided to free about 170
opposition supporters on October 18-19 under the law of amnesty,
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the peace agreement was put in
doubt after a series of bombings and armed attacks, which killed
18 Tajik soldiers last week.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Further Development of Special Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China will further explore the
role of special economic zones and the Shanghai Pudong New Area in
the development of the country's coastal areas, according to the
strategic plan introduced during the recent 15th Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
The strategy calls for China to continue efforts to restructure
and upgrade its industries and expand reform and opening in
central and western regions, with special economic zones
continuing to play an active role in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
The nation's five national special economic zones -- Shenzhen,
Hainan, Xiamen, Zhuhai and Shantou, the Shanghai Pudong New Area
and other open regions in coastal areas should play a leading role
in introducing suitable mechanisms, upgrading the industrial
structure, deepening reform and promoting further opening up.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented economic zones enjoy relatively strong
economic and technological operations, advantageous locations and
preferential policies. Their common historical task is to lead
China's economic upsurge and narrow the development gap between
the coastal and inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The demands of the socialist market economy and the integrated
global economy require the special economic zones and the Shanghai
Pudong New Area to accelerate the transformation of government
functions and the establishment of a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
They should undertake further development in order to provide
successful experiences for the other parts of the country. They
should not only improve their competitiveness in the international
market, but should also enhance ties with inland areas in order to
make greater contributions to the nation's overall economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China, a country with vast territory, has a long way to go to
achieve balanced development between coastal and inland
areas. However, further developing coastal areas and gradually
placing development priority on inland areas will ensure the
steady and healthy growth of the whole country.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers should master modern
agricultural means and rely closely on technical progress to
increase agricultural production, according to Senior Chinese
Communist Party official Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the comments during a three-day visit to Tianjin
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
He called on rural party organizations at all levels to study
the guidelines of the recent 15th CPC national party congress and
implement them consicentiously.
</P>
<P>
And in the light of the specific conditions in rural areas,
farmers should strive to resolve practical problems that have
cropped up rural reform, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu also calls for still greater efforts to train more qualified
rural personnel and use them well and in a proper way. He urged
local agricultural officials to adjust rural structure, focus on
efficiency and use more advanced technology to improve the
structure of farm products.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he encouraged the development of processing and the
marketing of agricultural products and noted that most Chinese
farmers are still preoccupied with simply growing crops.
</P>
<P>
Hu visited the homes of farmers and held talks with local rural
officials. Tianjin Party Secretary and Mayor Zhang Lichang and
other ranking municipal official accompanied him on the visits.

<HEADLINE> Black Upsets Kuerten to Win HK Tennis Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Byron Black upset
Brazil's French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten in a marathon-style
final to win the men's singles title of the 722,500 U.S. dollar
1997 Marlboro Tennis Championships in Victoria Park here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Black, 28 and ranked 61st in the world, held world eleven
Kuerten to five sets in a time of three hours and 23 minutes,
before winning 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5). It was the
first five-set final in the history of the annual event.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, 21, became the top favorite here after winning the
French Open crown earlier this year in Paris. He qualified for
the final after beating Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-4 in the
semi-final here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Black won his final berth after defeating Germany's former
world number one Boris Becker 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 in the
other semi-final match.
</P>
<P>
In a test mainly of baseline play, it was Black's consistency
and sudden burst of poor temper on the Kuerten's side that finally
brought the thrilling match to Black's favor.
</P>
<P>
After they took one set each, usually cool Kuerten began
murmuring against bad calls that seemed to cost his game in the
third set. After being warned by the referee before the start of
the eighth game, the Brazilian became so upset that he looked
reluctant to retrieve shots on his court.
</P>
<P>
But Kuerten managed to pull himself together after the break
and won the fourth set to level with his opponent two sets to two.
But accurate passing shots and times of net volleys helped Black
to seal the set and the triumph.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Kuerten was strong in forehand
shots while his opponent benefited much from the backhands. A
surprisingly high rate of unforced errors including unsuccessful
net play attempts damaged Kuerten's chances.
</P>
<P>
In a later final today, Thomas Johansson and Mikael Tillstrom
from Sweden defeated Black and American Jonanthan Stark 3-6, 6-3,
7-6 (10-8) to take the doubles title.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's integrated social
development index for 1996 surged by 9.6 percentage points on the
previous year, despite a drop in the unemployment rate
according to a report by the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The integrated index consists of data on the environment,
population, economy, income distribution, social guarantees,
employment, health care, culture, sports, education and social
security.
</P>
<P>
The index for income distribution rose by the widest margin,
with the annual rate for 1996 standing at 23 percent. The index
for social security ranked second with a growth rate of 19 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that employment, the only area with negative
growth, dropped 11 percent when compared to the corresponding
figure in 1995. Over 5.52 million people were unemployeed at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts further noted that the structure of employment improved
somewhat last year, with more farmers going to work for township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report indicated that China's coastal regions
continue to lead the country in social development.
</P>
<P>
However, central and western regions recorded accelerated
growth in social development in 1996, with respective growth rates
of 6.9 percent and 10.6 percent. The rate for the eastern region
stood at four percent.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Makes Further Efforts to Stimulate Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, in a struggling
effort to shore up stock prices, came out with a package of
measures to stabilize the ailing stock market today, which calls
for the expansion of tax favors to stock investors.
</P>
<P>
The measures are mainly focused on tax cuts for foreign
investors, promising benefits for long-term stock investors to
curb massive stock sell-offs and tax cuts for those who invest in
venture funds run by investment trust companies.
</P>
<P>
The government announced its first long-term stock market
boosting measures on October 13, but failed to prevent the
continued drop of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul stock market has suffered sharp declines with the
composite stock price index plummeting to 584.71 over the weekend,
the lowest point in five years.
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken this time are expected to stop the
plummeting share prices at least for now, market observers
projected.
</P>
<P>
However, they added the brakes will not be on for long unless
the negative factors still affecting the market, such as political
unrest and financial turmoil, are pacified.
</P>
<P>
The continuing lack of liquidity in funding institutions,
coupled with the worst financial crisis South Korea has seen in
recent years, had prompted fears of back-to-back bankruptcies of
large business groups and their affiliate firms for quite some
time.
</P>
<P>
The market was also largely influenced by outside factors such
as the slush-fund allegations launched by the ruling New Korea
Party against the opposition presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung,
market analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Thanong
Bidaya announced his resignation here tonight at his residence
after exactly four months in office.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that he would remain at his post
until a forthcoming cabinet reshuffle completes and his successor
is appointed, so as to avoid disruption of work at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said he had informed Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh of
his decision.
</P>
<P>
He did not say why he had decided to resign, but it is believed
that he was not happy with Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
who revoked a petrol and diesel oil tax hike by one baht per
liter, which Thanong had announced only three days before, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thanong was in favor of an oil tax hike to earn more national
revenue and to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a budget surplus of 1 percent of gross domestic product
in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister on Saturday told a rally in a
northeastern province that the oil tax hike had affected the
people's life and was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
Some mass organizations had planned to stage demonstrations to
demand the prime minister's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Thanong, a non-MP and president of the Military Bank, had been
invited by the prime minister to succeed Amnuay Virawan, who
resigned on June 19.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chavalit government took office in December last
year, the government has had two finance ministers, who had
followed different financial policies.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay refused to unpeg the baht from the US dollar and spent
several billion dollars to rescue the baht at offshore money
markets when the baht was under pressure to devalue, while
Thanong, only 13 days after he became finance minister, decide to
float the baht, and requested assistance from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2 the baht has depreciated by about 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, local television reported that the
prime minister was holding a meeting with leaders of five other
coalition parties to discuss a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that if the prime minister decides to have a
reshuffle, ministers and vice ministers in charge of economic
affairs will be affected, so as to improve the country's
macroeconomic and financial administration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grain Importer Confident About Sino-US Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Mingchen, president of the
China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export
Corporation (COFCO), said that there exist new opportunities for
US agricultural products to share a bigger part in Chinese market,
which will help create a long-term and stable environment of
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, also a member of the delegation that will accompany
President Jiang Zemin on a state visit to the U.S. later this
month, noted that U.S. wheat now accounts for more than a third of
China's annual wheat imports, and China also imports a large
amount of soybeans, barley, and other grains from the US every
year, or about 8 to 9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fierce competition in the world grain market, China
has always been one of the major buyers of the US agricultural
products, with orders on 89.38 million tons of American grain
since 1972, worth about 13.4 billion US dollars, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The grain imports have played an important role in reducing the
U.S. trade deficit with China and have helped create jobs in the
U.S., and they have also had a favorable impact on US grain
growing and the reduction of stockpiles, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' agriculture departments have negotiated
obstacles to trade, such as TCK, a wheat disease found in US wheat
shipments to China, and the China National Cereals, Oils and
Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation (COFCO) has established
links with many grain grower associations, food processing
companies, and congressmen from grain growing areas in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Food co-operation has even gone beyond grain imports and
exports. the COFCO has set up a joint edible-oil venture with the
U.S.'s ADM in the city of Zhangjiagang in east China's Jiangsu
Province, and "This is just the beginning," Zhou said.

</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, a multi-level Sino-US cooperation in
agricultural area will help more US products accede into Chinese
market.

<HEADLINE> Improving the Quality of Chinese Citizens (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Monday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
entitled "Making Efforts to Improve the Quality of the People".
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for priority to be placed on improving the
overall physical, intelligence and ideological quality of Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
The editorial quotes Jiang Zemin's report to the recent 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China as saying:
"Building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires
extensive efforts to improve the ideological, moral, scientific
and cultural quality of the entire nation in order to foster
successive generations of people who will meet the requirements of
socialist modernization, and who will have high ideals, morality,
culture and discipline."
</P>
<P>
The quality of the people refers to the overall physical,
intelligence and moral levels of the Chinese citizens, in
reforming the nature and society, according to the editorial. It
notes that related efforts will be an important symbol of the
integrated power of the country, as well an important factor in
international competition, and the base for the nation's economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has created a splendid civilization for
mankind despite an extended period of backwardness and
underdevelopment. The present-day quality of Chinese citizens
falls far short of the needs of the current modernization drive
and has severely hampered the nation's economic and social
development, according to the editorial.

have accounted for 60 percent and 80 percent of the city's total,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
These ventures achieved 20 billion U.S. dollars of industrial
output in 1995, double the figure for 1993. The foreign-funded
enterprises that have gone into operation have generated 6.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports by these ventures reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1996, some 10 times more than in 1991, and accounted for 85
percent of the city's total.

machine-building industry, textiles, chemicals, building materials
and aquatic products.

Le, who won the 100 meters title early. The third place went to
Shanghai's Ye Peipei with 25.44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
This was a repeat of Le's loss at the Atlanta Olympic Games,
where she captured the gold in the 100m while let the 50m slip off
her hands.
</P>
<P>
Liu Limin of Hubei, world record holder in the short-course
100m butterfly, finished a distance fourth place in the women's
200m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yun of the Chinese Army took the event with a year-best time
of 2:08.10, followed by Hu Ning of Liaoning with 2:08.34.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan of Guangxi, who broke the world 200m individual
medley record on Thursday, finished third with 2:10.45.
</P>
<P>
"She has made rapid progress recently and has the calibre to
challenge the world record holder Le," said Le's coach Zhou Ming,
also deputy head coach of the Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
Zhou added that the Shanghai native badly wanted to win the
gold. "Her aim is to win the gold, the second is to break her own
world record."
</P>
<P>
Shan, who beat Le in the 100m event but flopped in the 100m at
the Olympic trials in April, 1996, said the key to victory is an
upperhand she enjoyed in the start.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yun, also gold medalist in the 200m buttfly in the seventh
National Games four years ago, fell to a slump in the past two
years. "This might be a turnpoint for me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Qu had expected Liu Limin will be her top challenger in the
day's competition. "She is the best butterfly swimmer in China,
but I don't know why she slipped to the fourth," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200m backstroke, Fu Yong of Shandong set an Asian
record of 1:58.72 to capture the gold, while his fellow Jin Hao
completed a gold double in the 1,500m freestyle with 15:36.65
following his victory in the 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The final swimming gold of the National Games was won by the
local foursome in the men's 4X100m team medley relay.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A concerted effort has been
launched by the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol) to check international money laundering, Interpol
Secretary General Raymond E. Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Trust of India (PTI) today, Kendall said in
an interview with PTI that international money laundering is
"currently one of the most worrying forms of international crime."
</P>
<P>
However, lack of proper legislation in a fair number of
countries and differences in legal, political and law enforcement
systems make the task difficult, said Kendall, who was here to
attend an international conference of Interpol held in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Fraudulent commercial operations are conducted by people
ranging from legitimate businessmen trying to evade taxes to drug
traffickers and smugglers trying to send money abroad, especially
to tax heavens through illegal channels, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that distinction should be made between tax evasion
and laundering of proceeds of crime.
</P>
<P>
"We are launching an attack on organized crime and the most
effective way to deal with it is to take away its financial
back-up," Kendall stated.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's retail sales
index declined by 10.8 percent in August over July this year, the

exception of general provision and sundry shops, encountered sales
declines in August over July, as textiles, wearing apparel and

equipment, by 14 percent, and motor vehicles by 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malawians Banned to Buy Maize in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
forbidden Malawians from purchasing maize in its backwater
province of Niassa, to protect the interests of the local farmers
and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Bonifacio Aly, governor of Niassa, the largest province in
Mozambique, said Saturday that proof has showed that some traders
from Malawi are entering into the province to buy maize. Malawi
has been hard hit by drought this year.
</P>
<P>
Niassa, a province with an area of 129,000 square kilometers,
is a province bordering Malawi and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
As no Mozambicans go to buy maize in the province, some
foreign traders, mostly from Malawi, have crossed the border for
the purchase of maize, which is banned by the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
Aly encouraged Mozambican traders to go and purchase maize
in the province and sell it along the border or in Malawi, but
said Malawians are not allowed to do this.
</P>
<P>
He interpreted this as an action to protect the interests of
his countrymen, saying that "police and other institutions there
have been told to enforce more rigid supervision over this."
</P>
<P>
Aly said the decision was made because the land-locked
province turned out 175,000 tons of grain last year, but farmers
have not sold last year's crop off by now when this year's
harvest season is coming soon.

Now, he can make that call from his own house.
</P>
<P>
Farmers now find it much easier to communicate with the outside
world because of the rapid development in rural telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The number of rural telephone subscribers in Anhui has risen to
more than 400,000 in recent years, a remarkable achievement in
this underdeveloped province in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The province has given priority to improved communications for
rural residents to meet the needs of rapidly developing market
economy, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Programmable telephone networks have been formed in the rural
areas, with a telephone coverage of some 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has further promoted local
telecommunications by diversifying fund-raising sources.
</P>
<P>
Anhui plans to set up a rural telephone network over the next
three years, with a capacity for 1.9 million lines, 1.15 million
phone subscribers and a telephone coverage of 2.2 percent in the
countryside.

<HEADLINE> Accident Kills 67 in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- About 67 people died and
over 22 were seriously injured in a motor accident along the
peninsular area, west of Sierra Leone's capital Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were a number of children and suckling mothers.
</P>
<P>
Surviving passengers said the vehicle was a haulage vehicle
used to carry passengers and as it was going across a narrow
bridge near York, about 24 miles from the capital, its rear
wheels missed the kerb of the bridge and somersaulted into a
ravine.
</P>
<P>
Medical personnel who took part in the rescue operations said
many of the victims were squeezed to death by bags of rice and
gallons of kerosene which were among the vehicle's cargo.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that most of those who died were living in the
east of the city and were fleeing possible renewed bombing
attacks by Nigerian Alfa jets.
</P>
<P>
Shellings by Nigerian gunners across the Sierra Leone estuary
killed over 13 people in the east last week.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the main Connaught Hospital told Xinhua today, "we
are battling to serve the lives of at least 10 of the seriously
injured."
</P>
<P>
The doctors are joined in the operations by personnel from the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the Sierra Leone Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
At the city mortuary, anxious relatives with anxious faces
were identifying the corpses.
</P>
<P>
The peninsular area has been little used in the recent past
because of its poor condition but with the closure of the main
highway at Jui, it now remains the only outlet to the interior.
</P>
<P>
It now takes six hours to reach Waterloo which is the
diversion stop for a journey which normally is undertaken in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
One passenger told Xinhua, "the road is not good but vehicles
are using it all the same. I counted 189 vehicles using the bad
road within a six hour period."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Business News in Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major business
briefs of Egypt:
</P>
<P>
-- The trade volume between Egypt and the U.S. stood at
more than 2.16 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of the
current year, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. enjoyed a trade surplus of 1.399 billion dollars
during the period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to the U.S. during the period totaled 308.4
million dollars as against the 365 million dollars in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to the decrease of Egypt's oil
exports to the U.S. in comparison with the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
While Egypt's imports from the U.S. in the January-June period
stood at less than 1.708 billion dollars, up by 24 percent from
the 1.376 billion dollars recorded in the respective period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt exported 38 billion dollars worth of oil over
the past 16 years, the MENA Saturday quoted Egyptian Minister of
Oil Hamdi al-Banbi as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past 16 years, international oil companies spent more
than 19 billion dollars on oil prospection in Egypt under 179
agreements, resulting in 130 oil findings of crude oil and natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
-- Experiments on oil recycling started here Saturday by
Egypt Oil and Egypt Oil Cooperative Companies, MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
The project costing 175 million Egyptian pounds (51.4 million
dollars) aims at producing 20,000 tonnes of recycled oil every
year.
</P>
<P>
Several Egyptian oil companies have taken part in the project
that aims at rationalizing the use of energy.
</P>
<P>
The recycled oil will be put on sale on the local markets and
used in truck engines.
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will export 200,000 kantars (9,000 tonnes)
of cotton to China in accordance with agreements signed with
Beijing when an Egyptian delegation under Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri visited China during an Asian tour in April, MANA
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Gowaili as saying that a Chinese delegation is currently visiting
Egypt to discuss cooperation between the two countries in small
and medium size projects and joint marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
These projects include two cement plants in Suez and Northern
Sinai which are scheduled to start production next year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Recovers 1.14 Bln Dollar Overdue Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's banks have recovered
overdue loans worth 50 billion taka (about 1.14 billion U.S.
dollars) in nine months from January to September this year,
well-informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 40 billion taka (about 910 million dollars) was
realized in cash while the rest 10 billion taka (about 227 million
dollars) was in other forms.
</P>
<P>
Lutfar Ragnab Sarker, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, central
bank of the country, attributed the recovery of bad loans to the
government's firm commitment to streamline the financial sector
through legal reforms and other means.
</P>
<P>
He identified mismanagement, inefficiency and wasteful
expenditures as main weaknesses of the country's commercial banks,
but said the situation was improving following a number of reform
measures in the financial sector, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of bad loans now stand at 110 billion taka
(about 2.5 billion dollars), while the outstanding loans of big
public sector enterprises amount to 40 billion taka (about 901
million dollars), according to recent reports by local newspapers.

<HEADLINE> PNA Hopes US Envoy to Bring Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official today expressed hope that U.S Mideast
peace coordinator Dennis Ross could force Israel to abide by
signed agreements on his new mediation bid.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Ross would carry with him a mechanism that could force
Israel to abide by an exact and accurate implementation of the
signed agreements with the Palestinians," PNA Minister of Local
Government Saeb Erekat said in an interview with Voice of Arabs
radio over telephone from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross is returned to the region today, 10 days after he
successfully persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and PNA President Yasser Arafat to meet on October 8, their first
direct talks in eight months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy is likely to meet Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy and senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas in advance of their
scheduled Washington meeting on October 27.
</P>
<P>
Erekat pointed out that Ross' tour will mainly aim at breathing
life into the stalled peace march. He called upon the peace
advocate powers to work for salvaging the peace drive on the
Palestinian-Israeli track, which, he said, is undergoing a true
"crisis and dangerous plight."

<HEADLINE> India's Uttar Pradesh Government Plunges into Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The state government of Uttar
Pradesh, the largest state in India, today plunged into a serious
political crisis after the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) pulled out of
the coalition government led by the Bharatixa Janata Party (BJP)
leader Kalyan Singh, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
BSP Vice President Miss Mayawati announced her party's decision
at a hurriedly-called news conference in Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh, saying that she had given a letter to Governor Romesh
Bhandari in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Singh replaced Miss Mayawati as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh
on September 21 as head of a BJP-led coalition government under a
unique power-sharing agreement between the BJP and the BSP.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to rule the state on a six-month
rotation basis following the emergence of a hung state assembly
from the elections held in the state early this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the news conference, Miss Mayawati said the BSP
withdrew from the Kalyan Singh government because its coalition
partner BJP pursued anti-Dalit (an ethnic minority in India)
policies.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the Kalyan Singh government for reversing
decisions taken during her six-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
The former chief minister urged Governor Bhandari to dissolve
the state assembly as the one-month-old Kalyan Singh government
had been reduced to a minority.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the dramatic development, the BJP, the largest
opposition party at the national level, said Singh should be given
an opportunity to prove his government's majority on the floor of
the house.
</P>
<P>
The party complained that it extended full support to Miss
Mayawati's government as per the accord on rotational chief
ministership but the BSP had failed to honor its commitment.
</P>
<P>
The BJP central leadership would meet soon to evolve a strategy
on how to deal with the crisis, a senior BJP leader said.

<HEADLINE> Post-handover Budget May Please All in HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The first post-handover
budget of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China will not only be conductive to economic growth but also
satisfy all the population in Hong Kong, a senior official of the
SAR government said.
</P>
<P>
After consulting with provisional legislators on the 1998 draft
budget Saturday, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said:
"We want to prove to the rest of the world that we are capable of
producing a very good budget."
</P>
<P>
It will satisfy both the business community and the wider
population here in the SAR, he added. The draft budget will be
presented to the Provisional Legislative Council next February.
</P>
<P>
Tsang told reporters that most of the lawmakers'
recommendations dealt with revenue items -- many calling for
reductions rather than increases in spending -- and said that they
would be carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is managing financial affairs "very
prudently," he.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's 7.7-billion-HK
dollar expenditure program, announced in his recent inaugural
policy address, was equal to the projected 5 percent growth rate
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I would not have any difficulties in meeting the Chief
Executive's expenditure program," Tsang said. "Because the economy
is growing at 5 percent, I would expect the general revenue will
grow at 5 percent."

HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's air cargo
throughput hit a monthly record high of 151,340 tons in September,
the highest ever monthly total in the 21 years since Hong Kong Air
Cargo Terminals Ltd. (HACTL) was put into operation.
</P>
<P>
September's throughput beat the previous record of 150,070
tons, set in November 1996, by over 1,000 tons, according to
HACTL, Hong Kong's single airport air cargo handling operator.
</P>
<P>
It was 12.5 percent higher than the total for the corresponding
month in 1996, with all the three categories -- export cargo,
import cargo and transshipment goods -- recording increases.
</P>
<P>
Between January and September this year, the company handled
1,221,555 tons of air cargo, 16 percent more than the total for
the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Given the steady and sustained rate of growth for the first
three quarters, the company expected the throughput for the whole
year to reach 1.7 million tons, about 14 percent higher than last
year's.

<HEADLINE> Accusation of S. Leone Junta Reported to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has been accused of acts of aggression and intimidation
against civilians and west African peace-keepers in the country
since the announcement of the United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
published on Friday, Sierra Leone's permanent representative to
the UN James Jonah alleged that the junta had carried out several
attacks on the peace keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Some of the attacks had lasted for several days, it said,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
The junta, the envoy said, had also razed down the private
house of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, while boasting
through its spokesman Allifu Kamara that the action was a
reprisal for ECOMOG's attacks on their military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Jonah was possibly sent to the UN by Kabbah and he does not
recognize the junta which ousted Kabbah in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
"Any time a civilian is dead, Tejan Kabbah and his supporters
will definitely suffer because they have been crying to the
international community for military intervention," the letter
quoted the junta spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that the junta had shot and wounded a
journalist outside the burnt residence of Kabbah, suspecting that
he was a reporter for a pro-democracy radio station.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the sanctions, the letter quoted the junta as
telling journalists that "as long as we have our natural
resources, like diamond and gold, I can assure you that sanctions
will only affect our poor innocent civilians but not us (the
ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council)".
</P>
<P>
There have been attacks and counterattacks between the junta
soldiers and ECOMOG troops since the UN sanction was announced
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the willingness of west African countries to resume
dialogue with the junta, fighting seems to be escalating.
</P>
<P>
The junta reportedly attacks ECOMOG positions both in the
capital Freetown and other major towns, while ECOMOG shelled its
military headquarters, helicopter gunship, telecommunications
installations and radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
The UN has set up a committee to supervise the implementation
of the sanctions against the junta, which is expected to
facilitate an early resolution of the crisis in the tiny west
African country of 4.5 million people.

<HEADLINE> Fitz-Gerald Retains World Squash Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Sarah Fitz-Gerald
retained the women's world squash title in Sydney on Sunday by
beating arch-rival and fellow-Australian Michelle Martin.
</P>
<P>
Fitz-Gerald, who won the world championship in Malaysia last
year, outlasted Martin and her home town crowd of 1,500 to win the
one-hour final 9-5, 5-9, 6-9, 9-2, 9-3.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really hoping this helps to get the monkey off my back
because I have not beaten her (Martin) in a major," Fitz-Gerald
said.
</P>
<P>
"She's always beating me, I've beaten her in everything else
except the British Open which is the Wimbledon of squash. This
would probably be the nicest win out of the two world
championships."
</P>
<P>
Fitz-Gerald had beaten Martin in six of their past seven
matches, but Martin blitzed the world champion 3-0 to win her
fifth British Open earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Fitz-Gerald's coach Mike Johnson said his student handled the
pressure better on Sunday than she had at previous major titles.
</P>
<P>
"Sarah was very angry after the third game that she wasn't
competing," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"I impressed upon her to keep playing to the back corners and
wait for the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"She wound herself up and played a good length and when she
showed she was prepared to run down every point Michelle started
to make errors," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the 30-year-old Martin, who was world champion from
1993-95, hasn't given up hope of regaining that mantle.
</P>
<P>
"I've been at the top before and if I break Sarah once it might
happen again ," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
Fitz-Gerald won 10,500 US dollars prize money in Sydney while
Martin took home 6,935 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both players have entered next week's Australian Open in
Melbourne.

<HEADLINE> ANC Firm on Refusal to Death Penalty: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) will not change its stance on the
refusal to the restoration of death penalty, ANC spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa said today.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa made the remarks in response to Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela's call for referendum on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that calls for the death penalty do not
accord with the provisions of our new constitution and the ANC
will never entertain such sentiments," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC expresses its confidence in the national crime
prevention strategy as a means of uprooting crime in our society
and to ensure those responsible for crime do face the full might
of the law."
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Times newspaper, Madikizela-Mandela,
ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela, said that a referendum
should be held on the death penalty because criminals are getting
off "Scot-free."
</P>
<P>
She reportedly made the call at a recent closed-door meeting
of the party's policy makers in Midrand, a small city between
Johannesburg and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy arts minister is eyeing the post of deputy
presidency at the ANC's national congress in December.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Madikizela-Mandela's spokesman,
Alan Reynolds confirmed Saturday that she told the meeting:
"Crime is running rampant because the criminals are saying they
won't get the death penalty."
</P>
<P>
"Don't we as a democratic country have an obligation to take
this to a referendum?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela's request may anger Mandela, who said in
1995: "There can be no referendum in this country on this issue.
There can be no reopening of the question of the death sentence."
</P>
<P>
The president repeated his stance in the following years.
</P>
<P>
The ANC refused to re-introduce the death penalty, abolished
at the eve of the 1994 democratic elections on the ground that
the capital punishment was used as a major tool by the apartheid
government to oppress the blacks.
</P>
<P>
But as crimes and violence became all the more worse, more and
more people called for the re-introduction of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics earlier this year, about half of
blacks and more than 60 percent of whites were in favor of the
reinstatement of the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> S. Leoneans Want Nigerian Troops out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Sierra Leoneans went
on street on Saturday in capital Freetown, demanding that Nigeria
pulls its troops out and stops its bombing of the city.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian media reported today that the demonstrators carried
banners, reading "UN must stop Nigeria's bombing" and "S. Abacha
(Nigeria's Head of State), hands off Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
They marched from the east to the west of the city and later
converged on the national stadium, where they observed one
minute's silence for the 16 persons killed in Thursday's shelling
by Nigerian troops. A list of the victims' names were announced
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is playing a major role in the west Africa
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) stationed in Sierra Leone to enforce
the sanctions imposed by the U.N. on its military government that
seized power from elected president Tejan Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, Nigerian warplanes have dropped bombs on
several Freetown targets, including a telecommunications center
and a transmitter of the state radio and TV stations.
</P>
<P>
The military government in Freetown had accused Nigeria of
actually declaring war on Sierra Leone after Nigerians warplanes
bombing its military headquarters on October 8.
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria replied that it is not in a position to declare
war on that country, because it is acting under the banner of the
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman of Major Johnny Kromah's military
government announced Saturday in Freetown that they will send a
top-level delegation to Guinean capital Conakry for Wednesday's
talks with the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
This will be the second talk between Freetown and the
sub-regional body, which has been demanding that Kromah gives up
his power to ousted president Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Ma's New Protege Threats World Record in 10,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The 17-year-old Dong Yanmei
clocked the best of 30:38.09 to win the women's 10,000 meters
title at the Chinese National Games here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dong, one of nine disciples of coach Ma Junren in the 25-member
field, broke away from the leading pack in the last four laps at
the signal of her coach who sat in the stands surrounded by the
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dong's winning timing is clawing close towards the world record
of 29:31.78 set by Ma's former runner Wang Junxia four years ago
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The top three spots were swept by the members of the Ma's
Family as expected from the enthusiastic fans at the newly-built
Shanghai "Barrel" Complex.
</P>
<P>
"These runners are still very young, they are not ready to
break the world record this time," said coach Ma, "we are setting
our sights upon the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Dong, born in December 1979, was recruited by coach Ma into his
training camp in early 1995 after world record holder Wang Junxia
broke away in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to win the gold medal, and I wanted to extend thanks
to coach Ma," said the teenager long-distance runner, "without his
scientific training, I can't stand at the top of the podium."
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the competitions, we're not set and also not ready to
break the world record," said Dong Yanmei.
</P>
<P>
Ma's man disciple Sun Ripeng clocked a new national mark of
8:10.46 to win the men's 3,000 meters steeplechase, closing
towards the Asian mark of 8:09.67.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with Sun's performance by breaking the national
record today," said coach Ma, "yet it's a pity for his failure to
break the Asian mark because he ran a little bit slower in the
third lap."
</P>
<P>
The men's 110-meter hurdles was won by national champion Chen
Yanhao in front of the home fans in 13.41 seconds, beating
national record holder Li Tong to second in 13.64.
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to win the gold medal in an Asian record," said
the 25-year-old sprinter of Shanghai, "and I hoped to make the
breakthugh in the Asian Games."
</P>
<P>
In Sunday morning, Li Zewen of Yuannan province, clocked the
best of 1:20:46 to take the men's 20-km walking title while the
women's 10-km walking gold medal was won by Fan Xiaoling of the
Chinese Army in 43 mintues 47 seconds.

The center has been entrusted by the city to handle 1,070
hectares of urban land and 186.3 hectares of wasteland in the

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Supply Namibia With More Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will upgrade its power
supply to neighboring Namibia under an 18-million-U.S.-dollar
agreement signed on Saturday, Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Energy and Water Development Minister Suresh Desai
signed the accord with Namibian Mines and Energy Minister Andimba
Toivo Ya Toivo at Katima Mulio border town.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed the 66 kw power line from
Livingstone's Victoria Falls power station in southern Zambia
will be upgraded to 132 kw power line running over 210 kilometers
into Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has embarked on a very aggressive rural
electrification program which requires more energy from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The project is expected to cost 18 million U.S. Dollars, of
which 15 million Dollars will be spent on the Zambian side and
three million Dollars on the Namibian side," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
Toivo Ya Toivo said due to the Caprivi region's distance
from the NamibianCaprivi electricity grid, it will be very
expensive to supply the region from his country's own grid.
</P>
<P>
"In addition the Zambian power system has a surplus of
electricity while the NamibianCaprivi power system is
experiencing a growth in load which will soon catch up and exceed
its generation capacity.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, evident that the economically most viable
option for Namibia to provide the Caprivi Strip with electricity
is to encourage increased electricity trade with our neighbor
Zambia," he said.

TIANJIN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade has grown

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Tourists Target Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A major publicity campaign on
sightseeing Kenya will open from next week in Johannesburg, the
commercial capital of South Africa, as more and more South
Africans are attracted by Kenya's affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
Damian Sadi of Top Holidays of South Africa, who is leading a
team of 14 travel agents on a familiarization tour of Kenya, said
the media and workshops campaign will aim to create consumer
awareness about the eastern African country as a destination.
</P>
<P>
"Our tourists have, for many years, been holidaying in the
Indian Ocean islands, but pricing has become a major factor and
soon we are going to see many of them coming to Kenya," he was
quoted by today's Sunday Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The market in South Africa is price-conscious and it seriously
considers factors such as flight schedules and transfers, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said although Kenya and South Africa have almost the same
features in terms of beaches and safaris, his team has been
deeply impressed by the large number of animals in the Maasai
Mara, one of the most famous game parks in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
On the recent violence in Kenya's Coast Province, Sadi said
South Africans have followed the events closely but the situation
now seems to be under control.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States, a Chinese economic
and trade cooperation delegation left here today for a nine-day
visit to three cities in the United States -- Los Angeles, New
York City and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation is Zeng Peiyan, vice-minister of the
State Planning Commission, with Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, as its deputy head.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation include officials from the State
Planning Commission, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, Foreign Ministry, Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the People's
Bank of China, the Information Office of the State Council, and

<HEADLINE> Zambia Backs Local Small Scale Road Builders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
formulated a deliberate policy to support local small scale road
constructors, Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Deputy Works and Supply Minister Celestino Chibamba
as saying here Saturday that small scale local road constructors
and consultants will benefit from the recently approved 70
million U.S. Dollars road rehabilitation project funded by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see small scale road constructors
consultants to take up the challenge and go into the business, we
are giving them priority as we would like the money being given
to us to remain here but that is not to say the bigger
multi-national companies will be completedly discarded.
</P>
<P>
"The contracts for the small scale road constructors will
range from one million Kwacha (770 U.S. Dollars) to five million
Kwacha so everyone can make a reasonable living."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want excuses that Zambians cannot make roads
themselves," Chibamba noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed dismay at reports that the bigger road
construction companies operating in Zambia have formed a cartel
where all the smaller ones are being blocked out of business as
they do not have enough finance.
</P>
<P>
"We as government have heard that the 'big boys' are stifling
business for the emerging companies, we will deal ruthlessly with
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the World Bank released the 70 million Dollars for
the project to be kicked off next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government sent five comprehensive or specialized
purchasing delegations to the US beginning from 1990. This
delegation, the sixth of its kind, will be the largest in terms of
expected contract volume and the sectors involved.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, members of the delegation will attend
receptions hosted by the US-China Business Council and the
National Committee on US-China Relations. The delegation also will
explain policies concerning China's continued reforms and open-up.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan and Sun Zhenyu will meet with U.S. government
officials and business leaders to exchange views on furthering
Sino-US economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Sino-US economic relations have developed rapidly since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1979. Chinese
Customs statistics show that Sino-U.S. trade volume rose to 42.84
billion US dollars in 1996 from 2.45 billion US dollars in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The US was China's third largest trade partner in 1979-1995,
and its second largest trade partner in 1996. China became the
fourth largest trade partner of the US in 1996, up from 24th in
1980.
</P>
<P>
China's major exports to the US are such labor-intensive
products as textiles, clothing, shoes, toys, household electric
appliances and travel suitcases. The major U.S. export items to
China are capital-intensive products such as aircraft, power
equipment, machinery, electronic components and parts,
telecommunications facilities and chemicals, as well as farm
produce such as grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
US investment in China started in 1980, shortly after
diplomatic relations were established. By the end of June 1997,
the number of US-funded projects in China had increased to 23,250
with a total contractual volume of investment of 36.87 billion US
dollars. A total of 15.67 billion US dollars has arrived. The US
is second only to Japan among the biggest foreign investors in
China, excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan regions.
</P>
<P>
The US service trade with China also has grown rapidly too,
with the opening of 10 US bank branches and three U.S. insurance
company offices.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of Sino-US economic cooperation and trade
has pushed the growth of the economy of both countries and has
played an active role in promoting bilateral relations, becoming a
major stable element and push for the development of bilateral
relations. And further development of Sino-US economic relations
and trade accords with the fundamental interests of the people of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the visit shows the tremendous
potential and good prospect for the mutually beneficial Sino-US
economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the joint efforts made by the business
communities and government departments of both sides, Sino-US
economic and trade cooperation is expected to crown with greater
progress with Jiang's upcoming state visit to the US as a turning
point, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Negotiating Secret Package Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are quietly negotiating a halt to Israeli
settlement activities in exchange for the delay in Israel's
troop redeployments in the West Bank, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli negotiator, who is attending the current
Israeli-Palestinian talks, was quoted in today's English daily
The Jerusalem Post as saying that the focus of these efforts
are in Washington, where the two sides are trying to work
out a package deal with the help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The negotiator said the proposed accord would link all Israeli
and Palestinian concerns raised over the past year. The key to the
deal is said to be a trade-off between a Palestinian demand for a
halt in settlements with an Israeli demand that the further
Israeli redeployments in the West Bank be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have completed the first two stages of the
three-phase redeployments in the West Bank by early September
this year, but the scheduled pullouts have been already
delayed because of the dispute over the scope of
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are working on questions of how long there
should be such a halt in settlement and whether we can trade that
with a delay or cancellation of the redeployment," said the
Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
The report said that current peace talks, resumed last week
following a seven-month freeze, would not be concluded until an
agreement is reached in Washington. The peace talks will be
shifted to Washington from October 27-31.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet, which met in Ramallah Saturday, said the
renewed peace talks were in fact stuck and expressed the hope that
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is to return here today, would
press Israel to implement the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of committees has not shown any Israeli
willingness to change its position in the interim stage, "said
the Cabinet statement. "It is clear that the Israeli side
does not want the American participation in the works of the
committees."
</P>
<P>
Senior PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat said the forthcoming
Washington agenda will be composed of several points, including a
Palestinian demand for Israel not to take unilateral steps that
will affect the final status of the territories, implementation of
Israeli troop redeployments in the West Bank, security cooperation
against terrorism and completing the work of the nine committees
currently discussing issues that concern previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel Radio's Hebrew service Saturday that he expected the
current progress in the peace process to continue. He also vowed
"there would be no let-up in a war to the death on terrorists"
who seek Israel's annihilation.
</P>
<P>
"In the last weeks there has been progress," Netanyahu said,
adding "We hope this progress will continue and not be halted."

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The First Bus Company
of Guangzhou and the Hong Kong Kowloon Bus Co., Ltd. have been
learning from each other during the past four years to improve
their service, transport sources have said.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, when the Guangzhou carrier, prepared to adopt
an automatic fare-collection system, the Kowloon firm offered its
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Lie Zhongyuan, Kowloon's general manager, inspected
the Guangzhou operation and confirmed that the automated system
was compatible. He also offered practical tips on the design of
the fare-collection containers and related management system.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou company now has installed the fare-collection
system in all of its buses, which has increased the carrier's
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon company in turn followed the advice of its
Guangzhou counterparts to mark stations and prices along the lines
and to make announcements on the buses in English, Mandarin and
the Guangdong dialect.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon company also followed Guangzhou's lead and formed a
committee of passengers to offer advice on its service.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Released To Wild In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three falcons that were
discovered by the Beijing Customs when foreign buyers tried to
smuggle them out of China, have been released to the wild in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
And the wild life protection department of Ningxia, entrusted
by the Ministry of Forestry, freed them to Helanshan State Natural
Reserve after they were fed and cared in the Beijing Rare Animals'
Saving Center for a short period.
</P>
<P>
Falcons are a class-2 bird under state protection and Ningxia
is one of their main habitats in China. But, in recent years,
people have been purchasing them illegally for a high price in
southern Ningxia in the counties of Haiyuan, Xiji and
Tongxin. They then sell them at astronomical prices outside China.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia forestry department and the public security offices
have made an effort to crack down on the illegal trade in falcons,
and information about wildlife protection has made local people more
aware about the protection of the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen cases of poaching and trade in falcons have been
uncovered since last year, and 42 people penalized, and 29 foreign
buyers expelled from the country. As a result, 37 falcons were
released to nature, according to Bai Xinlian, an official with the
region's Wildlife Protection Office.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to protect wildlife and to crack down on
illegal poaching," said Liu Rongguang, deputy head of the forestry
department of Ningxia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Promote Coffee Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Coffee
Board (TCB) plans to mobilize farmers to produce good quality
coffee so as to fetch attractive prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by TCB acting Managing Director Leslie
Omari at Moshi at the weekend shortly after he returned from a
coffee conference in London, according to a news dispatch from
the northern Tanzanian town.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the conference, "Tanzania serves top
quality coffee cup. Apart from brewing, the three-man Tanzanian
delegation capitalized on the opportunity to disseminate useful
information about our coffee in terms of production and quality."
</P>
<P>
He believed that Tanzania can achieve its coffee production
targets and substantially improve quality coffee production if
farmers adhere to the husbandry of the crop proposed by the TCB
and various government and parastatal institutions.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include seeding production incentive scheme,
education on replanting and general good husbandry through film
shows and promotional film shows for Tanzanian coffee in
international market as well as seeds distribution to farmers in
new coffee planting areas, according to Omari.
</P>
<P>
Omari revealed that the TCB plans an aggressive promotional
drive for the country's coffee in Japan and western Europe.

<HEADLINE> Priebke Transfer Imminent, Monks Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The seven-month stay of convicted
Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke at a monastery in Frascati outside
Rome is coming to an end, Father Andrea Stefani confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Stefani told the press here the monks had been told that the
former SS captain will be transferred to a Rome military hospital
by Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
But the exact time has not been disclosed, so as to throw
the media off and make the transfer as easy as possible.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was moved to the monastery on March 21 at the end of a
re-trial for his part in Italy's worst World War II atrocity.
</P>
<P>
His arrival was greeted by strong left-wing protests and a
complaint from the town council that he was a painful reminder of
the sufferings of the Roman hill town during the war, when it was
a German army command post.
</P>
<P>
"He's an 84-year-old who does not have long left to live and
who thinks he has entered a tunnel which never seems to an end,"
Stefani said.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was ordered transferred from the monastery to Rome's
Celio military hospital shortly after his re-trial but his lawyers
managed to have the decision frozen.
</P>
<P>
At the re-trial, Priebke was found guilty and sentenced to 15
years in prison for his part in the 1944 Ardeatine Caves massacre
outside Rome. The sentence was later commuted to five years because of
mitigating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was one of those who rounded up 335 men and boys and
had them shot in reprisal for a partisan bomb that killed 33
German soldiers in downtown Rome.
</P>
<P>
In his first trial in summer 1996, he was found guilty but
freed because mitigating circumstances were judged to have
triggered the statute of limitations -- a decision that sparked
angry protests which prompted a swift rethink.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urged to Reshuffle Economic Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of
the Chart Pattana Party, the second largest in the six-party
coalition government, has urged the prime minister to reshuffle
all the economic ministers in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the northeastern town of Nakhon
Ratchasima Saturday, Chatichai, who is special adviser to Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on economic and foreign affairs,
said the prime minister and leaders of all other coalition parties
are scheduled to meet tonight to discuss the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
If the prime minister is to reshuffle the cabinet, it should be
chiefly the economic ministers that are reshuffled, the Bangkok
Post today quoted Chatichai as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If after the reshuffle things do not improve, Chart Pattana
will reconsider its own role (in the government)," Chatichai
warned.
</P>
<P>
However, although he is pushing for changes to the economic
portfolios, Chatichai has publicly professed to keep Finance
Minister Thanong Bidaya, who took office in June to replace Amnuay
Virawan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thanong Saturday indicated that he would resign in
protest against the reversal of the petrol and diesel tax hike of
one baht per liter, which was introduced Tuesday but was revoked
three days later by the prime minister under pressure from public
groups, who demanded the prime minister's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Thanong is believed to be among those who stood for the oil tax
hike to increase government revenue and cut back the country's oil
import bills.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern province of Amnat Charoen, the prime
minister told a thousand-strong rally that the oil tax rise had
made the people suffer and was a wrong decision.

U.S. President Bill Clinton and Argentine President Carlos

The two countries have agreed the concept on limits on
greenhouse gases, but neither the U.S. nor Argentina said what
those limits are.
</P>
<P>
Europeans are pressing for an emissions cap at 15 percent below
1990 levels by 2010 while the U.S. said such a deep reduction is

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bank Governor Blasts Credit Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank Governor Lutfar
Rahman Sarkar Saturday blamed the banks for siphoning off money
from villages to a few urban rich people, creating social
disparity and willful loan defaulters, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an open discussion on the banking sector, the
central bank chief said the concentration of money in fewer hands,
a result of the disparity between rural and urban areas, is the
single most important problem of the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank collect 22.5 percent of their total deposit,
about 90 billion taka (about 2.05 billion U.S. dollars) of the
total deposit of some 470 billion taka (about 10.7 billion
dollars), from the rural areas while disbursing a very
insignificant amount in the villages.
</P>
<P>
Of the total credit disbursed so far, 60 percent went to the
capital Dhaka region, 20 percent to Chittagong, the second largest
city, and the remaining 20 percent to the entire country, which
reflects the disparity.
</P>
<P>
"Not only that, we also hand over the deposits of the small
savers in the cities, who comprise 70 percent of the total urban
depositors, to the small richer section of the population," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sarkar said the banks were "patronizing" the richer section,
who make up only five percent of the population but command most
of the default bank loans, now totaling billions of taka.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, he said only 1,800 people who have 10
million taka (about 0.2 million dollars) or more in default loan,
command a total of 90 billion taka (about 2.05 billion dollars) of
the loans that have already become overdue in different banks and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of them are willful defaulters who can repay,
but don't, said the Bangladesh Bank governor, who blamed the
country's "teethless" laws for such a huge number of loan
defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Sarkar blamed equally the bankers for the default culture,
saying that they only considered the security against the loans
which often misguided them.
</P>
<P>
"But it should be kept in mind that security is not the only
consideration, the man behind the security is the main thing," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that like the economy, the banking sector is
suffering from three diseases - mismanagement, inefficiency and
wasteful expenditure - which, he cautioned, should be addressed
without delay.

<HEADLINE> Chen Yan Depicts Prowess with World Records in Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- As a 16-year-old teenager,
woman swimmer Chen Yan became the phenomenon of the National Games
by bettering two world records and two Asian marks for an
unprecented four-time national champion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to win four gold medals here, and I've set my
sights upon the World Championshisp in Perth," said Chen Yan, "I
will resume training soon after the Games and will try my best to
achieve good results there."
</P>
<P>
The native swimmer with a height of 1.78 meters first clocked
4:34.79 in the 400-meter individual medley to better the
15-year-old world marks of 4:36.10 set by Petra Schneider, former
East Germany, on August 1, 1982.
</P>
<P>
Then, admist gusts of applauses from the stands, the teenager
of Liaoning province, launched her second attempt towards the
world record in the 200-meter individual medley by finishing in
2:11.27, surpassing the previous mark of 2:11.65 set by Chinese
veteran Lin Li in the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
To further attain her dominance in the pool, the young swimmer
with great potentials, broke two more Asian marks in the 400-meter
and 800-meter freestyles.
</P>
<P>
People wondered about the impetus behind her overnight success
but failed to notice the hardships that she overcame after her
blunder in the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned by the tense atmosphere in Atlanta," recalled
Chen, "and I was plunged into the deep sea after failing to enter
any of the finals in the 200-meter, 400-meter freestyles and the
400-meter individual medley."
</P>
<P>
But coaches and teammates encourged her to overcome the sorrow
and sadness, as many a people, including coach Han Bingyan, sent
the morale-enhancing signal "You are still young, and have great
opportunities ahead. The point is for you to grab the chances
firmly in your own hands."
</P>
<P>
To evaluate her performances in the Olympic Games, it's no
surprise for her defeat as she had been busied in the City's
Games, the Asian Championships and Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Further more, she suffered ailment to her nose, was refrained
from daily training for two weeks, and failed to regain her top
form while aboarding the plane for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
After the Atlanta Games, Chen busied herself in a four-month
recovery with a daily coverage of 3,000 meters in the pool to
regain her confidence.
</P>
<P>
In January, Chen chopped up six gold medals in the 200-meter
and 400-meter individual medleys in three stops of the World
Short-Course Swimming Championships.
</P>
<P>
In April, Chen anchored her compatriots for her first major
splashes in the world by breaking the short-course world record in
the 4x200-meter relay in Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the Eighth National Games, Chen, together with
her mentor Han, buried herself in a 27-week intensive training
since May.
</P>
<P>
"The National Games was her first major battle wherein she has
achieved confidence," said Han Bingyan.
</P>
<P>
"And now, I have set my sights upon the World Championships in
January in Perth and the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney," said Chen.

<HEADLINE> Latin Americans Lukewarm to U.S. Free Trade Area Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 18 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton seemed to have failed to convince the skeptical
Brazilians and Argentines into embracing his plan of creating a
free trade area in the Americas by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Brazil and Argentina, two key members of the
Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur), remained lukewarm to
Clinton's plan, fearing the U.S. blueprint to build a Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) may overwhelm their own bloc.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, keen to reinforce Washington role in Latin America in
the face of growing presence of the European Union and Asia, today
wound up his visit to the three Latin American countries -- widely
seen as a campaign to preach his free trade plan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Brazil and Argentina reiterated their commitment to
the creation of the FTAA, but said they would prefer membership
negotiations in a step-by-step manner.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was
notably lukewarm to Clinton's notion that Brazil should play a
leading role in creating the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Brazil views Clinton's proposal as a threat to
its burgeoning regional status in Mercosur, the largest South
American common market grouping Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, President Carlos Menem expressed some
reservations, describing the FTAA as "a complex exercise ...
because of the number of disparities of participating actors."
</P>
<P>
"That is why it is indispensable of participating countries to
be able to define their interests at stake," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA, to group Mercosur members and NAFTA members of
Mexico, Canada and the United States, was proposed by Clinton in
the Summit of the Americas Conference held in Miami in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
He has been keen in pushing ahead with the plan as Latin
America is getting increasingly important to his country.
</P>
<P>
Among the three countries he visited this time, Venezuela has
replaced Saudi Arabia as the United States' biggest oil supplier.
Brazil is the biggest market of the American continent whereas
Argentina has been granted by the U.S. the status of non-NATO
military ally.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Brazil and Argentina, as key members of the
Mercosur, not only are important trade partners of the United
States but also acquire a growing negotiating capacity before
other economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was eager to get his plan implemented as Latin American
countries are accelerating their approach toward the European
Union and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already signed with Mercosur a framework
agreement of regional cooperation and decided to hold in 1999 the
first summit meeting of the EU and Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leader Urges Solution to Media Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo
Krajisnik today called for an urgent solution to the interruption
of radio and TV broadcast by NATO-led forces in the Bosnian Serb
capital of Pale, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a message to High Representative Carlos Westendorp and
U.N. envoy Kai Eide, Krajisnik said the representatives of the
Serb Radio Television (SRT) and the international community should
open a dialogue, in order to ensure free access to the media for
all parties in the run-up to legislative elections scheduled for
November 23 in the Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb member of the three-member
presidency, also addressed Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic,
asking her to observe the reconciliation agreement reached in
Belgrade earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allowed broadcasting stations in Banja Luka and
Pale, respectively the strongholds of Plavsic, who is back by the
West, and her predecessor Radovan Karadzic, to broadcast by turn.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, the NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia seized
three key transmitters of Karadzic's supporters and banned SRT
Pale from broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
But SRT Pale managed to be back on the air with news and
feature programs on October 16 with a transmitter not in the hands
of the SFOR before it was interrupted again by the SFOR today.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies U.S. Claim on Helping Iran Produce Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A Russian foreign ministry
spokesman today again dismissed a U.S. report alleging that Russia
has provided Iran with technology to produce ballistic missiles,
the Interfax news service said.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov said that Russia has strictly abided by the
treaty it signed on the non-proliferation of missile technology
and its cooperation with Iran falls within the scope of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
A recent report in The Washington Times alleged that Russia is
assisting Iran in developing missiles with ranges up to 1,200
miles (1,900 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said Russian departments concerned have made careful
inspections, but found no violations of the principle of
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also angrily
dismissed the U.S. report Friday, saying that he had "no intention
of commenting on stupid statements."
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the repeated allegations on this issue by the U.S
media are groundless and carry certain political motives.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Incidence High in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is facing an unusually
high incidence of dengue fever, according to Communicable Diseases
Control Department sources.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey shows that reported cases of dengue fever in
the country rose from 37,929 cases in 1996 to 48,174 in the first
nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has also recorded more cases than its neighboring
countries because of the presence of all four strains of the
virus, while other countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, have
reported only three strains.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute infectious viral disease characterized
by headache, severe joint pain and rash, can lead to shock and
even death, if correct diagnosis is delayed.
</P>
<P>
The disease is spread by certain kinds of house mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sujitra Nimmanmit, a paediatrist and technical consultant
to the department, attributed the high incidence to inadequate
programs in mosquito controls, limited professionals and slow
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was worst hit in 1987 when about 174,000 people
contracted the illness, leading to about 1,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sujitra said over the last two decades, dengue fever death
rate in the country has been reduced from 12.5 percent to 0.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Another Place Where Ancient East and West Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Ancient Europeans and Asians
might have been trading as early as the first century A.D. on the
"Musk Road", Chinese archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
Based on a series of finds in Tibet's Ngari Prefecture, Zhang
Jianlin, director of the Shaanxi Institute of Archaeology, said
recently that the "Musk Road", which was named after one of its most
popular products, linking ancient Rome and southwest China's
Changdu with the Ngari Prefecture as an important part, was
another cultural link between West and East, in addition to the
much more publicized "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
Zhang's studies showed that the Golden Age of the "Musk Road"
in the Ngari region was during the Guge Kingdom from the mid-10th
century to the early 17th century.
</P>
<P>
The Guge Kingdom at that time covered a vast area that included
present day Lhasa, Xinjiang, parts of Central Asia, India, and
Nepal and had a population of nearly one million.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that they have found stone implements in Ngari
typical of East Asia, South Asia, North Africa, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
And the Guge Kingdom used the route to export its special local
products, and imported daily necessities from neighboring
countries, the scholar said.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents record a Portuguese missionary describing
trade in the Guge Kingdom, with more than 200 traders from China
coming every year, bringing silk, tea, pottery, and porcelain.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned businessmen from Central Asia and West Asia
trading cloth, coral, and amber for sheep's wool produced by the
Guge Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological finds also indicate religious exchanges between
East and West along the "Musk Road".
</P>
<P>
In Ngari, experts can still identify the site of a church built
by Western missionaries at the end of the Guge Kingdom.
Archaeologists have also found fragments of a Bible in Portuguese
in some caves.

<HEADLINE> Echoes From Mercosur (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights
from the Southern Common Market (Mercosur):
</P>
<P>
Mercosur Called "An Irrevocable Reality"
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguayan Foreign Minister Alvaro Ramos said in
Japan that the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) is "an
irrevocable reality," according to news dispatches received here.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said during the 2nd Mercosur-Japan Meeting at
government-to-government level held in Tokyo October 13 and 14,
that the block will continue advancing toward the creation of "a
common economic space, institutionally consolidated, more
competitive, and more efficient."
</P>
<P>
Brazil Maintains Exemption of Restrictions to its Partners
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Brazilian government decided October 15
to extend until February 28 of next year the term in which they
will not be restricted in their sales to Brazil, which since April
of this year it imposed to its trade partners as a measure to
reduce its big trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
This measure was announced in a communique form the Central
Bank of Brazil, of which its president Gustavo Franco, admitted
that it was a "political" decision to maintain the cohesion of the
bloc.
</P>
<P>
It is the second postponement of the exemption, because the
Brazilian government did the same thing when this benefit expired
in July of this year.
</P>
<P>
Creation of Mercosur Army Dismissed
</P>
<P>
ROSARIO DO SUL (Brazil) -- Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso
of Brazil, and Julio Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay said here that a
Mercosur army will not be created, but that the cooperation among
its members will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents made this statement October 16 after they
witnessed, together with Argentine Vice-president Carlos Ruckauf,
the closing of the joint Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina military
exercise.
</P>
<P>
They also ratified that the armed forces of every one of these
countries will not participate directly in the war against drug
traffic, but will continue supporting police in that field.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Steel Output Increases
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian steel output totaled 17.495
million tons from January to August of this year, 6.4 percent more
than the 16.438 million tons of the same period of 1996, announced
the Brazilian Siderurgical Institute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, main steel producer in the region, expects to produce
this year a little over 26 million tons, 82 percent of the total
Mercosur output, estimated at 32 million tons for this year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil to Attract $24 Billion in Investments Until 1998
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil may receive 24 billion dollars in long term
foreign investments until 1998, which will make of this country
the second pole of attraction for foreign investments among the
emerging economies, second only to China.
</P>
<P>
Brazil received in 1996 direct foreign investments for 9.9
billion dollars, while just in the first eight months of this year
it attracted other 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was officially announced in Brazil that these investments
went to the privatization of the electricity and
telecommunications sectors, among others.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur Economy Ministers's Meeting Postponed
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The meeting of economy ministers and presidents
of central banks of the Mercosur countries was postponed until the
end of this month or the first days of November.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been foreseen for October 23, and its
postponement was due to the ministers' agenda problems.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the contacts between the member countries
to determine the concrete date for the rendezvous and the themes
to discuss on the occasion continue.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur to Negotiate as Regional Free Trade Bloc
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The Mercosur countries will negotiate as a bloc
the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), said
Argentine Industry and Commerce Minister Alietto Guadagni.
</P>
<P>
Guadagni said about the recent statements of President Bill
Clinton that the United States and Brazil will lead the destinies
of the region in the 21st century, that "those political
declarations do not involve the commercial aspect, because in the
negotiation process there will be only one voice, that of
Mercosur."
</P>
<P>
Unique Mercosur Telephone Tariff Implemented
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Mercosur Telecommunications Group established
a principle of agreement through which the four member countries
will have a single telephone tariff.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Lombardo, president of the National Telecommunications
Administration (Antel), made the announcement October 17 before
the Uruguayan press.
</P>
<P>
"The Mercosur member countries decided that they must accept
the Antel tariff, because they consider that it is the lowest in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
IADB: Mercosur Most Dynamic Integration Processes
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Mercosur is one of the most dynamic multinational
integration processes, among other reasons because it emerged in a
context characterized by the liberalization of the main Latin
American economies.
</P>
<P>
information received here stated that the Interamerican
Development Bank (IADB) praised Mercosur in this way in a report
presented in Washington October 17.
</P>
<P>
The IADB highlights also among other successes, that the
Mercosur partners base their mechanisms of functioning on the
promotion of commerce and investment, but respecting the limits
dictated by the conditions and the dominant micro economic
policies.

his recent tour of three South American countries the Mercosur
advance, calling it good for the world.
</P>
<P>
He told 1,200 businessmen in Sao Paulo that Mercosur is a good
group, not only for Brazil, but also for his country, because this
agreement increased the commerce among the members of the group
and of Mercosur with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told in Argentina President Carlos Menem that
Mercosur and the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) "do
not antagonize".
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Argentina Sign Agreements With U.S.
</P>
<P>
BRAZILIA -- The governments of Brazil and Argentina signed,
separately, agreements of bilateral cooperation with the United
States during the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and the United States signed October 14 seven agreements
on education, public administration modernization, judicial
cooperation, peaceful use of nuclear energy, technological
cooperation, environmental cooperation, and space cooperation.

Two days later, Argentina signed five agreements with the
United States on matters of cooperation in nuclear energy,
environment, and space projects.

<P>
Notwithstanding, the export of Paraguayan meat to its Mercosur
partners -- Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay -- dropped 13.2 percent
and its global commerce volume fell 11 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, Argentina Coordinate Controls in Colonia
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Uruguayan and Argentine Interior Ministries
agreed October 16 on the installation of a joint control unit of
persons and assets in Colonia, an Uruguayan city that borders with
Argentina across the River Plate.
</P>
<P>
An information exchange mechanism will also be established
between the two national police organizations to speed up the
exchange of information about international criminals, drug
traffic, terrorism, smuggling, and car theft.

<HEADLINE> Thai Labor Situation to Get Worse Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's labor situation will
worsen next year if the exchange rate stays at 35 baht per dollar,
with the services sector growing at only one percent, according to
Thailand Development Research Institute Vice President Nipon
Poapongsakorn.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar Saturday on the labor outlook under
economic uncertainties, he predicted that the Thai labor market
will see more layoffs in 1998 than this year if the country cannot
restore foreign confidence in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
If the baht weakens further to 40 baht per dollar, the service
sector, the major employer, will record a negative growth
resulting in unemployment of three to four percent of the total
workforce of 30 million. Peak unemployment used to be only two
percent, he was quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand Development Research Institute predicts that
unemployment for this year and next will be 200,000-800,000, while
the Thai Chamber of Commerce says it will rise to 1.3 million next
year.
</P>
<P>
Nipon also urged the Thai government to upgrade educational
standards, especially in the industrial sector. He said more than
74 percent of Thai labor force in the manufacturing sector was not
properly educated and was unskilled.

<P>
YICHANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges project,
China's largest hydro-electric project, has the support of the
whole nation, the project sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Funds have come in from all over the country for the project,
which began in 1993, and the people of the whole country will
continue to support the project through 2009, when the project is
scheduled for completion, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the project, which is expected to cost 20 billion
yuan, come mainly from appropriate increases of power rate in
different parts of the country. From 1993 to 1997, some 13.7
billion yuan of such funds has gone into the project.
</P>
<P>
Because of these, the project has been on schedule, and its
first phase goal -- the damming of the Yangtze river -- will be
reached next month.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the country has provided close to three
billion yuan for relocation of residents around the three gorges
area, and help begin more than 1,000 industrial projects to aid

<HEADLINE> Ivanisevic Urged to Play in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman urged tennis star Goran Ivanisevic to play for his country
in the Davis Cup, according to a report in Sportske Novosti on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, ranked fourth in the world, has threatened to
boycott a Davis Cup match against Finland in February unless the
head of the Croatian tennis federation, Suad Rizvanbegovic,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
The two men have been quarrelling for months, but the row came
to a head last week when Rizvanbegovic sacked the coach of the
national team, Zeljko Franulovic, whom Ivanisevic backed.
</P>
<P>
"I am on nobody's side, the only thing which is important is
that Croatia fields its best team, namely with Goran Ivanisevic,"
said Tudjman, who is a keen tennis player.
</P>
<P>
He praised Ivanisevic as a sports ambassador for Croatia but
said that he should not have demanded Rizvanbegovic's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"He is our best tennis player but regardless of what he means
to the sport, he shouldn't claim the right to do such a thing,"
Tudjman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of
Hughes Electronics Corp. is expected to depart to head AT&AMP;T, said
a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T Corp. may announce Monday that Michael Armstrong will
become its chief executive, Los Angelos Times quoted sources close

</P>
<P>
After lengthy delays in making its decision, AT&AMP;T offered --

York-based AT&AMP;T, sources close to the firms said.
</P>
<P>
No details of the agreement were disclosed, and AT&AMP;T and Hughes
spokesmen declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe Armstrong, who is widely credited with
shifting Hughes from a military to a commercial footing, will face
another difficult task at AT&AMP;T: restoring the industry leadership
that the long-distance giant has allowed to slow away.
</P>
<P>
Although total revenue earned by long-distance carriers has
risen consistently since 1984, AT&AMP;T's revenue share has dropped 39
percent over the last 13 years and its share of U.S. long-distance
revenue fell to 51 percent in the second quarter this year,
according to a new report complied by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Of course, AT&AMP;T still has a formidable franchise. It has 90
million customers, the industry's best-known brand name and a
global communications network that handles more than 250 million
calls and data transactions a day. Armstrong, who turns 59 today,
will have to find ways to staunch the loss of AT&AMP;T's market share
and to more effectively compete in new growth markets.
</P>
<P>
He is widely considered to be an engaging and politically savvy
executive who is expert at selling his point of view.

WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
said today at the dedication of a memorial to female military
service that every women and man in the military services should
be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.
</P>
<P>
Addressing crowds at the Women in Military Service for America
Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, Gore also said sexism has
no place in the U.S. military and in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The 21 million U.S. dollar memorial honors the 1.8 million
women who have served in the U.S. armed services.
</P>
<P>
"Let us rededicate ourselves to root out prejudice. Opportunity
is the birthright of all Americans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore also said, "Since President Clinton and I came to the
White House, we have seen the first women to serve at three-star
rank, the first woman service secretary, the first woman fighter
pilot, the first woman to command a flying wing, the first woman
to pilot the space shuttle, the first women to serve aboard an
aircraft carrier, the first woman to guard the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier, the first woman to command a naval base, and the first
woman to command an army hospital."
</P>

<HEADLINE> NYSE Adopts Measures to Safeguard Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) has over the past 10 years taken a series of measures to
enhance protection of investors and avoid market crashes.
</P>
<P>
These measures include technological improvements, greater
intermarket cooperation, higher capital and margin requirements
and mechanisms to enhance stability in periods of volatility,
Richard Grasso, chairman and chief executive officer of the NYSE,
said at a press conference here to observe the 10th anniversary of
the stock market crash in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's 1.25 billion U.S. dollar investment in technology
since 1987 has vastly increased the ability of the exchange to
handle greater trading volume. The capacity of the system, which
can now handle 2.3 billion shares per day, is about five times
today's average daily volume. Further enhancement will help build
its trading capacity to 3 billion shares per day.
</P>
<P>
This expansion provides a margin of safety well in excess of
what happened in 1987 when the capacity amounted to more than 400
million shares per day, more than twice the average daily volume
of the period. The level was exceeded in October 19 and 20 of
1987, when volume topped 600 million shares each day.
</P>
<P>
Coordination with other exchanges has been enhanced not only
through the functioning of circuit breakers, but through better
communication. A system called "hoot and holler" links the
leadership of al of the exchanges, providing a vital means to
share information and respond efficiently to any crisis situation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the NYSE has also established several mechanisms to
ensure orderly trading during periods of market volatility. For
example, the NYSE chairman said, there would be a trading halt for
30 minutes if the Dow Jones Index Average (DJIA) fell 350 points
from the previous day's close, and for 60 minutes if the DJIA fell
550 points.
</P>
<P>
Great improvements have taken place in the efficiency and speed
with which orders are processed, making it far less likely that
any backlogs will occur. In 1987, less than 25 percent of all
NYSE-listed stocks were traded on electronic order books; today
all are. Trades are being displayed more quickly and executed more
rapidly and accurately than at any time before.
</P>
<P>
Now everyone remembers, said the NYSE chairman, that the market
dropped 22.6 percent on October 19, but few recall that the DJIA
was actually up 2 percent in 1987. Since the low of 1666.21 on
October 20, 1987, the value of the Dow has risen close to five
times. A long-term investment perspective has become much more
widespread as a result.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the individual investor, who is the mainstay of
the market, will derive considerable comfort from the steps we
have taken to enhance market stability," Grasso said.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Chairman Dies at 65 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Co. chief Roberto C.
Goizueta, a Cuban immigrant who went on to lead America's most
successful business, died today of lung cancer at the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
Coke's chairman and chief executive officer since 1981,
Goizueta was diagnosed with cancer in September. The heavy smoker
resumed working as he underwent treatment, but last week returned
to a local hospital in Atlanta. A throat infection left him
critically ill because of his chemotherapy-weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola's board met Thursday and decided not to make any
immediate leadership changes. Goizueta had groomed M. Douglas
Ivester, the company president since 1994, to take over, and
analysts expect an uneventful transition.
</P>
<P>
Bold and aggressive, Goizueta ensured Coke's position as the
world's most-recognizable brand product while making the
Atlanta-based company one of Wall Street's most valuable. Coke's
value zoomed dramatically from 4 billion U.S. dollars in 1981 to
nearly 150 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Diet Coke and caffeine-free drinks joined Coca-Cola products in
the '80s and did well, but Goizueta's decision to come out in 1985
with New Coke was a classic blunder. The company brought back the
old formula, dubbed "Classic," after three months.
</P>
<P>
Goizueta moved Coke into new markets in China, India and Russia
and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
The experience helped drive Goizueta's leadership.
</P>
<P>
He earned a chemical engineering degree at Yale University,
then returned home to the family business in 1953. He answered an
ad for a bilingual chemical engineer or chemist, and found himself
going to work for Coca-Cola on July 4, 1954 in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in the U.S. in 1960 and moved in 1964 to company
headquarters and was elected vice chairman in 1979, president the
following year and chairman and CEO on March 1, 1981.
</P>
<P>
He also paid close attention to giving investors a better
return. A 100-U.S. dollar investment in Coca-Cola when Goizueta
took the top job would be worth about 6,500 U.S. dollars today,
including reinvested dividends.
</P>
<P>
Today, the company stands as the fourth most valued company in
the United States, and Goizueta was the 120th richest man in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Goizueta is survived by his wife, Olga, their three children,
and eight grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Achieves New Economic Growth: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's structural adjustment
program has achieved progress at the financial and economic
levels, an annual report issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)
has said.
</P>
<P>
The report on Egypt's monetary and credit developments said
that the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3 percent in the
fiscal year of 1996/97, which went from July 1, 1996 to June 30,
1997, compared with the growth rate of 5 percent in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was submitted today to the People's Assembly
of Egypt, attributed the growth to the development in the sectors
of agriculture, industry, transport, tourism, construction and
housing.
</P>
<P>
Investment rose to 21 percent of the GDP in the 1996/97 fiscal
year, against 19.7 percent in 1995/96, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit in 1996/97 was kept as low as 1 percent of the
GDP, resulting from rationalization of public expenditures and
development of public revenues.
</P>
<P>
The CBE report indicated that the annual inflation rate in the
1996/97 fiscal year declined to 6.2 percent, compared to 7.3
percent in the previous fiscal year, while the value of banking
deposits rose by 14.7 percent to reach 2,000.6 billion Egyptian
pounds (about 588.41 billion U.S. dollars) till last June.
