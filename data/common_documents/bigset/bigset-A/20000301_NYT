COURT OVERTURNS DISMISSAL OF DESEGREGATION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An appeals court on Tuesday overturned the
November dismissal of the Kansas City school desegregation lawsuit.
The three-member panel ruled that U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple
erred when he dismissed the 23-year-old case without allowing the
parties to present evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that stunned many and without explanation, the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also suggested that a judge other
than Whipple be selected to preside over the case. The court's
decision puts the district's future in question and could result in
the public school system's remaining under federal court control
for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple inherited the case in March 1997 from U.S. District
Judge Russell G. Clark, who oversaw the lawsuit for nearly two
decades before deciding to transfer the case. Whipple declined to
comment on Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren
who appealed Whipple's ruling, said: ``The schoolchildren were the
victors in the court's decision. With focused prodding from the
appeals court, the school district will have no excuse for failing
to concentrate on improving achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. would not comment Tuesday
evening on any aspect of the court's ruling. When reporters pressed
him, he dismissed questions with ``I've already answered that
question, sir,'' and walked into a school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But board member Helen Ragsdale, speaking for the board, said
the ruling would not affect the district's determination to turn
the school district around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors...remains committed to the completion
of the court-approved plans,'' Ragsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the court's ruling did not come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to this,'' she said. ``We want to move forward and
continue to think about the children. They're the main
stakeholders.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 18-page opinion, the appeals court also suggested that
the district court revisit the state's decision to strip the
district of accreditation. The appeals court hinted strongly that
it thought the state's action conflicted with previous
court-ordered goals to improve student performance and close the
achievement gap between black and white students.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments, the result of state action, have placed
(the district) in a most difficult situation...to deal with the
difficult educational problems (the district) faces,'' Circuit
Judge John R. Gibson wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court suggested that the state and the district
court work to reconcile their goals and to develop a single,
clearly understood standard for the district to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman said Tuesday
night that he thought the district court and the state Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education could work together to
develop a clear set of goals for improving achievement and
shrinking the achievement gap.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed worry that, without the threat of state
accreditation being withdrawn, the district could backslide from
recent efforts to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is some accountability that's real and imminent,
the impetus of moving the district toward those goals is not going
to be there, and we're going to lose another generation of kids who
don't have access to a good quality education,'' Bartman said.
``The fact of the matter is, when the state board of education gave
the district a little more than two years to perform or undergo
mandatory restructuring, it did move the district toward focusing
on the goals of student achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 15 years of court involvement had failed to produce
similar results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the fact there was no imminent threat of dissolution
or restructuring caused the district to not be as intense toward
fulfilling those goals,'' Bartman said. ``What's the fuel that's
going to drive them to meet time schedules and targets? If you
don't have some threat, albeit draconian, it's a more leisurely
stroll through the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court suggested that the district must improve
academic performance and shrink the achievement gap before it can
be freed from court control.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also suggested that the district court
consider some form of monitoring to ensure that the district is
moving steadily toward fully implementing a core curriculum,
improving teacher training and holding students, teachers and
administrators accountable. The court said such oversight should
complement, and not conflict with, state efforts to improve student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the new monitors could protect the
superintendent from the ``micro-management, politicization and
pursuing of personal agendas by the board,'' previously recognized
by the district court.
</P>
<P>
   School board President John Rios accused the appeals court
judges of buying into inaccurate perceptions of the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me they don't have any real understanding of what's
going on,'' Rios said. ``We have been supportive of the
superintendent and his efforts to get this district back to the way
it should be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he considered the appointment of monitors a step
backward for the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just adding back the layer of bureaucracy that has been
stifling this district for so long,'' Rios said. ``They're not
helping the school district. In fact, they're contributing to the
chaos and confusion they had hoped to eliminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios also had harsh words for Benson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started the court case and he will not be satisfied until
this district succumbs to mediocrity,'' Rios said.
</P>
<P>
   In his mid-November ruling, Whipple refused to block the state
Board of Education's decision to strip the district of
accreditation, and in a move that surprised many, dismissed the
desegregation lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple found that despite many remaining problems, the district
had done all it could to eliminate segregation and should be freed
from court control.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple found that the problems that remained, such as the lack
of administrative talent, an overly political school board and
endless litigation, were not constitutional violations and that the
court had no authority to address them.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court suggested that those problems impeded the
district's efforts to eliminate segregation and thus made them
subject to court action.
</P>
<P>
   The district at one point was in settlement discussions with
Benson and was close to an agreement that would have avoided the
appeal. The settlement also would have eliminated any
court-appointed monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Demps had complained about having to respond to the demands of
both the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee and the
state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, saying it
was difficult to serve two masters.
</P>
<P>
   But Demps, against the advice of the district's then-general
counsel, decided against a settlement. The next day, he asked the
general counsel, Kathy Walter-Mack, to resign immediately. The
district now faces an uncertain future with the prospect of
continued court-appointed monitoring, an unknown judge and
additional legal fees estimated at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The district also may have to delay plans to close some schools,
consolidate magnet themes and redraw attendance boundaries. Those
and other cost-cutting measures now may have to be approved by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a mistake,'' Rios said of the decision
not to settle. ``A lot of things you have to take a gamble and hope
things work out your way. We rolled the dice and we went with the
superintendent's recommendation. We were trying to show our support
of the superintendent. Where are we now? I don't know. We have to
reassess and see what comes of this. It's just unfortunate that the
court won't stay out of the lives of the children of the Kansas
City Missouri School District.''

MAVERICKS CAN'T STOP IVERSON, SIXERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After an amazing comeback Monday night against
the Boston Celtics, the Mavericks didn't have anything left in the
tank last night.
</P>
<P>
   They left a lane open for Allen Iverson to make a bee line to
the basket as the Philadelphia 76ers drove away with a 106-87
thumping of the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we had nothing,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said.
``This is the worst game we've played all year, and I definitely
credit Philly's defense. It's very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give very much competition tonight, but that's the
NBA. You have a few of these every year, and this was one of them
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a slightly torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder,
Iverson poured in 35 points on 15-of-18 shooting, with most of the
All-Star guard's shots coming on uncontested forays to the basket.
He scored on 11 layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to play, but I kind of wish he didn't,''
Mavericks guard Michael Finley said. ``\RThe injury\S forced him to
go to the basket more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was making the layups and pretty much playing as if it
wasn't bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a patch over his right shoulder, Iverson wound up
hitting seven of nine shots and scoring 15 of the 76ers' 29
first-quarter points. Iverson came in averaging 30.1 points but had
31 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that patch was a decoy,'' Mavericks guard Robert Pack
said. ``Allen put that patch on like something was wrong with his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an all-star player, but tonight we made it a little
easier for him. Unfortunately for us, defensively we weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers shot 63 percent from the field, which also was a high
this season for a Mavericks opponent. It was like target practice
for the 76ers; Theo Ratliff made nine of 10 shots and scored 19
points, and Toni Kukoc added 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mavericks forward Dennis Rodman left early in the
third period with a right calf injury and did not return. He
finished with a season-low three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My calf was a little sore today,'' Rodman said. ``I thought I
was going to tear a muscle in my calf like I've done the last
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played \Rhorribly\S anyway. We didn't have a chance to win
it, so I said I wasn't going to go out there and exert myself any
more than I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who scored a team-high 15 points, said the Mavericks
have started a dangerous trend lately. Although the Mavericks were
able to beat Denver, 98-96, Saturday and come from 20 points down
Monday to beat Boston (108-100), Finley doesn't like the pattern of
falling behind early and having to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won two games playing terrible,'' Finley said. ``Sooner
or later it was a false sense of security, and it came to a head
tonight where we played terrible and a team played great.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those two things are going, we were on the losing end of
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Iverson's heroics, the Mavericks only trailed 29-28
after the first period. But a late 14-4 run in the second quarter
gave Philadelphia a 53-42 lead at the half, and the 76ers poured it
on in the third, leading at one point by 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth time this season the Mavericks have lost a game
by 19 or more points. The last time they lost this badly was Nov.
29, a 107-82 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games that we were going to be out of it,
and it was going to be a blowout,'' Nelson said. ``You could see
that, I think, fairly early that we didn't have anything.''

 Ex-lawmaker pleads guilty to felony mail fraud  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former state Rep. Vernon Thompson pleaded
guilty Tuesday to two felony mail fraud charges and agreed to
cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas before U.S. District Judge Gary A. Fenner closed two
unrelated federal cases against Thompson, a Democrat who resigned
from the Missouri General Assembly in January. Thompson's plea
added another name to the long list of public officials convicted
in federal court since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After his hearing, Thompson said, ``I just hope young people
don't get in this kind of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also agreed to pay at least $9,100 in restitution. The
final amount will be established before he is sentenced. The
remaining charges against him could be dropped at his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   He could face from eight to 21 months in prison, according to
preliminary estimates. Prosecutors could ask Fenner to sentence
Thompson to less than that range if his cooperation is substantial
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill
Jr., said the irony in Thompson's case runs throughout a five-year
string of public corruption prosecutions in western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a man who was elected seven times to the Missouri House
of Representatives,'' Whitley observed. ``Now, as a result of his
criminal wrongdoing, he can't even vote, let alone hold public
office. It's another unfortunate example of a public servant
abusing the public trust and having to pay the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's pleas clear the federal docket in Kansas City of
public corruption cases. Since the February 1995 guilty plea of
former Kansas City Councilman Michael Hernandez, Hill's office has
prosecuted 24 public officials or their associates on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Those included former Kansas City Council members Chuck Weber
and D. Jeanne Robinson, former Jackson County Legislator James D.
Tindall and former Missouri House Speaker Bob Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline of public corruption prosecutions is unlikely to
remain empty for long, Whitley said. Such cases tend to generate
tips that take a while to flesh out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look back over the time line and you can see what
might be called lapses or quiet times,'' Whitley said. ``It's never
really been down. Public corruption cases begat one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Thompson, his son, a campaign aide and a Kansas City
property manager were accused of conspiring to steal more than
$250,000 from seven low-income apartment developments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that Thompson and the others transferred
money from the housing developments into an account controlled by a
real estate management company and then spent the money on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, prosecutors followed with a second set of
charges, alleging that Thompson and his campaign aide used a
nonprofit program to defraud Kansas City and a public employment
agency of up to $54,855 in public funds meant for youth and
anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and another man conspired to take state and federal
grant money and spend it on themselves, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was the last of the defendants to plead guilty in the
two cases.
</P>
<P>
   The property manager, Tucson D. Redd, pleaded guilty in November
to conspiracy; he is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Thompson's son, Jamil Thompson, pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor tax charge and prosecutors agreed to dismiss more
serious counts against him.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, charges in the housing fraud case against
campaign aide Kevin Sallard were dropped in exchange for a guilty
plea to a felony mail fraud charge in the second case.
</P>
<P>
   All have agreed to help prosecutors develop new cases.
</P>
<P>
   Though Thompson's plea agreement does not list areas of interest
for investigators, court records in Sallard's case disclosed an
``ongoing investigation into the Citizens Housing and Information
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The now-defunct council, which Thompson helped to create,
controlled millions of dollars in public inner-city housing funds
in the 1990s. No one in the organization has been charged, and
various officials over the years have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 56, represented the 37th House district _ which covers
much of Kansas City south of the Missouri River _ since his
election in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the House Urban Affairs Committee, which
handles much of the state legislation that deals specifically with
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's guilty plea will have no effect on his legislative
pension, state officials said. Gary Findlay, executive director of
the Missouri State Employees Retirement System, said Thompson is
eligible for a pension of $12,600 a year, based on serving seven
terms in office. Because Thompson is older than 55, he is eligible
to receive benefits immediately.

AREA JOINS ASTHMA CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Six Kansas City physicians are joining with
researchers in 18 other cities across the country for what the
American Lung Association calls the largest search ever for better
treatments, and eventually a cure, for asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The research program, expected to start this fall, will involve
thousands of asthma patients nationwide in a series of studies into
a lung disease that has become a growing health threat in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of studies already are done for cancer or heart
disease, but these will be the first large-scale studies of
asthma,'' said Gary Salzman, a lung specialist at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the center was announced Tuesday at a news
conference at Benton Elementary School in Independence. In
November, an 8-year-old student at the school died during an asthma
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman will lead a team of UMKC physicians in the new Asthma
Clinical Research Center. The center will operate out of existing
space at the medical school, Truman Medical Center and Children's
Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The center is being funded by a five-year $750,000 grant from
the American Lung Association of Western Missouri. The asthma
research centers in other cities are being sponsored by local lung
association chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is a disorder marked by recurring bouts of wheezing,
coughing and breathlessness. During these asthma attacks, the
breathing tubes in the lungs constrict and fill with mucus. The
attacks may be triggered by allergic reactions, stress, exercise or
even changes in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons doctors don't yet understand, the number of asthma
cases has been rising steadily, increasing 60 percent in the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 million people in the United States now live with
asthma; about 5,000 per year die from it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, more than 84,000 people, including
30,000 children, have asthma, the American Lung Association of
Western Missouri estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the leading cause of hospitalization of children. And
among chronic diseases, it's the leading cause of school
absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, the national American Lung
Association has made asthma research a priority, said Susan
Glassman, executive director of the American Lung Association of
Eastern Missouri in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the American Thoracic Society, a professional
organization of lung specialists, the lung association created
National Asthma Research Centers at the University of Utah,
University of New Mexico and the National Jewish Medical and
Research Center in Denver, to conduct basic research into the
causes of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association then began to seek medical centers
to conduct studies on large numbers of patients. The initial goal
was to have five such regional centers, Glassman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was so much excitement about this that we ended up
with 19,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kansas City, regional asthma research centers
have been established in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and other
sites along the East Coast. In the Midwest, centers are in place in
Columbus, Ohio; Chicago; Minneapolis; Denver; and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore will
collect and analyze data from the centers and maintain a computer
link among the centers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, all 19 centers will participate in every study. Each
center will typically recruit several hundred patients per study,
creating a pool of thousands of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, patients will be recruited from Truman
Medical Center and Children's Mercy Hospital and from physicians in
the community.
</P>
<P>
   The large numbers of patients in these studies will allow
researchers to draw strong conclusions from their results, and also
allow the studies to be completed in a year or two, rather than the
five to 10 years some previous asthma studies have taken, Salzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest multicenter asthma research program ever
attempted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman said there is a possibility that later on, some studies
will be done by smaller groups.
</P>
<P>
   A steering committee with members from each center will meet
every month or two to plan the studies they will undertake. The
committee will probably announce its first study in May or June; it
is scheduled to begin in October.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is considering studies of the roles played by
genetics and environment in asthma, ways to prevent children from
developing asthma, and the effectiveness of different medications.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one study under consideration would look at whether
flu vaccines can help prevent asthma attacks, said Dennis
Pyszczynski, one of the asthma center researchers and president of
the board of directors of the American Lung Association of Western
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Viral infections, such as the flu, can worsen airway function,
Pyszczynski said. ``Even just getting the vaccine may help (prevent
attacks),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Salzman and Pyszczynski, the Kansas City asthma
center researchers include Sandra Willsie, Michael McCubbin, Jay
Portnoy and Paul Dowling.
</P>
<P>
   While the asthma research centers will rely at first on money
from American Lung Association chapters, they also will seek
government grants and financing from drug companies, Salzman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential for growth and self-sufficiency,'' he
said. ``I think the American Lung Association would like to see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is committed to getting the findings of the
research to doctors as fast as possible, Glassman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this will have enormous benefits to the public,'' she
said. ``We plan to very quickly make this knowledge part of
standard practice.''

GORE EASILY WINS WASHINGTON PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore won the Washington primary
Tuesday night and was poised to deal a serious _ if not fatal _
blow to the presidential hopes of former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily out-distanced his only rival for the Democratic
nomination but the Bradley campaign, braced for defeat, downplaying
the significance of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley vowed to carry on through next week's Super
Tuesday primaries, some of his aides were reportedly urging him to
quit the race, and avoid embarassing defeats next week. He has yet
to win a primary or caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke, one Gore's leading supporters, said
Bradley should think about leaving the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a decisive margin, especially after Senator
Bradley spent almost six days in the state,'' Locke said. ``I think
he's going to have to reconsider his staying in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington might well prove to be the contest that cinches the
nomination for Gore. The state, with an open primary, a large pool
of independent voters, and a tradition of supporting mavericks,
seemed tailor-made for Bradley's insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled heavily that the state would give him a victory and
the bounce he needed to carry on the fight to delegate-rich primary
states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the gamble appears to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't do well in this type of situation, you're not
going to do well in any other state,'' Carolyn Long, a political
science professor at Washington State University, said of Bradley's
showing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're making a push, and not getting anywhere, then you're
sunk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Bradley campaign officials began lowering
expectations over the weekend. Tuesday night, they tried to
downplay the significance of the Washington vote, which was a
``beauty contest.'' Democrats will select delegates to the party's
nominating conventions in caucuses next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said that this was a must-win,'' said Mo Elleithee, a
Bradley spokesman. ``We've always said March 7 was when this
campaign has to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore supporters said the vice president appears all but
certain to capture the party nomination. The next round of
contests, closed to all but Democrats, heavily favor Gore because
he has the backing of most of the party establishment and its core
constituances, such as organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore had the support of Locke, Sen. Patty Murray
and state party Chairman Paul Berendt, as well as major labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty Bradley has had in this state is he just wasn't
able to convince many people that he was better than Gore,''
Berendt said. ``There was only room for one insurgent, and it
turned out to be (GOP presidential hopeful John) McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Berendt said, voters were sticking with Gore because
of the unprecedented prosperity overseen by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch McNary, a 55 year-old Seattle pre-school teacher, was one
of those voters. She said she stuck with the administration she
likes when she cast her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Gore has more experience,'' McNary said. ``As far as
running the country, I like what Clinton has done and I think Gore
will have picked that up.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's white-hot candidacy almost certainly hurt Bradley,
poltical observers said. Since New Hampshire, when McCain won a
stunning upset of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, McCain has been
siphoning away the independents that Bradley needed to overcome
Gore's institutional advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Jones, director of the Center for American Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Washington, said Bradley was
unable to bring new voters into the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   By running left _ he positioned himself as a proud liberal _
Bradley ended up fighting for the traditional Democratic
constituency that had largely pledged itself to Gore, Jones said.
With voters seeing little difference between the two candidates,
they went for the favorite, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was reaching back to the most liberal Democratic
constituencies, and trying to energize them, and it didn't work,''
Jones said. ``If you want to appeal to independents, you have to
move to the Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley targeted Washington early, making forays into the state
in 1998. He was able to attract many prominent supporters, and had
great success raising money here.
</P>
<P>
   He raised significantly more money than Gore in Washington
state, and made at least five visits to the state. In the week
leading up to the primary, he devoted six precious days to the
state, forsaking the bigger Super Tuesday prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign here called about 50,000 voters and passed
out about 100,000 flyers, said his spokesman, Elleithee. Bradley
did 70 interviews with local reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything,'' Elleithee siad. ``We brought in more
staff. We did a tremendous amount of grass-roots campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bradley couldn't overcome Gore's advantages in
organization, fund-raising and party support.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, one of the first elected officials to
endorse Bradley, said the senator had little choice but to gamble
on Washington, and try to step out from McCain's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably his only choice to get the national media's
attention,'' he said. ``He was starting from a long way back, it
was an uphill battle.''

REPORT TARGETS STATE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Despite an economic era of unparalleled growth
and prosperity, the number of Californians lacking health insurance
now stands at more than 7.3 million, according to a report to be
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report titled ``The Importance of Healthcare in
California,'' also focused on the impact the health care industry
has on the state's economy and as a component in all of industry's
need to have a healthy work force.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the health care industry is a $63 billion business
with more than 920,000 employees, according to the report compiled
by the Office of the State Controller and the Healthcare
Collaborative at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Our health care system, however, is in a state of crisis as the
uninsured ranks rise, the quality of health care falls and the baby
boom generation grays, state controller Kathleen Connell said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe California cannot expect to continue its
current economic expansion without adequate and comprehensive
health care coverage for its residents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She gets no argument from some in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't agree more,'' said David Olson, a spokesman for
Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health Systems Inc. ``Many of the
uninsured in California do get the care they need; unfortunately
they get very expensive care in an emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 48 percent of California firms offer their employees health
insurance, compared with 61 percent nationally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of several responses to the continuing problem
of the uninsured. Two new bills now being considered by the state
Legislature would help provide funding for the uninsured and
increase accessibility to the state's Healthy Families program.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller-employer tax credits bill (AB 1734) would provide a
$65 per employee per month tax credit to firms with 25 or fewer
full-time employees, provided the employees earn less than $34,700
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assembly Bill 1734 offers a way for government to partner with
the private sector to extend health insurance to the working
uninsured in California,'' said Assemblyman Bill Campbell,
R-Orange, who co-authored the bill with Assemblywoman Helen
Thomson, D-Vacaville.
</P>
<P>
   The W-4 form check-offs for Healthy Families Program enrollment
bill, (AB 1974) authored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, would allow employees to indicate their interest in
Healthy Families enrollment on their state tax form.
</P>
<P>
   The check-off would indicate interest in the program, and would
authorize payroll deductions to cover premiums. With this form
being completed by every employee statewide it would help to
increase awareness and accessibility of enrolling in the Healthy
Families program.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1998, the program is low-cost insurance that
provides health, dental and vision coverage to nearly 240,000
children who are uninsured and don't qualify for noncost Medi-Cal.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush won a forceful victory over
Sen. John McCain in Virginia and North Dakota on Tuesday, picking
up a large cache of delegates as well as a considerable morale
boost after his discouraging loss in Michigan a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the largest delegate prize of the day, both
candidates drew heavily from the voter groups that have supported
them in earlier contests for the Republican presidential
nomination. Bush captured faithful Republican voters, as he did in
his victory in South Carolina 10 days ago, particularly
conservatives and those who call themselves members of the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire before
that, they accounted for a much smaller proportion of the
electorate here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results also showed that the wave of publicity after
McCain's upset victory in Michigan and his fresh appeal that he was
``a proud Reagan conservative,'' were not sufficient to carry him
over the finish line. And McCain's blunt attacks on leaders of the
religious right on Monday failed to rouse independents and
Democrats, although the senator argued that message will play
better in upcoming states with higher proportions of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took 53 percent of the vote in Virginia; McCain won 44
percent and Alan Keyes took 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The governor later characterized his victory as a repudiation of
McCain's drive to paint him as a captive of the religious right.
``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one
religion against another,'' Bush declared at a rally in Cincinnati.
``This campaign is winning and we're doing it the right way. We are
uniting our party without compromising principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on his campaign bus in central California, McCain said
he had called Bush to congratulate him on his victory in Virginia.
But he minimized the governor's accomplishment, suggesting that
Bush had only regional appeal. ``It seems as if he has a Southern
strategy, doing well in Southern states,'' McCain said. ``We'll
look forward to Super Tuesday when we have a broad section _ a
cross-section of America _ voting all on that same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt his speech against the Christian right on
Monday had damaged him with Virginia voters, he replied: ``No. We
were talking nationally, not to Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the North Dakota caucuses, only 19 national convention
delegates were at stake, compared with 56 in Virginia. Bush won an
impressive 76 percent of the vote, McCain, 19 percent, and Keyes, 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bush and McCain were no where near Virginia as the
votes were being counted underscored how the looming jumble of
contests next Tuesday overshadowed the voting. The election on
March 7 is tantamount to a national primary, with Republicans going
to the polls in California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and
seven other states. As a result, the contenders have raced from one
coast to the other _ and in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not stumped in Virginia since Friday night, when he
spoke in Richmond at a party dinner. McCain rushed out of the state
early Monday afternoon after condemning Pat Robertson and the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, two leaders of the religious right, in a speech in
Virginia Beach. On Tuesday, as he bounced in California from
Stockton to Fresno to Bakersfield, McCain was clearly focused on
next Tuesday. ``California is a critical state,'' he said. ``And I
need to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia was the largest delegate prize of the day,
Washington state also held a primary on Tuesday. Both candidates
spent as much time in recent days competing there as in Virginia.
The McCain campaign viewed that state _ with a history of rewarding
insurgents _ as more hospitable to their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also went to caucuses on Tuesday in North Dakota, which
has only 19 delegates. There was also a Democratic primary in
Washington state, where no delegates were at stake. Bill Bradley
campaigned vigorously there, struggling for a symbolic victory as a
first step in catching Vice President Al Gore. By Tuesday night,
definitive results in Washington and North Dakota had not been
tallied.
</P>
<P>
   In this roller-coaster of a primary season, the outcome in
Virginia was a substantial victory for Bush because by capturing
all of Virginia's delegates to the national convention (1,034 are
needed for the nomination), he surpassed McCain in the total
delegate tally. The state has the 10th largest share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well organized in this state, relying on the energetic
support of the state's most prominent elected Republicans,
particularly Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John W. Warner, and
vastly outspending McCain. McCain had boasted that he would beat
the ``Gilmore-Warner machine'' just as he had topped Gov. John M.
Engler's organization in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain just played it wrong in attacking the Gilmore-Warner
machine in Virginia,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of politics
at Catholic University and an expert on Virginia politics. ``He
named probably the two most popular figures in Virginia politics.
And by making several campaign stops in Virginia, McCain raised the
expectations for his candidacy and failed badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they played down the significance of the outcome on
Tuesday, McCain's aides had significantly stepped up his budget for
the state in recent days after the senator's victory in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain folks were working very hard; they bought our whole
voter file,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the
Republican Party of Virginia. ``They ran a full-fledged campaign
here. The Bush people did too.'' Told that the McCain operation
said it was never particularly serious about Virginia, Matricardi
said, ``How can you advertise heavily in the most expensive
television market _ Northern Virginia _ and say you didn't campaign
here?''

</P>
<P>
   While McCain's supporters dismissed Bush as simply winning
another Southern state, this state is more diverse than South
Carolina, from the tobacco country in the South to the coal country
in the West to the Washington suburbs to the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the western tip of Virginia is further west
than Detroit?'' Matricardi said on Tuesday as he pointed to a
brightly-colored map on the wall of his office. But although this
state is more diverse than South Carolina, it is significantly more
conservative than Michigan _ and that helps explain why Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's continued difficulty in winning significant support
from loyal Republicans may also be a promising sign for Bush as the
contests turn largely to states where only Republicans can vote.
More than six in 10 of the voters on Tuesday described themselves
as Republicans and they overwhelmingly backed Bush, according to a
survey of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three in 10 said they considered themselves
independents _ and they just as overwhelmingly backed McCain. Less
than one in 10 voters described themselves as Democrats, and they
overwhelmingly backed McCain. Bush was far more successful here
than in Michigan because voters in Virginia are more conservative.
Nearly six in 10 of voters here described themselves as
conservatives, compared to just over four in 10 in Michigan. The
conservative voters in Virginia backed Bush over McCain by a margin
of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates, who accounted for about three in 10 of the voters
on Tuesday, backed McCain over Bush by nearly the same margin.
Liberals, who made up one in 10 of the electorate, overwhelmingly
backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of how the Republican rivalry has deepened the
divide between two very different wings of the party, Republicans
who voted Tuesday were split over McCain's ideological stripes.
Half said he is not conservative enough; half said he is
conservative by the right amount.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as religious conservatives were
less crucial to Bush's victory here than in South Carolina. Two in
10 Virginia voters said they were part of the religious right
movement; of those,nearly eight in 10 voted for Bush. In South
Carolina, more than threein 10 voters said they were part of the
religious right; nearly seven in 10 supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the closing days of the campaign here were dominated by
bitter exchanges between the Bush and McCain camps over the
Christian right and over which candidate is the true conservative,
that may not have had much influence on the outcome because fewer
than one in 10 voters left their decision until Tuesday. Those who
did decide backed Bush overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved aggressively to tap into hostility from
tobacco farmers about McCain's support for higher cigarette taxes
and from voters in Northern Virginia who were distressed by his
advocacy for more flights _ and more noise _ at Reagan National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's organization delivered automated telephone calls to
10,000 residents of Northern Virginia, accusing McCain of pressing
for ``48 additional noisy flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, there had only been one presidential primary in
Virginia, and that was in 1988. Bush's father, George Bush,
defeated Bob Dole and Pat Robertson in that primary. Since then,
the state has picked its convention delegates through caucuses.

 &HT;    Clinton stops motorcade twice to shake hands
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANALAPAN, Fla. _ Maureen Vinyard could hardly believe it. Just
a few feet away President Clinton was still shaking hands. She was
shaking her head in disbelief. So was the White House staff and the
Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in a Leap Day mood Tuesday, bounding all over the
county and twice leaping out of his car to shake hands with
startled onlookers. It was a chaotic five hours with Clinton
snarling traffic as he traveled from West Palm Beach to Manalapan
back to West Palm Beach then to Palm Beach Gardens before finally
returning to West Palm Beach to board Air Force One for a quick
trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is highly unusual,'' said a White House aide as Clinton
waded into a crowd near where the president had just made his last
stop of the day. ``Getting out of the motorcade once is unusual
enough, but twice?'' said the bemused aide.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton stopped the 23-car motorcade on Lantana Road,
Vinyard was standing outside her office at the Department of Motor
Vehicles hoping to catch a glimpse of Clinton as he sped by. ``I'm
speechless,'' she said after Clinton said ``hello'' and shook her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Torres and her friend Bethany Rocha had business at the DMV
office when employees said they were closing to see the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to hang out and meet the president,'' Torres
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service cordoned off an area with yellow tape near the
road. Then they patted down and waved a metal detecting wand over
those who wanted to get close to the motorcade. ``We had to keep
our hands in front of us,'' Torres said. And they made her put away
her car keys because an ornament on her key ring had a sharp edge.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in a playful mood. He came to Florida to raise money
for the Democratic National Committee with a lunch at the Manalapan
estate of Mel and Bren Simon and with cocktail parties and dinners
in Miami. He also attended a money-raising event for the
congressional campaign of state Rep. Elaine Bloom (D-Miami Beach).
</P>
<P>
   Crowds stood on corners as he motored around the county. One
woman was so enthused she rushed out of a beauty parlor on Lantana
Road clad in a smock and wearing tin foil in her hair to catch a
glimpse of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned somber, however, when he talked about Tuesday's
tragic child shooting in Michigan. He called for tougher gun laws
and said he felt ``very sorry'' for the family of the 6-year-old
girl who was shot by a 6-year-old boy in their first-grade
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   RACK OF LAMB FOR LUNCH
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One touched down at 12:25 p.m. at Palm Beach
International Airport. Clinton stepped from the 747 about 10
minutes later accompanied by U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-Fort
Lauderdale) and his wife, Lori. Among the local dignitaries waiting
for Clinton were state Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, state
Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm Beach and Palm Beach County Democratic
Party Chairman Monte Friedkin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's motorcade departed at about 12:49 p.m. for the
20-minute trip to Manalapan. About 45 people attended the $10,000
per person lunch under a white tent behind the oceanfront mansion.
For lunch they dined on rack of lamb with cherry sauce, Florida
stone crab salad, golden potatoes, asparagus spears and a desert of
caramelized bananas and mixed berries.
</P>
<P>
   It was catered by tuxedo and white-gloved waiters from the
nearby Ritz-Carlton, which is owned by Mel Simon, who also owns the
Palm Beach and Boynton Beach malls and Boca Raton's Town Centre.
</P>
<P>
   TAKES CREDIT FOR ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Clinton spoke for about 25 minutes, offering his
belief that the four presidential candidates have all convinced
voters that they are capable of being president and the winner will
be the one who shows the best vision for the future. Clinton also
rattled off a host of his administration's accomplishments,
including taking much of the credit for the strong economy. He also
chastised Congress for not fixing the problems with Social Security
and Medicare and predicted that some progress would be made this
year because of the election.
</P>
<P>
   When he left Manalapan to go to the Sheraton in West Palm Beach
for a private meeting with supporters of his proposed presidential
library in Little Rock, Ark., Clinton's motorcade was noticeably
missing something. There are always two, nearly identical
presidential limos. One broke down.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping Clinton off, the limousine was driven to the fire
bay at the South Palm Beach Town Hall. Apparently, something was
wrong with the water pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went into the garage to see it,'' said Mayor Margot
Roberts. ``I asked if I could put my card on the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials offered to help or to call a mechanic. ``The
Secret Service wouldn't let anyone else touch the car,'' she said.
``They rolled up their sleeves and worked on it. We told them if
they don't get it fixed, the president could sleep in the barracks
upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the senior center, Laverne Leonard, a bus driver for the
center, had a lot of questions for Clinton about saving Social
Security and Medicare. Clinton promised to keep working on it.
</P>
<P>
   The President also watched seniors working on computers in the
center's library and called the moving screen savers ``amazing.''
Clinton admitted he still doesn't use e-mail in the office.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the airport, Clinton strolled over toward a
5-year old Sandpiper Shores Elementary student wearing a dark-olive
skirt and a hand-colored badge: VICTORIA is a kindergarten writing
whiz kid.'' ``You're a kindergarten whiz kid? ... Good for you,''
Clinton said before posing for a picture with her. ``You're a
beautiful child.'' Victoria could only smile, nod her head and
twist her shoulder length hair.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Clinton boarded Air Force One and at about 5:45
p.m. he flew over the thousands of cars stuck in the traffic jams
presidential visits always cause. Clinton arrived back in
Washington well after midnight.

 &HT;    Jeb Bush defends G.W.'s visit to Bob Jones U.
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's Catholic, interracially married
governor went on national television Wednesday to defend brother
George W. Bush's visit last month to a South Carolina college that
frowns on both Catholicism and interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said he himself would speak at Bob Jones University,
even though its published rules would mean he and Mexican-born
wife, Columba, would have been expelled for dating had they met
there as students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was incumbent on political candidates to spread
their message to groups they might not agree with, and accused GOP
presidential rival Sen. John McCain of stooping to a divisive
``wedge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To even have a conversation about this in a political campaign
shows how far we've fallen,'' Jeb Bush said in a taped interview
broadcast on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``Shame on Senator McCain. Shame
on him for doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University, founded by the stridently anti-Catholic
fundamentalist preacher of the same name, did not admit black
students until the IRS took away the school's tax-exempt status in
the 1970s. It continues to ban interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The school nonetheless has been a stop for Republican candidates
for president over the past several campaigns. But this campaign,
McCain used George W. Bush's Feb. 2 visit there to criticize the
Texas governor for failing to condemn the university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush for weeks defended his visit, even though current President
Bob Jones III called the pope ``the anti-Christ'' and Bush's own
father, former President George Bush, ``a devil.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush issued an apology to New York Cardinal John
O'Connor this weekend, after exit polls in the Michigan primary
election last week showed that many Catholic voters had indeed
punished Bush after receiving phone calls from the McCain camp
describing the school and its views.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Democratic Party spokesman Tony Welch, who is black,
called Jeb Bush's defense of his brother reprehensible. ``He's
apparently appointed a new ambassador for Bob Jones University, and
it's Jeb Bush,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch wondered whether Jeb Bush's willingness to talk to groups
he disagrees with would extend to hate groups. ``I would assume
that means a Klan rally?'' Welch said. ``Where do you draw the
line?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an e-mail, told The Palm Beach Post, ``I would not
speak to the KKK,'' but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCarron, director of the Florida Catholic Conference, said
he thinks the Bob Jones controversy has gone too far, although he
was gratified by candidate Bush's apology for not speaking out more
forcefully against the school's ``offensive'' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been blown out of proportion. And I think that
it's highly political,'' McCarron said.

ONEOK INC. SUES STATE OVER MERGER FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAX JARMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Oneok Inc. is seeking to recover $85 million from the state in the
wake of its collapsed bid to acquire Southwest Gas Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest litigious volley in a snowstorm of lawsuits
swirling around the failed deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice of claims, filed Monday, Oneok alleges Arizona
Corporation Chairman Carl Kunasek and aide Jerry Porter improperly
worked to scuttle the deal to exact political revenge on
Commissioner Jim Irvin and ex-Corporation Commission executive
secretary Jack Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek would not comment on the Oneok action; Porter said the
allegations are baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa-based Oneok alleges Kunasek and Porter funneled misleading
information to jilted Southwest bidder Southern Union in an effort
to embarrass Irvin and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The information led to criminal investigation of the pair's
alleged activities and to Southern Union filing a $750 million
lawsuit against Irvin and Rose as well as officers of Oneok and
Southwest Gas. Both the investigations and lawsuit are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest move, Oneok also alleges that Kunasek established
a procedure of posing accusatory questions to Oneok that
contributed to a Jan. 4 corporation commission staff recommendation
that the merger be tabled or denied.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, Oneok formally withdrew its $912 million offer for
Southwest, the state's largest natural gas utility, citing concerns
over stockholder liability.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal led Southwest to sue Oneok, alleging it
fraudulently used Irvin and Rose to induced Southwest to accept its
bid over a higher offer by Southern Union.
</P>
<P>
   In its notice of claim, Oneok alleges the company has been
defamed by Kunasek and Porter and as a result of having to defend
claims that lack legal merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their collaboration with Southern Union makes them, the state
and the ACC liable for the loss of benefits as a result of the
failed deal,'' Oneok asserted, saying it will settle for $85
million, although actual damages may greatly exceed that sum. &QL;

MARICOPA COUNTY TO CITE DUST VIOLATORS ON THE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARY JO PITZL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Maricopa County inspectors issued six citations for
construction-related dust pollution this year, equal the number
issued in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And more are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The county announced Tuesday that it will start issuing
on-the-spot citations for 14 types of dust violation. Previously,
only two infractions had been deemed worthy of an immediate $2,500
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be clear to our citizens and the public that we are
serious about dust control,'' said Andy Kunasek, chairman of the
Maricopa County Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up enforcement comes as the Valley is about to enter
a penalty phase for failing to meet federal clean-air standards for
particulate pollution.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sanctions kick in Thursday
because the Valley failed last year to produce an acceptable
dust-control plan.
</P>
<P>
   A new plan is expected to win EPA approval next month. But if it
also fails, Arizona could lose federal highway dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Particulate pollution that is 10 microns or less in size, or
PM10, about one-seventieth the width of a human hair, is a nagging
health problem in the Valley. Tiny bits of soot and grime can lodge
deep in the lungs, creating major respiratory problems. The main
sources of PM10 are construction, agriculture and dust dragged up
by vehicle travel on both paved and unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
   The county's new policies target construction activity.
Previously, inspectors could issue immediate citations to companies
or individuals who were working without a dust-control permit and
to anyone who was hauling a load of dirt and debris without
covering it.
</P>
<P>
   That list of infractions has mushroomed from two to 14,
including such actions as not using a water truck on a construction
site, not controlling dust from being tracked out of a site, and
operating an unpaved parking lot if it holds 100 or more vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the immediate citations, the county later this
month will get a full-time prosecutor to handle dust violations.
</P>
<P>
   The get-tough action was welcomed by the trade group that
represents builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fine can be as great as the loss of the highway revenues,''
said David Martin, executive director of the Associated General
Contractors. ``We want to get to compliance just as much as
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching federal clean-air standards may be difficult. Since
January, there have been four cases when particulate levels
exceeded federal health standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a bad start for calendar year 2000,'' said Al
Brown, director of the county's Environmental Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown's office received 1,690 complaints about dust
stirred up by earthmoving equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with eight people in the field, we're overwhelmed,''
Brown said of his inspection staff. &QL;

PASSING HELPS LAKERS MAKE GRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ If the Lakers were to peg their recent winning
ways to one weapon, it might be the pass.
</P>
<P>
   During the 11-game winning streak they carried into Tuesday
night, the Lakers' assist totals jumped dramatically, from a season
average of 22.9 per game to 27.2.
</P>
<P>
   They registered new team highs in consecutive games, getting 34
at Cleveland last Wednesday, then topping it with 35 against Boston
two nights later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've just kind of gotten back to the basics,'' said
Derek Fisher. ``Things are coming out of the flow of what we're
trying to do, instead of guys creating situations. I think the
problem that we ran into is after we started to get comfortable
with our offense earlier in the year, sometimes when you get
comfortable with things you start to (improvise). . . . I think the
offense is one where you just have to stick with it and things will
come out of that, instead of going outside of the offense to come
up with things.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improviser on the roster has also been the Lakers'
best assist man. Kobe Bryant, leading the team with 4.5 per game,
averaged 5.8 during the 11-game stretch. Shaquille O'Neal was next,
with 5.3 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting better at reading defenses,'' Bryant said.
``Shaq's doing an excellent job, as well, reading how teams are
playing. With the triangle offense, what it does is you know where
your guys are at all times. You know how teams are coming. On any
given night, you can almost throw a pass without even looking
because players are supposed to be in certain spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to make the extra pass has spread throughout the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very contagious,'' Bryant said. ``That's been one of our
strengths . . . is our selflessness, everybody getting everybody
involved, making the extra pass.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shaw rising: Coach Phil Jackson has made few changes to the
rotation over the first two-thirds of the season, but he made a
change Sunday and it could be permanent. Brian Shaw was the first
guard off the bench against Houston and he got the first call
Tuesday night as well. Fisher had been the third guard for most of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw also has been gaining minutes for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just play well with him on the court,'' Jackson said.
``There was a time when I felt like he might have been a little too
opportunistic with the ball, trying maybe too many opportunities to
create shots for Shaq and moving the offense at a faster speed than
I want it to operate at.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw's play of late has been steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing more in the fourth quarter, just try to play
solid, not make any spectacular plays, but just take whatever the
defense gives you,'' Shaw said.

BELTRE'S AGENT PLANNING STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ With negotiations ongoing and the possibility
of a grievance hearing, the agent for Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Beltre continues to focus a few steps ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations fail, and if arbitrator Shyam Das rules against
Beltre's request to become a free agent, the next move could be a
court battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a possibility,'' said Scott Boras, Beltre's
agent. ``It's a door that's open after the arbitrator rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But both sides would like to have the matter concluded before it
reaches Das. Boras and Bob Daly, managing general partner and CEO
of the Dodgers, flew here together Monday and discussed the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a portfolio comparing Beltre's first full season of
major-league baseball against the best players in the game, as well
as the top third basemen of all time, Boras and Daly met again
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the information Boras gave to Daly was how Beltre,
20, performed last season in comparison to the first full season of
players who made $5 million or more in a season. Beltre's first
full season offensive numbers _ .275 average, 15 homers, 67 RBI, 18
stolen bases _ is better than most, including Ken Griffey Jr.,
Barry Larkin and Shawn Green. Beltre made $220,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is requesting to become a free agent because he was
signed at age 15, violating major-league rules. Commissioner Bud
Selig denied that request in December, but the players association
filed a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said the negotiations were in the preliminary stage
and they appear far apart. At the crux of the negotiations starting
point is the Dodgers' chance of losing Beltre. Most baseball
insiders are telling the Dodgers not to worry because Das should
rule in their favor. Beltre's camp believes differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gray decision and any time you have a gray decision,
you have to weigh the issues,'' Daly said. ``If it were a slam dunk
on either side, it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of whether Das' ruling would be final,
because a lawsuit is possible. Both sides are also watching the
Wilson Betemit situation. Betemit, a minor-league infielder in the
Atlanta Braves system, filed a suit in Palm Beach, Fla., and is
asking to be ruled a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were recently fined $100,000 and are not allowed to
scout players from the Dominican Republic. But as a minor-leaguer,
Betemit's not eligible for the players association's grievance
process, forcing him to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed Beltre's case would be similar because he
originally signed a minor-league contract with the Dodgers. Daly
said any such action wouldn't affect how he handled the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fetters hurts leg: Right-hander Mike Fetters, who the Dodgers
raved about since the first day of spring training, won't be on the
mound for at least a few days, possibly longer, after he pulled his
left quadriceps during a run-down in Tuesday's intrasquad
scrimmage. Manager Davey Johnson said Fetter could be out two
weeks, but an eager Fetters is hoping it's only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into camp in the best shape of my career,'' Fetters
said. ``I refuse to let this stop me. I came here for one reason,
to be a Dodger. If I don't make the team as a Dodger, I might as
well go home.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grapefruit rotation set: The Dodgers announced how their
starting pitchers will stack up for the first week of Grapefruit
League action. Mike Judd and Jeff Williams will pitch Friday, Chan
Ho Park and Orel Hersheiser throw Saturday, Kevin Brown and Eric
Gagne pitch Sunday and Darren Dreifort and Carlos Perez go Monday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Johnson said catcher Todd Hundley would start
Friday's opener against Houston and return to action Sunday to
catch Brown against the Mets. . . . In need of power off the bench,
Johnson said former Oakland slugger Geronimo Berroa will get a look
at first base to backup Eric Karros. . . . Sen. Jack Latvala
(R-Palm Harbor) officially introduced a bill in the Florida
legislature that could provide $7 to $8 million of funding to
various spring-training sites, including Dodgertown.

GORE EASILY WINS WASHINGTON PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore won the Washington primary
Tuesday night and was poised to deal a serious _ if not fatal _
blow to the presidential hopes of former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily out-distanced his only rival for the Democratic
nomination but the Bradley campaign, braced for defeat, downplaying
the significance of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley vowed to carry on through next week's Super
Tuesday primaries, some of his aides were reportedly urging him to
quit the race, and avoid embarassing defeats next week. He has yet
to win a primary or caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke, one Gore's leading supporters, said
Bradley should think about leaving the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a decisive margin, especially after Senator
Bradley spent almost six days in the state,'' Locke said. ``I think
he's going to have to reconsider his staying in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington might well prove to be the contest that cinches the
nomination for Gore. The state, with an open primary, a large pool
of independent voters, and a tradition of supporting mavericks,
seemed tailor-made for Bradley's insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled heavily that the state would give him a victory and
the bounce he needed to carry on the fight to delegate-rich primary
states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the gamble appears to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't do well in this type of situation, you're not
going to do well in any other state,'' Carolyn Long, a political
science professor at Washington State University, said of Bradley's
showing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're making a push, and not getting anywhere, then you're
sunk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Bradley campaign officials began lowering
expectations over the weekend. Tuesday night, they tried to
downplay the significance of the Washington vote, which was a
``beauty contest.'' Democrats will select delegates to the party's
nominating conventions in caucuses next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said that this was a must-win,'' said Mo Elleithee, a
Bradley spokesman. ``We've always said March 7 was when this
campaign has to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore supporters said the vice president appears all but
certain to capture the party nomination. The next round of
contests, closed to all but Democrats, heavily favor Gore because
he has the backing of most of the party establishment and its core
constituances, such as organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore had the support of Locke, Sen. Patty Murray
and state party Chairman Paul Berendt, as well as major labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty Bradley has had in this state is he just wasn't
able to convince many people that he was better than Gore,''
Berendt said. ``There was only room for one insurgent, and it
turned out to be (GOP presidential hopeful John) McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Berendt said, voters were sticking with Gore because
of the unprecedented prosperity overseen by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch McNary, a 55 year-old Seattle pre-school teacher, was one
of those voters. She said she stuck with the administration she
likes when she cast her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Gore has more experience,'' McNary said. ``As far as
running the country, I like what Clinton has done and I think Gore
will have picked that up.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's white-hot candidacy almost certainly hurt Bradley,
poltical observers said. Since New Hampshire, when McCain won a
stunning upset of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, McCain has been
siphoning away the independents that Bradley needed to overcome
Gore's institutional advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Jones, director of the Center for American Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Washington, said Bradley was
unable to bring new voters into the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   By running left _ he positioned himself as a proud liberal _
Bradley ended up fighting for the traditional Democratic
constituency that had largely pledged itself to Gore, Jones said.
With voters seeing little difference between the two candidates,
they went for the favorite, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was reaching back to the most liberal Democratic
constituencies, and trying to energize them, and it didn't work,''
Jones said. ``If you want to appeal to independents, you have to
move to the Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley targeted Washington early, making forays into the state
in 1998. He was able to attract many prominent supporters, and had
great success raising money here.
</P>
<P>
   He raised significantly more money than Gore in Washington
state, and made at least five visits to the state. In the week
leading up to the primary, he devoted six precious days to the
state, forsaking the bigger Super Tuesday prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign here called about 50,000 voters and passed
out about 100,000 flyers, said his spokesman, Elleithee. Bradley
did 70 interviews with local reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything,'' Elleithee siad. ``We brought in more
staff. We did a tremendous amount of grass-roots campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bradley couldn't overcome Gore's advantages in
organization, fund-raising and party support.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, one of the first elected officials to
endorse Bradley, said the senator had little choice but to gamble
on Washington, and try to step out from McCain's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably his only choice to get the national media's
attention,'' he said. ``He was starting from a long way back, it
was an uphill battle.''

M'S TURN PROFIT, BUT PUBLIC GETS SHORTCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since the civic parade has been slow to assemble, let
me be the first to line up, with my piece of confetti, to celebrate
the Mariners owners' announcement that they made a profit last
year.
</P>
<P>
   (begin agate) Hurrah. (end agate)
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, they turned $372 million of the public's money
into $2.5 million profit for 1999, according to their annual
release about financial operations. With that kind of acumen, it's
a wonder these guys don't get out of the baseball dodge and go into
investment counseling. They could help end this robust economy and
bring it to a cold, dead stop.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're unfamiliar with the number, the $372 million
represents the public investment in the new park.
</P>
<P>
   The number is relevant, because it appears nowhere in the
Mariners' snapshot statement.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it is hard to fathom how the most sizable public
contribution in U.S. history to a modern ballpark's construction
could be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only because those observers don't understand that
the owners, whether the current group or its predecessors, have
always argued it is about them and the cash they've spent, never
about baseball and the asset they've created.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner president Chuck Armstrong was at it again this week,
eagerly pointing out that this ownership in its seven years has
made an investment of about $337 million, which includes the
disputed cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Deducting the $45 million for naming rights that doesn't come
from ownership, that leaves the owners' claimed investment at
roughly $290 million ($100 million purchase price, $75 million in
annual operating losses and around $105 million in stadium cost
overruns).
</P>
<P>
   A handsome chunk of cash. But it's not as if it were thrown out
the window.
</P>
<P>
   They have ownership of a valuable _ and now profitable _
franchise housed in a magnificent theater with an enormous fan base
in a booming market in a monopoly industry that is weathering the
darkest economic period in its history _ the backlash from the 1994
work stoppage, from which national revenues have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   What is this asset worth? Hard to say exactly, but it's always
useful to find, as they say in real estate, a comparable.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians last month were sold for $323 million.
</P>
<P>
   As with any comparison, there's always an apples-and-oranges
problem. But consider that the seller, Richard Jacobs, bought the
club in 1986 for $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians then were much like the M's in '92 _ moribund, a
hapless franchise housed in an inadequate stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But after a similar public investment in a new Cleveland
stadium, the Indians built a team that has won five consecutive
division titles and made World Series appearances in 1995 and 1997.
They have sold out 373 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that Jacobs' investment over 13 years produced a
seven-fold increase in asset value. Not a bad return for a sport
whose leaders continue to harp on the bogus premise that player
salaries alone are imperiling the empire.
</P>
<P>
   In coming off two consecutive losing seasons, the Mariners are
not among the baseball elites as are the Indians, and would not
generate the same sale price on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little reason to think that the Mariners are not on
a similar arc.
</P>
<P>
   Already profitable in just a half season in the new yard, the
Mariners' only real impediment to success is mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of new GM Pat Gillick has resolved some of that.
Bumping up the payroll to nearly $70 million is another positive
sign.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the Mariners are doing that the Indians never did
is contemplate suing the public that paid for and built their
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what the impact of an ugly, bitter trial will
be on the ticket-buying public. It is interesting to note that in
the seven months since the yard opened, ownership hasn't yet
summoned the guts to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't stupid. Stubborn, megalomaniacal and occasionally
oblivious, maybe, but not stupid. They know the risk is high of
souring the fan relationship that is fundamental to success.
</P>
<P>
   Before the situation gets any uglier, the Mariners would do well
to show some true wisdom in the battle against the Public
Facilities District and recognize their cause is doomed to be more
costly than the overruns.
</P>
<P>
   However valid are any Mariners claims, the stadium package was
sold in the Legislature in 1995 on the premise that public
contribution would be capped. Period. It simply doesn't matter what
happened in the mud on Occidental.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 profitability confirms what many have known _ in a
short time, owners will have their net investment covered by
franchise appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   When they sell, they will come out ahead, as has every baseball
ownership in the game's history.
</P>
<P>
   The only real threat to being made whole is their own lack of
vision and stewardship.

GETTING IMAC TO GIRL TOUGH ON RESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BETTY REID  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In the Web world, news, graphics and e-mail move at the click of a
finger. On the Navajo Reservation, news still travels at the pace
of a pickup truck or a broadcast on the tribe's KTNN radio station.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the two worlds intersect, even the fastest drivers on
the superhighway can be baffled, as Web boss John Raess found out
while trying to unite a 13-year-old computer winner with her prize.
</P>
<P>
   The managing editor at AWZ.Com, a San Jose-based Web site for
teens, allowed a computer to randomly select a teenager nationwide
to win a fancy-schmantzy iMac. Out of 25,000 youngsters, it nailed
13-year-old Navajo Myra Jodie.
</P>
<P>
   Myra, however, lacked a home telephone. So Raess e-mailed Myra
in early February with the happy news.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, no response.
</P>
<P>
   The editor started a paper-trail investigation on Myra's
whereabouts, crisscrossing the remote, 16,000-square-mile
reservation. He had an e-mail address, a ZIP code, a date of birth,
and a state.
</P>
<P>
   He located Myra at Ganado Middle School through the ZIP code she
gave, which belongs to the historic Hubbell's Trading Post. Raess
left a message at the school urging Myra to check her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A week sailed by and still no return e-mail. Raess became more
persistent, asking that Myra be pulled out of class.
</P>
<P>
   What Raess didn't know was he had tapped into a remote Navajo
community where students are usually shy and reserved. Many travel
70 miles round-trip daily to attend Ganado Middle School in
northeastern Arizona. And for many families, paying a utility bill
or having enough money for groceries is more important than having
a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the two made contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hi, Myra, this is John Raess with AWZ.Com. You won an
an iMac.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He expected the Navajo child to squeal with delight. There was
dead silence on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's an iMac?'' Myra asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know an Apple?'' Raess asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Myra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Computer' and she got that,'' Raess said.
</P>
<P>
   I &QC;  &UR; o`3ho lives with her two older siblings and her mother in a
house near a thicket of
juniper trees north of Steamboat Chapter, said she didn't take
Raess' call seriously because she couldn't remember entering a
contest.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Myra, an eighth-grader, had plugged into her
teacher's desktop. Her teacher, Ella Earl, uses the computer for
her lesson plans and allows the children to use it once they
complete their social studies work. So, Myra wasn't on the computer
daily. She remembers entering the contest, but says she was
admiring a pearl necklace, not a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Myra's world couldn't be more different from that of the execs
trying to track her down. She lives in Bal Kai, a mesa with
slightly more than 1,000 residents where the average family income
is about $12,000 a year; the average income for a family in San
Jose is several times that. There, shopping is taken for granted;
in the Steamboat community, a trip to the Rio West Mall or the swap
meet in Gallup, N.M., is a big event. And while youngsters in San
Jose might come home and watch television, play Nintendo or call
their friends, youngsters on the reservation most likely are
helping relatives with livestock and chores at home after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fried,'' Raess said, given that President Clinton
talks about connecting each classroom in America to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Raess' boss, Tapan Joshi, president of AWZ.Com, plans to travel
to Ganado on Friday and personally deliver a turquoise-colored iMac
to Myra. Joshi also is incredulous about Myra's lack of a telephone
line. He is from India, where a city could be built of wealth or a
village can exist without water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Myra's story) took me back 10 years,'' he said,
remembering his homeland. ``If Myra were in India, she would not be
in school. She would be hauling heavy things.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is America, where the economy is strong and many
school districts brag about a 95 percent connection to the
Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That came as a real shock to me,'' Joshi said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Citizens Communication, which serves Navajoland,
said it provides a majority of residents with phones. In situations
such as that of Myra's family, which lives 10 miles from the
nearest pay phone at Steamboat Thriftway Store, major construction
of a telephone line is needed before a house is wired.
</P>
<P>
   The more relevant question then becomes, can Myra's family
afford a telephone?
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Myra said her mother might request a telephone line
given that Myra will get a new computer. Then again, Myra said she
doesn't have to have the Internet _ she'll be just as happy working
with CD-ROMs or software, because the family does have electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all making a big deal out of it,'' Myra said. ``I just
want a computer.'' &QL;

ONEOK INC. SUES STATE OVER MERGER FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAX JARMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Oneok Inc. is seeking to recover $85 million from the state in the
wake of its collapsed bid to acquire Southwest Gas Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest litigious volley in a snowstorm of lawsuits
swirling around the failed deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice of claims, filed Monday, Oneok alleges Arizona
Corporation Chairman Carl Kunasek and aide Jerry Porter improperly
worked to scuttle the deal to exact political revenge on
Commissioner Jim Irvin and ex-Corporation Commission executive
secretary Jack Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek would not comment on the Oneok action; Porter said the
allegations are baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa-based Oneok alleges Kunasek and Porter funneled misleading
information to jilted Southwest bidder Southern Union in an effort
to embarrass Irvin and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The information led to criminal investigation of the pair's
alleged activities and to Southern Union filing a $750 million
lawsuit against Irvin and Rose as well as officers of Oneok and
Southwest Gas. Both the investigations and lawsuit are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest move, Oneok also alleges that Kunasek established
a procedure of posing accusatory questions to Oneok that
contributed to a Jan. 4 corporation commission staff recommendation
that the merger be tabled or denied.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, Oneok formally withdrew its $912 million offer for
Southwest, the state's largest natural gas utility, citing concerns
over stockholder liability.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal led Southwest to sue Oneok, alleging it
fraudulently used Irvin and Rose to induced Southwest to accept its
bid over a higher offer by Southern Union.
</P>
<P>
   In its notice of claim, Oneok alleges the company has been
defamed by Kunasek and Porter and as a result of having to defend
claims that lack legal merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their collaboration with Southern Union makes them, the state
and the ACC liable for the loss of benefits as a result of the
failed deal,'' Oneok asserted, saying it will settle for $85
million, although actual damages may greatly exceed that sum. &QL;

COLUMN GASOLINE PRICE BEARS BIG TAX LOAD  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The recent history of gasoline prices is a
story of declining oil costs offset significantly by government
profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   Government, particularly Uncle Sam, took advantage of falling
fuel prices as an opportunity to raise taxes when low-cost gas made
consumers more willing to go along with gas tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists upset about surging pump prices need reminding that
the average inflation-adjusted retail price of gasoline was at a
record low only a little more than a year ago, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. Except for the 1973-81 period of
mounting U.S. inflation exacerbated by OPEC embargoes and
government regulations, gas prices have been on a steady decline
for more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional price spikes, of course, but this is the
way markets work. The psychological problem for consumers is how
they tend to remember painful bouts of rising prices but forget the
happier times of falling prices. As for prices since 1981, when
they began declining from a dramatic spike, the biggest problem for
consumers has been the government's mounting take.
</P>
<P>
   Total average gasoline taxes last year amounted to 43.5 cents,
according to the institute. This included 18.4 cents in federal
taxes and 23.1 cents in weighted average state taxes. The remaining
2 cents is estimated local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1980, the year before gas prices peaked, federal
and state gas taxes amounted to only 13.8 cents. To put what has
happened in perspective, the gas tax load increased more than 200
percent even as pump prices were declining by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tax hikes could be defended if the money were used entirely to
maintain roads, but Uncle Sam apparently has been putting much of
the federal share to other uses. Moreover, gas taxes also have been
levied for purposes other than keeping roads and bridges in good
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the '90s, for instance, gas prices were increased to
help defray record federal budget deficits. Subsequently, as the
budget was moving from deficit into surplus, those levies were
rededicated to the Highway Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   That, of itself, was objectionable. As a deficit reduction tax,
it should have been repealed instead of rededicated to a purpose
for which it wasn't originally intended. The levy should have been
relegislated.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, however, let's say it was acceptable
because Uncle Sam planned to put the extra money to good use
improving highways. Unfortunately, a lot of the money seems to have
been short-stopped along the way. Since the mid-1990s the Highway
Trust Fund's balance has swelled more than 150 percent. That may
sound good, but the increase represents revenue collected but not
used for highways. The trust fund contains Treasury securities,
which are IOUs to be cashed in whenever Congress appropriates the
money to redeem them for road work. The tax money collected at the
pump but still unused, meantime, has gone to finance other budget
outlays.
</P>
<P>
   This raises a question: If Washington is unable, or unwilling,
to use more gas tax money as intended, why not cut gas taxes?
America's motorists need the money at least as badly as the federal
government, which is rolling in extra dough these days. Or so it
says.

GRANNY MARCHES ON CAPTIOL HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; WASHINGTON _ You go, Granny!
</P>
<P>
   Promoting campaign finance reform, Doris ``Granny D'' Haddock
completed her 425-day, 3,200-mile trek and joined with more than
1,000 supporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She called for
Congress to end ``soft money'' political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like 'Alice in Wonderland.' I can't believe we're all
here,'' said Haddock, a 90-year-old grandmother from New Hampshire
who launched her cross-country walk at the tail end of the
Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Her fellow walkers along the last leg on Capitol Hill on Tuesday
included Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., support efforts to
ban unlimited soft money contributions to political parties from
business, labor and other special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   While praising House members for passing a soft money ban in
1999, Haddock chided senators for failing to approve a similar
measure authored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold,
D-Wis. The Senate's soft money ban died in 1999 amid a
Republican-led filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come, senators, for reform or new senators,'' she
said. ``Tell us which it will be, and then we will go vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock plans to begin lobbying the Senate Wednesday with a
weapon she has utilized since her days as an anti-nuclear activist
in the early 1960s: a nice, hot cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's rally, Haddock and her supporters headed for all
100 Senate offices, delivering engraved, personalized invitations
to a tea party that will get under way at 11 a.m. in a park next to
the Capitol. Haddock will do the pouring and will ask senators to
sign a pledge to vote for a soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock's triumphant march through Washington, D.C., which
included a loop around the White House and past offices housing
some of the capital's most powerful lobbyists, was a far cry from
her early days on the road. She took the byways, including a lonely
stretch of Mojave Desert highway between Twentynine Palms, Calif.,
and Parker, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, she preached campaign finance reform to groups
ranging from civic clubs to biker gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last hurrah,'' Haddock said before setting out on
the final leg of her odyssey. ``This isn't about me; it's about the
message. I don't care one whit if anyone remembers Granny D. What's
important is campaign reform and giving our government back to the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe one person can make a difference,'' she added. ``And
if I'm the one who can make that difference, why not try?''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock's loved ones had serious doubts when she announced plans
for her grueling journey back in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to talk her out of it,'' recalled her daughter, Betty
Lawrenz. ``My husband is a doctor, and he told her there was no way
she could make it. But she proved us wrong. I believe she dropped
20 years on the road. She's never been healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking 10 miles a day, six days a week, Haddock set a brisk
pace. Except for a short hospital stint for pneumonia, contracted
in a Mojave dust storm, she stayed healthy the entire trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubt that she'd make it,'' said Ken Hechler,
West Virginia's secretary of state and, along with the reform group
Common Cause, one of Haddock's most steadfast backers. ``This is a
woman with confidence, determination and optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler, 85, joined Haddock on the first 500 miles of her trek.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock said she gained self confidence on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been shy and reticent to approach strangers,''
she said. ``But once I found how kind and good people are in this
country, I just came out of my shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock's official Capitol welcoming committee included Reps.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., co-authors
of last year's House bill banning soft money. ``You walked to save
our Republic,'' Shays told Granny D.
</P>
<P>
   Other official greeters included Feingold, who conveyed
greetings from McCain, a candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, and veteran rock musician David Crosby of Crosby,
Stills, Nash &AMP; Young, whose Back Porch Foundation supported
Haddock's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money - the object of Haddock's wrath - is a loophole in
the federal law that limits individual donations to candidates to
$1,000 per election. There is no limit on soft money, funneled by
corporations, labor unions and nonprofit special interest groups to
political parties for party-building activities.
</P>
<P>
   The parties actually use much of the money to advertise their
stands on issues. Labor unions and special interest groups can use
their own soft money on advertising for the candidates they have
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission recently reported that, as of
Feb. 1, soft money donations to the Democratic and Republican
parties had topped $200 million for this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   After her tea party, Haddock hopes to campaign against incumbent
senators opposed to campaign finance reform. The widowed activist,
who lives on Social Security and a small pension, will also be
looking for some hard money to cover more than $7,000 in debts she
incurred on the road.

POLICE CHIEF SAYS PROBLEMS STARTED YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
and GREG GITTRICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Arguing that problems with the Los Angeles
Police Department go back at least two decades, Chief Bernard C.
Parks said Tuesday that the department's failings and culture of
mediocrity were heightened by budget cuts that replaced supervisors
with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fewer supervisors now than we did at our lowest
point,'' Parks said in an interview with the Los Angeles Daily
News. ``There was this push to hire civilians to get more people
out of administrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they might be able to write letters just as well, but
there is more to that in policing.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks acknowledged that many LAPD critics will be disappointed
with the Board of Inquiry report because it deals largely with
systemic issues and does not reveal whether other divisions have
the same problems as the now infamous Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the criminal investigation will deal with,'' Parks
said. ``What I hope gets through is that this department was able
to take a critical look at itself, identify problems and begin to
make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   To deter misconduct, Parks said he has authorized the use of
surprise inspections modeled after the U.S. military. The first
such inspection was conducted Tuesday at the Hollywood Division,
where teams of supervisors were sent in to review everything being
done at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he didn't look at the Board of Inquiry report and its
108 recommendations as being an extension of the landmark
Christopher Commission report that came after the 1991 Rodney King
beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that report is almost 10 years old now,'' Parks
said. ``To a certain extent, we have to get beyond that and begin
dealing with the problems of today and tomorrow and what the
department will look like in 2001 and 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Christopher Commission report did do, however, was
create a system of individual officer accountability within the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry has recommendations that go well beyond
that, including case audits, polygraph tests for officers and
allowing the department to check into officers' financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he hopes the release of the report will help begin to
restore some public confidence in the agency and its ability to
correct its own problems as well as public attitude toward
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's tough out there for our officers,'' Parks said.
``They go into court and are asked if they're honest. They're the
butt of cartoons and jokes. It's not easy.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush won a forceful victory over
Sen. John McCain in Virginia and North Dakota on Tuesday, picking
up a large cache of delegates as well as a considerable morale
boost after his discouraging loss in Michigan a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush held a solid lead over McCain with about a
third of the votes counted in the Republican primary in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   The largest delegate prize of the day was here in Virginia,
where both candidates drew heavily from the voter groups that have
supported them in earlier contests for the Republican presidential
nomination. Bush captured faithful Republican voters, as he did in
his victory in South Carolina 10 days ago, particularly
conservatives and those who call themselves members of the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire before
that, they accounted for a much smaller proportion of the
electorate here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results also showed that the wave of publicity after
McCain's upset victory in Michigan and his fresh appeal that he was
``a proud Reagan conservative,'' were not sufficient to carry him
over the finish line. And McCain's blunt attacks on leaders of the
religious right on Monday failed to rouse independents and
Democrats, although the senator argued that message will play
better in upcoming states with higher proportions of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took 53 percent of the vote in Virginia; McCain won 44
percent and Alan Keyes took 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The governor later characterized his victory as a repudiation of
McCain's drive to paint him as a captive of the religious right.
``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one
religion against another,'' Bush declared at a rally in Cincinnati.
``This campaign is winning and we're doing it the right way. We are
uniting our party without compromising principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on his campaign bus in central California, McCain said
he had called Bush to congratulate him on his victory in Virginia.
But he minimized the governor's accomplishment, suggesting that
Bush had only regional appeal. ``It seems as if he has a Southern
strategy, doing well in Southern states,'' McCain said. ``We'll
look forward to Super Tuesday when we have a broad section _ a
cross-section of America _ voting all on that same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt his speech against the Christian right on
Monday had damaged him with Virginia voters, he replied: ``No. We
were talking nationally, not to Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the North Dakota caucuses, only 19 national convention
delegates were at stake, compared with 56 in Virginia. Bush won an
impressive 76 percent of the vote, McCain, 19 percent, and Keyes, 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, 12 delegates were up for grabs, about a third of
the total in the state. The rest will be picked next week.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bush and McCain were no where near Virginia as the
votes were being counted underscored how the looming jumble of
contests next Tuesday overshadowed the voting. The election on
March 7 is tantamount to a national primary, with Republicans going
to the polls in California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and
seven other states. As a result, the contenders have raced from one
coast to the other _ and in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not stumped in Virginia since Friday night, when he
spoke in Richmond at a party dinner. McCain rushed out of the state
early Monday afternoon after condemning Pat Robertson and the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, two leaders of the religious right, in a speech in
Virginia Beach. On Tuesday, as he bounced in California from
Stockton to Fresno to Bakersfield, McCain was clearly focused on
next Tuesday. ``California is a critical state,'' he said. ``And I
need to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia was the largest delegate prize of the day,
Washington state also held a primary on Tuesday. Both candidates
spent as much time in recent days competing there as in Virginia.
The McCain campaign viewed that state _ with a history of rewarding
insurgents _ as more hospitable to their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also went to caucuses on Tuesday in North Dakota, which
has only 19 delegates. There was also a Democratic primary in
Washington state, where no delegates were at stake. Bill Bradley
campaigned vigorously there, struggling for a symbolic victory as a
first step in catching Vice President Al Gore. By Tuesday night,
definitive results in Washington and North Dakota had not been
tallied.
</P>
<P>
   In this roller-coaster of a primary season, the outcome in
Virginia was a substantial victory for Bush because by capturing
all of Virginia's delegates to the national convention (1,034 are
needed for the nomination), he surpassed McCain in the total
delegate tally. The state has the 10th largest share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well organized in this state, relying on the energetic
support of the state's most prominent elected Republicans,
particularly Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John W. Warner, and
vastly outspending McCain. McCain had boasted that he would beat
the ``Gilmore-Warner machine'' just as he had topped Gov. John M.
Engler's organization in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain just played it wrong in attacking the Gilmore-Warner
machine in Virginia,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of politics
at Catholic University and an expert on Virginia politics. ``He
named probably the two most popular figures in Virginia politics.
And by making several campaign stops in Virginia, McCain raised the
expectations for his candidacy and failed badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they played down the significance of the outcome on
Tuesday, McCain's aides had significantly stepped up his budget for
the state in recent days after the senator's victory in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain folks were working very hard; they bought our whole
voter file,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the
Republican Party of Virginia. ``They ran a full-fledged campaign
here. The Bush people did too.'' Told that the McCain operation
said it was never particularly serious about Virginia, Matricardi
said, ``How can you advertise heavily in the most expensive
television market _ Northern Virginia _ and say you didn't campaign
here?''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's supporters dismissed Bush as simply winning
another Southern state, this state is more diverse than South
Carolina, from the tobacco country in the South to the coal country
in the West to the Washington suburbs to the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the western tip of Virginia is further west
than Detroit?'' Matricardi said on Tuesday as he pointed to a
brightly-colored map on the wall of his office. But although this
state is more diverse than South Carolina, it is significantly more
conservative than Michigan _ and that helps explain why Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's continued difficulty in winning significant support
from loyal Republicans may also be a promising sign for Bush as the
contests turn largely to states where only Republicans can vote.
More than six in 10 of the voters on Tuesday described themselves
as Republicans and they overwhelmingly backed Bush, according to a
survey of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three in 10 said they considered themselves
independents _ and they just as overwhelmingly backed McCain. Less
than one in 10 voters described themselves as Democrats, and they
overwhelmingly backed McCain. Bush was far more successful here
than in Michigan because voters in Virginia are more conservative.
Nearly six in 10 of voters here described themselves as
conservatives, compared to just over four in 10 in Michigan. The
conservative voters in Virginia backed Bush over McCain by a margin
of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates, who accounted for about three in 10 of the voters
on Tuesday, backed McCain over Bush by nearly the same margin.
Liberals, who made up one in 10 of the electorate, overwhelmingly
backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of how the Republican rivalry has deepened the
divide between two very different wings of the party, Republicans
who voted Tuesday were split over McCain's ideological stripes.
Half said he is not conservative enough; half said he is
conservative by the right amount.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as religious conservatives were
less crucial to Bush's victory here than in South Carolina. Two in
10 Virginia voters said they were part of the religious right
movement; of those,nearly eight in 10 voted for Bush. In South
Carolina, more than threein 10 voters said they were part of the
religious right; nearly seven in 10 supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the closing days of the campaign here were dominated by
bitter exchanges between the Bush and McCain camps over the
Christian right and over which candidate is the true conservative,
that may not have had much influence on the outcome because fewer
than one in 10 voters left their decision until Tuesday. Those who
did decide backed Bush overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved aggressively to tap into hostility from
tobacco farmers about McCain's support for higher cigarette taxes
and from voters in Northern Virginia who were distressed by his
advocacy for more flights _ and more noise _ at Reagan National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's organization delivered automated telephone calls to
10,000 residents of Northern Virginia, accusing McCain of pressing
for ``48 additional noisy flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, there had only been one presidential primary in
Virginia, and that was in 1988. Bush's father, George Bush,
defeated Bob Dole and Pat Robertson in that primary. Since then,
the state has picked its convention delegates through caucuses.

RAMPART SUPERVISORS FAILED TO ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Rogue anti-gang officers in the LAPD's Rampart
Division embraced and exploited the department's overall culture of
mediocrity to commit crimes and corrupt policies with shocking
disregard and met little resistance from their supervisors, an
internal investigation found.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department's Board of Inquiry report
found that Rampart supervisors seldom challenged officers' police
reports and cooked-up stories. With more oversight, the pattern of
abuse and thuggery within the unit would have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the worst corruption scandal in the city's history
remained hidden until dirty cop Rafael Perez agreed to testify last
year in exchange for a lighter sentence for stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no doubt that things were amiss in Rampart,''
concluded the board report, which will be presented to the Police
Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuits, injuries resulting from uses of force,
officer-involved shooting and personnel complaints had a clearly
identifiable pattern ... Yet no one seems to have noticed and, more
importantly, dealt with the patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   The report identified deep systemic problems at Rampart, with
safeguards practically nonexistent after Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) officers moved to a separate
building - nicknamed ``Fort Apache.''
</P>
<P>
   At ``Fort Apache,'' officers were free, if not encouraged, to
adopt the ``Rampart Way'' of bending or breaking rules to make more
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Rampart CRASH saw itself as an entity separate and
apart from the rest of the command,'' the report noted, describing
how many officers adopted ``The Deadman's Hand'' patch.
</P>
<P>
   The unauthorized adornment displayed the hand of playing cards -
a pair of aces and a pair of eights - that legendary outlaw Wild
Bill Hickock supposedly held when he was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bernard C. Parks, who has vowed to root out all corruption
within the department, said the LAPD, as an organization, must
share in the criticism for providing the opportunity for Rampart to
happen in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had officers working their own sources without reporting to
supervisors,'' Parks said in an interview. ``We had officers
writing reports and their own booking instructions with no
supervision. We were just accepting what was being written.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunkered in the separate quarters under the leadership of a weak
captain, sergeants ran the show and CRASH officers routinely forged
supervisors' names on arrest reports and booking recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious breach of a major corruption check and
balance designed to ensure independent review of every arrest,''
the report said. ``Bypassing the system was blatant and readily
apparent to anyone who looked.''
</P>
<P>
   If officers' reports had been reviewed and challenged, a
suspicious pattern of suspects dropping narcotics in plain view,
readily confessing to crimes and making self-incriminating
statements might have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unheard of for gang members to drop drugs and guns in
front of police officers, but it becomes suspicious when the police
reports aren't reviewed and approved up the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated citizen complaints against a handful of officers
assigned to the Rampart CRASH unit also went untracked. Such a
tracking system was a key reform recommended by the Christopher
Commission after the videotaped 1991 beating of African-American
motorist Rodney King by LAPD officers. The board's report faulted
the department's computer system, saying it did not reliably track
an officer's disciplinary record.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LAPD supervisors took citizen complaints so lightly
that two CRASH officers were allowed to work together as partners
even after the department sustained a series of complaints against
each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors should have questioned why so many of the complaints
were later withdrawn, the report said. Plaintiffs in civil lawsuits
allege that officers threatened to harm them if they did not take
back their statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a complainant would allege to have been beaten
and the photos and medical treatment records support that. Then the
person would recant, saying he only fell, but the injuries were
inconsistent with a simple fall,'' the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD's chain of command should have noticed the high number
of use-of-force incidents at Rampart and problems with CRASH
shootings, including the shooting of Javier Ovando, who officers
then framed by planting a gun on him.
</P>
<P>
   ```Clearly, there was a noticeable OIS (officer-involved
shooting) pattern occurring in Rampart over this five-year period
(1994-1999),'' the report said. ``Large numbers of officers at
locations, multiple `shooters' and either no supervision or
ineffective supervision were apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The internal report said interviews with Rampart supervisors
suggest there existed a ``tremendous leadership vacuum.'' Rarely,
investigators said, has so much influence been exerted, not by
captains or lieutenants, but by a core of supervisors led by a
sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   The group was so dominant that it would convene informal,
``secondary roll calls'' at undisclosed locations to discuss how
things would be done at Rampart. Veteran officers often required
probationary officers to arrive early to wash cars, check out
equipment and load shotguns - with the knowledge of supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry concluded that the department must be
revamped in terms of staffing, computer equipment, training and
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative ... is to risk a repeat of the Rampart
corruption scandal, which is clearly an unacceptable alternative
for the department, the city and the people we serve.''

ROBITAILLE ON SCORING TEAR
</HEADLINE>

By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Luc Robitaille's assist on Ziggy Palffy's
first-period goal Tuesday against Vancouver gave him a point in 14
consecutive games, a career high.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, Robitaille has 10 goals and 13 assists,
giving him 499 assists as a King. His 61 points this year puts him
at 1,137 in his 14-year career and moves him within 15 of Michel
Goulet (1,152) for 33rd all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players in Robitaille's range are still playing and
producing. Former King Larry Murphy, now with Detroit, has 35
points this season and 1,205 points. Dave Andreychuk has 33 points
for Boston this season, giving him 1,177 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, says Robitaille, was the Kings' 9-4 record
during that stretch entering Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our line has really been playing well the past few weeks, but
that has only been part of our turnaround,'' Robitaille said. ``Our
defense has been great clearing pucks in front of the net and
getting it to us quickly. That's what gets you to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mogilny returns: Right-winger Alexander Mogilny, who missed
eight games with a separated shoulder and 23 overall this season,
returned to the Vancouver lineup. The move forced rookie Steve
Kariya to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who has been bothered by injuries the past few seasons,
was teamed with center Andrew Cassels and left wing Todd Bertuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the point where it's not going to get any better for
quite some time, but it's also at the point where I don't think
it's going to get re-injured,'' said Mogilny, who scored 76 goals
for Buffalo in 1992-93 and 55 three years later for the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who had 32 goals combined the two previous seasons, has
15 goals and 28 points in 40 games this year. He had a good scoring
chance late in the first period before getting tied up by Kings
defenseman Sean O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick Whistles: The Canucks played their first game at the
Staples Center. They were 29-47-13 at the Forum. . . . Steve
McKenna, Marko Tuomainen and Jaroslav Modry were the Kings' healthy
scratches.

GORE EASILY DEFEATS BRADLEY IN WASHINGTON PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs throughout for updating, rewriting; note byline change.
The story is now an added starter on The New York Times front
page.) 
 (sw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore delivered a crushing blow to
former Sen. Bill Bradley in Tuesday's Democratic presidential
primary in Washington, winning the state where Bradley said he
would make his most defiant stand, and where he concentrated his
resources for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who enjoyed the overwhelming support of most of the
state's Democratic establishment and many of its powerful labor and
environmental groups, beat Bradley by more than two to one in a
non-binding ``beauty contest'' primary in which no convention
delegates were at stake but the political viability of Bradley was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to the people of Washington state because it
looks like a big win but I'm not going to take a single thing for
granted,'' Gore told reporters in his hotel room in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With 33 per cent of the state's precincts reporting, Gore had 72
percent of the vote and Bradley 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given the humiliating margin of defeat, and Bradley's earlier
losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware, it was difficult to see
where he could make his next stand with any great expectation of
turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   About 2{ hours after the polls closed at 7 p.m. Pacific time,
Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, conceded the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost,'' Hauser said. ``We are a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Bradley had no intention of quitting. ``This
campaign is unanimous in its desire to move forward to March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley was spending six full days of campaigning
here, other candidates, both Democrats and Republicans, were
concentrating on those 16 primaries and caucuses next Tuesday. Many
of his top supporters questioned his decision not to campaign in
New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, that commitment was a huge political
gamble, an effort to post a win of any kind, anywhere. His
desperate hope was that a win here would help him regain some of
the traction that at one point earlier on in the nominating process
had him nipping at Gore's heels and even briefly ahead of him in a
few places. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the Washington contest, the harder Bradley
hammered Gore, calling him a closet conservative and matching him
television advertisement for television advertisement and mass
mailing for mass mailing, the more difficult the course got.
</P>
<P>
   Then over the weekend Gore dropped into the state and locked up
victory with a series of quick appearances in which he determinedly
defended his credentials as a solid Democrat and, at the same time,
proudly paraded the big array of Washington state Democratic, labor
and environment leaders who were backing him.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the results were in Bradley's campaign was fending
off questions about whether he was about to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation swept through Washington, D.C., on Tuesday that
Bradley would drop out of the race if he failed to win in
Washington state. But Bradley's aides strenuously denied that he
would quit before March 7, or that he was being advised to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This camp is working hard towards March 7 and beyond,'' said
Douglas C. Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman. ``I know everybody
wants to write a different story. But the velocity with which
things change in this political climate is incredible. And that's
the view of the campaign, and certainly the senator.''
</P>
<P>
   A top New York adviser to Bradley said he had heard speculations
all day about the former senator dropping out, but attributed it to
Gore's supporters. He said that Bradley's advisers, particularly
those in New York, were firm in advising that he should continue
his campaign through the March 7 primaries. California, New York,
Missouri, Ohio, Georgia, most of New England, and 10 other states
hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on March 7, when nearly a
third of the delegates to the Democratic national convention will
be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley announced on Tuesday that he would buy five minutes of
prime time on national television this Thursday to make a direct
appeal to voters five days before those races.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said the taped spot, which will be broadcast at
the end of the CBS news magazine ``48 Hours,'' will feature Bradley
speaking directly into a camera about why he would make the best
president of the four major candidates now running.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign's extraordinary decision to buy national television
time reflects not only Bradley's difficult straits _ he is running
well behind Gore in almost all state polls _ but also his
frustration with the small amount of media attention he has been
receiving. News coverage of the race has been dominated by the
Republican battle between Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spot will be competing with ``ER'' on NBC, one of
television's most popular programs. Asked why they had not bought
time on ``ER,'' Bradley's aides said it was probably too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign declined to say how much the spot would
cost. But several political consultants who buy television time for
candidates estimated that it would be about $1 million. They also
estimated that the commercial would be seen by more than seven
million people, though many would be in states that do not vote on
March 7.

COUNCIL REJECTS INDEPENDENT LAPD INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ A new effort to bring in outside investigators
to review the Rampart Division corruption case and eliminate any
role for the FBI was rejected Tuesday by the Los Angeles City
Council, despite pleas that it is needed to restore public
confidence in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 8-3 to defer the proposal after Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks told the council that he believes creating a task
force of federal, state and local investigators to take over the
criminal inquiry is premature and could delay the work that is
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, responding to news accounts of FBI agents
attempting to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
deport gang members from the Rampart area, called for a new task
force to be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public confidence in our justice system has been eroded,''
Feuer said. ``Frankly, my confidence in the system is shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he has been meeting with INS officials and was told
the allegations about its agents being coerced by FBI agents were
the result of testimony from disgruntled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs, whose proposal for an independent review
was rejected last week, said an outside look at the scandal will be
needed at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a taint over the department until we have
someone independent look at this,'' Wachs said. ``There really
hasn't been closure on the LAPD since Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis of the greatest magnitude, and at some point
we are going to have to come to terms that we will need an outside
review. It seems to me this is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg also supported the need for an
independent look at the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Rome burns, we continue to fiddle,'' Goldberg said. ``The
outside world is asking, `What the hell are we doing?' We must be
the only people not to get it. What we have is a crisis of
confidence and it looks to people like the council is the last one
to notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said his department is investigating all allegations about
whether officers violated Special Order 40, which precludes police
officers from questioning someone's immigration status unless he or
she committed a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   But, he acknowledged, investigators did not learn of the
accusations involving the department working with the INS until the
accusations were published in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what concerns me,'' Wachs said. ``You have had hundreds
of officers working on this and no one knew anything about this.
What else don't we know?''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they took an old woman in Texas from her cell on a
gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her
instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in
Europe _ were agitated.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about
the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't do any good. They don't take much notice of what
the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over
here. There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though
it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor
George W. Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems
to so enjoy its executions. After all, the man was obeying the laws
of Texas, which were made before he entered government.
</P>
<P>
   He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just
as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas.
Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to
him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
And there isn't much doubt that Mrs. Beets was guilty of the crime
she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best
exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life
was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by
killing an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical
politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or
the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades
ago. It's as well to be clear about why it is so. The taking of
life itself is not always wrong, after all.
</P>
<P>
   We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend
ourselves, for instance. And we expect others to do it on our
behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to
achieve some greater good.
</P>
<P>
   But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to
involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal.
Anything else is lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such
good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to
post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill. It is a
commandment. It really is set in stone, and you had better have
some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops
killing. In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades
after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining
again.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statistical relationship. Any consideration of the
rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what
is at stake here is simple retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is no consideration. Indeed the legal process
permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process
that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course. But it
has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the
legal slums.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to
call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the
death penalty. Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been
released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have
drawn interest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people have died. How many of them were innocent?
Now that they are dead, will we ever know?
</P>
<P>
   This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla
Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually
discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words
that have been frequently quoted since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation,
``don't kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't
blame him for the explosion of state killing. The point is that for
governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a
life has become just too easy.
</P>
<P>
   They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the
governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper
come across their desks. No one in high office questions it: that
would be too hard.
</P>
<P>
   One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however.
Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment
because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had
ended with the conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it
is growing in intensity.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the argument; it's over now. Betty Lou Beets is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone
there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and
Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And
America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL;

gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her
instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in
Europe _ were agitated.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about
the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't do any good. They don't take much notice of what
the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over
here. There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though
it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor
George W. Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems
to so enjoy its executions. After all, the man was obeying the laws
of Texas, which were made before he entered government.
</P>
<P>
   He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just
as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas.
Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to
him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
And there isn't much doubt that Mrs. Beets was guilty of the crime
she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best
exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life
was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by
killing an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical
politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or
the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades
ago. It's as well to be clear about why it is so. The taking of
life itself is not always wrong, after all.
</P>
<P>
   We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend
ourselves, for instance. And we expect others to do it on our
behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to
achieve some greater good.
</P>
<P>
   But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to
involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal.
Anything else is lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such
good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to
post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill. It is a
commandment. It really is set in stone, and you had better have
some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops
killing. In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades
after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining
again.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statistical relationship. Any consideration of the
rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what
is at stake here is simple retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is no consideration. Indeed the legal process
permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process
that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course. But it
has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the
legal slums.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to
call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the
death penalty. Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been
released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have
drawn interest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people have died. How many of them were innocent?
Now that they are dead, will we ever know?
</P>
<P>
   This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla
Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually
discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words
that have been frequently quoted since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation,
``don't kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't
blame him for the explosion of state killing. The point is that for
governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a
life has become just too easy.
</P>
<P>
   They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the
governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper
come across their desks. No one in high office questions it: that
would be too hard.
</P>
<P>
   One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however.
Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment
because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had
ended with the conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it
is growing in intensity.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the argument; it's over now. Betty Lou Beets is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone
there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and
Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And
America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL;

   LONDON _ From the moment the alarm rings in the morning, it is
all a blur. One cup of coffee, then pack the lunches, dress the
children, wolf a piece of toast, race to school in the rain, belt
to the station.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful respite, albeit in the company of hundreds of other
harassed commuters, reading some documents or the newspaper. Then a
sprint to the desk at the other end, plunging straight into eight
or nine or ten hours of work with no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then home as fast as possible to take over the child care, to
the relief of partner or nanny. Finally, most professional days end
comatose in front of the TV, drink in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Is this you?
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of working life is one of the staples of dinner
party conversation: the long hours, having to take work home at the
weekends, the impossibility of escape from the demands of mobile
phone and pager.
</P>
<P>
   Many a person with a good and satisfying job is likely to feel
completely overburdened and harassed, unable to square the demands
of their work with the needs of their family, never mind having any
free time for themselves. The pace of life feels as though it is
growing ever-faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the face of it unrelated, such pressures are one
aspect of the demographic problem suffered by most industrialized
economies.
</P>
<P>
   All have an aging population due to lower birthrates in recent
decades. The ratio of the elderly to the working-age population is
rising, very sharply in the case of countries like Germany, Italy
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the policy focus has concerned the fiscal problem this
implies. If the public sector is paying pensions though a
pay-as-you-go system, aging implies exploding government spending.
</P>
<P>
   And the policy prescriptions have consisted of measures to cap
this public spending, replacing it with private pension provision.
British governments tackled this early; the U.K. pension problem is
to ensure that low earners do not fall into poverty in their old
age.
</P>
<P>
   But is aging an economic problem in a broader sense? There is
some evidence that it is linked to slower productivity growth, but
even this is not necessarily a matter for concern when retirement
is seen as a positive choice for more leisure over more income.
</P>
<P>
   After all, older people could continue to work longer, yet the
average retirement age has been trending downwards for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development show that for the average OECD male with life
expectancy of 76 years, 38 years are now spent in the work force
and the rest in education, unemployment and, especially,
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The typical retirement component has climbed from a couple of
years in 1960 to more than a decade now.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for women is different, with 28 years of the
expected 80 spent in employment, decreased unemployment, and an
increase in retirement from less than 10 to more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect is that, on present trends, the share of the
population in work will peak at close to 50 percent some time
between now and 2005, and then as the postwar baby boom starts to
think longingly of leisurely days pottering in the garden, to
plummet to 41 percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is nothing innately bad, in an economic sense,
in mass gardening or line-dancing by the over-60s.
</P>
<P>
   But given the scale of the aging affecting the OECD economies,
and the nature of the intense pressures being felt by those
currently working, a blazingly obvious policy question is why on
earth do we have a tax and benefit system that encourages people to
take all their leisure when they are older, and none when it would
be most desirable to them, in the prime of life?
</P>
<P>
   After all, research conducted by the OECD's analysts shows that
on the whole people do not use their formal retirement to sail
around the world, visit the lost temples of the Incas or start a
new e-business from the spare room.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly they do more of the things they always used to do in
their leisure time anyway: watch TV, see family and friends, or
plant lobelias in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe bet that most people would rather spread their
leisure more evenly over their whole lifetimes, and not take it all
in the final 10-20 years. Peter Hicks, the OECD's aging expert,
says the existing institutional framework makes this financially
untenable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stacked the cards in favor of early retirement. People
do not have a free choice.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, tax systems favor saving for a pension in old age
far more than ordinary saving that can be spent at any time of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and benefit systems, employment rights and career status are
still firmly tied to the full-time breadwinner model, and tend to
militate against part-time work, so it can be hard to work
part-time for more years out of one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Many company pensions are linked to final salary, making them
far more generous for salarymen who slog away for ever-increasing
pay until they are past 55. &QL;

   Hicks says: ``Why should governments be funding retirement?'' A

<P>
   Of course, there will always be a role for government in

<P>
   But making a special effort to create incentives for people to

REPORT SAYS MEDIOCRITY RULED COPS

   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ A devastating internal probe of the LAPD
corruption scandal to be released Wednesday condemns the command
staff for fostering a culture of ``mediocrity'' that poisoned the
rank and file and allowed a few rogue officers to commit crimes and
frame innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Officers at every level of the Los Angeles Police Department
were failing to do their jobs, the LAPD Board of Inquiry concluded
based upon its exhaustive review, which was conducted by about 300
ranking officers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The board's nearly 400-page report, obtained Tuesday by the
Daily News, found no evidence of widespread corruption. But the
findings, which will be given to the Police Commission today,
include 108 recommendations to overhaul the management and
oversight in the LAPD, once considered among the nation's finest
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has devastated our relationship with the public
we serve and threatened the integrity of our entire criminal
justice system,'' the board concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distrust, cynicism, fear of the police and an erosion of
community law and order are the inevitable result of a law
enforcement agency whose ethics and integrity have become
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, public safety in the city has been harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented condemnation of his own department, LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks agreed there is strong evidence that the
department's failings are pervasive, but still could have been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to get out of mediocrity, we have to have the
courage to begin to expect more,'' Parks said during an interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter attached to the board's report, the chief promised
that the officers involved in ``disgraceful activity will be dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned: ``We as an organization must recognize that,
while they individually and collectively provided the motivation,
we as an organization provided the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry said its five-month probe found no reason
to believe that the actions of dirty cop Rafael Perez were
representative of the entire department. It portrayed Perez as a
rogue officer who sold out his department's value system to steal
cocaine from an LAPD evidence room in order to live the lifestyle
of a ``high roller.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, now the key informant in the largest police corruption
scandal in the city's history, has told investigators that he and
other corrupt cops in the Rampart Division's special anti-gang unit
shot unarmed suspects, brutalized suspects, framed innocent people
for crimes and lied in court to send many to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry was convened in September by Parks to
investigate corruption related to the Rampart Division. Based upon
the analysis of tens of thousands of documents and hundreds of
interviews, the board examined the top-to-bottom management of the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems uncovered by the board boiled down to
``people failing to do their jobs with a high level of consistency
and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we found this to be true at all levels of the
organization, including top managers, first-line supervisors and
line personnel,'' the board noted. ``Clearly, pride in one's work
and a commitment to do things correctly the first time seems to
have waned.''
</P>
<P>
   Specific recommendations by the board include toughening the
LAPD's screening process for potential cops, limiting the tour of
duty of officers in specialized units, expanding the Internal
Affairs Division, placing more senior officers in the field,
conducting sting operations to catch dirty cops and raising
standards for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The board added that it should continue to investigate and audit
at least seven different areas of concern within the LAPD,
including the activities of every special Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) anti-gang unit and the department's
use of confidential informants.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape will be shown at roll calls during the coming week
to express to officers what the Board of Inquiry report means and
how it will affect them. In addition, a follow-up report will be
issued next year when a special task force concludes its
investigation into the widening corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the board, mediocrity ``flourishes'' in the LAPD
largely due to incompetent senior officers who fail to challenge
the rank and file. In many cases, the top cops make excuses for an
overall laziness and lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediocrity was alive and well in Rampart up until about 1998.
We are sad to report that we also found mediocrity threatening to
engulf many of our other workplace environments as well,'' the
board wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say or imply in any way that corruption is
occurring throughout the department, for we do not believe that is
the case. However, there are strong indicators that mediocrity is
flourishing in many other workplaces and the mind-set of too many
managers and supervisors is allowing it to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than challenging our people to do their best, too many
of our leaders are allowing mediocre performance and, in cases,
even making excuses for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Police Commission, Parks said the
department ``created the opportunity for this cancer to grow'' by
failing to review officers' reports, examine events to identify
patterns of misconduct and provide effective oversight and audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has experienced the death of a child, or suffered
through the humiliation of being victimized by a violent crime,
knows they can never again look at the world in the same way.
Organizations, too, have those defining moments and the events that
have been uncovered in Rampart will and should be just such a
life-altering experience for the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget that this occurred and be ever vigilant
that we never allow the opportunity for this to occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Parks said he believes the problems go back
more than two decades, when the department was at its lowest
strength and officers began to cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was being asked to do so much and then you begin
taking shortcuts,'' Parks said. ``Then people begin doing more and
more and soon it becomes ingrained. And then people with
administrative experience leave and once that level of knowledge is
gone, it can't be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks noted that the Board of Inquiry identified other areas of
the department in which there are the same systemic problems that
existed at Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had officers working their own sources without reporting to
supervisors. We had officers writing reports and their own booking
instructions with no supervision. We were just accepting what was
being written,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry categorized its recommendations into nine
general areas: the testing and screening of police officer
candidates, personnel practices, personnel investigations and
management of risk, corruption investigations, operational
controls, anti-corruption inspections and audits, ethics and
integrity training, job-specific training and work that the board
should continue to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are ``both critical to ensuring a
corruption-free Department and achievable with minimal budgetary
impact,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's probe was launched after investigators discovered
the disturbing link among three serious crimes that occurred
between late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In each incident - a November 1997 bank robbery; a February 1998
station-house beating, and the March 1998 theft of three kilos of
cocaine from an LAPD evidence room - cops were identified as
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the suspected dirty officers were closely associated, either
working as partners or close friends. All but one of them were
assigned to Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those cases, Parks said he believes the LAPD training
system does not need to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Perez and some of the other officers involved,
they knew that what they were doing was a violation of
procedures,'' Parks said. ``To that extent, the training worked, in
they knew that what they were doing was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he expects the criminal investigation to be completed
this year, but that the lawsuits and other effects will go on
several years more.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, bolstered last week by the addition of eight
FBI agents, has resulted in the suspension or dismissal of 20 cops
and the reversal of 40 criminal convictions. At least 15 civil
lawsuits have been filed against the city, seeking hundreds of
millions of dollars in damages.

<P>
   LONDON _ From the moment the alarm rings in the morning, it is
all a blur. One cup of coffee, then pack the lunches, dress the
children, wolf a piece of toast, race to school in the rain, belt
to the station.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful respite, albeit in the company of hundreds of other
harassed commuters, reading some documents or the newspaper. Then a
sprint to the desk at the other end, plunging straight into eight
or nine or ten hours of work with no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then home as fast as possible to take over the child care, to
the relief of partner or nanny. Finally, most professional days end
comatose in front of the TV, drink in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Is this you?
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of working life is one of the staples of dinner
party conversation: the long hours, having to take work home at the
weekends, the impossibility of escape from the demands of mobile
phone and pager.
</P>
<P>
   Many a person with a good and satisfying job is likely to feel
completely overburdened and harassed, unable to square the demands
of their work with the needs of their family, never mind having any
free time for themselves. The pace of life feels as though it is
growing ever-faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the face of it unrelated, such pressures are one
aspect of the demographic problem suffered by most industrialized
economies.
</P>
<P>
   All have an aging population due to lower birthrates in recent
decades. The ratio of the elderly to the working-age population is
rising, very sharply in the case of countries like Germany, Italy
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the policy focus has concerned the fiscal problem this
implies. If the public sector is paying pensions though a
pay-as-you-go system, aging implies exploding government spending.
</P>
<P>
   And the policy prescriptions have consisted of measures to cap
this public spending, replacing it with private pension provision.
British governments tackled this early; the U.K. pension problem is
to ensure that low earners do not fall into poverty in their old
age.
</P>
<P>
   But is aging an economic problem in a broader sense? There is
some evidence that it is linked to slower productivity growth, but
even this is not necessarily a matter for concern when retirement
is seen as a positive choice for more leisure over more income.
</P>
<P>
   After all, older people could continue to work longer, yet the
average retirement age has been trending downwards for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development show that for the average OECD male with life
expectancy of 76 years, 38 years are now spent in the work force
and the rest in education, unemployment and, especially,
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The typical retirement component has climbed from a couple of
years in 1960 to more than a decade now.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for women is different, with 28 years of the
expected 80 spent in employment, decreased unemployment, and an
increase in retirement from less than 10 to more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect is that, on present trends, the share of the
population in work will peak at close to 50 percent some time
between now and 2005, and then as the postwar baby boom starts to
think longingly of leisurely days pottering in the garden, to
plummet to 41 percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is nothing innately bad, in an economic sense,
in mass gardening or line-dancing by the over-60s.
</P>
<P>
   But given the scale of the aging affecting the OECD economies,
and the nature of the intense pressures being felt by those
currently working, a blazingly obvious policy question is why on
earth do we have a tax and benefit system that encourages people to
take all their leisure when they are older, and none when it would
be most desirable to them, in the prime of life?
</P>
<P>
   After all, research conducted by the OECD's analysts shows that
on the whole people do not use their formal retirement to sail
around the world, visit the lost temples of the Incas or start a
new e-business from the spare room.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly they do more of the things they always used to do in
their leisure time anyway: watch TV, see family and friends, or
plant lobelias in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe bet that most people would rather spread their
leisure more evenly over their whole lifetimes, and not take it all
in the final 10-20 years. Peter Hicks, the OECD's aging expert,
says the existing institutional framework makes this financially
untenable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stacked the cards in favor of early retirement. People
do not have a free choice.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, tax systems favor saving for a pension in old age
far more than ordinary saving that can be spent at any time of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and benefit systems, employment rights and career status are
still firmly tied to the full-time breadwinner model, and tend to
militate against part-time work, so it can be hard to work
part-time for more years out of one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Many company pensions are linked to final salary, making them
far more generous for salarymen who slog away for ever-increasing
pay until they are past 55. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hicks says: ``Why should governments be funding retirement?'' A
tax system generous to savings might be a good idea for other
reasons, but it should be neutral about when people choose to spend
their savings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will always be a role for government in
ensuring that old people _ like younger ones _ have adequate
incomes. And there is a question of ensuring there are incentives
for people to save enough for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But making a special effort to create incentives for people to
stop working at 60 is sheer pensions madness.
</P>
<P>
   When will governments have the vision to lift their eyes above
the problem pensions pose for their budgets and tackle the crazy
structure of lifetime work incentives? &QL;

   LONDON _ People who use the Internet for as little as five hours
a week are less likely to talk to or visit their family and friends
and are in danger of shutting themselves off from society,
according to new research.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet expands so people can shop, chat with friends
and conduct business online, researchers from the Stanford
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in America have
found that the technology is having a damaging social impact even
when people use it in modest amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spent 5-10 hours a week online reported a 25 percent
fall in social activity _ spending less time talking on the phone
or face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Norman Nie, director of the Stanford Institute and his
colleague, Professor Lutz Erbring, have published preliminary
results from the biggest study yet into how the Internet is
changing daily life.
</P>
<P>
   They found that as people increasingly turned to the Internet
for their needs they were isolating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 60 percent of the time they spent online came from
watching less television, the rest was at the expense of seeing or
talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use the Internet at even modest amounts, of five or
10 hours a week, are reporting that they see fewer people, talk to
fewer people and go out less often. This merits concern,'' said
Professor Nie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 4,113 adults in nearly 3,000
households across America. More than half had Internet access and
one-quarter used the Internet for between five and 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   These people reported that since they had gone online they spent
8 percent less time attending social events, 13 percent less time
with family and friends and 26 percent less time talking to people
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Nie there is no doubt that people do form
strong relationships over the Internet but it is not the same as a
healthy social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't share a coffee or a beer with somebody on e-mail, or
give them a hug,'' he said. &QL;

   LONDON _ People who use the Internet for as little as five hours
a week are less likely to talk to or visit their family and friends
and are in danger of shutting themselves off from society,
according to new research.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet expands so people can shop, chat with friends
and conduct business online, researchers from the Stanford
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in America have
found that the technology is having a damaging social impact even
when people use it in modest amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spent 5-10 hours a week online reported a 25 percent
fall in social activity _ spending less time talking on the phone
or face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Norman Nie, director of the Stanford Institute and his
colleague, Professor Lutz Erbring, have published preliminary
results from the biggest study yet into how the Internet is
changing daily life.
</P>
<P>
   They found that as people increasingly turned to the Internet
for their needs they were isolating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 60 percent of the time they spent online came from
watching less television, the rest was at the expense of seeing or
talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use the Internet at even modest amounts, of five or
10 hours a week, are reporting that they see fewer people, talk to
fewer people and go out less often. This merits concern,'' said
Professor Nie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 4,113 adults in nearly 3,000
households across America. More than half had Internet access and
one-quarter used the Internet for between five and 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   These people reported that since they had gone online they spent
8 percent less time attending social events, 13 percent less time
with family and friends and 26 percent less time talking to people
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Nie there is no doubt that people do form
strong relationships over the Internet but it is not the same as a
healthy social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't share a coffee or a beer with somebody on e-mail, or
give them a hug,'' he said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is, as someone else said in a rather different
context, a funny old world.
</P>
<P>
   Two global corporate titans, Ford and Unilever, announced
recently that they are getting rid of thousands of their workers.
But we are undoubtedly going to go on needing Unilever's detergent
powder, shampoo and frozen peas, and we will certainly be driving
around in Ford cars for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy may be out of fashion, but we still need the
things it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the shares of companies like Nokia and Freeserve
continue to dazzle. Yet in another 30 years' time the Internet is
going to be so utterly different that the companies involved in it
may not even exist.
</P>
<P>
   And while I do think we will still be making mobile phone calls,
surely there won't be much added value in transporting electronic
signals across the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, we all could manage without high-speed Internet
access, but most of us would find it tough to manage without
shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   For personal investors this commonsense approach clearly rings
true. There is a new boom in people investing online, but despite
the fact that the dealing is done over the Internet, apparently
most of the funds are going into old economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the professionals in the financial markets, though,
high-technology is the only thing that matters. Were it not for a
couple of sectors such as mobile communications and any form of
Internet-related business, we would be in a bear market, with
shares of the old-economy companies plunging almost by the day.
</P>
<P>
   So the professionals have, so far at least, been right. But has
the world gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the investment experts in London's City and the other
financial centers can produce sound arguments to justify this twist
in share prices, reasons why those of the old economy should plunge
and those of the new should soar. They are very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   But all people, however highly paid, make errors of judgment. In
the 1980s most of the professionals assumed that the Japanese
economy would continue to conquer and that America's was set for
inevitable decline. Now we know that both ideas were rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   So will the current adulation of the new economy look equally
daft 10 years from now? The answer, I think, is no and yes.
</P>
<P>
   No, because the whole world economy will be transformed in a way
that none of us have experienced in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, as it happens, is Henry Ford's invention of
the production line. This popularized the car, turning it from an
elite item into a mass consumer one.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a similar transformation to take place as a result of the
telecommunications revolution. Just as the production line brought
costs down and improved quality, expect a similar change as a
result of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is that squeeze on both prices and costs that is spooking the
shares of the companies in the old economy. Yes, we will go on
shopping in supermarkets, but we will be able to compare prices
between them at a click of the mouse. So they have to cut their
margins. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But these companies do have a way of fighting back, which is to
use the same technology to cut their own costs.
</P>
<P>
   We think of communications revolution as chatting to our friends
on a mobile or sending e-mails. But the same technology is being
used by companies to crunch their production chains. Ordering and
paying for components becomes automatic.
</P>
<P>
   An example. A few weeks ago the first generation of hi-tech
refrigerators were rolled out. Apparently they remember if you are
running out of, say, milk, and will order more _ over a mini-mobile
phone _ from the supermarket, so that the next delivery will
include the appropriate number of cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though our stock control at home leaves a great deal to be
desired, I cannot imagine anything I would like less than have the
fridge deciding what to buy from the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are making shampoo it would presumably be great if
the machine always made sure it has the appropriate amount of raw
materials. So the Tescos, Unilevers and Fords of the world will
spend the next 10 years using this new technology to squeeze down
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary, but it is quite plausible that 10 years from now
the price we pay for goods will be five percentage points lower
than it would otherwise be, simply as a result of the new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But we are not going to wash our hair more often or eat more
frozen peas, so volumes will not rise much. It is tough to run a
business in a world where prices come down and volumes don't rise.
The old economy will be a cold economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   On the other hand we will make more mobile phone calls _ and
even if we don't, our children will.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, all the old-economy companies will have to buy
expensive communications kit to upgrade their offices and
factories. The companies that develop these, the new economy
companies, will duly flourish.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage even these new technologies will become
commonplace. Instead of being the hottest product in town, the
Web-enabled mobile phone will become just another thing we all
have, like a color television.
</P>
<P>
   But there is perhaps another 20 or 30 years before that happens.
Meanwhile the boom will continue.
</P>
<P>
   So it is easy to understand the adulation of the new economy,
and the concern about the old one. But at the same time, might this
adulation appear daft a decade from now? Because it has gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long history of markets (and remember that markets
are just a collection of individuals) getting carried away with
themselves when a new technology bursts out. There were successive
railway booms in the last century. There was a radio boom in the
U.S. in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   During such booms people correctly identify the growth potential
of the new technology, but they price it wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, mobile phone penetration in Britain will rise from 50
percent this year to 80 percent in 2003. But maybe we won't all
change our phones every 18 months as we do now. Maybe phone charges
will plunge so much that while we will talk more, we will pay less
for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the potential of high-technology firms will be
reassessed and, who knows, maybe even the new dot.com companies
will have to make a profit. &QL;

<P>
   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party. But there is no
danger of Haider, the most successful politician in postwar Austria
and an ambitious chancellor wannabe, disappearing from the scene.
In fact, his retreat is likely to prove a tactical gambit. &QL;

Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _

   (UNDATED) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives
in Prague next week on a trip that many in her native capital see
as a declaration of interest in the country's presidency.
Czech-born Albright is being touted as a possible replacement for
Vaclav Havel, whose term of office ends in 2002. Havel told
Albright a year and a half ago that he wanted her to replace him,
according to a report in Time magazine Monday. &QL;

   TBLISI, GEORGIA _ In the snow-covered mountains of northern
Georgia, soldiers can hear the roar of battle across the border in
Chechnya creeping gradually towards them. Georgia, the fragile
republic on the southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, is
trying hard to stay out of the Chechen conflict. A weary-looking
Georgian President Edouard Shevardnadze told The Independent
Saturday, ``we are doing everything we can to avoid getting
involved.'' &QL;

   &UR; HAIDER GOOSE-STEPS DOWN AMID DER FUROR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider stunned
political friends and foes alike by announcing Monday that he
wanted to step down as leader of the Freedom Party. But there is no
danger of Haider, the most successful politician in postwar Austria
and an ambitious chancellor wannabe, disappearing from the scene.
In fact, his retreat is likely to prove a tactical gambit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Just after learning to his evident amazement that
his presidential ambitions were still alive, thanks to the voters
of Michigan, Senator John McCain issued a curious appeal. ``Don't
fear my campaign, fellow Republican,'' he pleaded, ``join it, join
it.'' Mindful that only 40 percent of all U.S. voters are
Republicans and that anyone who wants to be president must appeal
across party lines, George W. Bush responded with an appeal of his
own, calling on ``Republicans and like-minded independents'' to
support him. Which candidate will capture the hearts _ and votes _
of Republicans? &QL;

   It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty in America.
Indeed, the legal process permits people to be executed with a
casualness _ and callousness _ that is shocking. There are now more
than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And America can, and
may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL;

KINGS LEAVE TOO MANY CHANCES ON TABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ziggy Palffy was back and spent most of Monday
buzzing the Vancouver Canucks net.
</P>
<P>
   But except for Palffy's goal just minutes into the game, the Los
Angeles Kings couldn't capitalize on his return from back problems
as they tied the Canucks 1-1 in front of 15,666 at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   They blew a great scoring chance in the second period when they
had a 5-on-3 advantage on the power play for 1:06 but could not
score.
</P>
<P>
   After that they let down, allowing Vancouver defenseman Jason
Strudwick to score his first NHL goal with just 29 seconds
remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they outshot the Canucks 18-9 in the second period
and spent most of the third in the Vancouver, it was another
frustrating night.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, they blew a 2-1 lead in San Jose and were beaten
6-3 in the finale of a seven-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had beaten the Canucks the night before in Vancouver
but lost Palffy when Matt Cooke cross-checked him across the back
of the neck in the second period. They also lost defenseman Garry
Galley with a neck injury, but he returned and was on the ice for
Palffy's goal.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating part of the night for the Kings came midway
through the second period when they had a 5-on-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Naslund was the first to go for Vancouver when he
interfered with Kings goaltender Stephane Fiset. Then, at 12:38,
Murray Baron went off for closing his hand on the puck.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings power play, which came in sixth in the league with an
18.2 conversion rate, never really got rolling. Defenseman Rob
Blake had three shots, all from long range, but he also hit Palffy
with a pass in front that probably was the Kings' best scoring
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver entered the game 24th in overall penalty killing but
looked far better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked so good for the Kings when Palffy scored just 1:24
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   He took a pass in the slot from Sean O'Donnell that ticked off
the skate of Luc Robitaille and fired it past Vancouver goaltender
Felix Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Palffy's 25th goal. If he stays healthy, he has a chance
to reach 40 goals for the fourth time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy had a chance for more with 12.4 seconds left in the
second period when he took a pass from Rob Blake in front. But this
time Palffy's shot struck Potvin's pad and stuck.
</P>
<P>
   During that period the Kings took 18 shots at Potvin even though
they had few good chances during the 5-on-3 advantage. The game
remained tied 1-1 heading into the third.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when they could have gone in the tank, the Canucks
have mounted a mini-rally in an attempt to reach the postseason.
They entered the game eight points behind San Jose for the eighth
and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   They came in 6-3-1 since the All-Star break, including a 2-1
victory Sunday against Phoenix. The Canucks say they aren't trading
captain Mark Messier, who is 39 and has one season left on his
contract at $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   That could change if they cool off. But they got back another
one-time big scorer Tuesday when Alexander Mogilny returned after
missing eight games with a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But for Strudwick, who began his career with the New York
Islanders during the 1995-96 season, this was his night.
</P>
<P>
   With 19:31 gone in the first, Todd Bertuzzi dug the puck out of
the corner and lobbed it into the slot. Strudwick caught it,
dropped it and fired. He beat Fiset over the right shoulder to tie
the game.

ANOTHER COSTLY MISS FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Bruins returned from their weekend games in
Washington and Pittsburgh with three of four points, there was a
glimmer of optimism, a ray of hope that this club had what it takes
to make a strong push for a playoff spot. As tight as the race is
in the Eastern Conference, it seemed possible they could turn their
fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, it's very likely a mirage. With 19 games left, the
Bruins Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night blew a golden chance to gain ground as they
lost to the Ottawa Senators at the FleetCenter, 5-3. With a roster
that has as many American Hockey League players as NHL players, one
that is decimated by injuries, one that lacks passion and
consistency . . . well, it's not over yet, but the light at the end
of the dark tunnel is looking more and more like an oncoming
high-speed locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some serious issues with this team, bigger than we
know,'' said goalie Rob Tallas, who had the thankless task of
mopping up for John Grahame after defensive errors put the Bruins
down, 3-0, in the second period. ``We've all kind of tried to
figure it out and there are some big issues. It's all mental.
Physically, we're in great shape, but it's the mental part of the
game. The excitement is not there, it's almost like it's not fun
playing a hockey game. This is the greatest game, we've grown up
doing this our whole lives, what is a better job? I don't know if
we're putting pressure on ourselves. It's a job, but it's also a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   A game the Bruins couldn't do anything with. After a scoreless
first in which neither team did much, the Senators turned on their
offense, thanks to some rookie-caliber mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The first Ottawa goal came result of a tough turnover by
defenseman Kyle McLaren. McLaren's attempted relay up ice was
picked off by Ottawa center Kevin Miller, who dished the puck to
right wing Marian Hossa, and he beat Grahame with a backhander for
a 1-0 lead at 3:11.
</P>
<P>
   Another poor play led to the second Ottawa goal, only 36 seconds
later. Again, it was Hossa doing the damage as he potted his 24th
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This time is was left wing Sergei Samsonov who got picked off.
Hossa stole the puck in the right circle and fired a high shot that
beat Grahame at 3:47.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give the puck to the opposition,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``That's basic hockey. You give the puck to the opposition,
like the flat pass Kyle gave right on the guy's stick. I can
understand the young players making mistakes but I do have a lot of
difficulty with that one. We just can't do that. It's those things
that are costing us. I was really disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   It went from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   Sloppy coverage led to Ottawa taking a commanding 3-0 lead at
12:42. Left wing Colin Forbes walked out of the right corner and
with no one stopping him, beat Grahame to the short side. After
that, Burns, looking for a spark, turned to Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do something at that point to maybe try to get things
going,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, whose workload the last few months has been sparse to
say the least, allowed a goal at 15:16 as the Senators ballooned
the lead to 4-0, this time courtesy of veteran right wing Kevin
Dineen.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Bruins apparently decided it was time to play.
Cameron Mann got it started when he potted his third of the year at
3:08. With the Bruins on the power play, Ray Bourque got the puck
at the right point. He dished it across to Don Sweeney at the left.
Sweeney faked a shot and fed a perfect pass into the slot for Mann,
who beat Ron Tugnutt at 3:08. Joe Thornton made it 4-2 at 18:03,
and Samsonov pulled the Bruins within one at 18:28. But, as has so
often been the case, it was too little, too late and Chris
Phillips's empty-net goal at 19:48 sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a desperate, desperate race right here,'' said
Tallas. ``We made no ground. That was a team that slept tonight,
and we could've taken advantage of that and we didn't. I look at
teams we're playing, in Pittsburgh and in Washington. Washington is
a team on a great winning streak. I look at (Capitals center) Adam
Oates and he's smiling before he takes a faceoff, they're talking
on the ice, they're enjoying themselves in the game. Right now, our
eyebrows are down . . . We were a bunch of Bad News Bear guys a
couple of years ago. Everyone took us lightly and we were a young
team and we had so much fun. When you have a losing season, it
brings a cloud over you.''

ITALY BLOWN AWAY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ It has been said of this America's Cup
match that if the teams had switched boats in the beginning, the
outcome would be the same. Never was the observation more clearly
true than in Tuesday's 1-minute 49-second thumping of Italy's Luna
Rossa by Team New Zealand, which took a 4-0 lead in this
best-of-nine match.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Italian afterguard called Tuesday's race, Team New
Zealand could have beaten Prada had the Kiwis been sailing a
Duxbury Duck.
</P>
<P>
   In light winds, Prada appeared a bit quicker than the heavier
NZ60 of New Zealand. But as if the boys from Milan wanted to go
home early, halfway up the first leg, Prada literally gave the race
away to Russell Coutts _ a present, perhaps, on the TNZ skipper's
38th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the start to Coutts and tactician Brad Butterworth
_ who wanted the left _ Prada found itself on the right side of the
course for the first time in four races. All three New Zealand
victories have begun with TNZ on the right.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, both teams' weather departments determined the left
was favored for shifts, and in its attempt to recover the left,
Prada gave up a lead it could have used to take control of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The critical moment came halfway up the first leg. In the first
two crosses upwind, Coutts tacked NZ60 into a lee bow position,
forcing skipper Francesco de Angelis back to the right. But as if
de Angelis and tactician Torben Grael had forgotten the huge power
of the right (owning the starboard tack advantage), at the third
cross, Prada simply gave the race away.
</P>
<P>
   As they came together, Luna Rossa was ahead of NZ60 for the
first time, forcing Coutts to steer bow down and take Prada's
stern. Had Prada then tacked on top of New Zealand, the Italians
would have had control of the race, forcing the Kiwis back to the
left, where they would have had to follow them in ``dirty'' air up
the port layline and around the first mark.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Grael had the left side implanted in his brain and
apparently did not understand what an advantage Luna Rossa had.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand did exactly what Prada could have done _ force the
left-side boat to the port layline, where the only option was to
trail to the mark in the lead boat's dirty air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that with light wind, the left was favored all
day,'' said de Angelis. ``That is what our weather information
said, and we wanted the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Grael agreed: ``Our plan was to have the left side, because
that's where the wind was. But then it went both ways. When you
guess the right way it is one thing, but sometimes you guess the
wrong way. That is just the wind. That's sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Grael was heavily criticized in Race 7 of the semifinals, when
in a similar move _ taking the left rather than covering the
trailing boat _ he let AmericaOne run away with the race.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Grael was scolded by Prada syndicate boss Patrizio
Bertelli, who said the Brazilian tactician, an Olympic gold
medalist, was sailing too much by instinct and not enough by the
match racing book.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli reacted to the latest loss with strong words: ``On a
day when wind conditions were in favor of Luna Rossa _ who proved
to have the same speed as New Zealand, if not faster _ suicidal
tactics gave the race away.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, the two-time skipper of Team New Zealand, Tuesday tied
an America's Cup record for consecutive victories _ nine _ since
the start of the 1995 Cup in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were crossing their stern, I thought it was not a
great situation, but then it turned out to be OK,'' said Coutts.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts said he and his team were not affected by four days off,
which included two cancellation days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This regatta has gone on a lot longer than we wanted it to.
Our plan is to go out and end it tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With moderate to strong winds forecast for Wednesday's race (No.
5), New Zealand could put an end to the 30th America's Cup, winning
again the oldest trophy in sports, first awarded in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts represents the second generation of New Zealand sailors.
Having won an Olympic gold medal in Star Class in 1984 as a
24-year-old, he watched another young Kiwi skipper, Chris Dickson,
lead New Zealand into its first America's Cup in Freemantle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis came close, but Dickson lost the Louis Vuitton Cup to
Stars &AMP; Stripes that year. Coutts was the backup helmsman in 1992,
when New Zealand again lost the challenger trials to Paul Cayard on
Il Moro.
</P>
<P>
   Back with a new program and its two ``Black Magic'' boats in
1995, Team New Zealand began its streak of seeming invincibility.

FAMILY HAS BEATEN CANCER, HOLOCAUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scott Greenberg doesn't need to run the Los
Angeles Marathon. He could easily continue his thriving career as a
motivational speaker by relating inspirational stories of his
triumph over cancer and his grandmother's survival of the Holocaust
as an employee in Oskar Schindler's factory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Greenberg will put his body on the line Sunday, and
despite the fact that he had no running experience at this time
last year, he will attempt to complete the 26.2-mile course, if
only to prove that he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motto has become, `Even if it's not a good time, it's a
good story,' '' said Greenberg, 29, a Sherman Oaks resident who
travels the country to speak to businesses, schools and various
groups. ``When I give my presentations, one of my primary subjects
is overcoming adversity, and in order to maintain some credibility
I need to expose myself to adversity, to prove that my message is
valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself, `What's the most-extreme thing you can do
besides getting cancer again?' and I came up with running a
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens this weekend, Greenberg realizes it will pale
in comparison to his current tale of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg grew up in San Diego, and after graduation from UCLA
in 1992 embarked on a promising career in the movie industry as a
graduate student at New York University, which has one of the
country's top film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg enjoyed New York and its contrasts to his Southern
California suburbia upbringing, but his stay would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, near the end of my first semester, I came home from
a film shoot,'' Greenberg said. ``I was laying in bed, and when I
scratched my neck I felt this bump, and it was large, about the
size of a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the next day I went to the doctor, and he said it
was just a swollen lymph node, and that there was a small chance it
could be HIV but that it was probably nothing to worry about. He
told me to come back in four or five days.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, however, Greenberg's phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to come back into the office immediately,''
Greenberg said. ``For 30 or 45 minutes, I was convinced that I had
HIV because why else would they want me to come in right away?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg didn't have HIV, but his diagnosis wasn't much more
positive. Greenberg, at age 22, was told he had Hodgkin's Disease,
a form of cancer particularly prevalent among young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight months of chemotherapy and radiation were in
Greenberg's future, which forced him to drop out of school and
return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't understand it,'' Greenberg said. ``My family
had always had good health care, I didn't smoke and I didn't do
drugs, so I didn't know how I could have changed my lifestyle to
prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that moment, when I found out, was a defining moment. My
first thought was, `OK, what do I need to do to get better?' It
wasn't, `Oh my God, why me?' even though I'm sure I was in shock.
But if anything, based on my grandmother's experience, it was `Why
not me?'
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's grandmother, who still does not want her name
revealed today for fear of Nazis, lived in Krakow, Poland, at the
onset of World War II. Her parents were both taken away and killed,
but she was sent to work for Schindler, who helped prevent the
deaths of thousands of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about my grandmother truly made me appreciate life,
and I made the decision to live life to its fullest,'' Greenberg
said. ``I didn't know if I was going to live or not, but either I
was going to die, or I was going to live and have a wonderful story
to share with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to clubs, I tried to meet girls and generally live
my life the way I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1993, on the eve of his final radiation treatment,
Greenberg was invited to Santa Barbara by a friend to speak at a
banquet. He spoke of his triumph and began to mold his current
presentation of inspiration mixed with humor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several youths asked Greenberg to speak at their
school, and a career was born. Greenberg now travels the country
(he will leave for Hawaii shortly after completing the marathon)
and established his own Web site (www.ScottGreenberg.com) to help
spread his message.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, now married, has been cancer-free for more than six
years, even though the radiation increases his chances of
developing leukemia in the future. Last year, his brother Brent ran
in San Diego's Rock and Roll Marathon in his honor to raise money
for the Leukemia Society, which sparked Greenberg's interest in
running in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at all those people, and I thought, `I'm such a
loser,' '' Greenberg said with a laugh. ``Running requires such a
high level of discipline, and I'd love to finish in four-and-a-half
hours, but the number one thing is just to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know life is short, and no matter what, I intend to enjoy
it.''!dlim!!end!

UMASS UPSET BY GW

<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ After 28 games, including a midseason surge
that presumably offset a sluggish start, it's difficult to believe
the University of Massachusetts is mired in misfortune again. But
one game remains in the Minutemen's regular season, and coach
Bruiser Flint is still shaking his head and sighing heavily at
postgame press conferences while trying to explain how another
winnable game got away.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, it was thought that such moments were over for this
season. UMass was beating teams it could beat, and playing well
against squads with more talent and depth.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, George Washington made the Minutemen take a
giant step backward. The younger, quicker Colonials rallied from a
7-point deficit with 6:51 left by taking advantage of several UMass
miscues down the stretch for an 87-86 Atlantic 10 upset, spoiling
the Minutemen's Senior Night before a crowd of 5,430.
</P>
<P>
   Following the debacle, Flint didn't mince words: ``We played
dumb basketball. That's why we lost. We had our chances. We shut
them down. But we have to play smart basketball. And we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   GW freshman guard SirValiant Brown, the A-10's top scorer and
one of the national leaders, had 35 points, including the
Colonials' last 7. He sank 1 of 2 free throws twice over the final
23 seconds to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games we felt if we could get it in the
80s, 90s, we have a chance,'' said coach Tom Penders, whose team
leads the A-10 in scoring but is last in defense. ``If we got into
a slug-it-out, halfcourt game, we had no chance. We did the right
things down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   And UMass didn't.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 8 in the second half, the Minutemen
rallied and took a 78-71 lead with 6:51 to go. But GW regained the
lead and went ahead, 85-82, with 1:24 left on a layup by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   UMass (15-13, 9-6) had several chances to silence GW's rally.
But with 5:16 left, guard Shannon Crooks was whistled for a
backcourt violation. With 2:45 left, he missed on a dunk attempt.
Then forward Mike Babul missed two free throws with 2:16 left and
turned the ball over with 1:41 to go.
</P>
<P>
   GW (15-13, 9-6) scored after each of the Minutemen miscues.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:07 left, guard Monty Mack (22 points) hit a left baseline
jumper, pulling the Minutemen within 1 (85-84), and when Brown
turned the ball over on GW's next possession, Mack raced up the
floor with a chance for the lead. But he missed a pullup jumper
with :27.6 left, and Brown got the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   He was fouled and sank one free throw to put GW up by 2, but on
the ensuing possession, Crooks was hit with an offensive foul in
the paint with 12.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The officials) said the guy was there,'' said Flint,
referring to GW forward Antxon Iturbe, who drew the charge. ``What
else can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   With 11.6 seconds left, Brown sank another free throw, putting
GW up, 87-84. Mack misfired on a trey attempt at the other end, and
teammate Chris Kirkland (a team-high 26 points) scored on a putback
with 2.1 seconds left for the game's final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, the Minutemen took solace that they can
still claim a first-round bye in the Atlantic 10 tournament with a
win Saturday at St. Bonaventure. The Bonnies beat UMass, 70-60, in
Amherst Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen need 16 wins to assure themselves a winning
season, which would make them eligible for the National Invitation
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go and just win the game,'' said Flint. ``I know
it's disappointing, because I've never lost a game on Senior Night
(as a coach). I lost my last college game on Senior Night, and you
never forget that.''

MURPHY, EAGLES SOAR TO RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With just over a minute to go in the first half
Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night against Syracuse, Boston College guard Alissa Murphy
went down, the team trainer came to the floor, and the crowd went
silent as the senior hobbled into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Would this be the way she would say goodbye to her career at
Conte Forum?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy scored a season-high 25 points and was 4 for 4 from the
3-point line as the BC women's basketball team trounced Syracuse,
80-60. The Eagles (23-7, 12-4 Big East) have not lost at home all
season, and they have the best record in school history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that No. 19 BC will host the first and second
rounds of the NCAA tournament in three weeks (March 16-19).
</P>
<P>
   After Syracuse struck first with a field goal by center Leigh
Aziz and two free throws by forward Beth Record, BC came back with
two layups by center Jamie Cournoyer and a jumper by Murphy to go
in front, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles led from that point, building a 15-point lead, 32-17,
at 5:04 behind the outside shooting of Murphy and the inside
shooting of Cournoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Orangewomen would whittle the lead to 5 on a
3-pointer by guard Jamie James of Plymouth and another by Jazmine
Wright, by far the scariest moment for the crowd was when Murphy
went down with 1:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just rolled my ankle,'' said Murphy after the game, with ice
on her right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Cournoyer, who closed the half with a jumper at the buzzer, gave
the Eagles a 36-29 lead going into the locker room. She set them in
motion again when she hit another jumper to open the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (10-17, 3-13) responded with a 3-pointer by Wright and
two free throws by Tara Trammell to bring the Orangewomen to within
4 at 38-34. But the Eagles then went on a 14-0 run, powered by
three field goals by Cournoyer, two more by Murphy, and a 3-point
play by guard Brianne Stepherson.
</P>
<P>
   Three more 3-pointers by James didn't make a dent as the Eagles'
lead grew to 24 with 4:48 to go. Record led the Orangewomen with 15
points, but had just 2 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't patient enough with the ball,'' said Syracuse
coach Marianna Freeman. ``We never picked up the intensity we
needed to play against Boston College. We tried to force Jamie
(Cournoyer) to the middle, then she'd set up on the lefthand side
and start hitting that baby hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Cournoyer, who finished with 22 points and four assists,
shrugged off her exploits under the basket: ``I guess I just
smelled blood.''
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese said she had confidence in her team,
which shot 57 percent (31 of 54) and pulled down 37 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syracuse has a lot of weapons, but we knew we had to put
together a full game,'' Inglese said. ``It's been our goal all
season to go undefeated at home, so I couldn't be more pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepherson finished with 13 points and four assists, while Cal
Bouchard was uncharacteristically quiet with no first-half points
and a total of 6 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bouchard said she isn't ready to close the book on Conte
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it won't be our last game here,'' she said. ``It was
an emotional night, but we're all hoping there will be a couple
more here.''

BOY, 6, ACCUSED IN CLASSMATE'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ A 6-year-old boy sneaked a loaded handgun into a
crowded elementary school here on Tuesday and shot a classmate to
death early on Tuesday morning in front of a large group of
first-grade students, said police officials here.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that they did not know the motive for the
shooting but that they recovered a stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic
handgun at the scene and took the boy into protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shooting at Buell Elementary near Flint, 60
miles from Detroit, occurred just before 10 a.m. When they arrived,
Kayla Renee Rolland, 6, was found with a gunshot wound to the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the shot was fired, the school principal made
an announcement on the school's public address system telling all
teachers to close their classroom doors and lock them.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl who said she was in the school said: ``We just put
our heads down and started praying.''
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, parents, some of them visibly distraught or
angry, rushed to the school to pick up their children. The school,
where additional police officers were sent for crowd-control duty,
was closed for the day at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded girl was treated by paramedics at the school and
then rushed to the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Mich. She was
pronounced dead at 10:29 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting, which occurred in a first grade classroom in front
of about 22 students, is the latest in a series of violent acts
that have struck schools in Colorado, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon
and reverberated across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the first grader involved in Tuesday's incident is the
youngest involved in any of the multiple shootings at schools
around the country over the last few years or other more random
shootings in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the youths found guilty in the schoolyard shootings that
left five dead in Jonesboro, Ark., on March 24, 1998, was 11 at the
time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, a 10-year-old who said he had been taunted by
classmates admitted to fatally shooting a fifth-grade boy. A few
years before, another 10-year-old shot a school bus driver in the
head, critically wounding her.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, the death of 51-year-old substitute teacher
with heart disease was ruled a homicide after she was repeatedly
punched by a 9-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   And in March 1996, a 6-year-old Newark, N.J., boy was arrested
after bring a 9 mm handgun to Our Lady of Good Counsel School and
firing one shot. No one was injured in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in Michigan said on Tuesday that the boy could
not be prosecuted, but he added that he was considering charging
the boy's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I think should be done,'' said Arthur A. Busch,
the Genesee County prosecutor. ``I don't think putting 6-year-old
boys in prison or lock-up is what should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said he did not know if the shooting was
intentional but added that he was investigating reports of a
playground scuffle that may have happened before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were also investigating reports that the
gun had been used in other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who said they believed the boy hid the gun in his
pants pocket, questioned the boy on Tuesday and then released him
to the state's Family Independence Agency, a social services
organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, there were candles and flowers left in front
of the door at the Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris
Township, Mich., in remembrance of the young girl.
</P>
<P>
   The young girl's grandmother, Ingrid Javor, told a local
television station on Tuesday that the boy's family must bear
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a 6-year-old could do this alone,'' Javor said.
``It would have to be his parents. He'd have to watch a lot of
crime to do what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in Florida for a Democratic fund-raiser,
said: ``Why could the child fire the gun? If we have the technology
today to put in these child safety locks, why don't we do it?''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports on Tuesday night on the local television
stations that the boy had been troubled in school. There were also
press reports that his father and grandfather were in prison and
that the boy lived with his mother and an uncle.

BRAEMAR TO HOST ATP EVENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Braemar Country Club in the San Fernando Valley
neighborhood of Tarzana will be host for a men's professional
tennis tournament this summer, former touring pro Vijay Amritraj
announced Tuesday at Braemar.
</P>
<P>
   Amritraj's First Serve Entertainment has been granted a USTA/ATP
Tour Men's Challenger tournament, which will be played July 10-16
on the 20-court Braemar complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to see some of the best young
professional players from various parts of the world,'' said
Amritraj, an Encino resident who plays occasionally at Braemar.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially enthused that San Fernando Valley tennis fans
will get to see upcoming young players ``before they go off and win
the Australian Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenger events carry ATP Tour ranking points and in the past
have attracted such pros as Andre Agassi, whose comeback to his
current No. 1 world ranking began with a Challenger event in
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Amritraj positioned his event at a time he hopes will attract
more top players for Braemar's 32-man singles draw and the 16-team
doubles competition. It immediately precedes a Challenger
tournament in Northern California and is followed by the annual ATP
Tour event in Los Angeles.
</P>

LAKERS EXTEND WIN STREAK TO 12 GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Somewhere, it seemed, the James Naismith trophy
must have been jiggling in its case.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime, down the road a bit, there will be playoff games with
less electricity than the one played here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a game with no long-lasting stakes to speak of took on
the dramatic proportions of an NBA championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it was only appropriate, considering the league's two
best teams were going head-to-head for the final time this season,
battling for control of their division, their conference and the
rights to the NBA's best record as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers played this
ultra-hyped event right down to the wire, where the Lakers pulled
out a 90-87 victory before a sold out sea of red shirts and red
faces at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored a game-high 23 points and made a key
free throw with 24.3 seconds left as the Lakers extended their
winning streak to 12, grabbed the NBA's best record at 46-11 and
pulled a game ahead of the Blazers in the West. They also evened
the season series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for one night's work.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant shook off early foul trouble to finish with 22
points and seven rebounds and was the only other Laker to score in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, the league's best-shooting team, was held to 40.4
percent, while the Lakers hit 44 percent from the field and held up
against the Blazers' array of big bodies (minus Brian Grant, out
with a foot injury).
</P>
<P>
   As if the game needed extra hype, the NBA put a historical
footnote on it: Never before had two teams faced each other with
matching 11-game winning streaks on the line. Not to mention that
these two also were tied for the best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   It lent a playoff feel to a time of season that's often
considered drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a bigger game in the NBA, in my history of the
game, in 33 years,'' said coach Phil Jackson, ``where two teams,
almost 60 games into the season, are tied and they have the best
record in the league, and they're still thumping it out in a
divisional race. I just haven't seen anything quite this dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really neat game, it's great to play and I think it's
good for teams to get this because it gives you that playoff
intensity in the middle of the season. It gets everybody piqued.
And you can judge a little bit of what your opponent is or you are
and gives us a level in which we go back at it maybe in another 2
months.''
</P>
<P>
   No one waited for May to assume playoff intensity, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers struck first, gaining an early six-point lead while
taking advantage of Bryant's absence due to early foul trouble (two
in the first five minutes). But the Lakers kept their poise and
seized control midway through the second quarter with a 16-6 run
that gave them a 42-32 lead, the biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   They settled for a 44-37 halftime lead, remarkable considering
O'Neal was 3 for 10 from the field, Glen Rice had just five points
and Bryant played a mere 13 minutes. But Bryant made the most of
his time, scoring 10 points, and Brian Shaw pitched in seven points
off the bench. Steve Smith led the Blazers with nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Jackson's message to his team was clear: Don't let
the emotions of one game _ albeit a monstrously huge game _ take
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've mentioned it so that there (won't) be a danger in it,
that they understand it's a long week and we've got a lot of games
ahead of us,'' he said. ``And there's still going to be five or six
more losses, at least, for both these teams before the season is
over. The advantage is that . . . it seems like a direction surge
for the winning team in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, there will be little time to dwell on one game
anyway. They returned home early this morning and immediately go
back to work with a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the best thing in the NBA, is that you can play
the next night and either prove yourself or else redeem yourself,''
Jackson said. ``That's the attitude I think you've got to take
until the playoffs come, and then you can really focus all your
energy in one direction.''

VALENCIA WOMAN IS WALKING MIRACLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the elite runners in Sunday's Los Angeles
Marathon will be pushing themselves to the limit for a chance at
$35,000 and a new car, one woman near the back of the pack would
find the biggest thrill of all in simply crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after suffering devastating injuries in an
automobile accident, Valencia resident Brianne Chierighino will
attempt to walk the 26.2-mile course, not knowing if she will be
able to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my accident, for several months I could barely walk to
the bathroom, let alone walk a marathon,'' Chierighino said. ``So
the concept of completing a marathon is invigorating to me. I have
been working so hard to get to where I am and I can't wait to meet
the dare I have placed upon myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, walking is painful and crossing the finish line
will bea miracle for me. I hope to gain a better image of myself
and feel good about who I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>

DUCKS DEFEAT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks did not want to admit that
Tuesday night's game with the San Jose Sharks was as close to a
must-win situation as they have faced all season.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't much doubt they knew exactly what was at stake
when Oleg Tverdovsky put them ahead to stay in the second period at
San Jose Arena. Anaheim players banged their sticks in a rare
mid-game celebration, a celebration that was completed after the
Ducks defeated San Jose 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The much-needed victory moved them into ninth-place in the
Western Conference standings, two points behind both Colorado and
San Jose, which are tied for the final playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky's power-play goal at 18:18 of the second period gave
Anaheim the lead, but the Ducks couldn't breathe any sigh of relief
until Mike Leclerc scored at 11:37 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sharks leading 2-1 early in the second period, the game
turned into a track meet on ice. Both teams traded chances, putting
the pressure squarely on goalies Guy Hebert and Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose had some excellent chances to take a two-goal lead, but
Hebert made a big save on Ronnie Stern's bid from the right circle
eight minutes into the second and the Sharks failed to get a shot
on net on a three-on-one at the 10-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Anaheim appeared snakebit. Ruslan Salei hit the post
and Shields made a great save on Matt Cullen's 15-footer from the
slot before the San Jose goalie wowed the crowd with a sprawling
Dominik Hasek-style save on a breakaway by Ted Donato with nine
minutes left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   But as the crowd screamed its approval of Shields stopping
Donato's bid with his head and shoulder, Steve Rucchin fought
through Marco Sturm on an offensive zone faceoff and pushed the
puck to Marty McInnis, who tapped in the tying goal at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan hit the crossbar and Hebert made two saves on Vincent
Damphousse before Mike Ricci was called for interference on
Rucchin, giving the Ducks a chance to take the lead.

GORE ADMINISTERS HUGE DEFEAT TO BRADLEY IN WASHINGTON STATE
PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs for updating and rewriting throughout story) 
 (sw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore delivered a crushing blow to
former Sen. Bill Bradley in Tuesday's Democratic presidential
primary in Washington, winning the state where Bradley said he
would make his most defiant stand, and where he concentrated his
resources for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who enjoyed the overwhelming support of most of the
state's Democratic establishment and many of its powerful labor and
environmental groups, beat Bradley by more than two to one in a
non-binding ``beauty contest'' primary in which no convention
delegates were at stake but the political viability of Bradley was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to the people of Washington state because it
looks like a big win but I'm not going to take a single thing for
granted,'' Gore told reporters in his hotel room in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With 67 percent of the state's precincts reporting, the vote
was:
</P>
<P>
   Gore: 123,993 (70 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: 53,458 (30 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Given the humiliating margin of defeat, and Bradley's earlier
losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware, it was difficult to see
where he could make his next stand with any great expectation of
turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   About 2{ hours after the polls closed at 7 p.m. Pacific time,
Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, conceded the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost,'' Hauser said. ``We are a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Bradley had no intention of quitting. ``This
campaign is unanimous in its desire to move forward to March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was spending six days of campaigning here, other
candidates, both Democrats and Republicans, were concentrating on
those 16 primaries and caucuses next Tuesday. Some of his
supporters, particularly in New York, began to publicly question
the wisdom of his huge commitment of time and money to a state in
which delegates would not be selected until caucuses next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By Bradley's own admission, the commitment to Washington was a
huge political gamble, an effort to post a win of any kind,
anywhere. His desperate hope was that a win here would help him
regain some of the traction that at one point earlier on in the
nominating process had him nipping at Gore's heels and even briefly
ahead of him in a few places. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his eye had long been on Washington because its
voters, particularly independents, have a tradition of voting for
underdogs and of switching across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   But with that tack, he suddenly found himself competing not only
with with Gore but also with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was
scrambling hard to persuade independents and dissident Democrats to
join him in his uphill effort to snatch the Republican presidential
nomination from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And, in fact, McCain,
though he fell short in winning core Republicans, succeeded on
Tuesday in picking up large numbers of independents and dissident
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the Washington contest, the harder Bradley
hammered Gore, calling him a closet conservative and matching him
television advertisement for television advertisement and mass
mailing for mass mailing, the more difficult the course got.
</P>
<P>
   Then over the weekend Gore dropped into the state and locked up
victory with a series of quick appearances in which he determinedly
defended his credentials as a solid Democrat and, at the same time,
proudly paraded his array of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the results were in, Bradley's campaign was fending
off questions about whether he was about to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation swept through Washington, D.C., on Tuesday that
Bradley would drop out if he failed to win in Washington state. But
Bradley's aides strenuously denied that he would quit before March
7, or that he was being advised to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This camp is working hard towards March 7 and beyond,'' said
Douglas C. Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman. ``I know everybody
wants to write a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   A top New York adviser to Bradley said he had heard speculations
of this sort all day, but attributed it to Gore's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   California, New York, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia, most of New
England, and 10 other states hold Democratic primaries or caucuses
on March 7, when nearly a third of the delegates to the Democratic
national convention will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley announced on Tuesday that he would buy five minutes of
prime time on national television this Thursday to make a direct
appeal to voters five days before those races.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said the taped spot, which will be broadcast at
the end of the CBS news magazine ``48 Hours,'' will feature Bradley
speaking directly into a camera about why he would make the best
president of the four major candidates now running.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign's extraordinary decision to buy national television
time reflects not only Bradley's difficult straits _ he is running
well behind Gore in almost all state polls _ but also his
frustration with the small amount of media attention he has been
receiving. News coverage of the race has been dominated by the
battle between McCain and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign declined to say how much the spot would
cost. But several political consultants who buy television time for
candidates estimated that it would be about $1 million. They also
estimated that the commercial would be seen by more than seven
million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush won forceful victories over
Sen. John McCain in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota on
Tuesday, picking up a large cache of delegates as well as a
considerable morale boost after his discouraging loss in Michigan a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this roller-coaster of a primary season, Bush's three-state
sweep raised sobering questions about McCain's potency as the
campaign moves next week to a rush of a dozen contests across the
nation, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   The largest delegate prize of the day _ 56 _ was here in
Virginia, where both candidates drew heavily from the voter groups
that had supported them in earlier contests for the Republican
presidential nomination. Bush captured faithful Republican voters,
as he did in his victory in South Carolina 10 days ago,
particularly conservatives and those who call themselves members of
the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the overwhelming support of independents and
Democrats. While those voters were responsible for the Arizona
senator's first-place finishes in Michigan and New Hampshire before
that, they accounted for a much smaller proportion of the
electorate here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results also show that the wave of publicity after McCain's
upset victory in Michigan and his fresh appeal that he was ``a
proud Reagan conservative'' were not enough to carry him over the
finish line. And McCain's blunt attacks on leaders of the religious
right on Monday failed to rouse independents and Democrats,
although the senator argued that message would play better in
upcoming states with higher proportions of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took 53 percent of the vote in Virginia; McCain won 44
percent and Alan Keyes took 3 percent. The governor later
characterized his victory as a repudiation of McCain's drive to
paint him as a captive of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one
religion against another,'' Bush said at a rally in Cincinnati.
``This campaign is winning and we're doing it the right way. We are
uniting our party without compromising principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in central California, McCain said he had
called Bush to congratulate him on his victory in Virginia. But he
minimized the governor's accomplishment, suggesting that Bush had
only regional appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look forward to Super Tuesday when we have a broad
section, a cross-section of America, voting all on that same day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believed that his speech against the Christian
right on Monday had damaged him with Virginians, he replied: ``No.
We were talking nationally, not to Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his losses on Tuesday night, the returns from Washington
state contained a glimmer of good news for McCain: voters who did
not declare themselves aligned with either party were able to cast
nonbinding ballots. When those were added to the total, McCain and
Bush ran neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   But only Republican votes can be counted toward delegates. And
while McCain can trumpet his win in the popularity contest, the
outcome in Washington was especially disappointing for him because
his campaign viewed the state _ which has often been hospitable to
insurgents _ as his best chance for victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the North Dakota caucuses, only 19 national convention
delegates were at stake. Bush won an impressive 76 percent of the
vote, McCain, 19 percent, and Keyes, 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, 12 delegates were up for grabs, about a third of
the total in the state. The rest will be picked next week.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bush and McCain were nowhere near Virginia or
Washington as the votes were being counted underscored how the
jumble of contests next Tuesday overshadowed the voting. The
election on March 7 is tantamount to a national primary, with
Republicans going to the polls in California, New York, Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and seven other states. As a result, the
contenders have raced from coast to coast _ and in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not campaigned in Virginia since Friday night. McCain
rushed out of the state early Monday afternoon after condemning Pat
Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell in a speech in Virginia Beach.
On Tuesday, as he bounced from Stockton to Fresno to Bakersfield,
McCain was clearly focused on next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a critical state,'' he said. ``And I need to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome here in the capital of the Confederacy was a
substantial victory for Bush because by capturing all of Virginia's
delegates to the national convention (1,034 are needed for the
nomination), he surpassed McCain in the total delegate tally. This
state has the 10th-largest share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also trumpeted that in the last four days, Bush has
piled up delegates in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and
American Samoa. ``Start adding up the delegates,'' he told
reporters aboard his campaign plane this evening. ``It's been a
pretty good week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was organized in every county in Virginia, relying on the
energetic support of the state's most-prominent elected
Republicans, particularly Gov. James S. Gilmore III and Sen. John
W. Warner, and vastly outspending McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had boasted that he would beat the ``Gilmore-Warner
machine'' just as he had toppled Gov. John M. Engler's organization
in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain just played it wrong in attacking the Gilmore-Warner
machine in Virginia,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of politics
at Catholic University and an expert on Virginia politics. ``He
named probably the two most-popular figures in Virginia politics.
And by making several campaign stops in Virginia, McCain raised the
expectations for his candidacy and failed badly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they played down the significance of the outcome on
Tuesday, McCain's aides had stepped up his budget for Virginia
after the senator's victory in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain folks were working very hard; they bought our whole
voter file,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the
Republican Party of Virginia. ``They ran a full-fledged campaign
here. The Bush people did too.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that the McCain operation said it was never particularly
serious about Virginia, Matricardi said, ``How can you advertise
heavily in the most expensive television market _ Northern Virginia
_ and say you didn't campaign here?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   While McCain dismissed Bush as simply winning another Southern
state, this state is more diverse than South Carolina, from the
tobacco country in the south to the coal country in the west to the
Washington suburbs in the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the western tip of Virginia is farther west
than Detroit?'' Matricardi said today as he pointed to a
brightly-colored map on the wall of his office.
</P>
<P>
   But although this state is more diverse than South Carolina, it
is significantly more conservative than Michigan, and that helps
explain why Bush won. The only place McCain swamped Bush was in the
affluent Northern Virginia suburbs, a stronghold of moderates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's continued difficulty in winning significant support
from loyal Republicans may be a promising sign for Bush as the
competition turns largely to states where only Republicans can vote
in the party's primaries. More than 6 in 10 of the Virginia voters
on Tuesday described themselves as Republicans, and they
overwhelmingly backed Bush, according to a survey of voters leaving
the polls. Nearly 3 in 10 said they considered themselves
independents, and they just as overwhelmingly backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 in 10 voters described themselves as Democrats, and
they overwhelmingly backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was far more successful here than in Michigan because
voters in Virginia are more conservative. Nearly 6 in 10 of voters
here described themselves as conservatives, compared with just over
4 in 10 in Michigan. The conservative voters in Virginia backed
Bush over McCain by a margin of more than 2 to 1. Moderates, who
accounted for about 3 in 10 of the voters on Tuesday, backed McCain
over Bush by nearly the same margin.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as religious conservatives were
less crucial to Bush's victory here than in South Carolina. Two in
10 Virginia voters said they were part of the religious right
movement, and nearly 8 in 10 of those voted for Bush. In South
Carolina, more than 3 in 10 voters said they were part of the
religious right, and nearly 7 in 10 of them supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the closing days of the campaign here were dominated by
bitter exchanges between the Bush and McCain camps over the
Christian right and over which candidate is the true conservative,
that may not have had much influence on the outcome because fewer
than 1 in 10 voters left their decision until Tuesday. Those who
did decide on Tuesday backed Bush overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved aggressively to tap into hostility from
tobacco farmers about McCain's support for higher cigarette taxes
and from voters in Northern Virginia who were distressed by his
advocacy for more flights _ and more noise _ at Reagan National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's organization delivered automated telephone calls to
10,000 residents of Northern Virginia, accusing McCain of pressing
for ``48 additional noisy flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, there had only been one presidential primary in
Virginia, and that was in 1988. Bush's father, George Bush,
defeated Bob Dole and Pat Robertson in that primary. Since then,
the state has picked its convention delegates through caucuses.

EDITORIAL: MR. BUSH'S COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 1:
</P>
<P>
   With his sweep in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington, Gov.
George W. Bush's troubled presidential campaign has wrung an
essential victory from three disparate states. But once again Sen.
John McCain pointed up the soft spot in Bush's candidacy by drawing
strong support in Virginia and possibly elsewhere among
independents, moderates and Democratic crossovers. Bush's partisans
argued on Tuesday night that McCain's challenge to religious
fundamentalists had backfired, rallying loyal Republicans to the
governor's side. All of the results set up a tremendously important
showdown in the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries. The
battleground states of California and Ohio, where Bush leads, and
in New York, which is a toss-up, may well determine whether McCain
will be remembered as a transforming or a transitory figure in the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore's victory in
Washington state threatens yet another blow to former Sen. Bill
Bradley's candidacy. Bradley needed at least a credible showing
against Gore in order to revive his chances in New York and
California, where he has been running behind. A bad defeat when all
the votes in Washington are counted could feed pressures on him to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, Tuesday's voting set the stage for a more
nationalized phase of the nominating process. Republicans
everywhere are wondering whether McCain's daring attempt to
redefine his party is an act of historic farsightedness or
self-destruction. The party's establishment is working hard to push
Bush to the nomination, and his triple win will restore their
wavering faith. But they are not yet sure whether to ignore
McCain's disturbing message that catering to religious
conservatives is becoming an outdated strategy, especially outside
the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success so far has arisen from his ability to set the
terms of the debate. To that end, it was smart of him to reverse
his decision to skip the final debate before the March 7 round of
primaries. By agreeing to participate from a live hookup in New
York, McCain shores up his support in New York and the New England
states that vote on Super Tuesday. McCain's future may depend on
how much strength he shows in those states, given Bush's expected
appeal in the Southern states voting that day.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, a keystone state of the GOP's Sun Belt base, took
regional revenge on McCain for his attacks on Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell, Bob Jones University and other icons of the religious
right. McCain wants his party to hold the votes of Bible Belt
Republicans without following their every dictate on policy. In
that sense, he was betting that sacrificing Virginia to Bush would
strengthen him among moderates next week. The loss of Washington,
where moderates are dominant, casts a shadow over that goal.
Tuesday, indeed, belonged to Bush as the undisputed champion of the
voter blocs that have dominated the GOP for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   With the lines so clearly drawn, no one will have trouble
reading the results over the next two weeks. McCain must hope his
party is ready for a more moderate and inclusive kind of
conservatism than the one that gave Bush his victories on Tuesday.

LAKERS WIN BIG REGULAR-SEASON SHOWDOWN

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Somewhere, it seemed, the James Naismith trophy
must have been jiggling in its case.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime, down the road a bit, there will be playoff games with
less electricity than the one played here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a game with no long-lasting stakes to speak of took on
the dramatic proportions of an NBA championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it was appropriate, considering the league's two best
teams were going head to head for the final time this season,
battling for control of their division, their conference and the
rights to the NBA's best record as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate, too, that the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail
Blazers played this ultrahyped event right down to the wire, where
the Lakers pulled out a 90-87 victory before a sold-out sea of red
shirts and red faces at the Rose Garden.

   Shaquille O'Neal scored a game-high 23 points and hit 9 of 13
free throws as the Lakers extended their winning streak to 12,
grabbed the NBA's best record at 46-11 and pulled a game ahead of
the Blazers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   They also evened the regular-season series at 2-2, snapped a
losing streak at the Rose Garden at seven games and ended the
Blazers' home winning streak at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for one night's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big win for us,'' said Glen Rice, who chose the upbeat
occasion to break his two-week silence with the media. ``I think
all the games are very important for us. We just try to go out
there and treat them all the same. I'm sure down the road this
game's going to come back and have a lot more meaning, but right
now it's just another game that we've won. I think it's definitely
going to help us mentally, knowing that we can come here and beat
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   That they did was a testament to defense and unheralded bench
play.
</P>
<P>
   The deep Blazers had four players score in double figures, but
their vaunted reserves were outscored by the Lakers' reserves
25-18. And Portland, the league's best-shooting team, struggled to
hit 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen had 19 points but was 7 for 18 from the field.
Arvydas Sabonis went 6 for 15. Steve Smith, 5 for 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the game was played rather high intensity,
energy-wise,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``They got off to a
good start, they had a fourth-quarter run that I thought was pushed
a lot by the energy in the building. We had an 11-point lead, that
kind of carried us through the fourth quarter. . . . It wasn't an
`A' game by the team, but we did a good defensive job.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant shook off early foul trouble to finish with 22
points and seven rebounds and was the only other Laker to score in
double figures. Rice and Brian Shaw chipped in nine points each,
and the Lakers shot 44.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It all came down to a frantic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   After losing leads of 10 and 11 points, the Lakers clung to a
one- point advantage after Bryant's go-ahead free throws with two
minutes to go. Ron Harper and O'Neal each hit 1 of 2 from the line
to make it 88-85 with 24.3 seconds left. The Blazers' last gasp
ended when Pippen missed a 26-footer. Smith grabbed the rebound and
tossed up a wild desperation shot from the corner that came nowhere
close.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when O'Neal was just 7 for 17 from the field, Jackson
said his free-throw shooting was the key to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I concentrate, I shoot 'em like Jerry West,'' O'Neal
said. ``Whenever I don't concentrate, I shoot them like Wilt
(Chamberlain).''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's usual array of big bodies (minus Brian Grant, out
with a foot injury) kept O'Neal from dominating. But the Lakers did
an equally good job of holding Rasheed Wallace (15 points, 7 for
16) in check.
</P>
<P>
   As if the game needed extra hype, the NBA put a historical
footnote on it: Never before had two teams faced each other with
matching 11-game winning streaks on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a bigger game in the NBA, in my history of the
game, in 33 years,'' said Jackson, ``where two teams, almost 60
games into the season, are tied and they have the best record in
the league, and they're still thumping it out in a divisional race.
I just haven't seen anything quite this dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   And does Jackson still think, as he predicted, the winner of
this game will win the division? ``Yeah,'' he said, ``I do.''

RIDE S.F.'S TROLLEY INTO L.A.'S PAST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The new palm trees along the Embarcadero, tied
up for months, have let down their fronds, and the old waterfront
is starting to settle into its new look, just in time for a big
weekend.
<P>
   Saturday and Sunday, the vintage F Line trolleys will finally
begin to rumble along the Embarcadero from Market Street to
Fisherman's Wharf, and we'll be going back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the F Line will finally be rolling bayside, and the cars
will be staffed with volunteer docents from the Market Street RR
and S.F. Tour Guide Guild, Jean Feilmoser of the Guild tells me.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the ``Tour'' part scare you away, Mr. and Ms. San
Francisco. You don't have to be a tourist to enjoy a pleasant ride
along a section of the waterfront that is starting to look like a
living postcard _ fronds down, trolleys up, cobblestones gleaming.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood is searching for a location for period movies set
in Los Angeles in the '30s and '40s, it knows where to come. We
could paint a few more of the F Line trolleys red, to simulate the
old L.A. Red Car, the Pacific Electric streetcar line that once
snaked 1,150 miles through the City of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I saw a Red Car,'' says my travel guru, Seymour
Seitz, ``was in `Who Framed Roger Rabbit' _ which should have been
called `Who Killed Wapid Twansit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., the streetcar killer was the Big Oil/Tire/Auto axis
that bought out the streetcar lines and ripped up the tracks, which
made it hard for the trolleys to steer. Thus was ushered in the
golden era of road rage, drive-by shootings and drive-thru fine
dining.
</P>
<P>
   Following in L.A.'s tire tracks, San Francisco sold out, too. In
'57, Big Oil/Tire/Auto bought out the Bay Bridge Key System
Electrical RR and shut it down, which was in sync with the city's
own systematic elimination of cable cars and streetcars. Rail
travel became tres uncool.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're reversing the trend. Let's get ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   POOR DARRYL STRAWBERRY of the Yankees, flunked another cocaine
test, despite all the time he'd spent studying.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl had been scheduled to host a fund-raising event for a
Florida boys and girls' club, and the club is trying to decide,
should they have him host the event anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Straw is no role model, but say this about him: Over the
years, he has kept a lot of street drugs from falling into the
hands of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER SPORTS NEWS: I'm still not able to confirm the rumor
that figure skater Tonya Harding tossed that hubcap at her
boyfriend because he told her, ``You skate like Marty McSorley.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE RAIN COMING, and Cuffs Corbett says, ``Hell with it, I'm
taking the brick out of my toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I'm too young to know what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   DIGNIFIED DINGBAT: Jean (Edith Bunker) Stapleton is starring as
Mrs. Roosevelt in her one-woman ``Eleanor: Her Secret Journey''
(Marines Memorial).
</P>
<P>
   Dining at John's Grill, Stapleton was heard loudly proclaiming
that San Francisco is the best theater town in America.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it: We're No. 1! Woohoo!
</P>
<P>
   EWWWW. Cary Sekoff says he was watching the Channel 5 news
Tuesday morning, and leading into a commercial break was a teaser
for ``Bad Stuff,'' a news expose on restaurant meat contaminated
with E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Then, boom, into a commercial for Carrows restaurants and their
big $8.99 sirloin special.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS ILLUSTRATED's swimsuit issue is out, and this year's big
tech breakthrough is a pair of 3-D glasses inside each magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Which removes much of the dignity and subtlety that men strive
for in perusing the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But at least SI is coming to terms with a widespread problem _
that a lot of their readers are leersighted.
</P>
<P>
   MORNING CALM, the in-flight magazine of Korean Air, informs its
readers that there is a train from SFO to downtown S.F., the fare
is $1.75 and the trip takes 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   How come nobody told us about this mystery train? What's it
called, the Disorient Express?
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC T-SHIRT: When Mark McGwire was on his record home-run
binge in '98, he reportedly hit homers No. 48 through 70 while
wearing a Bechelli's Restaurant T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Bechelli's is McGwire's favorite a.m. protein-loading zone when
he's playing in the Bay Area (he starts with a 10-egg-white
omelet), and owner Pat Bechelli gave Mac some T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   So McGwire autographed the lucky shirt and sent it back to
Bechelli, who is auctioning it online via Sothebys.Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated to fetch ... $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is scary that someone will pay a quarter-mil for a used
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Comforting, though. I've shaken hands with McGwire many times,
so I figure if I ever get in a financial bind, I can sell my right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   MANY STATES support capital punishment, but there are varying
degrees of gung-ho-ness, and George W. Bush's Texas seems to rank
fairly high on that scale.
</P>
<P>
   So if W is elected president, the suggestion here is for at
least a change in terminology. Convicted criminals won't be
executed, they'll be bushwhacked.

BUSH BEATS MCCAIN IN THREE STATES; GORE TROUNCES BRADLEY IN 
 WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush picked up decisive
victories in three states Tuesday with rock-solid support from
Republican voters, dealing a harsh blow to Arizona Sen. John
McCain's insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore easily beat Bill Bradley in
Washington Tuesday, an ominous development for the struggling
campaign of the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   With 56 delegates at stake, Virginia's Republican primary was
the prize in Tuesday's contests. Bush took 53 percent of the vote
to McCain's 44 percent, while Alan Keyes got the remaining 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also trounced McCain _ 76 percent to 19 percent _ in North
Dakota's caucuses, and he scored a win in the first round of
Washington's GOP primary, where he captured the support of nearly
60 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the Washington state vote was a symbolic one, as
delegates will not be chosen until party caucuses next week. But
Bradley, who has not won a primary, had hoped to score a symbolic
victory a week before Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   With 81 percent of Washington precincts reporting, Gore was
beating Bradley by a wide margin, garnering 68 percent of the vote
and leaving Bradley with just 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent five days campaigning in Washington, but recently
his campaign had shifted from saying a victory was needed to saying
that a strong performance would do.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bradley's campaign tried to put the best light
they could on the numbers. ``We lost,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric
Hauser. ``We're a little disappointed. But there are some things
that went quite well ... the energy that we generated in Washington
in five days will carry us forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said Bradley is looking ahead to March 7 and beyond and
there are no plans to drop out. He also denied that some advisors
are urging Bradley to give up the race. ``There is a unanimous
desire within the campaign to move agressively forward to March
7,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will work almost non-stop over the next week, with
the debate in Los Angeles tonight, a five-minute national
advertisement tomorrow night and campaigning back on the East coast
this weekend, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uphill fight _ but it's been an uphill fight for 15
months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, exit polls showed that Bush won resoundingly among
GOP voters, with McCain pulling in just 1 in 4 Republicans. But
McCain pummeled Bush among independents, 63 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's Christian conservatives voted 8 to 1 for Bush; Bush
also won 2 to 1 among moderately &LR;  conservatives. Women favored Bush
60 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day ago, McCain had chosen southern Virginia _ the home
of the Christian Coalition _ to lash out at televangelists Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``agents of intolerance'' in a
daring attempt to broaden his appeal to swing voters in this
Republican bastion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had hoped for an upset in Virginia, which would send Bush
into a tailspin going into Super Tuesday when 16 states, including
California, New York and Ohio choose delegates, with Republicans
selecting more than half the 1,034 needed to win their nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Bush who hauled in all of Virginia's 56
delegates and much-needed momentum after last week's defeat in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vaulted ahead of McCain in the delegate count, with the
Texas governor winning 77 delegates to McCain's nine Tuesday to
lead 170 to 105.
</P>
<P>
   In the North Dakota caucuses, where 19 delegates were at stake,
Bush picked up 14 delegates, McCain four and Keyes one.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, Bush picked up seven delegates to McCain's
five in the first round of that state's GOP primary. The remaining
25 delegates will be chosen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With 65 percent of precincts reporting, Bush had 156,840 of the
GOP vote, or 59 percent, McCain had 100,982 votes, or 38 percent,
and Keyes had 2 percent. ``Tonight, we are one step closer to
victory,'' Bush said. ``One step closer to a united party, and the
Clinton-Gore administration is one step closer to the exit door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared that his campaign is ``winning the debate of
substance _ the contest of ideas. Republicans and independents are
rallying to our cause because we are speaking to their hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Stockton, McCain retorted,``I congratulate
him on his victory. ``It seems as if he has a Southern strategy
here,'' a veiled reference to Bush's strength among Christian
conservatives. ``We'll look forward to Super Tuesday when we'll
have a broad section of Americans voting ... all on that same
day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted he is the GOP's best hope in the fall to take on
Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, and rescue the GOP from its
electoral defeats in 1996 and 1998. ``I am the one who can beat Al
Gore,'' McCain told a rally. ``I am the one who can bring in
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some polls show McCain surging ahead of Gore in a general
election, while a Bush-Gore contest is close.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's challenge has forced Bush to the right and made
religion a focal point of the GOP race so far, even  &LR; though Bush
had intended at the outset of his campaign intended  &LR; to court
moderates as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   But after McCain's independent-fueled win in New Hampshire, Bush
courted the Christian right in South Carolina. After Bush won in
South Carolina, McCain attacked Bush in Michigan for speaking at
Bob Jones University, which espouses anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called McCain's attack on Robertson divisive and accused
his rival of injecting religion into the campaign. Bush also
claimed to be the rightful heir to Ronald Reagan _ a claim McCain
has been making at every stop _ saying Reagan ``had an optimistic
agenda, as I do,'' rather than a ``spiteful agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the McCain campaign scrutinized Tuesday's results,
campaign manager Rick Davis told reporters that the senator's
economic message had not gotten through, even though McCain had
chosen to make Pat  &LR; Robertson the issue in Virginia. ``We haven't
been saying enough about Social Security,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the candidates took wildly different paths courting
the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did McCain choose Virginia to attack Robertson, but he
also went out of his way to taunt Virginia's top Republican
officials, Gov. James Gilmore and Sen. John Warner, telling a crowd
in Alexandria on Sunday, ``I say to the Gilmore-Warner machine,
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had campaigned in Virginia with Gilmore, Warner and popular
former Gov. George Allen at his side, courting votes in Virginia's
high-tech corridor at America Online headquarters in Vienna, and
then attending a GOP party banquet in at the capitol in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   McCain targeted the moderate suburban voters of northern
Virginia, hoping to draw independents, Democrats and former
supporters of Ross Perot, while trying At the same time, he tried
to appeal to conservatives by declaring himself a ``Reagan
Republican'' and a true conservative battling special interests in
nearby Washington. McCain also drew a heavy following among
veterans who are heavily concentrated near Washington and the big
naval base at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said that even though Bush lost
among independents by 30 percentage points, the result was better
than in New Hampshire, where Bush picked up just 19 percent of
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as we continue to beat Sen.ator McCain by such an
overwhelming margin among Republicans, and continue to make inroads
among independents, it's going to be impossible for John McCain to
defeat us,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign started, the Virginia and Washington primaries
were considered little more than blips between the opening curtain
in New Hampshire and the big primaries next Tuesday. Instead, they
became critical and hard fought battles in a major war for the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Virginia and Washington primaries were open to voters
in both parties, giving extraordinary weight to independents and
party crossovers. The effect was magnified by the excitement
generated by the tight Republican contest that drew in voters who
might otherwise have ignored the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia ballot had only Republicans, and Virginians who
voted were required to ``pledge'' not to vote in the later
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won among voters without a college education 2-to-1, while
the two candidates were close among those with a college degree.

MCCAIN INTENSIFIES HIS ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT; REVERSES 
 HIMSELF ON CALIFORNIA DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI, LYNDA GLEDHILL and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO _ Courting California's victory-starved Republicans, Sen.
John McCain ramped up his talk against leaders of the religious
right Tuesday and, in an abrupt turnabout, announced that he has
agreed to a satellite TV debate with Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, riding his ``Straight Talk Express'' through
California's GOP- rich Central Valley on a three-day state swing,
attacked evangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``the
forces of evil'' dividing the GOP. The Arizona senator continued to
pound his message of being a ``Reagan Republican,'' telling
enthusiastic crowds, ``I'm willing to take on the forces of evil
... (who) have driven us to the extreme right.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision to participate in the satellite television
debate with Bush tomorrow night was a sharp about-face. As late as
Tuesday morning, he insisted to reporters aboard his bus that he
would not take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
   But during a later a press conference, McCain changed direction
and said he would change his schedule to accommodate the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp, too, agreed to the face-off. ``We will debate in
Thursday's debate, but the debate planners are still working out
the details,'' said Margita Thompson, a Bush campaign spokeswoman.
She said it was still unclear whether Bush would be in California
for the event, or if he, too, would make the debate via remote.
</P>
<P>
   As he rode through the Central Valley last night, McCain called
Bush to congratulate him on the Virginia victory, but he said he
did not believe the losses would affect his success in the March 7
``Super Tuesday'' primaries, which include California's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's three-day California trip came only a week before the
primary here, as polls show that the senator has a formidable sales
job ahead with state Republicans _ and that he is trailing by a
double-digit margin.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain farmed the state's Central Valley for votes, Vice
President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley were also
in California, preparing for their debate tonight and trying to
pick up momentum for next week's all-important election.
</P>
<P>
   A confident-sounding Gore spent the morning in Cudahy, a heavily
Latino community a few miles from downtown Los Angeles, where he
worked on themes he plans to use against the Republicans in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, lagging far behind in the polls, hopes the debate,
along with a late rush of advertising and campaigning, can boost
his chances of victory in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's toughest talk came from McCain, who made his
appeal directly to California Republicans, arguing that only he can
give them what they want most: the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to put California back in the winning column,''
McCain said in Stockton. ``I now firmly believe that I, only, can
make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that ``the voters fully believe I am prepared for
combat with the vice president, and George Bush is not.''
</P>
<P>
   While registered voters can cast ballots for any candidate,
regardless of party affiliation, in California's open primary, only
GOP votes will count in the winner-take-all Republican primary. The
highest GOP vote-getter will be awarded the 162 GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Field Poll released this week shows McCain trailing
Bush by 20 points among party faithful, even as they show that
McCain is viewed more positively by all voters and _ unlike Bush _
leads both Gore and Bradley in head-to-head matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, I'm enthusiastic, I'm hopeful,'' McCain said.
``Yes, I need to win California. Yes, it's a critical state.
California has enormous impact on the nomination, and I need to win
_ I think we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   In his harsh talk against the two pre-eminent Christian
conservative leaders, McCain was reprising a speech he made this
weekend in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject individuals such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell,
who take our party in the wrong direction. We're the party of
Abraham Lincoln, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain told a town hall
meeting in Stockton. ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan and not
Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   California also is a do-or-die state for Bradley. The former
senator hopes to cut into Gore's margin with a prime-time,
five-minute-long television ad that will be broadcast on CBS at
10:54 p.m. tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ad, still under production, will include Bradley
talking directly to the camera, telling people why he would be a
good president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt the best way to communicate with voters is
simply and directly and without adornment,'' said Eric Hauser, a
Bradley spokesman. ``This is a good way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign said it didn't have any choice but to go up against
a brand-new episode of ``ER,'' one of the country's most popular
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sweeps month,'' said Hauser, adding that it was hard to
find network time for the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's message in California is that there is still plenty of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians don't make up their mind until the last week,''
Bradley said in San Francisco Tuesday. ``I think it is possible to
move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's plodding campaign style does not seem to be
energizing many voters. At San Francisco General Hospital Tuesday
morning, he spoke on gun control, one of his main campaign themes.
He repeated his call for registration of all handguns and mandatory
trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 hospital employees gathered around as Bradley spoke,
but the event in the hospital's cafeteria competed with the sounds
of employee pagers and workers eating breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance in Cudahy drew more than 600 people to a local
gymnasium to hear the vice president talk about the need for
improvements in education, health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's tragic shooting in Michigan, in which a 6-year-old
girl was killed at school by a classmate, turned Gore to the
subject of guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   When first-graders can get a gun and shoot their playmates at
school, it's past time for something to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it take before we say to opponents ... of
commonsense (gun control) measures `Enough is enough. We're going
to protect our communities and our children?' '' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   He scorched the National Rifle Association for its opposition to
mandatory trigger locks and told the cheering crowd that it is up
to them to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't
have them: criminals, children, students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included dozens of military veterans and young
children from a nearby school. Around the students were
Spanish-language signs saying ``The children of Cudahy (love) Al
Gore,'' and ``With Al Gore, the children will have a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president pointed to those children as he wound up his
20-minute-long speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children deserve to grow up in communities with clean
air, clean water and a bright future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stop in the 1.2-square-mile community underscored the
importance Gore puts on California's growing Latino vote. With him
at the speech were Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic
Party, local Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, whose father represented
East Los Angeles in Congress for decades, and Los Angeles County
Supervisor Gloria Molina, one of the state's most powerful Latina
politicians.
</P>

Gledhill from San Francisco and John Wildermuth from Cudahy.)

 BRADLEY AND GORE STRUGGLE TO STAND OUT  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the past is any guide, Wednesday night's
Democratic debate will feature indignant exchanges and fierce
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone but an avid loyalist, the hostile jargon may seem like
a fight over milk chocolate vs. dark chocolate. Each has a distinct
flavor and a stable core of devotees, but for most connoisseurs,
the similarities far outweigh the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are pro-choice, pro-trade, pro-gun
control centrist Democrats, with long records of public service and
strong ties to the party's liberal base. Both have strong support
from environmentalists and labor unions, and they are regarded more
highly for their intellect than their charisma.
</P>
<P>
   To choose between the two requires either a deep understanding
of narrow policy nuances or a decision based on something that goes
beyond issues.
</P>
<P>
   Did Vice President Gore vote for the 1984 Siljander Amendment
which defined ``unborn children'' as people? Did Bill Bradley vote
for experimental school vouchers? Is Gore a ``fighter'' or a
vestige of ``entrenched power?'' Is Bradley a ``quitter'' or a
practitioner of a ``new kind of politics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy differences between these two candidates are
minimal,'' said California Gov. Gray Davis, who, like most elected
officials, has staked his claim on the vice president. ``I think Al
Gore has earned the nomination of his party based on his exemplary
performance in the (Clinton) administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's forum in Los Angeles is the final face-to-face
confrontation for the two men before Tuesday, when California and
more than a dozen other states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has revealed how different they are,'' said
Thomas Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said that Bradley's notion of governing is reminiscent of
Franklin Roosevelt, addressing problems with ``bold steps and
transforming ideas.'' Gore more closely resembles President
Clinton's style of moving to the center and proposing ``modest,
bite-sized solutions,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Gore has been consistently more aggressive,
raising his voice to underscore his passion and winning the
endorsement of political allies and organizations that have long
courted his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between Sen. Bradley and Vice President Gore
are very minimal in relation to the issues,'' said David Smith of
the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay lobbying group,
which endorsed Gore two weeks ago. ``But with Gore we have
longevity and commitment. He's been fighting since the beginning of
the (Clinton) administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is a more deliberate and cautious speaker who has
promoted what he calls ``deeply held beliefs'' over flashy sound
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen him confront money, power and special interests
when few were prepared to make the fight,'' said Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., who endorsed Bradley in December. ``I have seen
him stick with his principles against tremendous odds and
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither seems to be comfortable with politicking. Gore's ability
to connect with voters is more evident in person than on
television, though it pales in comparison to President Clinton.
Bradley often seems downright uncomfortable with small talk and
glad-handing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore and Bradley had remarkably similar voting records
during the eight years they served together in the Senate _
Congressional Quarterly found they voted together about
three-quarters of the time _ Bradley has staked out more
comprehensive and liberal positions on several social issues over
the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bradley favors replacing Medicaid with a more
sweeping plan of subsidized insurance that would cost about $65
billion a year and provide insurance to 95 percent of all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has advocated a more incremental approach costing about $25
billion a year to expand Medicaid and Medicare and guarantee
coverage for children.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their few major areas of disagreement, Bradley, who
voted against the U.S. intervention in Iraq in 1991, does not favor
any increase in the military budget. Gore, who voted in favor of
Iraq involvement, favors an increase by as much as $20 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue of disagreement is on campaign finance reform, a
central part of the platform of Bradley, who maintains that
big-money interests have caused gridlock on Capitol Hill. He
supports a ban on soft-money donations and has criticized Gore for
advocating restrictions on soft money while directing fund-raisers
to solicit such cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of recent Democratic fund-raising scandals, Gore has
not highlighted the issue but has said he would make campaign
finance reform a priority as president. Both candidates offered to
pass up soft money in the general election if the Republican
nominee did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Democratic debate in New Hampshire last fall,
each meeting between the two has grown more barbed and
confrontational. If the words get harsh, it is useful to remember
that the two centrists &LR;  Democrats are elbowing for space from
within a very small ideological band.

 By CHON A. NORIEGA  
 &HT;    Despite the well-documented growth of the Hispanic community as
a political and market force, Hispanics enter the 21st century with
a lower level of media access and representation than when protests
first raised the issue in the 1960s.
 &HT;    As The Hollywood Reporter recently noted, ``Hispanics have
historically been the most underrepresented of all the minority
groups in film and TV, and there is no sign that their numbers are
increasing.''
 &HT;    In fact, guild figures released in late 1999 show significant
declines from the previous year: from 4 percent to 3.5 percent for
actors, and from 3.1 percent to 2.3 percent for directors.
Hispanics make up just 1.3 percent of the writers for prime-time
television.
 &HT;    But that's not the really bad news. While these numbers have
remained almost constant for the last three decades, the Hispanic
community itself has grown from 4.5 percent of the national
population in 1970 to 11.5 percent in 2000. In other words, there
are roughly two-and-a-half times more Hispanics getting the same
small percentage of jobs.
 &HT;    And in Los Angeles, where the film and television industry is
located, Hispanics make up around 45 percent of the population.
 &HT;    The industry has achieved consensus about the cause of the
problem: a lack of Hispanics in decision-making positions.
 &HT;    In a survey conducted for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, I
found that Spanish-surnamed employees accounted for 1.9 percent of
the executive positions at major studios and networks. In no
instance did a Hispanic executive occupy a creative decision-making
position.
 &HT;    Roughly 60 percent of networks and studios do not employ any
Hispanic executives.
 &HT;    Why? According to the industry itself, the reason is simply
economic. Hispanics may be a disproportionately large market, but
they are not ``distinct enough'' as consumers to be able to demand
inclusion on the production side.
 &HT;    That's right, we're too mainstream to gain admittance to the
executive suite.
 &HT;    What the industry is really trying to argue is that it operates
by economic rationale alone. In fact, the industry is relatively
small and its key players all tend to know each other. Hispanics
have not been part of that crowd.
 &HT;    The entertainment industry already has an extraordinarily high
failure rate (around 75 percent for new television series and not
much better for movies), and one look at Kevin Costner's
mega-budget box-office duds throws any sense of logic out the
window.
 &HT;    But in the absence of a formula for success, the industry has
invented one around itself, going with the actors, producers and
formats it already knows. These do not provide a higher success
rate, but they give executives a greater comfort factor than
gambling on the unknown.
 &HT;    If 1999 signaled an all-time low for minority representation _
best exemplified by the all-white casts for the 26 new prime-time
series in the fall _ it also witnessed the first national Hispanic
advocacy efforts since the early 1970s.
 &HT;    The most notable movement involved the creation of the National
Association of Latino Independent Producers. Ironically, these 250
Hispanic producers _ as a professional group with defining
characteristics and accomplishments _ have almost no visibility in
the press, the industry and even the media advocacy groups fighting
on their behalf. They are simply not part of the debate, and hence
they are never identified as part of the solution.
 &HT;    But these are precisely the people who will make the Hispanic
images that are currently missing from mainstream film and
television.
 &HT;    Now that they have organized, where are the Hispanic executives?

 By AMY WU  
 &HT;    The Fox Network's controversial game show ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' proved that, in America, love has lost any shred
of innocence it once had. It has become something to be selected
and chosen like a commodity.
 &HT;    As an Asian-American female, I have noticed how this dynamic _
women ``falling in love'' with men who have large wallets _ has
infiltrated the Asian community. Wealthy Asian males now have their
choice of mate across racial boundaries.
 &HT;    In a new book titled ``Asian-Americans: Intermarriage and the
Social Construction of Love'' (Beacon Press), demographer Larry
Hajime Shinagawa writes that more and more Asian-American men are
marrying outside their ethnic group _ something that was once very
rare. Part of the reason comes down to dollars and cents.
 &HT;    How so? Because Asian males have a reputation for being
wealthier than other ethnic groups, and those dollar signs are
attracting women of all colors.
 &HT;    Don't get me wrong _ many men find Asian women alluring, but for
very different reasons.
 &HT;    As a young, Chinese-American woman, race has played a major part
in all my relationships. At 15, I swore I would marry for love. At
17, when being Asian was no longer so fashionable, I swore I would
only marry a white man. My goal was to become as ``American'' as
possible.
 &HT;    At 21, I traveled to Hong Kong to work as a journalist, and
while I was there I witnessed firsthand how fashionable it was for
white men to date and marry Asian girls.
 &HT;    One of my white male colleagues, who had been dating an Asian
airline stewardess for three months, offered an explanation: ``I
like the way Asian women look, how polite they are and how they
seem so demure and innocent.''
 &HT;    The Asian women who I encountered in Hong Kong restaurants and
public places dutifully leaned against their lovers for support and
giggled with their hands over their mouths. They were thin-boned,
longhaired and looked like high school girls. And on the flip side,
these Asian women viewed white men as coveted prizes.
 &HT;    I also befriended an American music executive whose girlfriend
was 20 years his junior _ a local girl who looked every inch the
Asian princess. He lived in an impressive penthouse overlooking the
city and took her out to dinner every night.
 &HT;    She giggled and charmed him, and he was delighted. In return,
she got to live in a penthouse and had a closet filled with Gucci.
I only hope it was true love, but I have my doubts.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, my adolescent dream of being considered completely
American became a reality. In fact, I met many men _ both Asian and
Caucasian _ who thought I was too American. I am not a Suzy Wong
look-alike. I laugh freely. I ask many questions. I am opinionated.
Most of all, I like talking about current events.
 &HT;    I once went on a date with a local guy, an accountant who drove
a Mercedes-Benz. His interest in me soared after he discovered I
was a transplanted New Yorker. My colleagues who were local women
coaxed me into going out with him even though I thought he was
about as exciting as a brick.
 &HT;    ``He has a Benz, a big bank account. He'll take care of you for
the rest of your life,'' they said, perhaps secretly hoping I would
drop him like a hot potato so that one of them could scoop him up.
 &HT;    After two dates he tired of me. I knew too much about the stock
market and current events. I explained I loved to travel to exotic
places. I didn't lean against his arm, fetch his slippers and wash
his laundry. It was at that point I had decided that I would rather
spend my time with a starving poet than a wealthy numbers-cruncher.
 &HT;    Call me a traditionalist, but I think the new love landscape is
shameful and bizarre _ and Fox's alarmingly popular TV debacle is a
perfect example. True Love only lasts when fate is allowed to do
its work, and when the feelings aren't tainted by other motives.
 &HT;    For now, I think I'll stick with feng shui and fortunetellers.

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE PROPOSED IN VERMONT

 &HT;    
 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Lawmakers in Vermont stand tiptoe at the threshold of tolerance.
Will they make same-sex marriage legal for the first time in the
United States? Although Hawaii and California have already passed
domestic partnership laws, Vermont proposes enacting a far more
extensive same-sex marriage law.
 &HT;    So far the country road to same-sex unions in Vermont has been
paved with legislative responsibility, public hearings and positive
results. Recently the Judiciary Committee of the state's House of
Representatives indicated, in an informal 8-3 vote, that it would
draft ``a broad civil rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage.''
 &HT;    To their credit Vermont lawmakers have been dealing directly
with the task at hand _ providing gay and lesbian couples the same
``common benefit, protection and security of the law'' guaranteed
to opposite-sex couples. Lawmakers have no choice: They must comply
with the state Supreme Court's legislative order to grant legal
benefits and protections to same-sex couples. This can be achieved
by including gays in existing civil marriage laws or by creating a
parallel domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    Despite the ruling's clear intent, legislators face a daunting
task. Many residents of the state, including Democratic Gov. Howard
Dean, are ``uncomfortable'' with the idea of same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    Dean recently clarified his position. ``I'm against gay
marriage,'' he said in a recent radio interview.
 &HT;    His view is reflected in a recent poll of 623 registered Vermont
voters in which 52 percent oppose the Supreme Court ruling, 38
percent agree and 10 percent remain undecided.
 &HT;    Yet the voices of tolerance reverberate loud and clear in the
chambers of the state capital. Consider Rep. Steve R. Hingtgen, who
has offered a compelling rationale for legal same-sex marriage
instead of a domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    ``For all those who have come before this committee preaching
hate in all its poor disguises, whether with Bible, a law degree or
Ph.D. in hand,'' he said, ``those who have filled our ears with
hate, they will not be sent a message of rebuke by this committee
by our choosing domestic partnership. The hateful will have been
strengthened by our decision.
 &HT;    ``Pursuing the domestic partnership path validates the hate.
Going with domestic partnership validates the bigotry. It does more
than validate it. It institutionalizes the bigotry and
affirmatively creates an apartheid system of family recognition in
Vermont,'' Hingtgen said.
 &HT;    Rep. William Suchmann suggested that honesty and fairness should
be the compass by which to guide the journey of citizens, who like
himself, are uneasy with same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I am uncomfortable seeing two adults of the same gender
openly displaying affection. But that is my problem. I have a much
bigger problem with a community that passes judgment on a specific
group of God's children and deems them unfit to share in an
institution that draws its strength from compromise and unselfish
love,'' Suchmann wrote in a letter printed on the editorial page of
one Vermont newspaper.
 &HT;    A minority of the House expressed dissatisfaction after the
committee voted to go the domestic partnership route.
 &HT;    ``I'm disappointed we're not doing marriage. But I also want to
emphasize that if our committee and Legislature adopt a
comprehensive domestic partnership bill, it will be the single most
forward-looking piece of legislation for gay and lesbian people in
the entire United States, and this is still very big news,'' said
Rep. William J. Lippert Jr., vice chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who is gay.
 &HT;    A broad civil-rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage will never fully guarantee equal rights for
gays.
 &HT;    Perhaps 10-year-old Courtney Dozetos, who testified at committee
hearings, said it best: ``It would make me feel special and good if
my moms could get married. I don't and probably never will
understand why that can't happen.''
 &HT;    Rep. Dean Corren puts the issue in it's proper historical
perspective. He understands that extending civil marriage to
same-sex couples is the only true ``remedy for what may be the last
great instance of legal discrimination based solely on bigotry.''
 &HT;    American history is rife with lessons on bigotry. Separate but
equal did not work in the South. It took bold action _ integration
_ to foster true equality.
 &HT;    Vermont legislators need to be bold. Legalize same-sex marriage.

 By CHON A. NORIEGA  
 &HT;    Despite the well-documented growth of the Hispanic community as
a political and market force, Hispanics enter the 21st century with
a lower level of media access and representation than when protests
first raised the issue in the 1960s.
 &HT;    As The Hollywood Reporter recently noted, ``Hispanics have
historically been the most underrepresented of all the minority
groups in film and TV, and there is no sign that their numbers are
increasing.''
 &HT;    In fact, guild figures released in late 1999 show significant
declines from the previous year: from 4 percent to 3.5 percent for
actors, and from 3.1 percent to 2.3 percent for directors.
Hispanics make up just 1.3 percent of the writers for prime-time
television.
 &HT;    But that's not the really bad news. While these numbers have
remained almost constant for the last three decades, the Hispanic
community itself has grown from 4.5 percent of the national
population in 1970 to 11.5 percent in 2000. In other words, there
are roughly two-and-a-half times more Hispanics getting the same
small percentage of jobs.
 &HT;    And in Los Angeles, where the film and television industry is
located, Hispanics make up around 45 percent of the population.
 &HT;    The industry has achieved consensus about the cause of the
problem: a lack of Hispanics in decision-making positions.
 &HT;    In a survey conducted for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, I
found that Spanish-surnamed employees accounted for 1.9 percent of
the executive positions at major studios and networks. In no
instance did a Hispanic executive occupy a creative decision-making
position.
 &HT;    Roughly 60 percent of networks and studios do not employ any
Hispanic executives.
 &HT;    Why? According to the industry itself, the reason is simply
economic. Hispanics may be a disproportionately large market, but
they are not ``distinct enough'' as consumers to be able to demand
inclusion on the production side.
 &HT;    That's right, we're too mainstream to gain admittance to the
executive suite.
 &HT;    What the industry is really trying to argue is that it operates
by economic rationale alone. In fact, the industry is relatively
small and its key players all tend to know each other. Hispanics
have not been part of that crowd.
 &HT;    The entertainment industry already has an extraordinarily high
failure rate (around 75 percent for new television series and not
much better for movies), and one look at Kevin Costner's
mega-budget box-office duds throws any sense of logic out the
window.
 &HT;    But in the absence of a formula for success, the industry has
invented one around itself, going with the actors, producers and
formats it already knows. These do not provide a higher success
rate, but they give executives a greater comfort factor than
gambling on the unknown.
 &HT;    If 1999 signaled an all-time low for minority representation _
best exemplified by the all-white casts for the 26 new prime-time
series in the fall _ it also witnessed the first national Hispanic
advocacy efforts since the early 1970s.
 &HT;    The most notable movement involved the creation of the National
Association of Latino Independent Producers. Ironically, these 250
Hispanic producers _ as a professional group with defining
characteristics and accomplishments _ have almost no visibility in
the press, the industry and even the media advocacy groups fighting
on their behalf. They are simply not part of the debate, and hence
they are never identified as part of the solution.
 &HT;    But these are precisely the people who will make the Hispanic
images that are currently missing from mainstream film and
television.
 &HT;    Now that they have organized, where are the Hispanic executives?

 By AMY WU  
 &HT;    The Fox Network's controversial game show ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' proved that, in America, love has lost any shred
of innocence it once had. It has become something to be selected
and chosen like a commodity.
 &HT;    As an Asian-American female, I have noticed how this dynamic _
women ``falling in love'' with men who have large wallets _ has
infiltrated the Asian community. Wealthy Asian males now have their
choice of mate across racial boundaries.
 &HT;    In a new book titled ``Asian-Americans: Intermarriage and the
Social Construction of Love'' (Beacon Press), demographer Larry
Hajime Shinagawa writes that more and more Asian-American men are
marrying outside their ethnic group _ something that was once very
rare. Part of the reason comes down to dollars and cents.
 &HT;    How so? Because Asian males have a reputation for being
wealthier than other ethnic groups, and those dollar signs are
attracting women of all colors.
 &HT;    Don't get me wrong _ many men find Asian women alluring, but for
very different reasons.
 &HT;    As a young, Chinese-American woman, race has played a major part
in all my relationships. At 15, I swore I would marry for love. At
17, when being Asian was no longer so fashionable, I swore I would
only marry a white man. My goal was to become as ``American'' as
possible.
 &HT;    At 21, I traveled to Hong Kong to work as a journalist, and
while I was there I witnessed firsthand how fashionable it was for
white men to date and marry Asian girls.
 &HT;    One of my white male colleagues, who had been dating an Asian
airline stewardess for three months, offered an explanation: ``I
like the way Asian women look, how polite they are and how they
seem so demure and innocent.''
 &HT;    The Asian women who I encountered in Hong Kong restaurants and
public places dutifully leaned against their lovers for support and
giggled with their hands over their mouths. They were thin-boned,
longhaired and looked like high school girls. And on the flip side,
these Asian women viewed white men as coveted prizes.
 &HT;    I also befriended an American music executive whose girlfriend
was 20 years his junior _ a local girl who looked every inch the
Asian princess. He lived in an impressive penthouse overlooking the
city and took her out to dinner every night.
 &HT;    She giggled and charmed him, and he was delighted. In return,
she got to live in a penthouse and had a closet filled with Gucci.
I only hope it was true love, but I have my doubts.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, my adolescent dream of being considered completely
American became a reality. In fact, I met many men _ both Asian and
Caucasian _ who thought I was too American. I am not a Suzy Wong
look-alike. I laugh freely. I ask many questions. I am opinionated.
Most of all, I like talking about current events.
 &HT;    I once went on a date with a local guy, an accountant who drove
a Mercedes-Benz. His interest in me soared after he discovered I
was a transplanted New Yorker. My colleagues who were local women
coaxed me into going out with him even though I thought he was
about as exciting as a brick.
 &HT;    ``He has a Benz, a big bank account. He'll take care of you for
the rest of your life,'' they said, perhaps secretly hoping I would
drop him like a hot potato so that one of them could scoop him up.
 &HT;    After two dates he tired of me. I knew too much about the stock
market and current events. I explained I loved to travel to exotic
places. I didn't lean against his arm, fetch his slippers and wash
his laundry. It was at that point I had decided that I would rather
spend my time with a starving poet than a wealthy numbers-cruncher.
 &HT;    Call me a traditionalist, but I think the new love landscape is
shameful and bizarre _ and Fox's alarmingly popular TV debacle is a
perfect example. True Love only lasts when fate is allowed to do
its work, and when the feelings aren't tainted by other motives.
 &HT;    For now, I think I'll stick with feng shui and fortunetellers.

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE PROPOSED IN VERMONT

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Lawmakers in Vermont stand tiptoe at the threshold of tolerance.
Will they make same-sex marriage legal for the first time in the
United States? Although Hawaii and California have already passed
domestic partnership laws, Vermont proposes enacting a far more
extensive same-sex marriage law.
 &HT;    So far the country road to same-sex unions in Vermont has been
paved with legislative responsibility, public hearings and positive
results. Recently the Judiciary Committee of the state's House of
Representatives indicated, in an informal 8-3 vote, that it would
draft ``a broad civil rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage.''
 &HT;    To their credit Vermont lawmakers have been dealing directly
with the task at hand _ providing gay and lesbian couples the same
``common benefit, protection and security of the law'' guaranteed
to opposite-sex couples. Lawmakers have no choice: They must comply
with the state Supreme Court's legislative order to grant legal
benefits and protections to same-sex couples. This can be achieved
by including gays in existing civil marriage laws or by creating a
parallel domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    Despite the ruling's clear intent, legislators face a daunting
task. Many residents of the state, including Democratic Gov. Howard
Dean, are ``uncomfortable'' with the idea of same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    Dean recently clarified his position. ``I'm against gay
marriage,'' he said in a recent radio interview.
 &HT;    His view is reflected in a recent poll of 623 registered Vermont
voters in which 52 percent oppose the Supreme Court ruling, 38
percent agree and 10 percent remain undecided.
 &HT;    Yet the voices of tolerance reverberate loud and clear in the
chambers of the state capital. Consider Rep. Steve R. Hingtgen, who
has offered a compelling rationale for legal same-sex marriage
instead of a domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    ``For all those who have come before this committee preaching
hate in all its poor disguises, whether with Bible, a law degree or
Ph.D. in hand,'' he said, ``those who have filled our ears with
hate, they will not be sent a message of rebuke by this committee
by our choosing domestic partnership. The hateful will have been
strengthened by our decision.
 &HT;    ``Pursuing the domestic partnership path validates the hate.
Going with domestic partnership validates the bigotry. It does more
than validate it. It institutionalizes the bigotry and
affirmatively creates an apartheid system of family recognition in
Vermont,'' Hingtgen said.
 &HT;    Rep. William Suchmann suggested that honesty and fairness should
be the compass by which to guide the journey of citizens, who like
himself, are uneasy with same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I am uncomfortable seeing two adults of the same gender
openly displaying affection. But that is my problem. I have a much
bigger problem with a community that passes judgment on a specific
group of God's children and deems them unfit to share in an
institution that draws its strength from compromise and unselfish
love,'' Suchmann wrote in a letter printed on the editorial page of
one Vermont newspaper.
 &HT;    A minority of the House expressed dissatisfaction after the
committee voted to go the domestic partnership route.
 &HT;    ``I'm disappointed we're not doing marriage. But I also want to
emphasize that if our committee and Legislature adopt a
comprehensive domestic partnership bill, it will be the single most
forward-looking piece of legislation for gay and lesbian people in
the entire United States, and this is still very big news,'' said
Rep. William J. Lippert Jr., vice chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who is gay.
 &HT;    A broad civil-rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage will never fully guarantee equal rights for
gays.
 &HT;    Perhaps 10-year-old Courtney Dozetos, who testified at committee
hearings, said it best: ``It would make me feel special and good if
my moms could get married. I don't and probably never will
understand why that can't happen.''
 &HT;    Rep. Dean Corren puts the issue in it's proper historical
perspective. He understands that extending civil marriage to
same-sex couples is the only true ``remedy for what may be the last
great instance of legal discrimination based solely on bigotry.''
 &HT;    American history is rife with lessons on bigotry. Separate but
equal did not work in the South. It took bold action _ integration
_ to foster true equality.
 &HT;    Vermont legislators need to be bold. Legalize same-sex marriage.

 &HT;    Families battling insurers' refusals
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At first, Angie King didn't believe it when her
husband, Mark, suspected their 6-month-old daughter, Erica,
couldn't hear. ``I dismissed it,'' she recalled, ``because there
was no family history.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, however, the couple observed Erica.
When the dog barked, Erica didn't startle. When they clanged pots
and pans, Erica didn't react.
</P>
<P>
   That brought them crashing ``back to reality,'' Mrs. King
recalled, and forced them to confront a harsh truth: Erica suffered
from profound hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction was shock,'' Mrs. King said. ``As a mom,
you feel grief that part of your hope for that child suddenly
disappears. My biggest fears were, 'What if there's a fire?' and
'She'll never be able to hear me say, 'I love you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The family needed a miracle, and they got one: A cochlear
implant placed in Erica's ear in May. The nickel-sized implant
serves as an artificial inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   Since the procedure, Erica, now 4, marvels at sounds most of us
never notice: a bird on the roof; a bathroom door squeaking open; a
refrigerator's hum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never know that she's deaf,'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   The implant has given Erica nearly normal hearing. Her speech
and language skills went from ``age equivalency,'' her father said,
to well beyond it. ``With the implants she just zipped ahead,''
Mark King said, ``and we were ecstatic about that.''
</P>
<P>
   They were less than ecstatic about the $53,000 bill their
insurance company, Benicorp Insurance Corp. of Indianapolis, has
refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Their battle against their daughter's condition has proven in
many ways less formidable than their battle with their own insurer.
The Kings have sued Benicorp, saying the Ohio Department of
Insurance ruled that the implant was covered by the family policy.
</P>
<P>
   Their dilemma is now twofold: younger daughter, Jaime, 17
months, has the same condition. Will any hospital perform the
surgery with a pending bill from the other procedure? Can they
really go $100,000 into debt?
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are determined to find a way: ``If we have to sell the
house, we'll do it; that's how important it is to us for our
daughters to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Their case has received national publicity, including an
appearance on ``Good Morning America.'' After Mrs. King contacted
Gov. George W. Bush's domestic policy adviser, the Bush team called
the couple Monday night. They wanted the Kings to meet the
candidate Tuesday afternoon during a campaign swing through the
Columbus suburb of Westerville.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings met privately with Bush before the rally, along with
four other families.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' impressions?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got my vote. Need I say more?'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it genuine empathy, or politicking as usual?
</P>
<P>
   ``His track record stands for itself because Texas has numerous
programs for the hearing-impaired,'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush told us that Texas has an appeals board where
you can appeal your insurance company's decision, and that Texas is
the only state in the country where you can sue your HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however, won't need to rely on George W. Bush's
intercession. They're relying on their own considerable resources
and determination. Mrs. King, a stay-at-home mother who spent 10
years as an insurance adjuster, has already formed her own advocacy
group, Hear US, with its own Web site (www.hearus.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, but I honestly believe all things happen for
a reason,'' Mrs. King said.

   Q: Who was Sam Hill, as in the expression ``What in Sam Hill?''
</P>
<P>
   A: Edwin V. Mitchell mentions Col. Samuel Hill of Guilford,
Conn., in his Encyclopedia of American Politics (1946), but whether
there was such a person in reality is a matter of conjecture.
Legend has it that this man Hill perpetually ran for office, which
eventually gave rise to the phrase ``go like Sam Hill'' or ``run
like Sam Hill.'' But no evidence of his existence could be found in
any historical record, according to the Facts on File Encyclopedia
of Word and Phrase Origins.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the absence of such record, it concludes that Sam Hill
must remain ``a personified euphemism our Puritan ancestors used
for `hell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pope John Paul II's frailty has caused rumors of his possible
resignation someday. Has a pope ever resigned? If so, who was the
last one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Popes have resigned, ``but certainly not in modern times,''
said Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wilson at the Archdiocese of Atlanta said the last to do so
was Celestine V, who was in his 80s when he was elected pope on
July 5, 1294. He accepted only because the papacy had been vacant
for two years. Although a holy man, he lacked administrative
ability and considered the papacy a distraction from his ascetic
struggle for salvation. After encountering great difficulty,
Celestine V realized it would be dangerous for the church and for
his soul if he continued as pope. So, after consulting the
cardinals, he resigned on Dec. 13, 1294.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My cable TV company is replacing the wire cable with fiber
cable. Rather than dig up the whole neighborhood, the workers are

   A: There are two ways to bury these lines: directional bore and
trenching. In trenching, large holes are dug in order to place the
lines next to other utilities in the public right-of-way. This can
cause minor damage to sod, landscaping and the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   With a directional bore, a long rod goes into the ground,
shooting water to loosen the dirt. When the rod is pulled back, it
threads the conduit back through a hole for running fiber optics
and cable. This causes less damage to property and allows workers
to go several hundred feet with only limited disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes a sonic boom?
</P>
<P>
   A: The noise, which to a person on the ground sound like a
thunderclap, results from a shock wave produced by the object _
usually an airplane. A shock wave is a pressure disturbance that
builds up around the craft flying at a supersonic speed. It results
from a change in the air flow pattern around the craft's leading
edges. Sonic booms can't hurt people, but may damage plaster walls
and break windows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could President Clinton stay out one term and then run for
president again? Or is he limited to two terms, whether consecutive
or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, enacted in 1951,
reads: ``No person shall be elected to the office of president more
than twice, and no person who has held the office of president, or
acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some
other person was elected president, shall be elected to the office
of the president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible for a person to serve for more than two terms only
if he or she succeeds to the office and serves less than two years
of the departed president's four-year term, then is elected two
times on his or her own. But serving two terms, then staying out
for a round or two, and trying again, isn't permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Dwight Eisenhower, the first president to whom the
22nd Amendment applied, would have liked to run for a third term in
1960, according to John Eisenhower, his son and deputy chief of
staff. And Ronald Reagan, in his second term, campaigned for a
constitutional amendment to repeal the two-term limit, although not
in such a way as to apply to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 64 and working. What can you tell me about a new bill
that is being introduced in Congress that would allow people 65 and
older to draw their Social Security benefits and continue to work,
without a limit on the amount of money they can earn? How can we
encourage passage of this bill?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bill, which would eliminate the Social Security earnings
test that reduces benefits for workers 65 to 69 has been approved
by the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. Those
retirees now are penalized $1 in benefits for every $3 in earnings
above $17,000. A vote before the full House could come March 2.
After that, it would go to the Senate for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said he expects quick passage in
the House, but expressed some concern that when it goes to the
Senate, it could become a vehicle for other Social Security
changes. President Clinton, who called for repeal of the earnings
test two years ago, has said he would sign the repeal if Congress
sends him a ``clean bill'' without other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Constituents always should call or write their representative or
senator to indicate an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel testified Feb. 15
before the subcommittee on this bill. The Social Security
Administration's Web site _ www.ssa.gov _ has the full text of his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the populations of the North and the South at the
time of the Civil War? And in the South, is it known how many
individuals actually owned slaves?
</P>
<P>
   A: When the Civil War began, about 22 million people lived in
the North. About 9 million people, including 3 1/2 million slaves,
lived in the South. The Encyclopedia of the Confederacy reports
that 26 percent of Southern white families owned slaves. While the
typical Southern slave owner possessed one or two slaves, the
typical white Southern male owned none, according to the
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter will be applying to colleges soon. Can you list
all the Ivy League schools?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are eight institutions in the grouping, which is widely
regarded as high in academic and social prestige: Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell and the University
of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported last fall that Sandra Ann Rosas, wife of Los
Lobos singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, was missing. I haven't read
anything about it since. Was she found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Investigators think she was killed by her half-brother,
Gabriel Gomez, and have charged him with kidnapping and murder.
Gomez, 39, of Whittier, Calif., could face the death penalty if a
jury finds that she was killed during a kidnapping. Her body has
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Orange County (Calif.) Register in late
December, Gomez pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was arrested
the day after Sandra Ann Rosas vanished from her home in the Los
Angeles suburb of Rowland Heights.
</P>
<P>
   She was last seen by her three daughters before they went out
for the evening on Oct. 23. When they returned a few hours later,
they found the front door to their home open, her van gone, and
broken glass from the vehicle in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scott, a Los Angeles County sheriff's detective, said one
of the daughters called her mother's cell phone and, after it was
activated, overheard a conversation in which someone sounding like
Gomez ``was making threats regarding their mother's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time back, I read about a scholarship for minorities
established by Bill and Melinda Gates. Where can I get more
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation _ 877-690-4677 _
for recorded information. The message indicates that the deadline
has passed for applications for the 2000-01 school year. But you
should try the number again over the next few months for updated
information about new applications.
</P>
<P>
   When the scholarships and fellowships were announced, it was
said that the Gates Millennium Scholars Program would be for 20
years, starting in the fall of 2000, for outstanding low-income
African-American, American Indian, Alaska native, Hispanic-American
and Asian-American students. The United Negro College Fund
administers the program.

   FILE 2 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the Indian woman with papoose on the new golden
dollars?
</P>
<P>
   A: She is Sacagawea, a young Shoshone explorer who in 1804-06
assisted the Lewis and Clark expedition from the Northern Great
Plains to the Pacific Ocean and back. Sacagawea is credited with
contributing to the success of the expedition through her
navigational, diplomatic and translating skills. Translated, her
name means ``Bird Woman,'' according to the U.S. Mint
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the model for the image of Sacagawea on the on the
new golden dollar coin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mysterious face behind the golden dollar belongs to
Randy'L He-Dow Teton, a Shoshone who was a student at the
University of New Mexico in 1998 when the U.S. Mint invited New
Mexico sculptor Glenna Goodacre to submit proposed designs for the
coin.
</P>
<P>
   No portraits existed of the Shoshone teenager who assisted the
historic Lewis and Clark exhibition between 1804 and 1806, and even
the explorers' journals didn't include sketches or other clues as
to what she looked like. So Goodacre, knowing that even the best of
sculptors can't create out of thin air, went to the Institute of
American Indian Arts Museum in Santa Fe, N.M. Upon arrival, she
asked if any young Shoshone women were in the area. As luck would
have it, a woman who worked at the museum showed her a photo of her
three daughters, one of whom was Teton. Soon the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   Teton's stint modeling for a few hours paid off. A few weeks
later, Goodacre called with the big news: ``We got it!''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the coin's design, Teton said she was proud of
being the model. Of the image, she said she especially liked ``its
strength, gracefulness and humbleness.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the image doesn't represent just her, but all
Native American women. ``All (Native American) women have the
dignity of the golden dollar's image,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please settle an argument. Who was the first American athlete
to run a sub-4-minute mile?
</P>
<P>
   A: This isn't a trick question, is it? It you said Don Bowden,
you'd be correct. If the other party in the argument said Jim
Beatty, he or she would be correct, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why, as ``Famous First Facts'' explains. Bowden, of the
University of California, was the first U.S. runner to better the
4-minute mile outdoors. He did it in 3 minutes, 58.7 seconds, at
the Pacific Amateur Athletic Union Meet at Stockton, Calif., on
June 1, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The first to accomplish this feat indoors was Beatty, of the Los
Angeles Track Club, who ran the mile in 3 minutes, 58.9 seconds, in
the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on Feb. 10, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, incidentally, was the 11th man in the world to better
the 4-minute mile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The House vote on a posthumous Congressional Gold Medal for
``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz was 410-1. Who was the single
member of Congress to vote against it, and what was his or her
explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The single dissenter was Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). While Paul
``has no problem with the Congressional Medal of Honor for military
heroes, he votes against all Congressional Gold Medals,'' said his
spokesman, Tom Lizardo. Congressional Gold Medals are the highest
civilian honors handed out by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lizardo added that Paul ``has taken an oath to uphold the
Constitution and the separation of powers as outlined by the
founding fathers.'' In Paul's view, the doctrine of enumerated
powers is at the heart of the separation of powers. This doctrine,
Lizardo said, states that the federal government is limited to
taking such acts as specifically authorized by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some argue that the `necessary and proper' clause gives
the Congress broad powers to do whatever it wishes, this
interpretation is clearly contrary to the intent of the founders,''
Lizardo said. ``Thus, while it may be constitutional to award
honors to men and women who fulfill the constitutional function of
defending the nation, Congressman Paul can find no constitutional
authority to spend $30,000 in taxpayer funds to give awards to
great people such as Mr. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the top five states in the number of people
executed since the death penalty was reinstated? Can you compare
that number with the executions in some other countries, such as
England , France, Germany and Canada?
</P>
<P>
   A: The top five, as listed by the National Coalition to Abolish
the Death Penalty: Texas, Virginia, Florida, Missouri and
Louisiana. Twelve states and the District of Columbia have no
capital punishment. Brian Henninger of the coalition said no
Western European countries maintain the death penalty. Nor does
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty maintains a
Web site _ www.ncadp.org/ _ with statistics and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was an autopsy performed on Wilt Chamberlain?
</P>
<P>
   A: No autopsy was reported. The 7-foot-1-inch ``Wilt the
Stilt,'' who played 14 NBA seasons, died Oct. 12. He was found dead
in bed at his home in the Bel-Air suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As reported at the time, it had been said as early as the 1960s
that Chamberlain had a heart problem. In 1992 he was hospitalized
for three days with a slightly irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sy Goldberg, his attorney, agent and longtime friend, told the
Associated Press that Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure.
Shortly after his death, Goldberg said Chamberlain had deteriorated
relatively quickly ``over the last month or so.'' In the few weeks
before his death, Chamberlain had lost 30 or 40 pounds as doctors
drained his legs of fluid that had accumulated before his heart
trouble, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters just after Chamberlain's death, Barbara
Lewis, his sister, said he had undergone dental surgery the week
before his death and looked worse than she had ever seen him.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was Sam Hill, as in the expression ``What in Sam Hill?''
</P>
<P>
   A: Edwin V. Mitchell mentions Col. Samuel Hill of Guilford,
Conn., in his Encyclopedia of American Politics (1946), but whether
there was such a person in reality is a matter of conjecture.
Legend has it that this man Hill perpetually ran for office, which
eventually gave rise to the phrase ``go like Sam Hill'' or ``run
like Sam Hill.'' But no evidence of his existence could be found in
any historical record, according to the Facts on File Encyclopedia
of Word and Phrase Origins.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the absence of such record, it concludes that Sam Hill
must remain ``a personified euphemism our Puritan ancestors used
for `hell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pope John Paul II's frailty has caused rumors of his possible
resignation someday. Has a pope ever resigned? If so, who was the
last one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Popes have resigned, ``but certainly not in modern times,''
said Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wilson at the Archdiocese of Atlanta said the last to do so
was Celestine V, who was in his 80s when he was elected pope on
July 5, 1294. He accepted only because the papacy had been vacant
for two years. Although a holy man, he lacked administrative
ability and considered the papacy a distraction from his ascetic
struggle for salvation. After encountering great difficulty,
Celestine V realized it would be dangerous for the church and for
his soul if he continued as pope. So, after consulting the
cardinals, he resigned on Dec. 13, 1294.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My cable TV company is replacing the wire cable with fiber
cable. Rather than dig up the whole neighborhood, the workers are
using a process in which the new cable is forced underground with
water. Can you explain the technique?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two ways to bury these lines: directional bore and
trenching. In trenching, large holes are dug in order to place the
lines next to other utilities in the public right-of-way. This can
cause minor damage to sod, landscaping and the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   With a directional bore, a long rod goes into the ground,
shooting water to loosen the dirt. When the rod is pulled back, it
threads the conduit back through a hole for running fiber optics
and cable. This causes less damage to property and allows workers
to go several hundred feet with only limited disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes a sonic boom?
</P>
<P>
   A: The noise, which to a person on the ground sound like a
thunderclap, results from a shock wave produced by the object _
usually an airplane. A shock wave is a pressure disturbance that
builds up around the craft flying at a supersonic speed. It results
from a change in the air flow pattern around the craft's leading
edges. Sonic booms can't hurt people, but may damage plaster walls
and break windows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could President Clinton stay out one term and then run for
president again? Or is he limited to two terms, whether consecutive
or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, enacted in 1951,
reads: ``No person shall be elected to the office of president more
than twice, and no person who has held the office of president, or
acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some
other person was elected president, shall be elected to the office
of the president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible for a person to serve for more than two terms only
if he or she succeeds to the office and serves less than two years
of the departed president's four-year term, then is elected two
times on his or her own. But serving two terms, then staying out
for a round or two, and trying again, isn't permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Dwight Eisenhower, the first president to whom the
22nd Amendment applied, would have liked to run for a third term in
1960, according to John Eisenhower, his son and deputy chief of
staff. And Ronald Reagan, in his second term, campaigned for a
constitutional amendment to repeal the two-term limit, although not
in such a way as to apply to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 64 and working. What can you tell me about a new bill
that is being introduced in Congress that would allow people 65 and
older to draw their Social Security benefits and continue to work,
without a limit on the amount of money they can earn? How can we
encourage passage of this bill?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bill, which would eliminate the Social Security earnings
test that reduces benefits for workers 65 to 69 has been approved
by the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. Those
retirees now are penalized $1 in benefits for every $3 in earnings
above $17,000. A vote before the full House could come March 2.
After that, it would go to the Senate for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said he expects quick passage in
the House, but expressed some concern that when it goes to the
Senate, it could become a vehicle for other Social Security
changes. President Clinton, who called for repeal of the earnings
test two years ago, has said he would sign the repeal if Congress
sends him a ``clean bill'' without other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Constituents always should call or write their representative or
senator to indicate an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel testified Feb. 15
before the subcommittee on this bill. The Social Security
Administration's Web site _ www.ssa.gov _ has the full text of his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the populations of the North and the South at the
time of the Civil War? And in the South, is it known how many
individuals actually owned slaves?
</P>
<P>
   A: When the Civil War began, about 22 million people lived in
the North. About 9 million people, including 3 1/2 million slaves,
lived in the South. The Encyclopedia of the Confederacy reports
that 26 percent of Southern white families owned slaves. While the
typical Southern slave owner possessed one or two slaves, the
typical white Southern male owned none, according to the
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter will be applying to colleges soon. Can you list
all the Ivy League schools?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are eight institutions in the grouping, which is widely
regarded as high in academic and social prestige: Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell and the University
of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported last fall that Sandra Ann Rosas, wife of Los
Lobos singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, was missing. I haven't read
anything about it since. Was she found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Investigators think she was killed by her half-brother,
Gabriel Gomez, and have charged him with kidnapping and murder.
Gomez, 39, of Whittier, Calif., could face the death penalty if a
jury finds that she was killed during a kidnapping. Her body has
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Orange County (Calif.) Register in late
December, Gomez pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was arrested
the day after Sandra Ann Rosas vanished from her home in the Los
Angeles suburb of Rowland Heights.
</P>
<P>
   She was last seen by her three daughters before they went out
for the evening on Oct. 23. When they returned a few hours later,
they found the front door to their home open, her van gone, and
broken glass from the vehicle in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scott, a Los Angeles County sheriff's detective, said one
of the daughters called her mother's cell phone and, after it was
activated, overheard a conversation in which someone sounding like
Gomez ``was making threats regarding their mother's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time back, I read about a scholarship for minorities
established by Bill and Melinda Gates. Where can I get more
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation _ 877-690-4677 _
for recorded information. The message indicates that the deadline
has passed for applications for the 2000-01 school year. But you
should try the number again over the next few months for updated
information about new applications.
</P>
<P>
   When the scholarships and fellowships were announced, it was
said that the Gates Millennium Scholars Program would be for 20
years, starting in the fall of 2000, for outstanding low-income
African-American, American Indian, Alaska native, Hispanic-American
and Asian-American students. The United Negro College Fund
administers the program.

<P>
   Q: Who is the Indian woman with papoose on the new golden
dollars?
</P>
<P>
   A: She is Sacagawea, a young Shoshone explorer who in 1804-06
assisted the Lewis and Clark expedition from the Northern Great
Plains to the Pacific Ocean and back. Sacagawea is credited with
contributing to the success of the expedition through her
navigational, diplomatic and translating skills. Translated, her
name means ``Bird Woman,'' according to the U.S. Mint
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the model for the image of Sacagawea on the on the
new golden dollar coin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mysterious face behind the golden dollar belongs to
Randy'L He-Dow Teton, a Shoshone who was a student at the
University of New Mexico in 1998 when the U.S. Mint invited New
Mexico sculptor Glenna Goodacre to submit proposed designs for the
coin.
</P>
<P>
   No portraits existed of the Shoshone teenager who assisted the
historic Lewis and Clark exhibition between 1804 and 1806, and even
the explorers' journals didn't include sketches or other clues as
to what she looked like. So Goodacre, knowing that even the best of
sculptors can't create out of thin air, went to the Institute of
American Indian Arts Museum in Santa Fe, N.M. Upon arrival, she
asked if any young Shoshone women were in the area. As luck would
have it, a woman who worked at the museum showed her a photo of her
three daughters, one of whom was Teton. Soon the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   Teton's stint modeling for a few hours paid off. A few weeks
later, Goodacre called with the big news: ``We got it!''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the coin's design, Teton said she was proud of
being the model. Of the image, she said she especially liked ``its
strength, gracefulness and humbleness.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the image doesn't represent just her, but all
Native American women. ``All (Native American) women have the
dignity of the golden dollar's image,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please settle an argument. Who was the first American athlete
to run a sub-4-minute mile?
</P>
<P>
   A: This isn't a trick question, is it? It you said Don Bowden,
you'd be correct. If the other party in the argument said Jim
Beatty, he or she would be correct, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why, as ``Famous First Facts'' explains. Bowden, of the
University of California, was the first U.S. runner to better the
4-minute mile outdoors. He did it in 3 minutes, 58.7 seconds, at
the Pacific Amateur Athletic Union Meet at Stockton, Calif., on
June 1, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The first to accomplish this feat indoors was Beatty, of the Los
Angeles Track Club, who ran the mile in 3 minutes, 58.9 seconds, in
the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on Feb. 10, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, incidentally, was the 11th man in the world to better
the 4-minute mile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The House vote on a posthumous Congressional Gold Medal for
``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz was 410-1. Who was the single
member of Congress to vote against it, and what was his or her
explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The single dissenter was Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). While Paul
``has no problem with the Congressional Medal of Honor for military
heroes, he votes against all Congressional Gold Medals,'' said his
spokesman, Tom Lizardo. Congressional Gold Medals are the highest
civilian honors handed out by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lizardo added that Paul ``has taken an oath to uphold the
Constitution and the separation of powers as outlined by the
founding fathers.'' In Paul's view, the doctrine of enumerated
powers is at the heart of the separation of powers. This doctrine,
Lizardo said, states that the federal government is limited to
taking such acts as specifically authorized by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some argue that the `necessary and proper' clause gives
the Congress broad powers to do whatever it wishes, this
interpretation is clearly contrary to the intent of the founders,''
Lizardo said. ``Thus, while it may be constitutional to award
honors to men and women who fulfill the constitutional function of
defending the nation, Congressman Paul can find no constitutional
authority to spend $30,000 in taxpayer funds to give awards to
great people such as Mr. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the top five states in the number of people
executed since the death penalty was reinstated? Can you compare
that number with the executions in some other countries, such as
England , France, Germany and Canada?
</P>
<P>
   A: The top five, as listed by the National Coalition to Abolish
the Death Penalty: Texas, Virginia, Florida, Missouri and
Louisiana. Twelve states and the District of Columbia have no
capital punishment. Brian Henninger of the coalition said no
Western European countries maintain the death penalty. Nor does
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty maintains a
Web site _ www.ncadp.org/ _ with statistics and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was an autopsy performed on Wilt Chamberlain?
</P>
<P>
   A: No autopsy was reported. The 7-foot-1-inch ``Wilt the
Stilt,'' who played 14 NBA seasons, died Oct. 12. He was found dead
in bed at his home in the Bel-Air suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As reported at the time, it had been said as early as the 1960s
that Chamberlain had a heart problem. In 1992 he was hospitalized
for three days with a slightly irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sy Goldberg, his attorney, agent and longtime friend, told the
Associated Press that Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure.
Shortly after his death, Goldberg said Chamberlain had deteriorated
relatively quickly ``over the last month or so.'' In the few weeks
before his death, Chamberlain had lost 30 or 40 pounds as doctors
drained his legs of fluid that had accumulated before his heart
trouble, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters just after Chamberlain's death, Barbara
Lewis, his sister, said he had undergone dental surgery the week
before his death and looked worse than she had ever seen him.

 &HT;    Flavorful soup great way to savor good bacon
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some culinary moments are so special they are
etched in memory.
</P>
<P>
   So I remember the summer day in 1996 and lunch on the patio at
The Winds in Yellow Springs. That's when I first tasted Nueske's
applewood smoked bacon on a state-of-the-art BLT. I quickly asked,
``Where did you get that bacon?''
</P>
<P>
   They told me, but I had to struggle to get my hands on Nueske's
bacon. Nearly four years later, delivery to area supermarkets
remains irregular even when the butcher begs suppliers for it.
Fortunately, Nueske's now has a mail-order catalog and a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the bacon in hand, try it in this recipe, a real
showstopper adapted from Ming Tsai's ``Blue Ginger'' cookbook
(Potter, $32.50). It's full of the flavor of good smoked bacon plus
the smoky hot flavor of chipotle chiles.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe takes a bit of work, but the soup can be made ahead
and refrigerated. Even the red pepper and bacon salsa can be made
in advance and warmed just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   CHIPOTLE SWEET POTATO SOUP WITH RED BELL PEPPER AND BACON SALSA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Salsa:
</P>
<P>
   4 slices smoky bacon
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime (half a lime if they are big)
</P>
<P>
   Soup:
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, smashed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger root
</P>
<P>
   2 small yellow onions, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 teaspoon pureed chipotles in adobo sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 large sweet potatoes (not yams) peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
dice
</P>
<P>
   6 cups fat-free chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   Creme fraiche or equal parts of sour cream and nonfat yogurt
mixed together
</P>
<P>
   To make the salsa, cook the bacon, turning once, until crisp in
a large, heavy pan over medium heat. Drain bacon on paper towels;
crumble and set aside. Strain the bacon fat into a container and
wipe pan. Return just enough bacon fat to the skillet to coat the
bottom lightly. Add the diced red onion and red pepper and cook
over medium heat about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and
add the lime juice. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside at room
temperature (or refrigerate and rewarm later).
</P>
<P>
   Add some of the reserved bacon fat to the pan (bacon fat
provides essential flavor), using enough to coat the pan. Add the
garlic, minced ginger, chopped onions and brown sugar; season with
salt and pepper and cook about 6 minutes, until onion is lightly
browned. Add the wine and stir up any brown bits in the bottom of
the pan. Add the chipotle puree and cook the mixture over medium
heat until the mixture is reduced by three-fourths, about 6
minutes. Add the sweet potatoes and chicken stock and simmer until
the potatoes are very soft, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a blender, puree the soup mixture in batches. The soup can
be made ahead to this point and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Reheat the soup. Warm the salsa and bacon crumbles in
a 300-degree oven for 5 minutes, then combine the salsa and bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle soup into soup bowls, add a spoonful of creme fraiche and
top with a generous spoonful of salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Puree 1 chile and a little of the sauce and in a mini-processor.
Keep the remaining chiles in a well-sealed jar in the refrigerator
and they will last for weeks.

<P>
   For those of you who think you've seen the last of Mick Foley,
don't shed too many tears. Despite losing a 'retirement' match with
Triple H in the ``No Way Out'' pay-per-view Sunday, Foley should
return in some capacity for the April 2nd ``Wrestlemania.'' Once
again, WWF fooled the experts with Big Show defeating The Rock,
Chris Jericho losing the Intercontential belt to Kurt Angle and the
Dudley Boyz becoming the new tag team champs. The finishes helped
to make the follow-up ``Raw'' show one of the best this year.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Nitro'' this week, you may have seen the last of Tank
Abbott. His gimmick as the toughman no one can stop will have to be
changed if he remains after his loss to Sid Vicious. Rumors were
hot and heavy that Abbott would be fired after a knife incident in
his match with Big Al at the ``SuperBrawl'' pay-per-view. Don't
expect that, but his chance to be a main eventer has probably
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of passed, did you hear all those boos for Hulk Hogan
on ``Nitro.'' Sure he was bad-mouthing a Minnesota legend in Ric
Flair, but WCW needs to open its ears to the fact fans don't want
to see Hulk Hogan anymore.
</P>
<P>
   D-Lo Brown is getting tired of playing second fiddle to the
Godfather and wants a new gimmick. One problem, his old gimmick
wasn't causing any heat among the fans. A few rumors have surfaced
that the reason why D-Lo dropped both the Intercontential and
European belts was because of the neck injury that he helped cause
to Droz. When D-Lo missed his spot, Droz was injured. Weeks later
he dropped both belts and has been buried in the WWF since.
</P>
<P>
   ECW is looking into making Super Calo a contract offer. He has
worked with the organization on a per appearence basis, but that
could change soon.
</P>
<P>
   Another personality ECW is looking at signing is manager James
Vandenberg. He is currently involved in the storyline with Raven
and Tommy Dreamer. Expect him to become the mentor of the former
ECW tag champs as they feud with the Impact Players. Expect to see
Balls Mahoney return to the ECW soon. He has been working some FMW
shows over in Japan for the past month. The FMW and ECW hope to
continue their trading of talent, which has included Masato Tanaka.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Prentice, who owns Championship Wrestling in the Eastern
Tennessee and Georgia area, pulled out of a deal with WWF to sign
with WCW. Prentice will get wrestlers from the WCW Power Plant to
work some of his shows in those areas.

and the faithful can hardly handle the wait. ``I'm ready to rock,''
said fan Mickey Davies. ``I want to see my boys. Whoooohooooo!''
Davies, 19, is not the only one fidgeting in his seat. The crowd of
28,000 is waiting to go nuts. They want to crank it up. They know
what's coming. The house lights go down. The Dome erupts. It's so

 IN AMERICA-0302-COX &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 0302: There's something funny about this family
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In many ways, Jay and Kristin Stewart are just
your average young married couple with a toddler, a minivan and a
house in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, when they began dating in Las Vegas, she was a
professional clown and he alternated playing Moe and Larry in a
``Three Stooges'' show at the MGM Grand Hotel. And yes, every day
it takes both of them about an hour to get dressed for work and _
ahem! _ put on their makeup.
</P>
<P>
   OK, and their co-worker, the Human Comet, sets the suit he's
wearing on fire daily _ six times on weekends. And the Wheel of
Wonder's wife helps run the nursery where the Stewarts'
18-month-old daughter, Karen, stays when they're working.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many people just feel as if they're living in a
three-ring circus, Jay and Kristin Stewart actually do. Four months
ago, the couple signed on as clowns with the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus. Taking the jobs meant arranging for family
to stay in their house. Except for a few days spent at home for
Christmas, they'll be hitting the road through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Atlanta,'' said Jay, who will nonetheless stay with
his little family on the circus train.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the effort is worth it to the Stewarts, who this year
will perform in some 500 shows, taking countless pratfalls and pies
in the face in pursuit of a shared dream. Indeed, in a setting
where a high-wire walker teeters precariously over a pit of tigers,
trapeze artists boast more nerve than net and even bouncing on a
pogo stick can be downright lethal, Jay and Kristin Stewart
arguably are courageous figures in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the very serious decision to be funny for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to join the quote-unquote normal circuit that most
people do,'' Kristin Stewart, 30, who looked positively normal in
street clothes some two hours before showtime in Raleigh, N.C.
``But it wasn't for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after marrying in 1996, in fact, the couple settled down in
Atlanta and took what they describe as ``administrative'' jobs with
a vinyl flooring company. But clowning eventually called them back:
first to Japan, where Jay took a job with a different circus last
year, and then to the big top big time with Ringling Bros. last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought for a while maybe we should try to have a `real'
life _ who knows, maybe be more stable or those words that people
throw around,'' Jay, 35, explained, sitting in a temporary circus
office in the Raleigh arena not far from the elephant holding area
and the acrobats' dressing rooms. ``But then we realized Karen's
got to know us for who we are. I want her to be proud of me, and
for me to do what I'm good at, so that when she's able to say what
her daddy does for a living, it's something kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts native Kristin, this is her first year with
the acknowledged creme de la clown performing unit. For Jay, this
year marks both his return to the circus he first joined in 1989
and a step up the career ladder: He is the official ``Boss Clown,''
which only sounds like Tony Soprano in red nose and oversize shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's just nitpicking,'' said Jay. ``It sounds like
it's unimportant. But the littlest thing, like someone not checking
their props beforehand, can ruin a gag for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was P.T. Barnum himself who said clowns and elephants were
the ``pegs'' holding up the circus. During one 2 1/2-hour show in
Raleigh, only the cotton candy vendors were more constant presences
than the clowns, who juggled and danced their way through
ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson's opening and closing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were clown numbers, including one in which a
comically exasperated Jay portrayed _ what else? _ the boss of the
world's most inept group of bakers. Plus clown hijinks to direct
the audience members' eyes away from apparatus being moved out of
one ring or toward dogs doing handstands in another.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult balancing acts are something the Stewarts know all
about. Under that clown makeup, they face many of the same
challenges as people who don't work in a spangled bodysuit and top
hat, or hide seven feet of handkerchief up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a one-room apartment on the train, but keep the
minivan in case they need to take Karen to a doctor or run errands.
The circus provides a traveling school and a nursery, and Karen's
sleeping schedule has been adjusted to jibe with performance times.
They've even developed a routine to deal with that well-known bane
of working parents _ getting dressed with a toddler underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us will start and the other will watch her and then
when the first person gets to the point where they can watch the
baby and continue to get dressed, we'll switch off,'' Kristin
explained, while Karen blew on a souvenir ringmaster's whistle.
``So that within an hour, both of us have gotten our makeup on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stewarts plan to have more children, just as they plan to
stay with the circus ``as long as we have fun and everything's cool
with Karen,'' Jay said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask how things are with Karen and the Stewarts react with that
typical blend of parental pride and modesty _ albeit with a
three-ring twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't seem to be scared of anything,'' Jay said. ``When
we were in Japan, she had her own personal giraffe and zebra. The
giraffe would lean down and lick her on the top of the head and she
loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I think she has a really strong sense of balance,''
Kristin said. ``And she's strong, because she learned to walk over
cables and stuff. She didn't learn to walk on a rug in my living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't necessarily discourage their daughter if she
wanted to step into their comically oversize shoes someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want her to do what she wants to do,'' Jay said. ``Now
obviously, if she chooses to be a clown, we're going to be very
happy and very proud. If she chooses to be a doctor, we're going to
be even happier, probably!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she chooses to be a high-wire walker, I'll be very
scared,'' Kristin admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Not your average parents' concern. But this is not your average
couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people who are happy with what they do for
a living, and I think they really are,'' said Jay's mother, Marye
Fincher. ``And I think they love each other very much. In this day
and age, it's hard to do either of those things. In any setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, though, there was no funny business between the
couple. They met in passing in 1993 at the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Clown College, where Jay, an '89 graduate, was
teaching and Kristin was a student. After graduating, she took
clown jobs at Circus Circus and several other Las Vegas hotels.
They reconnected when Jay joined the ``Stooges'' show there, and
married on Cape Cod in what Karen describes as a ``traditional''
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were clowns and Stooges in attendance, but everyone was
in civilian clothes,'' Jay explained.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after came that experiment with a ``real'' life and those
office jobs. On paper, they were ideal candidates: Kristin has a
political science degree from Brown University and Jay has a
master's degree in communications and theater arts from Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But for these two clowns, an office is no competition for a
three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Raleigh, children of all ages roared their approval
as the clown-garbed Jay chased the pink-haired Kristin around in
circles after she had repeatedly swatted his rear end with a broom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't imagine making your living by making people
laugh,'' Jay had said a few hours earlier, winking at Karen. Then,
as he and Kristin beamed with pride, the toddler performed to
perfection the exaggerated move on him whereby one clown pretends
to poke another in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   See? Just your average young family.

pogo stick can be downright lethal, Jay and Kristin Stewart
arguably are courageous figures in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the very serious decision to be funny for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to join the quote-unquote normal circuit that most
people do,'' Kristin Stewart, 30, who looked positively normal in
street clothes some two hours before showtime in Raleigh, N.C.
``But it wasn't for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after marrying in 1996, in fact, the couple settled down in
Atlanta and took what they describe as ``administrative'' jobs with
a vinyl flooring company. But clowning eventually called them back:
first to Japan, where Jay took a job with a different circus last
year, and then to the big top big time with Ringling Bros. last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought for a while maybe we should try to have a `real'
life _ who knows, maybe be more stable or those words that people
throw around,'' Jay, 35, explained, sitting in a temporary circus
office in the Raleigh arena not far from the elephant holding area
and the acrobats' dressing rooms. ``But then we realized Karen's
got to know us for who we are. I want her to be proud of me, and
for me to do what I'm good at, so that when she's able to say what
her daddy does for a living, it's something kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts native Kristin, this is her first year with
the acknowledged creme de la clown performing unit. For Jay, this
year marks both his return to the circus he first joined in 1989
and a step up the career ladder: He is the official ``Boss Clown,''
which only sounds like Tony Soprano in red nose and oversize shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's just nitpicking,'' said Jay. ``It sounds like
it's unimportant. But the littlest thing, like someone not checking
their props beforehand, can ruin a gag for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was P.T. Barnum himself who said clowns and elephants were
the ``pegs'' holding up the circus. During one 2 1/2-hour show in
Raleigh, only the cotton candy vendors were more constant presences
than the clowns, who juggled and danced their way through
ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson's opening and closing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were clown numbers, including one in which a
comically exasperated Jay portrayed _ what else? _ the boss of the
world's most inept group of bakers. Plus clown hijinks to direct
the audience members' eyes away from apparatus being moved out of
one ring or toward dogs doing handstands in another.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult balancing acts are something the Stewarts know all
about. Under that clown makeup, they face many of the same
challenges as people who don't work in a spangled bodysuit and top
hat, or hide seven feet of handkerchief up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a one-room apartment on the train, but keep the
minivan in case they need to take Karen to a doctor or run errands.
The circus provides a traveling school and a nursery, and Karen's
sleeping schedule has been adjusted to jibe with performance times.
They've even developed a routine to deal with that well-known bane
of working parents _ getting dressed with a toddler underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us will start and the other will watch her and then
when the first person gets to the point where they can watch the
baby and continue to get dressed, we'll switch off,'' Kristin
explained, while Karen blew on a souvenir ringmaster's whistle.
``So that within an hour, both of us have gotten our makeup on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stewarts plan to have more children, just as they plan to
stay with the circus ``as long as we have fun and everything's cool
with Karen,'' Jay said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask how things are with Karen and the Stewarts react with that
typical blend of parental pride and modesty _ albeit with a
three-ring twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't seem to be scared of anything,'' Jay said. ``When
we were in Japan, she had her own personal giraffe and zebra. The
giraffe would lean down and lick her on the top of the head and she
loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I think she has a really strong sense of balance,''
Kristin said. ``And she's strong, because she learned to walk over
cables and stuff. She didn't learn to walk on a rug in my living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't necessarily discourage their daughter if she
wanted to step into their comically oversize shoes someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want her to do what she wants to do,'' Jay said. ``Now
obviously, if she chooses to be a clown, we're going to be very
happy and very proud. If she chooses to be a doctor, we're going to
be even happier, probably!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she chooses to be a high-wire walker, I'll be very
scared,'' Kristin admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Not your average parents' concern. But this is not your average
couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people who are happy with what they do for
a living, and I think they really are,'' said Jay's mother, Marye
Fincher. ``And I think they love each other very much. In this day
and age, it's hard to do either of those things. In any setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, though, there was no funny business between the
couple. They met in passing in 1993 at the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Clown College, where Jay, an '89 graduate, was
teaching and Kristin was a student. After graduating, she took
clown jobs at Circus Circus and several other Las Vegas hotels.
They reconnected when Jay joined the ``Stooges'' show there, and
married on Cape Cod in what Karen describes as a ``traditional''
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were clowns and Stooges in attendance, but everyone was
in civilian clothes,'' Jay explained.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after came that experiment with a ``real'' life and those
office jobs. On paper, they were ideal candidates: Kristin has a
political science degree from Brown University and Jay has a
master's degree in communications and theater arts from Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But for these two clowns, an office is no competition for a
three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Raleigh, children of all ages roared their approval
as the clown-garbed Jay chased the pink-haired Kristin around in
circles after she had repeatedly swatted his rear end with a broom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't imagine making your living by making people
laugh,'' Jay had said a few hours earlier, winking at Karen. Then,
as he and Kristin beamed with pride, the toddler performed to
perfection the exaggerated move on him whereby one clown pretends
to poke another in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   See? Just your average young family.

 &HT;    How do hotels attract guests in a fiercely competitive market?
By going way beyond overnight shoeshines, 24-hour room service and
pet goldfish in guest rooms to offer something that their rivals
don't.
 &HT;    Here's a rundown of some of the unusual perks that hotels are
tempting visitors with these days.
 &HT;    Anyone who's skilled with a pool cue may get a chance to cut a
deal at the Hotel Loretto, where the ``Rack 'em! Rate'' rules.
Guests who win a game of pool against Janine Shelton, the general
manager, can get a reduced room rate _ 25 percent off one night's
accommodations or 5 percent off one night's accommodations for each
ball left on the table, whichever is greater.
 &HT;    For example, if a guest beats Shelton and she leaves seven balls
on the table, the guest would receive 35 percent off their room
rate. But if Shelton fails to pocket any balls during the game or
if the guest sinks the eight ball on the break, the guest receives
his first night's accommodations free. The ``Rack 'em! Rate'' is
based on space availability. For more information: The Hotel
Loretto, 211 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501; (800)
727-5531; www.noblehousehotels.com/loretto/index.html.
 &HT;    At the Four Seasons Las Vegas, the usual poolside amenities such
as Evian mist and cold towels are supplemented with sliced
cucumbers to relieve eyes tired out by late Vegas nights. The hotel
says it hands out 3,000 slices of cucumbers per week. For more
information: Four Seasons Las Vegas, P.O. Box 98881, Las Vegas,
Nev. 89193; (800) 819-5053; www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    In car-obsessed California, the Pan Pacific San Francisco offers
on-site auto detailing with car expert Joe Newhoff. Available by
appointment only, standard cleaning is $35 and extended cleaning is
$60. Add a hand polish and wax and the cost is $145, while complete
auto detailing is $295. For more information: Pan Pacific San
Francisco, 500 Post St., San Francisco, Calif. 94102; 800-533-6465;
www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    At Villa del Sol in the Mexican resort of Zihuatanejo, guests
can take the ``Interactive Spanish and Mexican Cuisine Course.''
Participants tour the town markets, learning about herbs, spices,
fruits, vegetables and fish, while shopping for the ingredients for
a Mexican meal.
 &HT;    Afterwards, guests can help prepare a Mexican meal or merely
watch the demonstration. Tequila, wine, beer and soft drinks are
served with the lunch, along with a booklet of recipes. The
five-hour course is $80 per person and limited to a group of eight.
For more information: Villa del Sol, Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo,
Mexico; (888) 389-2645; www.hotelvilladelsol.com.
 &HT;    At Hastings House, each guest's name is hand-lettered on the
door to their room and a personalized greeting card welcomes them.
In the evening, guests receive a personalized dinner menu. Every
morning, a wake-up hamper filled with fresh coffee or tea and
homemade pastries is delivered to the door of their suites. For
more information: Hastings House, 160 Upper Ganges Road, Salt
Spring Island, B.C., Canada V8K 2S2; 800-661-9255;
www.hastingshouse.com.
 &HT;    The Four Seasons Hotel Washington, D.C., has a ``Quiet Room''
for $30 per hour. It's a private, soundproofed getaway where guests
can relax or listen to CDs while sitting in a leather recliner with
built-in massage functions. The room is lit by recessed, adjustable
``mood'' lighting. There's a remote-controlled audiovisual system
as well as a sound machine that can emulate noises like ocean
waves. In addition, a mini-fridge stocked with complimentary
refreshments, hot and cold face towels and a lava lamp are at their
disposal. For more information: The Four Seasons Hotel, 2800
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-819-5053;
www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    An Irish Yogi is what the Fitzpatrick Family Group of Hotels
offers at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel and the Fitzpatrick Grand
Central Hotel. Yogi Paul Dallaghan of Dublin teaches private
Vinyasa-style yoga to guests in their rooms. Sessions must be
arranged 24 hours in advance, and the cost is $80 per hour or $100
for 90 minutes. For more information: Fitzpatrick Hotels, 687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 800-367-7701;
www.fitzpatrickhotels.com.
 &HT;    The Towers at The New York Palace features ``maitre d'etage'' or
butler service. Room service is through Le Cirque 2000, one of New
York's most lauded restaurants, as well as a neighboring Japanese
restaurant, Sushisay. The Towers also has its own concierge, and
guests receive personalized stationery and business cards that
include the number of the fax machine in their room. For more
information: The Towers, 455 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
(800) NY-PALACE.
 &HT;    At the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, golfers can schedule a
massage right on the course. The massage therapist meets the player
at the ninth hole for the massage, but the $90-per-hour charge _
and the massage _ can be split among a foursome. For more
information: The Broadmoor, 1 Lake Ave., Colorado Springs, Colo.
80906; 800-634-7711; www.broadmoor.com.
 &HT;    Aruba Sonesta Resorts has an ``Island Nanny Program'' that
provides a nanny for the duration of the family's stay. The rates
start at $120 per day, and the nanny is on duty from 8:00 a.m. to
midnight for two children. For more information: Aruba Sonesta
Resorts, Orangestad, Aruba; (800) SONESTA; www.arubasonesta.com.
 &HT;    Finally, the 5th Avenue Suites Hotel allows guests to ``Spend
the Night with Doug.'' Ecology-minded guests can request to have a
miniature Douglas Fir, the state tree of Oregon, brought to their
room. Trees that outgrows the hotel will eventually be donated to
Portland's Hoyt Arboretum. For more information: 5th Avenue Suites
Hotel, 506 S.W. Washington, Portland, Ore. 97204; (800) 711-2971;

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 &HT;    This year, many tour companies are including adventure-travel
excursions for the senior set. Here is a sampling.
 &HT;    
 SOUTHWESTERN STYLE  
 &HT;    Interhostel, an international study/travel program for adults
ages 50 and older, is adding six new domestic trips for 2000 _
including two that explore the Southwest and its heritage.
 &HT;    The trips are sponsored by the University of New Hampshire's
Continuing Education Program. Travelers can head for Palm Springs
(April 2 to 7) or Palm Desert, Calif., (April 9 to 14), where they
will learn about the wonderful activities of such organizations as
Animal Advocates for Life.
 &HT;    The Palm Desert program includes a tour of the Wildlife
Ambassadors facility to meet Belgian tigers, a meeting with the
curator scientist of the Palm Springs Desert Museum and a trip to
the Living Desert, a outdoor museum where wild creatures are
rescued and cared for.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs outing will include guided tours of the Agua
Caliente Indian Canyons as well as a ride on the Aerial Tramway.
Depending on the trip you choose, the price is about $830, double
occupancy, without airfare.
 &HT;    Interhostel is also offering a trip to the Butler Wash
Archaeology and Rock Art Service Project in Eastland, Utah, from
April 15 to 21. Tour-goers are given the chance to explore the Comb
Ridge area, which is particularly rich in archaic sites. Here, rock
art dates back as far as 8000 B.C. Participants also learn how to
locate and survey cliff dwellings, learn how to document sites and
participate in lectures and discussions about the ancient people of
the area.
 &HT;    Interhostel requires that travelers be able to hike two to four
miles in hilly canyon land. The price is $935 (no singles), without
airfare.
 &HT;    For more information about Interhostel's travel selections, call
(800) 733-9753 or visit www.learn.unh.edu on the Web.
 &HT;    
 WHITE-WATER RAFTING  
 &HT;    Dave Warren's River Expeditions in Salmon, Idaho, is posting
nearly a dozen white-water rafting trips designed especially for

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 &HT;    This year, many tour companies are including adventure-travel
excursions for the senior set. Here is a sampling.
 &HT;    
 SOUTHWESTERN STYLE  
 &HT;    Interhostel, an international study/travel program for adults
ages 50 and older, is adding six new domestic trips for 2000 _
including two that explore the Southwest and its heritage.
 &HT;    The trips are sponsored by the University of New Hampshire's
Continuing Education Program. Travelers can head for Palm Springs
(April 2 to 7) or Palm Desert, Calif., (April 9 to 14), where they
will learn about the wonderful activities of such organizations as
Animal Advocates for Life.
 &HT;    The Palm Desert program includes a tour of the Wildlife
Ambassadors facility to meet Belgian tigers, a meeting with the
curator scientist of the Palm Springs Desert Museum and a trip to
the Living Desert, a outdoor museum where wild creatures are
rescued and cared for.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs outing will include guided tours of the Agua
Caliente Indian Canyons as well as a ride on the Aerial Tramway.
Depending on the trip you choose, the price is about $830, double
occupancy, without airfare.
 &HT;    Interhostel is also offering a trip to the Butler Wash
Archaeology and Rock Art Service Project in Eastland, Utah, from
April 15 to 21. Tour-goers are given the chance to explore the Comb
Ridge area, which is particularly rich in archaic sites. Here, rock
art dates back as far as 8000 B.C. Participants also learn how to
locate and survey cliff dwellings, learn how to document sites and
participate in lectures and discussions about the ancient people of
the area.
 &HT;    Interhostel requires that travelers be able to hike two to four
miles in hilly canyon land. The price is $935 (no singles), without
airfare.
 &HT;    For more information about Interhostel's travel selections, call
(800) 733-9753 or visit www.learn.unh.edu on the Web.

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    How do hotels attract guests in a fiercely competitive market?
By going way beyond overnight shoeshines, 24-hour room service and
pet goldfish in guest rooms to offer something that their rivals
don't.
 &HT;    Here's a rundown of some of the unusual perks that hotels are
tempting visitors with these days.
 &HT;    Anyone who's skilled with a pool cue may get a chance to cut a
deal at the Hotel Loretto, where the ``Rack 'em! Rate'' rules.
Guests who win a game of pool against Janine Shelton, the general
manager, can get a reduced room rate _ 25 percent off one night's
accommodations or 5 percent off one night's accommodations for each
ball left on the table, whichever is greater.
 &HT;    For example, if a guest beats Shelton and she leaves seven balls
on the table, the guest would receive 35 percent off their room
rate. But if Shelton fails to pocket any balls during the game or
if the guest sinks the eight ball on the break, the guest receives
his first night's accommodations free. The ``Rack 'em! Rate'' is
based on space availability. For more information: The Hotel
Loretto, 211 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501; (800)
727-5531; www.noblehousehotels.com/loretto/index.html.
 &HT;    At the Four Seasons Las Vegas, the usual poolside amenities such
as Evian mist and cold towels are supplemented with sliced
cucumbers to relieve eyes tired out by late Vegas nights. The hotel
says it hands out 3,000 slices of cucumbers per week. For more
information: Four Seasons Las Vegas, P.O. Box 98881, Las Vegas,
Nev. 89193; (800) 819-5053; www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    In car-obsessed California, the Pan Pacific San Francisco offers
on-site auto detailing with car expert Joe Newhoff. Available by
appointment only, standard cleaning is $35 and extended cleaning is
$60. Add a hand polish and wax and the cost is $145, while complete
auto detailing is $295. For more information: Pan Pacific San
Francisco, 500 Post St., San Francisco, Calif. 94102; 800-533-6465;
www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    At Villa del Sol in the Mexican resort of Zihuatanejo, guests
can take the ``Interactive Spanish and Mexican Cuisine Course.''
Participants tour the town markets, learning about herbs, spices,
fruits, vegetables and fish, while shopping for the ingredients for
a Mexican meal.
 &HT;    Afterwards, guests can help prepare a Mexican meal or merely
watch the demonstration. Tequila, wine, beer and soft drinks are
served with the lunch, along with a booklet of recipes. The
five-hour course is $80 per person and limited to a group of eight.
For more information: Villa del Sol, Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo,
Mexico; (888) 389-2645; www.hotelvilladelsol.com.
 &HT;    At Hastings House, each guest's name is hand-lettered on the
door to their room and a personalized greeting card welcomes them.
In the evening, guests receive a personalized dinner menu. Every
morning, a wake-up hamper filled with fresh coffee or tea and
homemade pastries is delivered to the door of their suites. For
more information: Hastings House, 160 Upper Ganges Road, Salt
Spring Island, B.C., Canada V8K 2S2; 800-661-9255;
www.hastingshouse.com.
 &HT;    The Four Seasons Hotel Washington, D.C., has a ``Quiet Room''
for $30 per hour. It's a private, soundproofed getaway where guests
can relax or listen to CDs while sitting in a leather recliner with
built-in massage functions. The room is lit by recessed, adjustable
``mood'' lighting. There's a remote-controlled audiovisual system
as well as a sound machine that can emulate noises like ocean
waves. In addition, a mini-fridge stocked with complimentary
refreshments, hot and cold face towels and a lava lamp are at their
disposal. For more information: The Four Seasons Hotel, 2800
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-819-5053;
www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    An Irish Yogi is what the Fitzpatrick Family Group of Hotels
offers at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel and the Fitzpatrick Grand
Central Hotel. Yogi Paul Dallaghan of Dublin teaches private
Vinyasa-style yoga to guests in their rooms. Sessions must be
arranged 24 hours in advance, and the cost is $80 per hour or $100
for 90 minutes. For more information: Fitzpatrick Hotels, 687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 800-367-7701;
www.fitzpatrickhotels.com.
 &HT;    The Towers at The New York Palace features ``maitre d'etage'' or
butler service. Room service is through Le Cirque 2000, one of New
York's most lauded restaurants, as well as a neighboring Japanese
restaurant, Sushisay. The Towers also has its own concierge, and
guests receive personalized stationery and business cards that
include the number of the fax machine in their room. For more
information: The Towers, 455 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
(800) NY-PALACE.
 &HT;    At the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, golfers can schedule a
massage right on the course. The massage therapist meets the player
at the ninth hole for the massage, but the $90-per-hour charge _
and the massage _ can be split among a foursome. For more
information: The Broadmoor, 1 Lake Ave., Colorado Springs, Colo.
80906; 800-634-7711; www.broadmoor.com.
 &HT;    Aruba Sonesta Resorts has an ``Island Nanny Program'' that
provides a nanny for the duration of the family's stay. The rates
start at $120 per day, and the nanny is on duty from 8:00 a.m. to
midnight for two children. For more information: Aruba Sonesta
Resorts, Orangestad, Aruba; (800) SONESTA; www.arubasonesta.com.
 &HT;    Finally, the 5th Avenue Suites Hotel allows guests to ``Spend
the Night with Doug.'' Ecology-minded guests can request to have a
miniature Douglas Fir, the state tree of Oregon, brought to their
room. Trees that outgrows the hotel will eventually be donated to
Portland's Hoyt Arboretum. For more information: 5th Avenue Suites
Hotel, 506 S.W. Washington, Portland, Ore. 97204; (800) 711-2971;

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 &HT;    This year, many tour companies are including adventure-travel
excursions for the senior set. Here is a sampling.
 &HT;    
 SOUTHWESTERN STYLE  
 &HT;    Interhostel, an international study/travel program for adults
ages 50 and older, is adding six new domestic trips for 2000 _
including two that explore the Southwest and its heritage.
 &HT;    The trips are sponsored by the University of New Hampshire's
Continuing Education Program. Travelers can head for Palm Springs
(April 2 to 7) or Palm Desert, Calif., (April 9 to 14), where they
will learn about the wonderful activities of such organizations as
Animal Advocates for Life.
 &HT;    The Palm Desert program includes a tour of the Wildlife
Ambassadors facility to meet Belgian tigers, a meeting with the
curator scientist of the Palm Springs Desert Museum and a trip to
the Living Desert, a outdoor museum where wild creatures are
rescued and cared for.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs outing will include guided tours of the Agua
Caliente Indian Canyons as well as a ride on the Aerial Tramway.
Depending on the trip you choose, the price is about $830, double
occupancy, without airfare.
 &HT;    Interhostel is also offering a trip to the Butler Wash
Archaeology and Rock Art Service Project in Eastland, Utah, from
April 15 to 21. Tour-goers are given the chance to explore the Comb
Ridge area, which is particularly rich in archaic sites. Here, rock
art dates back as far as 8000 B.C. Participants also learn how to
locate and survey cliff dwellings, learn how to document sites and
participate in lectures and discussions about the ancient people of
the area.
 &HT;    Interhostel requires that travelers be able to hike two to four
miles in hilly canyon land. The price is $935 (no singles), without
airfare.
 &HT;    For more information about Interhostel's travel selections, call

 &HT;    Madonna soundtrack covers world territory
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though its sales hook is Madonna's new dance cover of '70s rock
anthem ``American Pie,'' this soundtrack from the star's latest
movie is more world buffet than a serving of traditional Top 40.
The tunes here are mostly European-flavored, electronic pop and
Afro-Latin music _ light.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 tracks hop from one mood to another like a series of
patients occupying the couch. There's Franco-Spanish
singer-songwriter Manu Chao with the fun-time novelty tune ``Bongo
Bongo,'' a Latin lounge rap that layers a hypnotic chant over a
pogo stick beat. DJ-turned-folk-revivalist Moby mixes pre-1945 folk
melodies with thickly textured keyboards on ``Why Does My Heart
Feel So Bad?'' off his ``Play'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   Four tracks are brand new: Madonna's ``Pie'' and ``Time Stood
Still,'' a Latin-flavored remake of her 1995 hit ``Take a Bow;'' an
updated cover of 10CC's bloated '70s ballad, ``I'm Not In Love,''
by the electronic hip-hop group Olive; and a new song from teen
warbler Christina Aguilera called ``Don't Make Me Love You,'' which
sounds much like every other Mariah Carey rip-off song she has
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   With its radio-friendly, mainstream pop leanings, this is
probably not the album for electronic dance or world music purists,
but it's a great primer on the broadly defined genres for folks
outside the club scene.

 &HT;    `The Best Man' is a joyous occasion
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   In Malcolm D. Lee's often funny, sexy and prickly comedy-drama,
Taye Diggs heads a talented ensemble cast in an outright contender
for one of last year's best date movies: a glossy wedding film
punctuated with soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder,
MeShell Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic
bite.
</P>
<P>
   It's a plot that occasionally digs deep into the intricate
nature of friendship, love and sex among a group of successful
20-somethings gathering for the union of two old college friends.
Many quickly dismissed this movie as a rip-off of ``The Wood,'' the
remember-when, good-times movie that not only had a wedding at its
core but also starred Diggs. But ``Best Man'' focuses far less on
flashbacks and, more than once, provokes the same kind of dramatic
shivers that made Lawrence Kasdan's reunion hit ``The Big Chill''
such a big thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs plays Harper Stewart, the film's title groomsman and an
up-and-coming writer. His steamy new book about a collegian and his
guy and gal pals, is about to get played large on ``Oprah.''
Naturally, Harper's friends _ nicely played by Morris Chestnut, Nia
Long, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun and, especially, Terrence
Howard _ are more than curious about how their lives are portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   One key scene involves a poker game, in which the guys'
requisite male bonding turns into a frank and challenging thesis on
fidelity. It evokes the kind of raw, emotional power you just don't
get in all-jokey relationship films like ``The Story of Us.''

   Michael Penn. Epic. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes the millenium,'' Penn warbles on the first track of
this clever, concise collection of pop ditties. He sounds ready for
it. For sheer catchiness, the singer-songwriter's fourth outing
(hence the title) surpasses even his 1989 debut, ``March,'' which
yielded the irresistible sing-along hit ``No Myth.'' Dipping into
his family's pool of talent _ wife Aimee Mann sings backup on three
tracks, actor-brother Christopher Penn croons on one _ Penn has
fashioned an intricate work that echoes past efforts by fellow
brainy popsters Lindsey Buckingham and Elvis Costello, but with a
new energy. Such songs as ``Lucky One,'' produced by Atlanta's
Brendan O'Brien, and ``Beautiful'' radiate warmth even as Penn's
lyrics explore the uncertainties of love and career. ``I can't
belong to any future,'' Penn insists on ``Footdown,'' which recalls
Costello's ``Imperial Bedroom'' period. But he does, whether he
likes it or not.

   ``Life Before Insanity''

   Gov't Mule. Capricorn Records. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   This Allman Brothers Band splinter group may never entirely step
out of the shadow of Gregg, Dickey &AMP; Co. But on the power trio's
third studio album, Mule makes its biggest leap yet from its
Southern-rock roots to the 1970s metal-rock territory mined by
Mountain, Zeppelin and Wishbone Ash. Unlike the band's last outing
(``Live ... With a Little Help From Our Friends,'' a two-disc set
of extended jams), ``Insanity'' is a collection of concise tunes
that clock in at five to eight minutes each. Yet even within these
truncated songs, the band's signature improvisations are the main
draw.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Warren Haynes is a credible singer-composer, with his
whiskey-cured bark and world-weary lyrics. But his speed-with-soul
fretwork is what elevates Mule's sound. And most vocal passages
here seem to exist only to frame Haynes' stirring solo breaks _ on
everything from restrained acoustic ballads such as ``In My Life''
to full-throttle boogie-rockers like ``Wandering Child'' and the
Lowell George-inspired ``Bad Little Doggie.''

</P>
<P>
   D.I.T.C. stands for the rap collective Digging in the Crates,
but back in 1988 when it released its first album, the term meant
something else. ``Digging in the crates'' was a way of saying that
someone had done some serious hunting in their collection of albums
(often kept in milk crates) to find a certain obscure _ and usually
appropriate _ hip-hop sample. Not that the music was as much of a
concern in this genre as it is now. Then it was all about whether
you could attack the microphone as confidently as KRS-One on ``Drop
It Heavy'' here or say something as cleverly as recently departed
Latino rapper Big Pun on ``Where Ya At.'' And this second, sparely
produced album from D.I.T.C. is a much-needed reminder of those
sorely missed attributes.

 &HT;    Passionate Pumpkins pounce on metal, melody
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crunchy guitar goodness is back.
</P>
<P>
   After 1998's ``Adore,'' a soft, low-key record that was a
commercial and critical disappointment, the Pumpkins thunder back
with an amped-up set of tunes. It's not all head-banging and
rampaging drums, but even in the
</P>
<P>
   quietest moments it feels a lot more like rock 'n' roll than
``Adore.'' Head Pumpkin Billy Corgan never lost his fondness for
'70s metal, and that influence is all over the album, especially in
the thunderous riffs of ``The Everlasting Gaze'' and ``Heavy Metal
Machine.'' When Corgan and fellow guitarist James Iha crank up the
guitars, it rumbles like a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviness is tempered with a nice assortment of hooks and
melodies, and several genuine beauties. ``Wound'' swirls like a
lost Psychedelic Furs gem, while ``Raindrops + Sunshowers'' is
reminiscent of the melodic melancholy of ``1979'' from the Pumpkins
third album, ``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   The dense wall of sound that characterized the band's 1993
masterwork ``Siamese Dream'' has been opened up. There's still a
lot going on, but the music gets a little more room to breathe.
</P>

   Corgan and company seem fired up and ready to take on the world

Dream.''

 &HT;    WHAT'S IN A NAME? FOR WOMEN IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, IT'S 'OVA'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scan the entertainment sections of any Czech magazine or
newspaper and you'll find Julia Robertsova and Meryl Streepova, not
Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   In Czech and other Slavic languages, the suffix ``ova'' is added
to the last names of all females. It's an ending long-ingrained in
the vernacular that quite literally means ``belonging to'' the
male, as in belonging to a woman's father or husband. (In English,
``ova'' is plural for ``ovum,'' a female egg cell.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any American feminist wince. But Europe _
and especially Central Europe _ has long fought against
American-style political correctness, a term often derided as
describing a tortured sensitivity resulting in ridiculous changes
to the language.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, even in post-Communist countries like
the Czech Republic, meaning the use of the suffix ``ova'' may soon
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation recently proposed by the Czech Republic's Ministry
of Interior would enable a woman to remove the suffix from her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, the legislation is expected
to pass and could take effect by the end of the year. They insist
the impetus for the proposal is not a rise in complaints, but is
simply the result of a changing world in which women are seeking
more control.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Kavkova, who runs Relocation Management International, a
Prague-based firm that helps companies relocate to the Czech
Republic, said some women have started to consider the use of
``ova'' demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they use it reluctantly because they accept it as part of
life here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, language is not as scrutinized in Europe as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, people who deliver the mail are still
called postmen, even if they are women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though British Prime Minister Tony Blair often speaks
out in favor of women's rights, no one bats an eye that the female
members of Parliament belonging to his Labor Party are popularly
referred to in the press as ``Blair's babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Czech Republic is even more traditional than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, the kind of country in which high-level
female involvement in business or government is rarely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic there are no women in the Cabinet, whereas
in Sweden, 12 of 20 Cabinet positions are occupied by women.
</P>
<P>
   But many post-Communist countries are introducing laws these
days to put them in line with the European Union, which they aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, legislation to combat sexual harassment
was recently proposed following the publishing of a study by the
daily, Lidove Noviny, indicating that almost half of the country's
working women had been sexually harassed in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Zuzana Roithova, one of just nine female members in the
81-member Senate, said Czech women have been slow to push for more
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family life is more important to many than their
rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women right's advocates said it's no surprise then that the
Czech government is just now considering giving women the option of
removing the suffix ``ova'' from their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not so popular in post-Communist countries as it
is elsewhere,'' said Jirina Ciklova, founder of the Center for
Gender Studies in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this new proposal is a positive one and that, as a
result, many women, at least many of those from the younger
generation, will change their names,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ciklova said, however, the change may not go over so well with
older women, who favor the suffix for making it immediately clear
whether someone is male or female.
</P>
<P>
   Even she agreed that some Czech names just won't sound right
without the ``ova.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she pondered, ``Can you imagine saying Martina
Navratil, instead of Martina Navratilova?'' She certainly can't.
</P>

 &HT;    Bread pudding _ admirably adaptable
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cookbook author Carole Lalli is so convinced of the ease of
making a bread pudding she declares only the ``seriously inept or
scatterbrained'' fail to produce a decent one.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to go that far, having had my share of failures
with ``foolproof'' recipes. But bread pudding is darn easy. Tear
some bread in chunks, mix up a custard and pour it over and add
some sweet or savory ingredients. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things to keep in mind while making the recipes
below. While they call for specific kinds of bread, feel free to
use what you've got. A mixture of breads works, too. I often have
whole wheat slices left over and find they mix well with white in
many bread puddings.
</P>
<P>
   You can tailor a bread pudding to your personal taste, though
you may have to prepare a recipe by the book the first time. Then,
if it's too moist, cut back on the custard next time. Too dry?
Double the custard. Don't like raisins? Throw in your favorite
dried fruit instead. Or chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Most recipes allow for 15 minutes of soaking time before baking.
This is important for a moist pudding. And most cook slowly between
300 and 350 degrees. If your oven runs hot, turn the heat down.
</P>
<P>
   Lalli, author of ``Yesterday's Bread'' (HarperPerennial,
$12.95), highly recommends baking bread puddings in a water bath.
To do that, place the baking pan in a larger pan and fill with
water halfway up the pudding pan. This will produce a tender
texture. But some actually prefer it a bit crusty. So let your
taste be the guide.

   New Orleans Bread Pudding
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutesResting time: 15 minutesCooking
time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   This is it _ the classic but versatile bread pudding recipe from
the New Orleans School of Cooking that I've used for years. Try it
once as written, then have fun improvising. My favorite is to add
about 2/3 cup chocolate chips. You can also add pineapple or other
fruit chunks, coconut and your favorite nuts. Our stylist, Mary Ann
Clayton, added dried apricots. Let your imagination run wild. I
usually use only 6 cups of bread cubes so it will be more custardy.
The sauce is good enough to drink!
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup whiskey or bourbon
</P>
<P>
   6 to 7 cups lightly packed bite-size cubes of day-old French or
Italian bread
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Whiskey Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks, lightly whisked
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons whiskey or bourbon
</P>
<P>
   Combine the raisins and 1/3 cup whiskey in a small bowl. Preheat
the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the bread in the baking dish and scatter the pecans over
it. When the raisins have absorbed most of the whiskey, scatter
them and any remaining whiskey over the bread. Whisk together the
eggs, milk, half-and-half, granulated sugar, butter, vanilla,
cinnamon and nutmeg, and pour the custard mixture evenly over the
bread. Lightly pat the bread down into the custard. Let the mixture
sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then stir and pat
back down again. A bit of the bread should remain just above the
custard. Bake the pudding for 50 to 55 minutes, until the pudding
is slightly puffed and golden brown, with a few crunchy spots on
top.
</P>
<P>
   While the pudding bakes, prepare the sauce. Combine the butter
and confectioners' sugar in a medium saucepan and warm over medium
heat until the butter and sugar melt together. Stir 2 tablespoons
of the butter-sugar mixture into the egg yolks, then pour it back
into the rest of the butter-sugar mixture and whisk until combined,
about another minute. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in
the whiskey. The sauce will be somewhat thin, but it thickens as it
cools.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the pudding warm, spooned onto individual plates, with a
few tablespoons of the sauce poured over each. Pass the remaining
sauce separately.

   This quickly prepared dish is excellent and beautiful, with the
yellow corn bread, red tomatoes and green jalapenos, green onions
and cilantro. It's one of several savory bread puddings found in
Carole Lalli's ``Yesterday's Bread'' (HarperPerennial, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   1 (8-inch) square stale corn bread
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions, including 1-inch green tops
(about 6)
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 minced jalapeno peppers
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped, plus additional for
garnish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   Cut the corn bread into strips about 1/2 inch wide by 2 inches
long. (If the bread is not dry to the touch, place it on a baking
sheet and put it in a 300-degree oven for 5-10 minutes, until it is
dry but not browned.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a low simmer and keep
it warm over low heat. In a separate pan, melt the butter. Add the
green onions and saute until they soften but do not take on color;
add the jalapeno peppers and cook briefly. Stir in the flour and
cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the broth. When the
broth is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth, place it
over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened,
about 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and season to
taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter or oil a baking dish about 9 by 13 inches and
line the bottom with the strips of corn bread. Distribute the
tomatoes and 1/2 cup cilantro over the bread. Carefully pour the
sauce over and sprinkle on the cheese. Let the pudding sit for
about 15 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the sauce, then place
it in the oven. Bake the pudding for 30-45 minutes, until the top
is golden brown and bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   The pudding will still be slightly saucy; let it rest for about
10 minutes, then serve, garnished with additional cilantro if
desired, warm or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, the pudding can be briefly reheated in the oven.

   1/4 cup pear eau de vie such as Poire William or pear nectar
</P>
<P>
   3 medium-ripe but firm Bosc or d'Anjou pears (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   6 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   6 slices challah or brioche bread or 10 to 12 slices French
baguette, about 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Place the cranberries in a small bowl and pour the eau de vie
over them. Peel, core and slice the pears into six pieces each.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and, when it
ceases foaming, add 1/4 cup sugar and the pears along with the eau
de vie and cranberries. Cook, stirring gently, until the sugar
melts and the mixture is warm.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the eggs, then whisk in the remaining sugar, half-and-half
and vanilla. Lightly butter a baking dish and line it with bread,
overlapping the slices slightly. Distribute the pear mixture over
the bread, then pour the custard over. Let the pudding rest for
about 15 minutes, then set the dish in a water bath. Bake the
pudding for about 45 minutes, until it is set but not dry. Serve
warm or at room temperature, dusted with confectioners' sugar. _

   Mexican-style bread pudding is different. It combines sweet and
savory ingredients and uses a syrup of brown sugar and spices
instead of a milk-based custard. Yes, it sounds unusual, but it's
most delicious and will be especially popular with peanut lovers.
And aren't most Georgians?
</P>
<P>
   3 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   5 (3-inch) cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons anise seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 loaves French bread or 18 to 20 slices good-quality sandwich
bread
</P>
<P>
   1 stick ( 1/4 pound) unsalted butter, melted (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted shelled peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shredded white cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   20 colaciones (candied peanuts such as honey-roasted or
Planter's ``sweet and crunchy'')
</P>
<P>
   Make the syrup: In a small pot, combine the brown sugar, cloves,
cinnamon sticks and anise seeds with 8 cups water. Bring to a boil
and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sugar
dissolves. Reduce heat and simmer vigorously, uncovered, until the
liquid reduces to 4 cups, about 35-40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the bread: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease two
cookie sheets. Arrange the bread on the cookie sheets and bake
until golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Using a pastry brush,
coat or drizzle the bread with melted butter, if desired. Turn oven
down to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the casserole: Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Place
a layer of bread on the bottom. Slowly pour 1 cup of syrup evenly
over the bread layer and allow the bread to soak up the syrup.
Sprinkle with a third of the shelled peanuts, a third of the
raisins and a third of the cheese. Repeat the layers twice, ending
with cheese. Pour the remaining syrup over the casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees. During the
last 10 minutes, uncover the casserole and top it with the
colaciones, if desired. _ From ``A Gracious Plenty: Recipes and

   Chocolate and bread make a beautiful pair, so it's no surprise
that there are numerous versions of chocolate bread pudding. But we
loved this one from Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split
</P>
<P>
   3 cinnamon sticks (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 day-old loaf brioche or good-quality white bread (about 1
pound)
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped, plus 1/2 ounce
or 1/4 cup shavings for garnish
</P>
<P>
   8 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 (8-ounce) container creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   Place the cream, milk, vanilla seeds and pod and cinnamon
sticks, if using, in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove
from heat, cover with plastic and let sit for 30 minutes to infuse
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the brioche into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice into
quarters, setting aside the rounded top pieces. Fill a 9-by-12-inch
gratin dish or 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish with the remaining
pieces of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Return milk mixture to a boil, remove from heat and discard
vanilla pod and cinnamon sticks. Add chocolate and whisk until
smooth. Whisk egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl. Very slowly pour
chocolate mixture into egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly, until
fully combined.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly pour half the chocolate mixture over the bread, making
sure all bread is thoroughly soaked. Arrange the reserved bread
tops on top in a decorative pattern, and press firmly so bottom
layer of bread absorbs chocolate mixture. Spoon remaining chocolate
mixture over bread until completely covered and all cracks are
filled. Place a piece of plastic wrap over dish, and press down to
soak bread thoroughly. Remove plastic, wipe edges of the dish with
a damp towel, and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place dish in a larger pan, and fill with hot water halfway up
the sides of the dish. Bake until set, about 35 minutes. Cool on a
rack for 15 minutes before serving. Whisk creme fraiche until soft
peaks form. Serve pudding warm garnished with creme fraiche and
chocolate shavings. _ From: ``Favorite Comfort Food: The Best of

   &QR;  ``Random Hearts (R) _ A meandering mystery/drama/romance that
never hits the right groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin
Scott Thomas a congresswoman who discover that their spouses, both
killed in a plane crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing
romance never taps beneath the surface. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stigmata'' (R) _ Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of
``The Exorcist,'' ``The Omen,'' etc., stars Gabriel Byrne as a
Vatican investigator sent to examine a young woman (Patricia
Arquette) who's showing signs of the story of us, i.e., the wounds
suffered by Christ on the cross. Unfortunately, despite some early
good scenes and a decent performance by Byrne, the movie prefers
sensationalism to making sense. It's enough to make you long for
the good ol' days of pea soup and spinning heads. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Suburbans'' (R) _ A bland project that can't decide
whether it's a music-biz satire or a midlife-crisis comedy-drama,
this concerns a one-hit wonder teenage band from 1981 (named the
Suburbans) that gets rediscovered by a music industry executive,
played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who wants to market their
retro-music to the ``post-boomer, pre-millennial demographic.''
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Best Laid Plans'' (R) _ Reese Witherspoon, Alessandro Nivola
and Josh Brolin work hard, but only end up proving how difficult it
is to pull off modern noir. They're caught in a twisty plot
involving a charge of statutory rape, false identity, betrayal and
debt. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly implausible as it
nears an ending that's tricky, but a little too pat. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Love Is the Devil'' (unrated) _ Derek Jacobi stars as
Francis Bacon in this rivetingly dark, fractured drama about the
painter's sadomasochistic relationship with a young burglar (Daniel
Craig). Often hard to watch, and more of a study than a portrait,
the movie is impressive in its way of finding a cinematic
equivalent for the painter's grotesque work. Grade: B+

 &HT;    Bread pudding: Humble or jazzed up, these custardy delights have
stood the test of time
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are telltale signs of a favorite recipe: If on a notecard
or piece of paper, it's yellowed and a bit crumpled. Usually, a few
notes have been added to reflect tinkering. And there are age spots
where years of joyful alchemy have splashed onto the page.
</P>
<P>
   I have such a recipe I like to pull out at this time of year. I
acquired it on a college road trip in 1984, when I wandered into
the New Orleans School of Cooking. My companions quickly informed
me that a cooking class was not their idea of living it up in the
French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But even they'd have to admit I came away with the best souvenir
_ cooking school owner Joe Cahn's recipe for bread pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 16 years, I've made the sweet, sopping stuff
straight up, with raisins and plenty of whiskey sauce. And I've
tried many variations _ with pineapple and coconut, ``pina colada''
style; with pumpkin puree and pecans; and with loads of chocolate
chips. Sometimes, it's rum sauce instead of whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a more happy marriage of frugal and
festive. And though the revelers in the French Quarter may prefer
King Cake this week, my favorite Fat Tuesday indulgence has to be
bread pudding.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's a food that has comforted through the ages. Just
read this 1747 description of ``boiled loaf'' that Richard Sax
found while researching bread puddings for his book ``Classic Home
Desserts'' (Chapters, $29.95):
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a Penny-loaf (ordinary bread, milled from coarse flour),
pour over it a half a Pint of Milk boiling hot, cover it close, let
it stand till it has soaked up the milk then tye it up in a cloth
and boil it a quarter of an hour, '' wrote Hannah Glasse of London
in ``The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy.'' ``When it is done,
lay it in your Dish, and pour melted Butter over it, and throw
Sugar all over, a Spoonful of Wine, or Rosewater, as well in the
Butter, or Juice of a Seville Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, a whole class of desserts that use bread
crumbs, chunks or slices, such as queen's pudding, summer puddings
and some types of charlottes, explains Alan Davidson in the
``Oxford Companion to Food'' (Oxford University Press, $60.)
</P>
<P>
   But the simplest has always been taking stale bread, soaking it
in milk, sweetening it by one means or another and baking the
result. Versions of this dessert can be traced back to medieval
``sops'' in Europe and to the countrysides of the Middle East and
India centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt has survived because the central ingredient _ stale
bread _ has never gone away. What family today doesn't find itself
with a considerable bread supply _ sliced bread for sandwiches,
buns for hot dogs and burgers, loaves of French or Italian bread
for dinner. Inevitably, some of it goes stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take all of that bread and throw it in a dish and put
a custard on it and it will be good,'' said Carole Lalli, author of
``Yesterday's Bread'' (HarperPerennial, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Slices of white and wheat sandwich bread work great. So does
fancy brioche, panettone and even stale cake. All work beautifully
as sponges for rich custards of milk and eggs or, as in the Mexican
tradition, syrups of brown sugar and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Fillings also can vary, from sweet to savory. Wild mushrooms and
leftover boiled potatoes (cut into chunks) mix well. Inside we give
one of Lalli's recipes, sure to be useful to many a Southerner,
using corn bread and tomatoes.

   A classic New Orleans bread pudding, coming from the rustic
French and English traditions, simply has raisins as a sweetener.
But dried apricots, cherries or cranberries are delicious. So are
fruits like pears, apples and peaches. And, of course, chocolate is
divine.
</P>
<P>
   The classic New Orleans sauce is a buttery whiskey concoction,
but it can be altered as well. Rum is nice. Kahlua is good.
Basically, the whole dessert can be modified to use what's on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Try some of the recipes inside, like Martha Stewart's sinfully
delicious chocolate bread pudding or Lalli's cranberry/pear combo.
And, of course, we included Joe Cahn's recipe _ that gem from my
first trip to the French Quarter. It's a classic that will be
friendly to whatever is in the pantry. One bite, and we promise the
good times will roll.

 &HT;    Cake gives visitors the royal treatment
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lois Fenderson of Prineville, Ore., came through just in time
with a Mardi Gras King Cake for Jane Johnson of Powder Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet egg bread is as much a part of the pre-Lent party as
strings of cheap purple, gold and green beads _ festival colors
repeated in tinted sugar sprinkled on top of the cakes.
</P>
<P>
   This version, from the cookbook ``Jambalaya'' by the Junior
League of New Orleans, calls for a cinnamon filling and a
sprinkling of sugars on an egg wash before baking. Others, like the
one on the front of this section now available from la Madeleine
stores, are frosted first, and then decorated with tinted sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bakers always put in a plastic baby, toy or bean to symbolize
the baby Jesus. Find it in your slice and you'll be treated as king
or queen for the day, but you'll also be obliged to buy or make the
next King Cake or even to host the next party.
</P>
<P>
   Bon chance!
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras King Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 cakes, about 16 slices each
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   Rising time: 2 1/2-3 hours, divided
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the cakes:
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) butter, divided use
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup evaporated skim milk (99 percent fat free)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided use
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 envelopes dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   6 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted, divided use
</P>
<P>
   For the topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar, divided and colored (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 plastic babies ( 3/4 inch), trinkets or beans
</P>
<P>
   For the cakes: In a small pot, place 1 stick butter, milk, 1/3
cup sugar and salt. Stir occasionally over low heat until butter
melts. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons sugar, yeast and
warm water. Let stand until foaming, about 5 to 10 minutes. Beat
eggs into the foaming yeast, then add the cooled milk mixture and
the grated rinds. Stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, reserving 1
cup flour on the kneading surface. Knead dough until it is smooth,
about 5 to 10 minutes. Grease large mixing bowl with 1 tablespoon
butter. Place dough in prepared bowl, turning once to grease the
top of the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double,
about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: Mix brown and white sugars with cinnamon and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   When dough has doubled, punch it down and divide in half. On a
floured surface, roll one half into a rectangle about 30 by 15
inches. Brush with half the melted butter and cut into three
lengthwise strips. Sprinkle half the sugar-cinnamon mixture on the
strips, leaving a 1-inch lengthwise strip free for sealing. Fold
each strip lengthwise toward the center, sealing the seam. You now
have three 30-inch strips with sugar mixture enclosed in each.
Braid the three strips, working from the center, and make a circle
by joining the ends. Repeat with the other half of the dough and
filling. Place each cake on a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet, cover
with a damp cloth and let rise until double, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. When doubled, brush each cake with
beaten egg and sprinkle top with colored sugars, alternating
colors. Bake 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from pans immediately so the sugar won't harden. While
warm, place 1 plastic baby, trinket or bean in each cake from
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To tint sugar, separate into thirds to make yellow, purple
and green. Drop food coloring into each 1/3 cup sugar, mixing until
desired color is reached. To speed mixing and keep from getting too
moist, sugar may be tinted in the food processor.

 &HT;    WHAT'S IN A NAME? FOR WOMEN IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, IT'S 'OVA'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scan the entertainment sections of any Czech magazine or
newspaper and you'll find Julia Robertsova and Meryl Streepova, not
Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   In Czech and other Slavic languages, the suffix ``ova'' is added
to the last names of all females. It's an ending long-ingrained in
the vernacular that quite literally means ``belonging to'' the
male, as in belonging to a woman's father or husband. (In English,
``ova'' is plural for ``ovum,'' a female egg cell.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any American feminist wince. But Europe _
and especially Central Europe _ has long fought against
American-style political correctness, a term often derided as
describing a tortured sensitivity resulting in ridiculous changes
to the language.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, even in post-Communist countries like
the Czech Republic, meaning the use of the suffix ``ova'' may soon
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation recently proposed by the Czech Republic's Ministry
of Interior would enable a woman to remove the suffix from her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, the legislation is expected
to pass and could take effect by the end of the year. They insist
the impetus for the proposal is not a rise in complaints, but is
simply the result of a changing world in which women are seeking
more control.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Kavkova, who runs Relocation Management International, a
Prague-based firm that helps companies relocate to the Czech
Republic, said some women have started to consider the use of
``ova'' demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they use it reluctantly because they accept it as part of
life here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, language is not as scrutinized in Europe as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, people who deliver the mail are still
called postmen, even if they are women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though British Prime Minister Tony Blair often speaks
out in favor of women's rights, no one bats an eye that the female
members of Parliament belonging to his Labor Party are popularly
referred to in the press as ``Blair's babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Czech Republic is even more traditional than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, the kind of country in which high-level
female involvement in business or government is rarely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic there are no women in the Cabinet, whereas
in Sweden, 12 of 20 Cabinet positions are occupied by women.
</P>
<P>
   But many post-Communist countries are introducing laws these
days to put them in line with the European Union, which they aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, legislation to combat sexual harassment
was recently proposed following the publishing of a study by the
daily, Lidove Noviny, indicating that almost half of the country's
working women had been sexually harassed in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Zuzana Roithova, one of just nine female members in the
81-member Senate, said Czech women have been slow to push for more
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family life is more important to many than their
rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women right's advocates said it's no surprise then that the
Czech government is just now considering giving women the option of
removing the suffix ``ova'' from their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not so popular in post-Communist countries as it
is elsewhere,'' said Jirina Ciklova, founder of the Center for
Gender Studies in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this new proposal is a positive one and that, as a
result, many women, at least many of those from the younger
generation, will change their names,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ciklova said, however, the change may not go over so well with
older women, who favor the suffix for making it immediately clear
whether someone is male or female.
</P>
<P>
   Even she agreed that some Czech names just won't sound right
without the ``ova.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she pondered, ``Can you imagine saying Martina
Navratil, instead of Martina Navratilova?'' She certainly can't.

&HT;     WHEN INTERVIEWING JOB APPLICANTS, KEEP `WHY' IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you're a boss preparing for a round of job
interviews, there is one question you should focus on more than any
other: Why?
</P>
<P>
   No, not ``Why do you want to work for us?'' or ``Why did you
leave your last employer?'' This ``why?'' is not a question to ask
your applicants, but to ask yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you base so much of your company's future on an hour or
two of conversation? The job interview has been the standard
practice for decades, but in this era of downsized work forces and
overstressed employees, hiring mistakes are even costlier than they
used to be. And the job interview needs to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to look back 100 years from now and look
at interviews like we look on gaslights or silent movies or Model T
Fords,'' said Pierre Mornell, the psychiatrist who wrote ``Hiring
Smart: How to Predict Winners &AMP; Losers in the Incredibly Expensive
People-Reading Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers realize this, sort of. They're asking more questions
about how the candidate has behaved in the past, such as, ``Tell me
about a time you had a problem with a co-worker and how you
resolved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two cottage industries have even sprung up, with one set of
books offering tips on how to answer job interview questions, and
another set of books offering tips on how employers can surprise
workers with questions that aren't covered in the first set of
books.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has stopped to ask: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, an interview measures chemistry, poise and communication
skills, but mostly what it measures is the ability to do well in a
job interview. So someone who goes job hunting every six months
will probably be great at it. But is that a skill you really need _
or want?
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry is certainly crucial, but you'll probably decide in
the first five minutes whether the applicant would be a good fit,
even if all the two of you do is sing ``Kumbaya'' together.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, relying too much on chemistry can backfire. If you and
the applicant have a mutual friend or went to the same high school
or share a particular hobby, you might feel an instant connection
that leads you to overlook a weakness. You might also penalize
those who are different from you because you don't have that same
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to your gut feeling, certainly, but don't let your brain
take a holiday. Remember that con artists excel at chemistry, too.
</P>
<P>
   Poise is also important, but interviews give it more emphasis
than it deserves. Suppose you ask that chestnut, ``What's your
biggest weakness?''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants familiar with job interviews will know what to do: Be
as insincere as is humanly possible, coming up with some innocuous
weakness or explaining how you've overcome a past weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose your applicant sputters and has trouble answering,
or says something lik, ``Well, you know, I really should work more
on my computer skills.'' He flunked the poise test. But you'll
probably give that answer more weight than it deserves when you
decide whom to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking quickly is a good skill _ especially if you're in
something like customer service or public safety _ but how
important is it really for your workers? Do most problems have to
be solved instantly, or can you think about them overnight? Do you
need a marketing plan in 15 minutes, or in 15 days?
</P>
<P>
   Does your hiring process reflect that? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me about a time you had a problem with a co-worker and
how you resolved it,'' for example, could be a useful question. But
what types of people are going to have an answer to it on the tip
of their tongues? Those who have done a lot of job interviews or
those who have had such a big conflict that it still stands out in
their mind, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make them better applicants than everyone else?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you give applicants some questions like that a few days
before the interview. Tell them you will ask those questions during
the interview or ask them to write their answers and bring them to
the interview. You'll still be measuring communication skills _
even written communication, if that's important _ but you'll get
more thoughtful answers.
</P>
<P>
   To protect yourself from phoniness, try to see samples of the
applicant's work. Sometimes, too, you can give an assignment before
or after the interview, such as preparing a marketing plan for a
product.
</P>
<P>
   Mornell also suggests asking applicants to call back at a
specific day and time after the interview. That shows
responsibility and attention to detail. (My two cents: If they call
back at the right time and you already have their thank you note in
hand, you may just have a winner.)
</P>
<P>
   All these things will put the interview into perspective, and
you still won't be ignoring chemistry and communication skills. You
should save some surprises for the interview to measure poise, but
use questions that demonstrate work-related skills rather than
job-hunting ones.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite interview question sounds flaky: ``What's your
favorite Web site?'' I ask it mostly to weed people out; if you're
in the working world and you haven't tried the Web by now, you sure
don't seem to have much in the way of initiative or curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   I also like it because there is no ``right'' answer. There are
few absolutely right answers in the world of work, but that
shouldn't stop you from asking the right questions. And make sure
one of them is always: Why?
</P>

 &HT;    SHOWTIME!
 &HT;    Wrestling fans know what they want and the industry knows how to
throw a show
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 15 minutes before a live taping of the World
Wrestling Federation's ``Raw is War'' event in Atlanta and the
faithful can barely handle the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to rock,'' said Mickey Davies of Fulton County, Ga.
``I want to see my boys. Whoooohooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Davies, 19, is not the only one fidgeting in his seat. The crowd
of 28,000 is waiting to go nuts. They want to crank it up. They
know what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   The house lights go down. The Dome erupts. It's so loud you
can't hear the person yelling next to you.
</P>
<P>
   Handmade signs of all different shapes and colors are hoisted in
the air as if they were colors raised in battle.
</P>
<P>
   It's show time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw's'' heavy metal theme music blares from the arena's sound
system. The crowd screams as images of their favorite wrestlers are
flashed on a giant television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dads put children to their shoulders to improve the view for the
little ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to see this,'' one dad says, hoisting a preschooler
above his head. ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   What would make thousands of people go bananas for a sporting
event whose outcome the spectators know has been predetermined?
</P>
<P>
   It's all about the show, baby!
</P>
<P>
   The head honchos of this pile-driving sports entertainment
industry know what the people want and seem to respond to fan's
desires better than the folks at the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB.
</P>
<P>
   With soap opera-style storylines, good villains, sex appeal,
explosions and laser effects, today's professional wrestling has
become the new American theater.
</P>
<P>
   WWF, the Stamford, Conn.-based company, has generated hundreds
of millions of dollars in revenue and its two weekly TV programs
attract millions of viewers. The stars of the WWF are known
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities and sports stars can't even resist these events.
Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman have entered the ring and actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger recently got into the act during a WWF
``Smackdown!'' At the ``Raw'' show, Atlanta Falcons star running
back Jamal Anderson and rapper/producer/record company executive
Jermaine Dupri were trying to figure out where they could sit
without being mobbed by fans. They didn't want to answer a
reporter's questions about their love for wrestling, but Anderson
did snap photos with his fans. Their group ended up watching the
matches near the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have as close to a full house as you can get in
here,'' said Adam Hopkins of WWF Entertainment Inc. about the
Atlanta venue.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, there is no tension.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers _ in different stages of dress _ mill about. Some are
trying to break a sweat before their match, while others joke with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   At a table, a couple of seamstresses mend several colorful
outfits. If you're a wrestler, you don't want to lose your Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   During the preliminary matches, the crowd is subdued. Fans walk
around and talk to each other during matches. A few bouts involve
wrestlers with a name, but the early bouts are usually for the
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a chance for the guys (wrestlers) to tryout,''
said Hopkins. ``When we go on the air, they'll (the fans) get a
show.''
</P>
<P>
   And that they do.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the drama of a Broadway play, an evening with the
WWF unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The hated Triple H enters the ring and is meet with a chorus of
boos. He and his ``wife,'' Stephanie McMahon, daughter of WWF
founder and CEO Vince McMahon, bask in every negative comment.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, the lights go out, and the entrance music for the man
most of fans came to see starts playing. A woman screams, ``Oh my
God, here he comes.''
</P>
<P>
   As planned, at exactly 9:04 p.m., the Rock _ better known as the
``people's champion'' _ enters the Dome. Hundreds of fans rush to
the stage to take his photograph or just to get a closer look.
Security officers in yellow jackets do a great job of keeping
everyone in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   One woman declares, ``he's the most beautiful man on earth.''
Now that's something to live up to.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock, however, doesn't disappoint. ``Finally, the Rock has
come to Atlanta,'' He bellows.
</P>
<P>
   The fans chant. ``Rock. Rock. Rock. Rock!'' He has them in the
palm of his hand and he doesn't even have to get in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Four guys from Conyers, Ga., Rich Cannon, 28, Jordan Canon, 17,
Mark Jones, 16 and Alex Smith, 16, each hold up silver letters that
spell, R-O-C-K.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love this, '' said Rich Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling industry has been criticized for its violent and
misogynistic storylines and characters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta show, the Godfather _in full pimp attire _
entered the ring with a dozen scantily-clad women and asked the
crowd to ride the ``ho train.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana University and the TV program ``Inside Edition''
recently surveyed 50 episodes of the USA network's Monday night
fixture ``Raw'' between January 1998 and February 1999. Researchers
found 1,658 instances of crotch grabbing, 128 simulated sexual
activities, 157 flippings of the finger, 47 instances of simulated
satanic activity, and 42 cases of simulated drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Fans don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Jon Weaver, 20, of Athens, Ga. ``It's
the Rock and the hos.''
</P>
<P>
   What a show.

   BOSTON _ There's a new section in the Toronto Raptors game
notes. It's called ``Time Changes.'' The Raptors have been forced
to make some scheduling adjustments lately, something they're not
accustomed to doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the Raptors were switched to a national game on NBC
to spotlight and showcase Vince Carter. He then went out and set a
franchise record by scoring 51 points in a 1-point win over the
Suns. That snapped the previous franchise record of 47 held by,
yup, Carter. That one stood for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC already has decided to pick up the Raptors-Timberwolves game
in prime time March 26. The Toronto game next Monday in Portland
has been moved to accommodate TNT. The TV basketball folks are only
a part of the rush.
</P>
<P>
   Carter already has done Letterman. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of
Greater Boston has arranged for a Nantucket teenager to visit with
Carter this week and play some one-on-one after attending a Raptors
practice.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, the Celtics will get him twice in the next three
days: Wednesday in Boston and Friday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his performance in the Slam Dunk competition during
All-Star weekend _ ``It put me on the map,'' Carter acknowledged _
and the explosion eight days later against Phoenix, Carter has been
hot. As in Jordan. In the Raptors' first home game after the
All-Star Game, the penultimate line of ``Oh Canada!'' was amended
from ``Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee'' to ``Oh Vince
Carter, you are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the current Sports Illustrated cover boy. He's the NBA
Player of the Week for the second time this season. He is among the
top five scorers in the league, the top vote-getter for the
All-Star team (fans), the reigning Rookie of the Year. He's an
attention grabber on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently if he was surprised by all the hoopla, Carter
said, ``I'm overwhelmed. It's happening so fast. I have the ability
to play in this league and to be where I am. I just didn't think it
would happen so fast . . . I try to make it as easy as possible.
The guys expect me to contribute and give 100 percent to the team,
regardless of Letterman or All-Star Weekend. I take a valiant
effort to focus on what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already the latest in a long line of Next Jordans. He
shares an alma mater with Michael _ North Carolina _ as well as an
ability to play above the rim and to dunk, spectacularly. In
talking about his Make-A-Wish meeting with Carter, 13-year-old
Michael Ferreira of Nantucket said Tuesday, ``I've liked him for
about a year. I like his dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carter can do other stuff that you don't see on
``SportsCenter.'' He leads Toronto in steals. He's second in
assists and third in blocked shots and rebounds. He's put Toronto
on the NBA map and made the Raptors must-see basketball. Fans in
that hockey-mad city have filled the Air Canada Centre to capacity
nine times. Jordan did that for a moribund Chicago franchise, too.
</P>
<P>
   And, Rick Pitino observed, Carter already can do something
Jordan couldn't do at a similar age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, the only way you could play Michael was to play off
him and hope he would miss,'' Pitino said. ``Then he became a very
good outside shooter. This young man (Carter) is becoming a better
outside shooter earlier on in his career. He's shooting the three.
There are so many different ways that he can hurt you . . . You
have to concentrate on him because obviously he's capable, as he
did the other night, of getting 51 points. You have to concentrate
on him because he's capable of having an unbelievable game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics know all about Carter. They were witness to what
many felt was his Coming Out Party last year in Toronto March 7,
when he dropped 26 on Paul Pierce, then the presumptive leader for
Rookie of the Year, in a 105-92 Toronto victory. There was no
stopping him the rest of the abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   But they've held him in check this season in taking both games
from the Raptors. Carter was an Iversonian 8 of 28 in a 94-90 loss
to the Celtics Jan. 19 in Boston and a Walkerian 3 of 12 in the
season-opening 103-90 loss to the Celtics in Toronto. That is the
one blemish on Carter's resume; his team isn't that good.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Vince, All-The-Time stuff started after the
All-Star Game, the Raptors have managed to lose to Denver and
Dallas at home and are playing .500 basketball. They are in a pack
of conference wannabes right now, although they have beaten the
Knicks twice since the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be looking for payback against Boston. Calbert Cheaney,
who hasn't played a almost three weeks, will draw the unenviable
task of guarding Carter out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney has had other things on his mind since he last played.
His wife delivered a baby son Tuesday morning after a complicated,
difficult pregnancy. He didn't go west with the Celtics and he
wasn't at Monday's game against the Mavericks. He'll be there
Wednesday, but only as the first of many foils of the man everyone
wants to see these days.

<P>
   RICHLAND, N.J. _ ``How's Jewish Jordan doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The query was repeated over and again by many who walked into
the dimly lit gym late. The people were of all races, colors, ages,
and gender. They uttered it, and then they scanned the court,
eventually homing in on the lanky player whose yarmulke was
fastened to his closely cropped, fire-red hair.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Tamir Goodman touched the ball _ which, to the chagrin
of many in the crowd, wasn't often in the first half _ much of the
chatter stopped. Whenever the 18-year-old player, an Orthodox Jew
from Baltimore, let the basketball fly, someone in the crowd
uttered the moniker again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get Jewish Jordan the ball more.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd at the Atlantic Cape Classic game knew him as
the high school basketball player who made national headlines for
his Division 1 skills and his commitment to a life of Torah
observance _ notably, his refusal to play on Shabbat (the Jewish
Sabbath, sundown Friday to sundown Saturday), when many college
games are held.
</P>
<P>
   His notoriety grew when the University of Maryland offered him a
scholarship halfway into his junior season. When the school's
interest waned, Goodman opted for America East member Towson (Md.)
University and cited friction with the Maryland coaching staff over
his unwillingness to play on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented attempt to help a player observe his
beliefs, the America East, at the request of Towson and with the
concurrence of league members, moved Towson's league games next
season away from the period of the Jewish Sabbath. The issue will
be revisited each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get him the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman began playing at Talmudical Academy, a yeshiva in the
Baltimore area that has fewer than 100 students, where he averaged
35.4 points, 7.5 assists, and 6.5 rebounds per game. Wanting to
improve his level of competition, he transferred to Takoma Academy,
a Seventh Day Adventist school in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his move, many coaches at the major college level _
Maryland included _ question whether the 6-foot-3-inch, 170-pound
player can compete at their level.
</P>
<P>
   Over the latter portion of the second quarter of Takoma's game,
Goodman made believers of most everyone in the crowd. He scored 13
of his team's 15 points in 2:02 _ on three consecutive NBA-range
3-pointers, a nifty pass fake and layup, and a steal and finger
roll that set off a high-fiving, fist-clenching frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks dropped the first word from the nickname, and for a
moment, it didn't matter whether he topped his crown with a
yarmulke or turban or headband or nothing at all. On a court that,
like the crowd, consisted of players of all races, he was the best
on it, as Michael Jordan used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dude's a player.''
</P>
<P>
   What a wonder it is when the heavens throw a wrench at
preconceived notions _ just as folks believe they have enough
evidence to confidently assert how some cannot play quarterback in
the NFL, some cannot win a 100-meter dash, some are best suited for
housework.
</P>
<P>
   It seems irresponsible to link a high school player with the
greatest who's ever played the game. (Some who do so hardly know
the difference between Michael Jordan and Michael Bolton.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goodman's story should be an uplifting one _ an
18-year-old whose quickness and athleticism defies the stereotype
that young Orthodox Jews would be more comfortable in a clasroom
than on a basketball court. He's a mature young man with his
priorities in order, and whose devotion to his faith is ahead of
his passion for basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He might take inspiration, as so many young Jewish athletes have
over the years, from Sandy Koufax. The outstanding Dodger pitcher
repeatedly declined to pitch on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the
holiest days of the Jewish year, which often coincided with the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Like Koufax, Goodman has become a walking topic for debate, on
where the sacred begins and the secular ends, where individual
concerns fall with respect to team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giving it a shot
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old wanted to be like his older brother. To him,
Reuvane Goodman was the coolest guy at Talmudical Academy, a small
Orthodox yeshiva in the Baltimore area, and he wanted to be the
same when he got older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm on the basketball team,'' Reuvane told him, and he
took Goodman to practice with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never left the gym,'' Goodman said. ``I went to all his
games and all his practices, and I watched on the sidelines. I just
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went home and tried emulating what he saw on the court.
For six days a week, rain or shine, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would wake up at 6 in the morning and shoot, and then go
and shoot at 11 o'clock at night with no lights outside,'' said
Harold Katz, the former coach at Talmudical and Goodman's current
adviser. ``Then he would come over and tell me about a move, as a
coach would, and most kids at 8 or 9 couldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman was still pipe-cleaner thin, but he began to grow, and
though he didn't play organized basketball until 10th grade, he
developed a flair for finesse and athleticism in pickup games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put together a scrimmage with our players and Tamir and
other players when he was in ninth grade,`` said Katz. ``Tamir
didn't make a shot, but there was one possession where he went into
the paint and hung up there for a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made you _ whew _ Jews can't do that. It was those things
that made you say, `What's that all about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman joined the Talmudical team as a sophomore and became a
scoring, passing sensation. As a junior, he scored 40 points in a
game 15 times. Once, he notched 24 points in one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fans dubbed him, the ``Jewish Jordan,'' and one time, the
moniker blared over the Talmudical public address system as Goodman
finished a play with a two-handed reverse dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's teams began faring well against non-Orthodox schools in
Baltimore, a recruiting hotbed. ``Tamir got everyone's best game,''
Katz said, adding that Goodman was often hit with racial slurs and
overly physical play from those unaccustomed to guarding an
Orthodox player with his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman scoffs at the notion that his background makes him
unique. ``I hear it a lot, and it's kind of a stereotype,'' he
said. ``People think a lot of kids like me aren't developed for the
field I want to go into because of their background, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally opposite. Because of my background, it
has helped me out more than anything. It's the biggest advantage I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there were days he could not play while others could.
``When you become a teenager, you stay out of trouble because of
your religion, and you become a better player because of all the
discipline you have because of your religion,'' he said. ``It just
transfers onto the court.''

SHOOTING SPURS MINORITY ACTIVISM IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ From the first floor of a cinder-block
building on Prairie Avenue, loud voices spilled into the halls of
the Urban League headquarters. Gathered around a conference table,
20 or so men and women were trying to find a way to ensure that the
January shooting death of a black Providence officer was not in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them _ black, white, Hispanic ministers and civic
leaders _ insisted that the attorney general, who, they say, has
not been sensitive to the plight of minorities, be removed from
office. Others emphasized the need for caution. This, they said, is
a key moment for the blacks and Hispanics of Providence, a chance
to finally make progress on a host of long-term complaints, from
the justice system to public schools to the lack of minorities in
jobs at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When Cornel Young Jr. was killed by two fellow officers, the
apparent victim of mistaken identity, all of Providence braced for
a show of outrage from the city's black community. What they didn't
expect was that the community would look critically at itself and
decide that it had allowed itelf to be pushed to the fringes of
civic life for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Providence, we have always had problems, but we thought the
problems would correct themselves. But the death of Cornel Young
Jr. made us say by the grace of God that could have been my
daughter or son,'' said Balbino Young, an African American city
councilor. ``We are now taking a new approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since a riot following the assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr. in 1968 _ when black protesters fell upon Prairie Avenue,
pelting rocks, ramming cars into buildings, and burning a
white-owned grocery store where the Urban League building now
stands _ has the city been so alive with activism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than 200 protesters marched to Attorney General
Sheldon Whitehouse's office to demand that an independent
investigator take over the case. Rallies have been planned
throughout this week as the two officers who shot Young appear at
the probation hearing of Aldrin Diaz, the man who police say
sparked the events that led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   And over the last month, there have been gatherings across
Providence, in churches on the West Side, in the dorm rooms of
Brown University, and in makeshift offices not far from Prairie
Avenue on the city's South Side. Everywhere, it seemed, activists
drafted petitions and resolutions and finalized plans for more
protests _ including a large one in they hope will attract
thousands of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are energized,'' said the Rev. Marlowe Washington, pastor
of Allen AME Church after the meeting. ``For us the civil rights
movement was postponed, but this is where we left off.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Young case seemed to hit a nerve. Young, 29,
was off duty and in plainclothes when he was fatally shot outside
Fidas Restaurant on Jan. 28 by two white officers who mistook him
for a suspect. Many civil rights leaders suspect that the police
assumed Young was a criminal because of his race. They saw
parallels to cases in Connecticut and New York, where police
mistakenly killed unarmed black males.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the people in the middle of it all, including the victim's
family, worry that the push to build Young into a political symbol
could make a thorough, fair investigation impossible. The two
officers involved, Michael Solitro and his partner, Carlos Saraiva
contend Young never identified himself as an officer on the night
of the shooting and that the accident had nothing to do with race.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, who leads the
investigation, also cautioned that the public not jump to the
conclusion that Young's death was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly he is a young man that gave his life to his
community,'' said Whitehouse. But ``it may be a little bit
premature to identify him as a martyr on the cross of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci said it is only natural for
the community to unite around the life of a model officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are doing anything in his name that is
harmful,'' said Cianci. ``His death has brought a lot of community
organizations together to rally and make demands for things they
have been asking for _ for a lot of years.''
</P>
<P>
   While blacks have lived in Providence, once a slave seaport,
since it was founded by English settlers, their small numbers never
afforded much influence, said Clifford Montiero, executive director
of the Providence branch of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Montiero, a former police officer, said blacks rarely ventured
outside the Lippitt Hill neighborhood in the east side of
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the black population was so small that African-
American leaders like Montiero tried to convince blacks from other
states to move in.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it didn't work,'' Montiero said. ``The black folks who
came said, `We are not at home,' and left.''
</P>
<P>
   When blacks in larger cities like Washington and New York were
gathering strength with large marches and sit-ins, in Providence
the demonstrations were smaller and quieter.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the minority population of the city has grown
to be 40 percent, but while Italian-Americans organized themselves
into a potent political force, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians seemed
unable to organize.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``there was nothing collective for all to rally
around,'' said Fayneese Miller, an associate professor of education
and human development at Brown University. Everyone ``could relate
to Young's death _ it cut across class and racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilor Balbina A. Young said that the case drew so much
attention because of a widespread sense that the justice system is
racist in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put the system under a microscope, especially the
police department. And we will root out anyone who gets in our
way,'' said Young, who is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   But Langley of the Urban League said since Cornel Young's death,
his organization has begun to focus on a number of issues outside
of the Young case. He hopes to increase the number of minorities
working for city and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He is also looking to push for an immigration bill which would
require judges to alert defendants that they could be deported if
they plead guilty or no contest for a crime. The governor of Rhode
Island vetoed the bill last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some black leaders worry that anger over the Young case will
soon fade, and with it all of the fervor for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``These local groups will be here today and gone tomorrow,''
predicts Montiero. ``I think there will be some people who will
stay on the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, observers here said the political atmosphere is
shifting. Two days before the shooting, Whitehouse voiced his
opposition to a proposed bill that would gather statistical data to
determine whether state troopers are unfairly targeting minorities.
Initially, he said that the bill would be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then along comes this incident,'' said Whitehouse, ``and all
my concerns that a bill like this would cause discord and
increasing hostility and misunderstanding were washed away in a
tidal wave of discord, hostility, and misunderstanding arisen from
this tragedy.''

CAMPAIGNS TURN TO RELIGION AS A WEAPON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was to be the year when religion was a warm and fuzzy
subject in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush named Jesus as his favorite philosopher. Al Gore
spoke of a personal conversion experience and proclaimed himself
born again. John McCain ran a campaign ad about the Christmas
sermon he wrote for fellow prisoners of war in North Vietnam 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened on the way to November.
</P>
<P>
   The race, at least for the GOP nomination, tightened, and all of
a sudden religion emerged as the wedge issue of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   In an astonishing sequence of events, accusations of
anti-Catholicism, anti-evangelicalism, even anti-Semitism are
floating across the telephone lines and the airwaves of key states.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian right, whose support has seemed indispensable to
the success of modern GOP primary candidates, is being blasted by
McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona. Catholic voters, a key
constituency in many states, are being courted by Bush, the
Republican governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Religion has always been a hot topic of conversation in American
politics, but this year the level of rhetoric has intensified, and
the accusations have reversed.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are candidates tarred for their faith _ as Democratic
presidential candidates Alfred Smith in 1928 and John F. Kennedy in
1960 were stigmatized for being Catholic _ but for supposed
intolerance of another's faith. The insinuation of religious bias
has become a leading political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an exercise in American religious politics, I'd say it's
all moving in the right direction, because it's bringing down the
wrath of the community on people who in one way or another seem to
be disrespecting someone else's religion,'' said Mark Silk,
director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at
Trinity College in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Silk's may be the rosiest gloss on the trend. Certainly, he
would agree, the process has been anything but uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   First, evangelist Pat Robertson, acting as a surrogate for Bush,
records an ad complaining that McCain's campaign cochairman is a
``vicious bigot,'' hostile to the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   The cochairman, former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire,
complains in turn that he is being targeted because he is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   McCain seizes on Bush's speech at fundamentalist Bob Jones
University to suggest that Bush stood silent in the face of
anti-Catholicism. And then, for good measure, he accuses Robertson
of being an agent of intolerance and Bush of being an agent of
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has been repeated beyond the presidential campaign.
In New York, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, accuses his
opponent in the race for US Senate, Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton, of ``hostility toward America's religious traditions.''
And in Congress, Democrats make hay of Republicans' refusal to pick
a Catholic as House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Religious scholars tend to sneer at the level of the current
debate, which the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the journal
First Things, calls ``an exceedingly unedifying spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Barkey, a policy analyst at the Acton Institute for
the Study of Religion and Liberty in Michigan, said, ``Most of
what's been going on has been down and dirty politics, as they look
for any stone to toss at the other candidate, and the stones that
have been thrown have been quite nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this has the quality of name-calling for cheap
political gain,'' said the Rev. Diane C. Kessler, executive
director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches. ``Let's stop the
name-calling and have a more enlightened conversation that elevates
the candidates and the electorate in thinking about the proper role
of religious convictions in the public sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges and countercharges fall into some familiar patterns
of American political and religious history, as candidates try to
win the sympathies and exploit the fears of different segments of a
fragmented electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion has always been important in American politics _ this
just goes with the territory,'' said Boston University historian
Robert Dallek.
</P>
<P>
   But the tenor and volume of the rhetoric seem new.
</P>
<P>
   The to-and-fro is clearly intended to move voter blocs. Bush
appears at Bob Jones University in an appeal to South Carolina's
Christian conservatives; McCain doesn't raise the anti-Catholicism
accusation until heading to the primary in Michigan, with its many
Catholic voters. Bush then apologizes for his handling of the Bob
Jones appearance in a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York,
another state with many Catholic voters and an upcoming primary.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate has a supporter with strong credentials among
religious conservatives: Former Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed
is an adviser to Bush, while former Family Research Council
president Gary Bauer is supporting McCain after abandoning his own
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing particular religion cards that have to do with
voting constituencies _ conservative fundamentalists in South
Carolina, Catholics in Michigan, Jews in New York _ it's pretty
much business as usual,'' said Silk of Trinity College.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of the accusations _ that Bush is anti-Catholic
because he spoke at a university whose leadership espouses
anti-Catholic views, or that McCain is anti-evangelical because his
campaign chairman criticized some fundamentalists _ impresses few
in the world of religion.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Boston's Cardinal Bernard F. Law dismissed the
suggestion that Bush is anti-Catholic, pointing out that a variety
of politicians have visited Bob Jones University but have not been
accused of anti-Catholicism. ``I find it sort of bizarre,'' Law
said. ``I think that place has some strange views, but that doesn't
mean one shouldn't go there and speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus, the First Things editor and a Catholic priest, called
the accusation of anti-Catholicism against Bush ``slanderous,''
saying, ``It was very clearly a mean-spirited political ploy by
McCain or his people.'' He argues that the anti-Catholicism of Bob
Jones University, which is premised on the notion that certain
fundamental Catholic beliefs are false, is a complex proposition
better debated by theologians than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important distinction between anti-Catholic
bigotry and a theological position that in various forms has been
going on for more than 400 years,'' Neuhaus said. ``They are not
bigots, they're simply profoundly wrongheaded in their
understanding of biblical tradition, but that's an argument neither
Bush nor McCain is equipped to engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, scholars say the name-calling could affect voters.
Christian conservatives are an influential part of the Republican
Party base, while Catholics and Jews form key constituencies,
particularly in Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics may not know Bob Jones, but every Catholic knows the
Protestants used to want to throw them out of the country,'' said
Alan Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion and American Public
Life at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfe warns that trying to move voter blocs using religion
is tricky. ``The damage to Bush with Catholics is real, but McCain
runs into a problem if he is perceived as using this for personal
gain, because it could backfire,'' Wolfe said. ``The thing about
religion is it doesn't have an automatic link to any political
view, and anyone who tries to harness it for political purposes is
playing with fire. Americans love God and hate politics, and they
don't want politicians messing with their religious beliefs.''

&HT;     FIREFIGHTER'S SUIT AGAINST DOOR OPENER COMPANY NEARS COURT
DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The case of a severely injured firefighter who
has sued a leading manufacturer of garage door openers is scheduled
to go to trial next week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Stapper, 39, is seeking nearly at least $8 million from
the Genie Corp. She contends that she and a fellow firefighter were
trapped inside a garage while fighting a house fire on March 9,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers contend that the garage door opener did not work,
and that the nylon cord that can disengage the door from the
automatic system had burned.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper, who no longer works for the Fire Department, suffered
burns over 40 percent of her body and was left permanently scarred
and legally blind.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Mambretti, a 25-year veteran of the department, died in
the fire. Two other firefighters, Keith Onishi and John Pieretti,
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melanie can't work anymore,'' said Browne Greene, a lawyer
representing Stapper. ``It was one of the most tragic fires the San
Francisco Fire Department ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   During a pretrial hearing on Tuesday, Genie lawyers argued that
their product was not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that what happened to Melanie Stapper is a tragic
situation,'' said Mary Wirth, one of the lawyers representing the
company. ``But it didn't happen because of a faulty garage door
opener. She was injured because the firefighters did not watch her
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapper and the other firefighters entered the burning home
through the garage door. According to reports, there was no smoke
or flames in the garage when the firefighters carried a hose
through the garage to get to the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   Heat and smoke forced Stapper and Mambretti to retreat to the
garage, but by then the door had closed and would not open. It took
firefighters outside more than 10 minutes, according to reports, to
cut a hole in the door and get their colleagues out. Stapper was
badly burned and Mambretti died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper's lawyers said they were seeking more than $1 million
for medical expenses, $5 million for future medical bills, more
than $2 million for lost wages and an unspecified amount for
general pain and suffering.

   TAKE-BOS  
 RICHLAND, N.J.: ... the court.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he grew as a player, Division 1 colleges took notice, most
notably Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said Maryland offered Goodman a scholarship after attending
two Talmudical games, and Goodman accepted early last January.
Still, he said, Goodman met with the coaches, and the Sabbath
issue, which had been raised by Maryland, was discussed at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told them if it was a doable thing, he would love to come
to Maryland,'' said Katz, ``but he said if not, he couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said Maryland coach Gary Williams raised a hypothetical:
What if the Terrapins were playing Duke Sunday afternoon and left
Saturday? He said Goodman offered to leave Friday or late Saturday
and to pay for travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   He said Williams said the school would take care of the costs if
it came to that. ``He told Tamir, and this is a direct quote, `I
don't think that's much of a problem,' '' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Katz said he began hearing otherwise. ``The
word on the street was that they were saying, `If he's good enough
we'll be happy. If not, he'll be a practice player or go
elsewhere,' '' he said. ``I kept calling them, asking about it, and
they kept saying, `If you didn't hear it from us, it isn't true.'
''
</P>
<P>
   By May, Katz said Goodman had heard it so often that he began
doubting it would come to fruition. Then he suffered a medial
colateral ligament sprain prior to attending two of the nation's
most prestigious summer camps, ABCD and Five Star. He went anyway,
but struggled at both.
</P>
<P>
   After a Sept. 2 meeting among Goodman, his mother, and Williams,
presumably to iron things out, Goodman announced he would not
accept the school's offer. He signed a letter of intent to attend
Towson in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, many college coaches insist he still isn't suited
for the major college game and that he is better off at Towson.
When told about his exploits at the recent Atlantic Cape Classic,
some coaches asked first about the level of competition he was
playing against.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have with that is that most of those guys who
have those opinions of Tamir either saw him play at ABCD or Five
Star, when he was hurt, or never saw him play at all,'' Katz said.
``I think Maryland eventually lost interest because of the Sabbath
and because people forgot he was a junior. With all that hype he
got, they thought he should make every shot, dunk every ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman and Maryland officials agree on two things: It's time to
move on from the matter, and he's better off at Towson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known about Towson at the time, I would have gone
there in the first place,'' said Goodman. ``Maryland is over with
as far as I look at it. I don't hold any grudges against them. It
just wasn't a match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like finding out something bad about your fiancee before
you get married, but you break up. Sometimes things aren't meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be a difference of opinion on his ability to
perform at the ACC level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with my skill,'' said Goodman. ``They've
seen me. I've been up there, playing against their team. They've
seen me playing against all the best players in the world. They
offered me a scholarship because they thought I was good enough to
play there. They offered it to me after two games, so obviously
they were impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams chronicled the events this way: ``We offered Tamir
Goodman a scholarship. At this time last year, his junior year, he
verbally committed to us. In the spring and summer, he didn't play
well _ he may have been hurting with a knee. We called him in and
said we would still honor the scholarship, but would he be happy
not playing? He walked out of the office, and he was still happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he is going to Towson. He may or may not be good
enough to start at Towson. He couldn't play at the ACC level. We
made a mistake. But we were still prepared to honor the scholarship
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``About playing on the Sabbath: For 46 years the ACC has played
on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. He knew that. Then you have
television commitments. He knew all this. We said, maybe, we could
change an occasional Saturday game from 1 to 7 . . . maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story is that if he's a star player, you might make
more concessions. But if you're an eighth or ninth man, you take
your chances. If you can't play, and the other guy does the job in
your absence, he should play. Every once in a while, you make a
mistake. We made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Night and day
</P>
<P>
   Towson's game at Northeastern next year, originally scheduled
for Saturday afternoon, Feb. 10, has been moved to the night. The
Tigers' game at New Hampshire Saturday afternoon, Jan. 27, has been
moved to the following afternoon. Their game Saturday afternoon,
Jan. 6, at Hartford, has been moved to night.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Goodman will not miss a regular-season game next
season because of his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   And, should Towson advance to the America East championship
during Goodman's tenure at Towson, America East officials might ask
ESPN, which usually televises the contest on Saturday afternoon, to
schedule it for another time.
</P>
<P>
   America East officials say they have less leeway during the
postseason, as teams play according to seeds. They say the matter
will be addressed in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Said America East commissioner Chris Monasch, ``I think there
are a lot of factors that go into when we schedule games, from
whether an arena will be available to whether it's a people thing,
to if we conflict with hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towson has requested to play games, whenever possible, on
Thursday and Saturday. Other schools said they would accommodate,
so on that basis, it's much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman would hardly call it such.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Towson and the America East are concerned, there
aren't enough words in the English language to thank them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman added that if any school cannot reschedule games during
his tenure at Towson, he will sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I owe (Towson) my life. It's an unbelievable thing,''
Goodman said. ``When I was going into everything, I felt all alone.
Just me, my coach, and my family. To find out, a couple of years
down the road, that my dreams could come true, with people actually
fighting for me, is something I thought was never possible, and I
could never thank them enough for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Change for the better
</P>
<P>
   There are some who, like Monasch, wonder what all the fuss is
about. Why not make such allowances for players who give time and
effort being representatives of such institutions?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to my mind is the guy who inspired
the movie, `Chariots of Fire,' who took a stance for his beliefs,''
said Campbell University athletic director Tom Collins, whose
Baptist school, along with Brigham Young University's Mormon-based
student body, doesn't play or practice on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA makes allowances for the schools by scheduling their
postseason contests for other days. ``It's good for institutions to
stand up and support Tamir the same way,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The three America East coaches whose schedules are affected say
they are also willing to help accommodate Towson. ``Any time our
league can get a quality player, I think everybody in the league
has to be happy about it,'' said Northeastern's Rudy Keeling, ``and
we have to do what we can to facilitate whatever is needed for
getting that player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only negative in moving games is if the games are moved
and it makes us miss more class. I don't think that's fair. But
other than that, I think moving a game, staying a day, moving from
day to night, those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some question the extent to which a school or conference
accommodates one player in a team sport. Others wonder whether the
America East would be going to such measures if Goodman weren't
someone capable of making an immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked with (the league's) athletic directors, they
understood the issue and wanted to be supportive,'' said Monasch,
``yet their concern was what if there are five more cases next
year? My feeling is, to not do something because down the line
there are so many other issues is a presumption I don't want to get
into.''
</P>
<P>
   With regards to Goodman's talent, Monasch said, ``The
institution made the request, and we said we would try to work with
it. At that point, we left it at that. We didn't evaluate how good
the player was. I guess the only way I would see the quality of a
player having an impact is if you're talking about integrity of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As a hypothetical example, Monasch used Towson's playing in the
America East championship game. ``To go all the way to the end and
not do something reasonable in terms of balancing things out for a
more significant player or two, I don't think that would be doing
right in terms of integrity of competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, would a TV network move a conference
championship game to allow for a player's religious observances?
</P>
<P>
   Said ESPN manager of communications Josh Krulewitz: ``If the
conference considered that request to be that important and if it
fit our schedule and made logical sense, we would consider it.
However, it's not something we can do on the spur of the moment. In
a request like that, a lot of time would be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Krulewitz said the network begins compiling its postseason
tournament package in the spring and summer prior to the season. He
said the America East has not contacted the network about such
matters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Believable lifestyle
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches already taking steps to accommodate players'
religious beliefs have mixed reviews about the process.
</P>
<P>
   One coach at a prominent major college in the Northeast, who
asked that his name not be used, said his program has taken major
steps to accommodate a player's beliefs with regards to practice
time and game meals.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach said he later discovered the player was having
premarital sex, which ran contrary to the player's religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him out on it,'' the coach said. ``My thing is, if
you're asking me to make concessions because of your religious
beliefs, I'm saying you should follow those beliefs all the way.
For you to get us to help you observe one facet of your faith while
you're violating another is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we practicing early in the morning and doing all sorts
of things for him if he's going to turn around and go out and do
whatever he wants?''
</P>
<P>
   Does that make a coach an unfair judge on whether a player is
following his beliefs _ or does the player put himself or herself
in that position by asking a school to help him or her observe such
tenets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see how coaches could have a problem with that, but
that situation is unique because you're talking about an
individual,'' said BYU athletic director Val Hale.
</P>
<P>
   He said his school never runs into such problems because it has
made observing religious beliefs part of school policy, and those
who violate them are dismissed from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Many do not believe much will change for Orthodox Jewish
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most yeshiva players that go into American society should know
that it does not,'' said Garry Katz, principal at Maimonides
School, a modern Orthodox day school in Brookline. ``As a former
all-city track runner in college, I suffered enormously because I
could not make Friday or Saturday practices and meets. It is
difficult, because Friday and Saturday are such staples in college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a part of a Jewish boy's life, but it is not a
dominant factor, nor should it be. If it can work out, great, but
most schools will not, nor should they be, expected to play, or
tailor, their schedules to one or two players.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were circumstances under which an Orthodox Jewish
player could participate in a game but not travel, Rabbi David
Ehrenkranz, the Orthodox rabbinic adviser at Brandeis, gave an
unequivocal, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Jew who reaches bar mitzvah age for boys or bat mitzvah for
girls, would be allowed to play on Shabbat, late Friday afternoon
through Saturday night,'' he said. ``Now, I'm sure some people will
read this and say, `No, that only applies to Orthodox Jews.' But
the Torah applies to all Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, increasing numbers of reform and conservative Jews are
Sabbath observant. That means that from sundown Friday through
sundown Saturday, they don't drive, don't do any work, often
worship at a synagogue, and generally try to spend the day with
their families in a more reflective mode.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the transition
</P>
<P>
   Towson coach Mike Jaskulski, who met with Goodman's family for
five hours before signing Goodman, said he addressed the
recruitment of Goodman and matters concerning it with current
players beforehand, and they had no problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work very hard to make sure he doesn't miss any
practices or games so he is indeed accountable like anyone else on
the team,'' said Jaskulski. ``If that means having practices
earlier on Friday afternoons, we'll do that. If someone else has
classes on Friday afternoons, we'll have practices on Friday
mornings, to make sure everyone is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaskulski said he believes the school has a gem in Goodman. ``He
is probably about as well-prepared cerebrally as any player I have
come in contact with,'' the coach said. ``That will make his
transition to college basketball better in terms of our style of
play.''
</P>
<P>
   How Goodman fares at the next level remains to be seen, as is
the impact he will have on other Orthodox Jewish players looking to
do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here is, where is a player's priority?'' said
Garry Katz of Maimonides. ``That is the question Tamir will have to
ask himself. ``He will not play in the NBA. If he thinks he will,
he shouldn't, because the NBA is not going to revise its schedule
for him. For him to use basketball to get a good education is, as
far as I'm concerned, the most important thing for a Jewish boy to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Katz said, folks should drop the ``Jewish Jordan''
reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction to it was how unfair it is to do that to
him,'' he said. ``He's not Jordan. He has an identity of his own.''

   Wanda Fox-Thetford, Graham, saw Lisa Day Johnson's request for a
stuffing that her grandmother made in the 1950s. Fox-Thetford got
the recipe from an Italian friend from Michigan in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Herron saw the request for a beef stew that includes
onions and mushrooms. She responded with the ``town stew'' recipe.
``This sounds very much like a recipe I've made for winter dinner
parties. It's from ``The Southern Junior League Cookbook,'' edited
by Ann Seranne. This is a stew for the purist. When it is
well-made, the result should be beautifully brown gravy containing
tender pieces of meat, whole small onions and mushrooms.''

BOB JONES UNIVERSITY: CONSERVATIVE FROM THE START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Jones Sr., the founder of the university that today bears
his name, was a well-known evangelist at the turn of the century
whose family has over the years remained committed to the most
conservative, and occasionally separatist, form of fundamentalist
Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th child of an Alabama sharecropper, Jones Sr. started Bob
Jones College in College Point, Fla., in 1926 when his followers
complained that their children were losing their faith upon
attending college. The college opened just two years after the
Tennessee trial of high school biology teacher John Scopes for
teaching evolution, an event that helped fuel hostility toward
fundamentalist Christianity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones College struggled under Jones Sr., even going bankrupt
in 1933, but moved to Cleveland, Tenn., and then in 1947 to its
current location in Greenville, S.C., where it was revitalized
under the leadership of Jones's fiery-tongued son, Bob Jones Jr.
The school now has about 5,000 students and is run by Bob Jones
III.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Sr. and Jones Jr. were so conservative that they distanced
themselves from the Revs. Billy Graham, a one-time student, and
Jerry Falwell, as well as the National Evangelical Association,
because they worked with ministers perceived as liberal, according
to Washington and Lee University historian Mark Dallhouse, author
of ``An Island in the Lake of Fire : Bob Jones University,
Fundamentalism, and the Separatist Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses argued that fundamentalists should remain separate
from people with heretical beliefs, and even from other
fundamentalists who did not do the same, according to the book
``Religious Leaders of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The university teaches that the Bible is literally true, and
requires every faculty and staff member annually to sign a document
affirming belief in the university's creed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Sr. was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and
traveled the country as an evangelist leading revival-style prayer
gatherings. He started preaching at the age of 12. He ran the
college for six years before turning over day-to-day administration
to his son in 1932. Jones Sr. died in 1968 at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Jr., a member of the Missionary Christian Alliance church,
was trained as a historian and first became known as an interpreter
of Shakespeare traveling the country and acting out various roles.
Jones Jr. was president of the university from 1932 to 1971, and
served as chancellor and board chairman until his death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Jones Jr., the university broadly
expanded its academic offerings. Jones Jr. was also an avid
collector of religious art and a supporter of an active cultural
life, including theatrical performances, on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was much more academically oriented, but he also had quite
a tongue,'' Dallhouse said. ``He's the one who called the Catholic
Church a satanic cult. He could wield quite a venomous tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has long had problems with Catholicism. In 1928
Jones Sr. campaigned in Alabama against the presidential candidacy
of Governor Alfred Smith of New York, the first Catholic to be
nominated for president. Years later Jones Jr. was quoted comparing
the Catholic eucharist to cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, its Web site proclaims the school's
``anti-Catholicism,'' saying, ``We love the practicing Catholic and
earnestly desire to see him accept the Christ of the Cross, leave
the false system that has enslaved his soul, and enjoy the freedom
of sins forgiven that is available for any of us in Christ alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the university lost its federal tax exempt status
because of its policy prohibiting interracial dating among
students.
</P>
<P>
   The university now is run by Bob Jones III, the university
president, and Dallhouse said that two of Jones III's sons, Bob
Jones IV and Stephen Jones, are considered possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones IV, a frequent contributor to World magazine, recently
drew attention for his critical profile of GOP presidential
candidate John McCain, a senator from Arizona. The magazine is
edited by an adviser to GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush,
the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported that Democrats said Tuesday they would push for
Congress to condemn the fundamentalist Christian college for
barring interracial dating and espousing anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans slammed the Democrats' plan as an effort to
embarrass Bush, who for weeks has fended off accusations that his
appearance at the South Carolina university was a tacit endorsement
of the college's teachings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ Donald Phipps and his friend Ken Duffie
wouldn't cross the street to hear a conventional church-style
organ.
</P>
<P>
   But for almost as long as either can recall, they have loved the
theatre organ, a lesser-known instrument designed to accompany the
silent films that launched the US motion-picture industry.
</P>
<P>
   The theatre organ could duplicate not only a full orchestra, but
also a range of real-world sounds: ocean waves roaring, birds
tittering, train whistles screeching, the clip-clop of horses'
hooves. And the human voice could hum hopefully, or sound ominious,
as the film unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of ``talkie'' pictures in the late 1920s, most
of these organs _ which sat in 6,000 of the nation's movie houses
in their heyday _ were junked or sold as parts.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, devotees like Phipps, 67, and Duffie, 74, have
been rescuing and restoring them, pipe by pipe.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, at least four societies and dozens of private
enthusiasts are preserving the old organs and offering concerts and
silent-film festivals, which are increasingly well attended.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans attribute this minirevival to a love of swing-era
music, show tunes, and ballads, which these organs reproduce so
well. Some are drawn by nostalgia for a simpler, more
black-and-white world where good triumphs and evil dies
ignominiously.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that to understand the importance of film in
contemporary society, you need to know where it came from, and you
can't understand silent film without studying the music that
accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   In New Bedford, a red-metal warehouse that still houses the
Warrior Fuel Co. and a boat settlements business is the unlikely
site of one of Phipps's and Duffie's restorations. There, amid the
debris of Phipps's former marine electronics business, with its
rusty paint cans, clamps, saws, and sandblasters, sits an antique
Wurlitzer with the horseshoe-shaped console that characterizes a
theatre organ.
</P>
<P>
   Atop a small, metalworking shop is the percussion section: a
tambourine, castanets, snare and bass drums, sleigh bells, a
xylophone, wood blocks, a Chinese gong. In a loft and elevated
chambers on the east and west walls, pipes, some tapered, in
several sizes make the sounds of harps, trumpets, violins, oboes.
Against another wall stand the elongated pine boxes of diaphones
and tubas, some as tall as 16 feet _ all activated by an elaborate
electrical relay system.
</P>
<P>
   A banner hanging above a bank of lacquer cans, nail boxes, and
plastic sawhorses identifies this as ``Phipps' Pipe Organ Concert
Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lot of cleaning, said Phipps, who also founded the
Eastern Massachusetts branch of the American Theatre Organ Society,
his glorified garage seats 125 concertgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Phipps and Duffie spent 10 years assembling this 12-ton,
2,235-pipe organ from discard piles of movie houses being
demolished or converted: the old Strand Theatres in Quincy and
Clinton, the Olympic in Boston's Scollay Square, the Majestic in
Providence, Somerville's Teal Square theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It's a consuming interest, requiring devotion, detective work,
and anywhere from $4,000 for a low-end small organ to $120,000 for
a large, elaborate one, plus many hours of maintenance and
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The silent films that developed at the turn of the 20th century
initially were accompanied by a single piano or a lone violin,
explained Duffie, who helped found the New England Theatre Organ
Society in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As the films' popularity grew, some movie houses hired small
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   About 1915, to economize and expand the dramatic range of the
accompaniment, the musicians' ensembles were replaced by one
organist playing a special ``unit orchestra,'' or theatre organ.
The cadillacs of this genre were the Wurlitzers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most celebrated contemporary performers is Chad
Weirick, 36, of Braintree, who at 16 was the youngest musician ever
hired to play the mammoth 35-ton organs at New York's Radio City
Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he plays on restored theatre organs around the country,
including the Zeiterion Theatre in New Bedford and Wellesley's
Babson College, where silent-film concerts draw up to 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an entire soundtrack on one instrument is a daunting
experience, said Weirick, who also teaches music in Wellesley
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the entire orchestra. It's like being the conductor
without having all those temperamental musicians to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   With their primitive cameras and limited filmmaking techniques,
the silent films could seem disconnected and hard to watch, said
Linda Dittmar, who teaches film studies at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the music could give depth and coherence.
</P>
<P>
   Movie producers did not issue musical scores, so accompanists
improvised. There were legendary tales of organists who played
whatever they wanted, inserting the birdcall when a car's honk
should have sounded.
</P>
<P>
   But a good organist could add emotional nuance and clarity,
heightening the dramatic impact, Dittmar said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the great 1928 silent film ``The Wind,'' with Lillian
Gish, as Weirick says he would accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   Letty, an innocent Virginia girl represented musically by a
happy American ballad, moves to the Texas prairie to live with
cousins. But they are mean and the incessant wind, conveyed through
low and breathy sounds, unnerves her.
</P>
<P>
   To escape her relatives, Letty marries a well-meaning but clumsy
cowpoke, represented by a jaunty, comic tune. But his awkward
attempts at lovemaking repel her. The organ gasps and sputters
notes that sound as if she's saying, ``Oh, my God!''
</P>
<P>
   As Letty prepares to leave her husband, an intruder breaks in
during a windstorm and attacks her. Sustained diminishing chords
let the violence speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Letty shoots him dead and seeks refuge from the wind in a
closet, where she lives like a caged animal.
</P>
<P>
   Her musical theme merges with the wind's maelstrom as she
descends into madness.
</P>
<P>
   At last, Letty reunites with her husband. Her theme, intertwined
with his goofy macho melody, plays against a low timpani roll. As
the film ends, a tuba emits a faint, flat sound in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Such performances can be mind-blowing, said Dorothy Bromage,
president of the Pine Tree chapter of the American Theatre Organ
Society, with members inMassachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit in the theatre with pipes in front of you and on each
side, and sound rolls over you and absorbs you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences are encouraged to boo and applaud, making the
``silent'' film experience more interactive than current movies.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate ``pipe'' dream for those who love these old organs
may be the Shanklin Center in Groton. F. Garrett Shanklin, 69,
whose family owns a packaging-machinery company, has created a
facility to house just one theatre organ.
</P>
<P>
   This instrument, which once graced Boston's Metropolitan Theatre
(now the Wang Center), was used in an Oregon pizza parlor until
Shanklin rescued it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ornate, white-and-gold console sits atop a red-carpeted
turntable, with elaborate lighting from colored spotlights and a
mirrored ball overhead.
</P>
<P>
   He has wanted to own one of these magnificent instruments ever
since he first heard one at the Stoneham Town Hall in 1968,
Shanklin said, as merry organ music resonated throughout the
building so loud that the floor vibrated.
</P>
<P>
   Barely audible above the din, Shanklin voiced the views of many
enthusiasts when he said, ``I just love the sound of it.''

VIEWS MIXED ON FEDERAL DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four policemen who killed Amadou Diallo have been
found not guilty of a crime, but that doesn't mean their legal woes
are over.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the victim's parents and some New York supporters,
including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Representative Charles Rangel,
will meet in Washington with US Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
to push for a second trial, this time in federal court, on charges
that the officers violated Diallo's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists are mixed on whether such a trial is likely or
justified.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers were acquitted on charges of second-degree
murder, manslaughter, and other lesser offenses in a state court
last week, a verdict that set off massive, angry, but nonviolent
protests across New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was US Attorney in New York in the
1980s, said Friday that civil-rights law does not apply to the
Diallo case. For federal prosecutors to bring a case, they would
have to find ``a gross miscarriage of justice'' in the state trial,
or conclude that the officers ``purposefully'' deprived Diallo of
his rights. The facts, he said, support neither premise.
</P>
<P>
   However, Laurence Tribe, a constitutional specialist at Harvard
Law School, said in a telephone interview that there could be other
grounds for a federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo, a West African
immigrant, as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building the night of Feb. 4, 1999. At the trial, they said they
acted out of self-defense, believing Diallo was pulling a gun out
of his pocket. (It turned out to be a wallet.)
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said, ``If you concluded that these officers were
suspicious of this guy or scared of this guy almost entirely
because he was black, and wouldn't have killed him if he had been
white, you could argue that they violated his constitutional right
to equal protection under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It might make little sense to go after these
officers on this theory,'' because it would be ``very hard to prove
that they had it in for Diallo, that they intended to deprive him
of his rights.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Justice Department could argue that their action
represented, as Tribe put it, ``the tip of a systematic iceberg,
involving institutional racial profiling that made it more likely
that this sort of thing would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, instead of filing a criminal case against the officers,
federal prosecutors might file a civil suit against the New York
Police Department, seeking to monitor its practices, order changes
in policy, or even place the department under federal control.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal investigations into the department's racial
practices are under way, prompted by the Abner Louima
torture-and-sodomy case of two years ago: one by the US Attorney's
office in Brooklyn, another by the US Civil Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Carter, the former US attorney who started the Brooklyn
inquiry, said he could imagine the Diallo case prompting a move to
tie these investigations into one federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said it will instead ``provide an occasion'' for
city and federal officials ``to discuss necessary police reforms
and resolve the matters in ways short of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several precedents for taking police officers who have
been acquitted in a state court, and trying them on civil-rights
charges in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodney King case, in which Los Angeles police officers
severely beat a black man after pulling him over after a highway
chase, is the best known instance. In another case, in New York
City, Officer Francis Livoti put a deadly chokehold on Anthony
Baez, a young Hispanic man, after Baez hit his car with a ball.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Diallo shooting differs in at least one crucial
way. ``In Rodney King, the facts could establish that the officers
were very deliberately administering punishment,'' Tribe said.
``You could say they were holding a sort of kangaroo court,
intentionally depriving him of his constitutional right to due
process.'' It would be ``very difficult'' to prove such a claim for
the officers who shot Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Obbermaier, another former US attorney in New York, also
noted that second trials of this sort of rare. ``The federal
government just can't say, `I think we ought to retry this case
because I don't like the result,' '' he said. ``New York is a
sovereign state. There is a reluctance to intrude without extremely
good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what happens will be determined by Attorney General
Janet Reno or possibly by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect politics might play a role. It is widely believed
that the Clinton administration brought the federal case in the
Rodney King beating in part because the officers' acquittal in
state court triggered riots in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said
a federal trial of the Diallo officers might be contemplated ``as a
backdrop for the Rudy Giuliani-Hillary Clinton Senate race.''
However, he added, it is unclear which direction, if any, politics
might tilt the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Carter scoffed at the notion. ``Politics enter into these things
a lot less than people like to imagine,'' he said. ``If there is a
federal trial, it won't happen because Al Sharpton wants one, or
because Rudy Giuliani doesn't.''

AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, MCCAIN HAS AN ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news is that the republic bids fair to survive eight
years of left-handed leadership. Not that we had any choice; all of
the major candidates seeking the presidency in the 1990s (Clinton,
Perot, Bush Sr., and Dole) were left-handed, and thus, odd ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The even better news is that the Republican contender John
McCain is painfully superstitious. (He is also left-handed, a
shortcoming I will ignore for the duration of this article.)
Journalists traveling with McCain report that he harbors a lucky
compass, a lucky feather, a lucky penny and, sometimes, a lucky
rock. An aide carries his lucky pen _ a Zebra Jimnie Gel Rollerball
(medium, blue) _ at all times. For added luck, he sometimes wears
his magical L.L. Bean rubber-soled dress shoes.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the South Carolina primary, according to the
Washington Post, McCain ate his lucky food (barbecue) and imported
his lucky friend to stand by him. McCain even invoked the Spring
Hill Lizard, a talismanic wiggling of an aide's right pinkie finger
that once helped Texas A &AMP; M prevail over Nebraska in a football
game. ``We use it only if we're at Def Con One,'' said his
political director, referring to the highest stage of national
security alert. I hope the Spring Hill Lizard scares Vladimir Putin
as much as it scares me.
</P>
<P>
   There are cynics who will note that, his precautionary measures
notwithstanding, John McCain lost the South Carolina primary. But
there could be a thousand reasons for that. It's not clear that he
saw his lucky movie that afternoon. Perhaps, unbeknownst to him, a
member of his retinue tossed a hat on a bed; I go berserk when my
kids do that. Maybe George W. Bush's lucky red-white-and-blue
tie-shirt-suit combination packed more juju than McCain's sacred
Hopi feather that day.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says his superstitions are an aviator's thing. And
they've stood him in good stead: he's survived at least two
airplane crashes. Maybe it's a geographic thing; his home state of
Arizona has a small mountain range called The Superstitions. He
doesn't have to explain it to me. Funky superstitions? Just more
reasons to love John McCain, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: The world is an extremely dangerous and hostile
place. Religion offers some succor. The problem with most religions
is that they concern themselves with the fate of my soul, not the
fate of whatever USAirways flight I happen to be riding at the
moment. Would I leave for the airport without observing the Russian
custom of sitting quietly before a trip? Would I board an airplane
without my St. Christopher's totem? Are you nuts?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I guest-taught a writing class in
Cambridge. The students and I had gathered around a table. When the
12th and last writer arrived, I sprang up from my chair. The
assembled company was baffled by my refusal to sit at a table of
13, but they good-naturedly agreed to take turns standing. The
13-at-a-table curse dates back to the Last Supper. If Peter or Paul
had offered to take turns standing up 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ
might have lived well past the age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   What else? I never open an umbrella indoors, and yes, I throw
spilled salt over my (left) shoulder. Of course, I knock on wood _
an old Druid thing _ to avoid tempting fate. I would never give
someone a knife as a gift (cuts the friendship) nor accept a pet
for free _ that's very bad luck. You must say ``bread and butter''
if you and a loved one pass on either side of an object that you
can't hold hands over (preserves the union) and do not, repeat not,
kiss a loved one on the forehead. Don't ask why, just take my word
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some superstitions are just plain silly. In Iceland, for
instance, they believe that if someone drops a knife while cleaning
fish, and the knife points to the sea, that presages good fishing.
If the knife points toward land, the fish won't be filling the
nets. Obviously, this kind of old-world folkway is ridiculously
primitive. Everyone knows that if you drop a knife, it means you
will soon be receiving a male guest. If you don't believe me, just
ask John McCain.

MEXICAN UNIVERSITY LIMPING BACK TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's now a strange sight for Eduardo Mendoza,
seeing students and professors walking around the campus of the
National Autonomous University, its brick towers and
picture-windowed classrooms lit at night and filled with activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to see the university like this again,''
Mendoza, 23, a part-time management student, said last week after
class. ``I got used to seeing it empty.''
</P>
<P>
   After being shut down for nearly 10 months by students who
seized the main campus to protest a proposed tuition increase,
Mexico's most important institution of higher education, known by
the Spanish acronym UNAM, is lurching back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed-wire barricades put up by protesters have been
removed. Several graffiti-stained walls have been painted over, and
classes have resumed for most of the 260,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly everyone in this academic community called University
City, which sprawls across three square miles in the southern part
of the capital, admits that many scars remain from the strike. The
strike ended Feb. 6 when more than 600 students surrendered to a
force of 2,000 federal police officers during a surprise predawn
raid.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern about students _ about 250 of them _ who remain
jailed, whose fate continues to spark small confrontations between
pro- and anti-strike students.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a palpable sadness that the high-profile conflict
and the loss of nearly a year's worth of research and teaching may
have permanently dented UNAM's image as one of Latin America's most
prominent universities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, there are worries about UNAM's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conflict will accelerate some of the changes that UNAM
has needed to make for years, like its structure and its academic
programs,'' said Carlos Munoz Izquierdo, director of educational
research at the private Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ``
</P>
<P>
   Education experts like Munoz said the main question is how UNAM
will recover and whether it can compete with other universities
despite its constitutional mandate to provide nearly free
education.
</P>
<P>
   UNAM's challenge is in many ways Mexico's daily reality: Finding
a midpoint between its populist past and a more modern, reformist
future.
</P>
<P>
   The university received nearly $1 billion in subsidies from the
government last year, roughly a third of the total given to all of
Mexico's public higher education institutions. Tighter spending
policies by President Ernesto Zedillo have kept those subsidies
nearly flat in recent years even as enrollment grew.
</P>
<P>
   To make the UNAM more financially independent, officials decided
last spring to raise the tuition from 2 cents a year to about $140
_ the first hike in 50 years. Administrators said the increase
would bring in nearly a tenth of the annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   But that proposal, as well as fears that the government was
preparing to privatize the university, led a group of angry
students to take over the campus. Officials eventually backed down,
agreeing to make the tuition hike voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The strike reached far beyond UNAM's main buildings, closing
dozens of university-affiliated prep schools, libraries, and
cultural centers across Mexico City. It closed university-run
dental and medical clinics and even quieted the instruments of its
renowned philharmonic orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the strike's end, federal officials and
private business groups pledged to come up with money to help
repair buildings and get restart classes as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But when students re-registered, the toll of the shutdown began
to take shape. About 40,000 who had previously been enrolled at
UNAM didn't show up. They either dropped out, officials guessed, or
signed up at other universities.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the protests last April, UNAM had begun losing
prestige, students, and research opportunities to aggressive
private universities and technical schools in Mexico, whose
enrollments have grown significantly over the last twenty years.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators are now planning to organize a university-wide
congress whose main objective is to come up with a blueprint to
revamp the university, from its bureaucracy and budget to its
academic programs and admissions standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of view that I have is that all issues of university
life should be revised (as part of) the congress,'' said Jose Narro
Robles, general coordinator of the congress, in an interview with
the Mexico City newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue, perhaps, from the UNAM strike, protests have
sprouted at other state-sponsored institutions. At a rural teachers
college in Hidalgo state, students and parents demanded more
tuition subsidies. Workers took over the administration building at
a public university campus in northern Sinaloa state demanding
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, in fact, say UNAM's dilemma is at the heart of a
larger problem facing the public higher education system: how to
become more efficient without becoming too elitist.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz and other observers say UNAM will have no choice but to
tighten its academic standards if it wants to survive in a more
competitive industry. But, they add, all levels of government will
have to come up with a clearer and more modern policy toward higher
education to make sure a college education remains accessible and
affordable.

TIME ON SHARPTON; THE DEAD AND THE PROFITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The solemn face of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African
immigrant shot to death last year by four white police officers
outside his Bronx apartment, stares from the cover of this week's
Time magazine. With the officers' stunning acquittal on all charges
last week, Howard Chua-Eoan probes the painful questions concerning
racial profiling by law enforcement, police brutality, and the
politics of outrage that have echoed since Diallo died in a hail of
bullets. He also considers how these issues will shadow New York's
Senate race between Hillary Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, as well
as the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even more compelling is Jack E. White's provocative essay on
the Rev. Al Sharpton. Ever since Sharpton popped up at the side of
Tawana Brawley, the young woman whose false accusations of a
kidnapping and rape by a group of white men almost broke New York
in two more than a decade ago, he's been viewed as a reckless
rabble-rouser and a public nuisance. Many believed Sharpton, with
his thick build and that absurdly processed hair, was nothing more
than a bombastic media hound romping through the volatile minefield
of race just to raise his own profile. But White argues that from
the ashes of the Diallo case, Sharpton has finally shown himself to
have ``the makings of a moral leader.'' And for those who would
scoff at such a thing, White reminds us that it was Sharpton who,
in the wake of the verdict, told the agitated throng outside the
courthouse, ``Let not one brick be thrown, not one bottle be
thrown. Those that believe in Amadou should not betray his memory
by acting like those who killed him.'' And while there were
numerous protests after the verdict, all were nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As career moves go, death is killer.
</P>
<P>
   Tupac Shakur, dead since September 1996, is somewhere in the
cosmos enjoying the success of his third posthumous release of
``new'' music, ``Still I Rise,'' while the Notorious B.I.G.
returned to the charts with ``Born Again,'' nearly three years
after he was gunned down. Such beyond-the-grave productivity, of
course, isn't limited to deceased hip-hop stars. Last year, novels
from two long-dead authors, Ernest Hemingway and Ralph Ellison,
made the bestseller lists. And from Biggie to Ellison, there were
legitimate arguments that these works were little more than sloppy
seconds cobbled together to turn a buck, products hardly
representative of the artists at their best. Hence, every
post-mortem book or CD begs the question posed by Erik Tarloff in
The American Prospect: ``Did the artist responsible regard the work
under consideration as finished and publishable?'' In a fairly
brief but entertaining essay, Tarloff works this question from
every possible angle. He first considers our inability to let go:
``Once we've experienced the complete canon of a favorite artist,
it's natural to feel frustration that all the ore has been
extracted from a particular lode; it's only human to want more,''
he writes. ``We want a solution to the murder of Edwin Drood. We
want to see Michelangelo's Slaves liberated from their blocks of
marble.'' But finally he nails it for what it really is: capitalism
at its most lazy and cynical. Like Coke or Kleenex, Hemingway and
Tupac are also brand names that sell. ``Brand names narrow the
field for us; they make selection (and frequently, response) less
risky; they reassure us with their apparent imprimatur of quality.
Mediocre art with an impressive brand name is often preferable _ or
at least safer _ than art of obscure provenance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If any hip-hop artists make it into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, Run-D.M.C. _ eligible 2008 _ should be among the first. Back
in the 1980s, the Hollis, Queens, trio took rap to the masses when
many still believed it was a novelty. Such songs as ``It's Like
That'' and ``Sucker MCs'' established the group's style, and ``Rock
Box'' and ``Walk This Way'' laid the groundwork for the rap-rock
dabblings of Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, and Korn. In
XXL, Matt Diehl considers these hip-hop pioneers as they put the
finishing touches on their long-awaited seventh album, ``Crown
Royal.'' The album features the de rigueur guest spots _ from Kid
Rock, Everlast, and Limp Bizkit _ something, by the way, that
Run-D.M.C. never needed back in the day. But these are different
times for these b-boys turned b-men. For one, Darryl ``D.M.C.''
McDaniels seems to be moving away from the group, working on a solo
project that he says better reflects who he is now. He describes
his music as ``a mix of Neil Young, Chuck Berry, and Led Zeppelin,
with a little Ike and Tina Turner.'' Hmmmm. As for his days with
Run-D.M.C., which seem to be numbered, ``I'd rather do my stuff and
fail than be in Run-D.M.C. goin' through hell.'' I guess for
D.M.C., it's like that, and that's the way it is.

GOING, GOING, GONE? IS STRAWBERRY'S REAL PROBLEM A HARD HEAD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you see that list of big-league baseball drug suspensions in
the paper the other day? Instead of pre-game meetings to discuss
opposing hitters and pitchers, maybe baseball teams should conduct
mandatory meetings of Narcotics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just baseball, of course. Football has its Lawrence
Taylors and Leon Letts. And basketball's Dallas Mavericks gave the
world Roy Tarpley.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball lays claim to a breathtaking Hall of Shame when it
comes to substance abusers. Take Darryl Strawberry _ please.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Strawberry failed a drug test required as part of his 1999
probation on charges of cocaine possession and soliciting a
prostitute in Florida. His positive test for cocaine Jan. 19 earned
Strawberry his third drug-related suspension since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suspension is for one year. Since he's almost 38
years old and already past his prime, it is not outrageous to
imagine that he has played his last game as a major-league baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's critics _ count me among them _ are wondering why
Commissioner Bud Selig didn't just kick Strawberry out of baseball
for life, instead of allowing for the possibility of yet another
Darryl comeback in 2001. Selig, however, seemed to be of the
opinion that the punishment he handed down was pretty darn tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult and painful decision for me to
make,'' Selig said. He added, ``In the end, I could not ignore
Darryl's past infractions and concluded that each of us must be
held accountable for his or her actions.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess your reaction to Selig's decision depends on your
definition of ``held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   And those words obviously mean something entirely different for
sports stars than they mean for just plain folks.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who have serious problems with booze or drugs
quickly find themselves out of work and out of options. But
athlete-addicts can always find a team that is willing to give them
a second chance, not to mention a third chance, a fourth chance ...
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports is all about winning and making money. If
you own a sports franchise and you've got a player who can help
inflate your won-lost record and your financial bottom line,
chances are you won't allow yourself to get too worked up about the
player's cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that right, George Steinbrenner? Isn't that right, Jerry
Jones?
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, sad to say, this attitude is not helpful to the
player. Eventually, age and/or addiction will erode his skills to
the point that he can't play any longer _ and a drug-addicted
ex-ballplayer isn't nearly as bulletproof as an addict who is still
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry may be on the verge of learning that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong baseball fan who never had much use for
Strawberry, I don't much care what happens to him. He is not, I am
pleased to report, my problem.
</P>
<P>
   But as someone who hasn't had a drink in almost 18 years after
nearly destroying my life with alcohol, I can't help but wonder why
Darryl Strawberry can't pull himself together and deal with his
problem. You don't become a great athlete without hard work and
determination, without considerable self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry conquered major-league pitching and even colon
cancer, for heaven's sake. Why can't he conquer drug addiction?
</P>
<P>
   The answer might be deceptively simple.
</P>
<P>
   An addict doesn't conquer his problem. He must surrender to it.
The addict must admit that he is powerless over the source of his
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that the very qualities that spurred Darryl
Strawberry to greatness as an athlete actually work against his
recovery from addiction by preventing him from conceding defeat, by
preventing him from admitting to himself that the addiction is
stronger than he is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Strawberry might just be an arrogant jerk who
doesn't think he has to follow the rules that lesser mortals
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever it is, it's time he figured it out.

 &HT;    Shopping destination: CNN Center
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Lambe was a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Lambe, who works downtown, recently wandered into the Braves
Clubhouse Store searching for a birthday present for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's a serious Braves fan, so I figured that the Clubhouse
is going to have something he'll like. I'm thinking about getting
him a sweatshirt, and I'll probably throw in a Braves cap,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to the CNN Center in a while, you might be
surprised at what you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN Center complex _ billed as a ``1.5 million-square-foot,
multiuse megastructure'' _ includes two 14-story office towers, the
Omni Hotel, CNN studios, several restaurants and stores and a
multiscreen movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   To go hand in hand with the new Philips Arena, to which it is
attached, CNN just underwent some major renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philips and CNN Center complement each other,'' says Lisa
Tobias of Turner Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a flashy new glass-and-steel front on Marietta
Street, the main atrium area was opened up to allow for increased
Philips Arena traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created even more of a studio environment by adding six
large screens throughout the atrium where people can watch the
Turner networks. Also the tour area and the tour itself have been
revamped,'' Tobias says.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the recent facelift, 27,000 square feet of new retail
space has been made available.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Brieske with Turner Properties, more stores
are on the CNN horizon, including the possibility of a national
chain book store as well as another upscale restaurant facing
Marietta Street with outdoor seating overlooking Centennial Olympic
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the big draw for shoppers is, for the most part,
sports related.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves Clubhouse, which opened its doors in 1986, is the
first store owned and operated by the Atlanta Braves, according to
store manager Don Shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are true Braves fans, but we also get a lot of
international travelers that come through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At this well-stocked store fans can find team jerseys,
collectibles including signed baseballs and even wrist watches
sporting Braves logos.
</P>
<P>
   During baseball season, when the team is in town, selected
players will come to the store one Saturday a month and sign
autographs for fans.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Clubhouse, you'll find the Turner Store. Here
you can pick up stuffed Scooby Doo toys, a selection of ``Gone With
the Wind'' souvenir items ranging from a Scarlett O'Hara doll to a
GWTW coffee mug.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Turner Store, CNN fans will find sportswear

   Q: I have looked everywhere for a hand and body lotion called
Rose Milk. Is it still manufactured and if so, where can I purchase
it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Laura French, Covington, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We should all rush out and buy Rose Milk, because the bottle
says it's ``for softer, smoother, younger feeling skin.'' We found
our 8-ounce bottle ($4.96) at Drug Emporium, 2625 Piedmont Road
N.E. (404-233-1201). This lotion has the soft smell of roses and
when applied, is as smooth as milk on the skin, without a greasy
afterfeel, according to a spokeswoman at Lee Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read in a magazine that almond butter was a
healthful substitute for peanut butter, but I have been
unsuccessful in finding any. Can you help me?
</P>
<P>
   _Christin Chandler, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another almond butter request: Where can I find almond
butter? It's like peanut butter but made from almonds.
</P>
<P>
   _Karen Burpo, Alpharetta
</P>
<P>
   A: An almond butter and jelly sandwich, anyone? Usually, nut
butters such as almond butter and cashew butter are available at
health food stores. We found Smooth Almond Butter ($7.99 for a
16-ounce jar) and Crunchy Almond Butter ($5.99 for a 16-ounce jar)
at Whole Foods, 2111 Briarcliff Road N.E. (404-634-7800). Now for
the healthful part. Page Love, a registered Atlanta dietitian and
nutritionist, says that almond butter is not lower in fat than
peanut butter. ``Some brands,'' she says ``are actually higher in
fat, containing 16 to 20 grams of fat per two tablespoons. Peanut
butter, on the other hand, has about 16 grams of fat per two
tablespoons.'' The advantage of a nut butter such as almond butter?
``It's more heart healthy because it is less hydrogenated, which
means less unsaturated fat,'' says Love.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where in Atlanta can I buy the soft drink Cheerwine? Kroger
carried it for awhile, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   _Connie York, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Those of you in Atlanta who like this burgundy-colored soft
drink with the bold cherry taste have little to cheer about. ``We
are happy that people want Cheerwine in Atlanta, but our
distributor there dropped the line last year,'' said Alice Edwards
of Carolina Beverage Corp. The closest places that carry the
carbonated drink are Quality Foods in Habersham and Franklin
counties in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   However, you Cheerwine addicts can order a case (24 cans, diet
or regular) by sending a check or money order for $22.70 to:
Carolina Beverage Corp., P.O. Box 697, Salisbury, NC 28145. Jump on
the Web site at: www.cheerwine.com for more cheery information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife wants you to track down wax paper sandwich bags. She
says she bought them several years ago at Kroger but cannot find
them anywhere now. Any help you can provide would be much
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernie Hockswender,
</P>
<P>
   Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although not widely distributed, we managed to find those
elusive wax paper sandwich bags. Known as Reynolds Cut-Rite
Sandwich Bags, they're available through Market Grocery at the
State Farmers Market, 16 Forest Parkway, Building K.
(404-361-8620). Wayne Amos will be glad to special order them for
you. A case of 12 boxes (each box contains 50 bags) is $15;
however, Amos said he would sell customers half a case (six boxes)
for $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Levi's Silver Tab loose fit jeans in a
misses size 4. I fear they are not made anymore, so of course they
are the only jeans that really fit me. Are there any retail or
catalog outlets that might carry these now so hard-to-find jeans?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kristin Kelly,
</P>
<P>
   Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your fear is well-founded. A spokesman at Levi's said that
the Silver Tab loose fit jean is no longer made in misses sizes;
however, this style is still made in junior sizes, such as 1, 3, 5,
etc. You can probably wear either a size 3 or 5. Look for the
Silver Tabs ($50 a pair) at Rich's stores at Lenox Square, Gwinnett
Place, Southlake Mall, Greenbriar Mall, Town Center Mall and North
Point Mall. The jeans are also available online at jcpenney.com for
the same price.

 THE FEAR of LOATHING on the CAMPAIGN TRAIL

publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-996-0075; fax, By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Earlier this month, as the Republican contenders for president
were bickering over who was the bigger meanie, I paid a visit to
Greg Stevens, who was hard at work creating two commercials for his
candidate, John McCain, in a rent-by-the-hour video editing studio
across the river from Washington in Arlington, Va.
 &HT;    The son of a minister, Stevens, who is 51, speaks in mild tones
and dresses in muted colors. That day he was wearing pressed gray
flannels, a light gray shirt and a dark gray and black sweater. His
commercials, in contrast, sparkle with color, swoop through
blurring camera pans, shake with sound.
 &HT;    Of the TV ads Stevens was producing, one, called ``Leader,'' was
the kind that political operatives and obliging reporters refer to
as ``positive.'' It was a 30-second confection intended to
introduce McCain to California viewers.
 &HT;    The second spot had a less inspiring name. ``OK, Polly,''
Stevens said, shortly after I entered the shadowy studio. ``I guess
we can go to the 'New Low.'''
 &HT;    Polly Bryan, a video editor, drew a stylus across a flat control
panel, and the image of George W. Bush, bigger than life, smirked
on three screens, a five-foot screen against one wall and two
smaller desktop ones.
 &HT;    Nearly 12 years ago, it was Stevens who burned the now-legendary
image of Michael Dukakis peeping from a tank into our collective
memory. Now he was working on finding a similar place in the
American mind for a smirking Bush. The new commercial used
slow-motion footage of a startlingly goofy Bush to mock him as
having reached a ``new all-time low'' in attacking McCain's record
on assisting veterans. But Stevens was not satisfied with the cut.
 &HT;    The last image, a head-on shot of McCain speaking in front of an
aircraft carrier, was not dramatic enough to create the hoped-for
contrast between one man who should be president and another who
should be spanked.
 &HT;    On Stevens' instructions, Bryan used her machine _ a sort of
image processor with cut and paste tools like a word processor's _
to copy frames from existing footage of McCain and stick them into
``New Low.''
 &HT;    Dizzyingly, McCain's image jerked back and forth, and his brisk
voice spoke normally and in reverse, as she adjusted the new clip
to fit near the end of the advertisement.
 &HT;    ``Let's try it 20 frames sooner,'' said Stevens, who is known as
a perfectionist in his trade. (To give you a sense of the hair he
was splitting, there are 30 frames in a second, 900 in a 30-second
commercial.)
 &HT;    In the end, none of this effort mattered. No voter ever saw this
commercial.
 &HT;    Even as Bush intensified his barrage of critical advertising in
South Carolina and Michigan, McCain ultimately decided to put ``New
Low'' on the shelf and to rely only on positive commercials such as
``Leader'' in a bid to reclaim the high ground.
 &HT;    Earlier he had seemingly abandoned that high ground by
broadcasting a spot comparing Bush to Bill Clinton. History may
someday sort out whether or not this attack ad hurt McCain. What is
already clear is that it, along with Bush's more frequent attacks,
fueled one of the most tiresome aspects of this campaign: grown men
calling each other negative ... and then calling each other
negative for calling each other negative.
 &HT;    Yes, the doubling negatives have served as a kind of proxy
debate over the character of the candidates, but that debate is not
terribly enlightening.
 &HT;    Any debate about TV spots and radio ads and the nature of
telephone polls is ultimately a debate about tactics rather than
issues and agendas. That is, it's the very sort of insider
preoccupation that the critics of negativity say they want to
avoid.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most unsatisfying aspect of this debate about
negative campaigning is that, having monumentally distracted the
political world, it has not addressed directly the basic questions
it raised.
 &HT;    Are negative advertisements so much worse than positive ones? Is
either category actually a bad thing? And does either really
matter? The answers are no, no and a lot less than you probably
think.
 &HT;    At the national level, the brainwashing powers of political
advertising have long been exaggerated _ in part by some
advertising men, who make their money on commission, as a
percentage of the purchase of TV time. Given the rise of channel
surfing, mute buttons, the Internet and irony, traditional
advertising is becoming only less effective, in the view of a
number of media consultants.
 &HT;    What still matters most in a national race, candidates and
operatives will tell you, is what they rather patronizingly call
``earned'' or ``free'' media _ the press.
 &HT;    McCain has proved that this year. Even as his campaign was
taking off, he could not afford much advertising. On the other
hand, Steve Forbes proved _ as he already had in '96 _ that
abundant and skillfully produced advertising can get you only so
far.
 &HT;    Now, paradoxically, one way to ``earn'' free media is through
advertising, particularly negative advertising. Reporters tend not
to build stories around spots like ``Leader,'' a paean to one
candidate, but they are very likely to pay attention to ads in
which one candidate levels a charge against another.
 &HT;    And so Stevens had intended to pay to broadcast ``New Low'' only
a handful of times, knowing that news programs, delighting in its
acerbity, would work up stories about Bush and veterans and then
broadcast the commercial free.
 &HT;    There is really nothing wrong with this. One role of campaign
reporters is to relay and evaluate what the candidates are saying,
in their ads as on the stump, and they are simply doing their jobs
when they analyze such attacks.
 &HT;    One of the grounds that critics use in attacking negative
advertisements is that they twist the truth _ without necessarily
breaking it _ by manipulating words and images to undercut an
opponent. Yet positive commercials can be just as manipulative and
sometimes less truthful than negative ones.
 &HT;    Indeed, so-called positive ads are just as likely to rely on
anonymous narration that skips inconvenient details, music that
summons emotions, and images stripped of context _ all of this
carefully arranged to tell the producer's chosen story.
 &HT;    Now, turning attention to his positive spot, Stevens led me down
a hall in the warren of windowless studios to a room where Steven
Lipton, another editor, was assembling the images for ``Leader.''
 &HT;    Like other employees of the studio, Lipton, 33, is a gun for
hire. He once cut a commercial for Bill Clinton and one for Bob
Dole in the same room on the same day, erasing all traces of one
campaign's work before the next entered.
 &HT;    Stevens had written the script for ``Leader'' the night before.
He usually does write a script first, then scribbles in the margins
what images _ which he believes are far more important than the
words _ should go with each line.
 &HT;    ``A young Navy pilot who volunteered for duty in Vietnam,''
boomed the bass Voice of God _ actually, the voice of Terry
MacDonald, a burly actor with a wry wit _ as pictures of a youthful
McCain flashed by on a large screen.
 &HT;    Following Stevens' written instructions for the imagery
(``Reagan,'' ``big crowd,'' ``flag profile''), Lipton had spliced
shots of a pilot bailing out of a falling plane with footage of
McCain in prison in Hanoi along with scenes of him with Ronald
Reagan and on the campaign trail. The parachutist, however, was not
McCain; the campaign purchased footage of an unnamed pilot from the
military.
 &HT;    The closing shot showed McCain standing before a blue field of
stars as he earnestly addressed a crowd. In fact, the senator,
deadpan, was telling a joke about how, when he showed up with his
kids on the first day of school, a teacher congratulated him for
bringing his grandchildren.
 &HT;    But as the narration gave these images new meanings, the
pictures now told a compact, powerful story with no punch lines.
That story was true enough, but the ad, in reality, was more
postmodern pastiche than documentary.
 &HT;    Indeed, this ``positive'' commercial had managed to underscore
implicitly that McCain, unlike Bush, had gone to Vietnam, not into
the National Guard. Just imagine the reaction to a spot that
bluntly, negatively, made the same point.
 &HT;    By now, Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, had entered the
room. Watching the ``Leader'' spot, he arrived at a new concern.
``You've got to have a female announcer,'' he said.
 &HT;    Stevens rolled his eyes.
 &HT;    ``It's California,'' Davis continued. ``We've got to get out of
a South Carolina mindset.''
 &HT;    Stevens suggested that there was no evidence that women
responded more to female voices. In fact, he said, there was some
evidence that they were put off by them.
 &HT;    Soon Jay Payne, Stevens' production manager, set to work with
Lipton editing ``Leader'' _ which is to say, manipulating the
sounds and images _ while scarfing down lasagna from the production
studio's mess. Payne, a 25-year-old from South Carolina, had been
in the studio until 3:30 that morning, and his thick, brown goatee
was merging into several days' worth of beard.
 &HT;    Payne and Lipton began riffling their file footage for a good
sound bite. They settled on a shot of McCain declaring to a crowd,
``I'm going to give the government back to you, and I promise you
that.''
 &HT;    But there was a hitch. McCain was speaking outside, and the
preceding image was of an indoor rally.
 &HT;    ``You can't lead in from that crowd now,'' Payne warned.
 &HT;    Lipton eliminated the crowd shot, then went searching for a good
outdoor crowd to follow McCain's remark.
 &HT;    ``I don't want a shot of that guy,'' Payne said, as a man in
dark glasses and a tie appeared. ``He looks like he's in the Secret
Service.''
 &HT;    Lipton finally found a nice crowd shot at the same event at
which McCain was speaking. People of varying ages, oblivious to
Stevens' cameraman, were listening intently and then clapping.
 &HT;    But they were not clapping loudly enough. So Lipton embarked on
a hunt for better crowd noise. The cheering and whistling from
another event sounded ``too young,'' he concluded, and the sounds
from other rallies he sampled at head-spinning speed did not work
either.
 &HT;    He returned to the original speech and fast-forwarded, turning
the senator into a caffeinated chipmunk, until he found a
satisfying cheer. He picked up that piece of sound and laid it over
his preferred crowd shot. So in the end, a group of people clapped
and cheered with others' hands and voices for a remark no one seen
or heard in the ad was actually applauding.
 &HT;    As a presentation of reality, ``Leader'' had become as
misleading as many other campaign commercials, positive, negative
or otherwise. Still, as a representation of one reality _ of the
dynamism of the McCain campaign _ it was dead on.
 &HT;    After lunch, Stevens pushed a sheaf of papers toward me.
Political organizers still think in terms of precincts and
counties. But Stevens is reaching voters through their televisions,
not their front doors. So he was working off color-coded maps of
the media markets in California and elsewhere that listed the
percentage of the Republican vote that would come from each.
 &HT;    Stevens can cut a commercial in about 12 hours, at a cost of
$12,000 to $15,000. The great expense in TV advertising comes when
you put it on the air. And so by using ratings data, some pop
psychology and sophisticated computer programs, campaigns carefully
pick particular times and particular shows to ship their messages
to particular voters.
 &HT;    Ideally, Stevens wants every viewer to see an ad 10 to 12 times
to absorb its message. He tends to buy time during morning and
evening news programs, as well as during ``Nightline,'' to reach
the audience that is most likely to go to the polls. Then he
pursues prime-time slots to get the most possible viewers.
 &HT;    Going a step further, Stevens planned to place ``Leader'' during
``Oprah,'' ``Judge Judy,'' ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' and
even an afternoon rerun of ``Matlock'' in hopes of appealing to the
suburban women McCain has had trouble rallying.
 &HT;    Later, as he screened the revised ``Leader,'' Stevens murmured,
``That's good ... good, good, good.''
 &HT;    The McCain campaign is not testing its advertisements in focus
groups or polls. Generally, Stevens just picks the images and
sounds he thinks are most effective, freely incorporating the
suggestions of his underlings or colleagues.
 &HT;    The new version of ``Leader'' with McCain speaking, he readily
conceded, was better than the original. He scribbled out some
graphics, like ``Ready to Lead,'' which he handed over to Bryan,
who had now taken control of the commercial to edit it on a
superior and _ at $500 an hour _ more expensive machine.
 &HT;    As Bryan worked, and narrative shards like ``defying special
interests'' periodically filled the room, Stevens talked about his
candidate and advertising.
 &HT;    ``He hates this,'' Stevens said. ``He understands its value, but
it's something that isn't reality to him.''
 &HT;    Unlike McCain, his candidate, Stevens is fascinated by
advertising, with its simultaneous appeals to two senses, its iron
discipline of money and time, its overt messages and subtle cues
and its blend of politics and art, high technology and sometimes
low blows.
 &HT;    McCain's decision to shelve ``New Low'' may have been the only
one he could have made politically, given his image as an
unconventional candidate. But his decision should not be read as
addressing the underlying question of whether negative advertising
should have a place in campaigns generally, including in primaries.
It should.
 &HT;    Granted, politics would probably be more enlightening if
political advertising, positive or negative, relied less on
gimmickry. Campaigns would surely be better if candidates told
their own stories and made their own attacks, addressing the camera
directly in their commercials.
 &HT;    But don't make the easy assumption that politics would be more
serious and more moral if all candidates were positive all of the
time.
 &HT;    The truth is not always pretty, and there can be just as much of
it in a slow-motion smirk as in a cheering crowd.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The first thing Lt. Vyacheslav Kiselyov did before leading his
platoon into Grozny was to yank the metal plates from his
bulletproof vest, leaving only the panel that covered his heart.
Then he crammed the jacket with extra cartridges of ammunition.
 &HT;    It was one of those trade-offs Russian soldiers make to maximize
their chances of survival.
 &HT;    The regular supply of ammo _ four magazines with 32 cartridges
each _ is good for only about 20 minutes of fighting. The fire from
Chechen rebels can sometimes get so intense, however, that it
sounds like eggs on a griddle, and Vyacheslav felt his best
protection was having enough bullets to answer back.
 &HT;    He also put aside his helmet. It was nice to have if you were
manning a checkpoint. But when a soldier has to run for his life
and dodge snipers, the ill-fitting helmet just gets in the way.
 &HT;    As Vyacheslav recalled not long ago, he was creeping up on a
warehouse in the eastern part of Grozny when he saw that two of his
soldiers were pinned against the ground, bullets whizzing over
their heads.
 &HT;    He began lobbing smoke grenades so that they could make their
escape. It was then that a 5.45-millimeter bullet ripped into his
hand.
 &HT;    That, Vyacheslav now says, was a bit of luck. If it had been a
7.62-millimeter, it would have torn off a finger.
 &HT;    Vyacheslav told me his tale in Room No. 8, which was not a room
at all but a tent set up on the grounds of the military hospital in
Mozdok, just a few miles northwest of the Republic of Chechnya.
 &HT;    He spoke in a low monotone, as if he were talking about another
soldier in some far-off battle. It was a dirty little war, but it
was his lot to fight it. He had not bothered to tell his parents
about his wound. It would only worry them, and there was nothing
really that they could do.
 &HT;    ``I don't know whether we are fighting for the motherland or
not,'' Vyacheslav said. ``But if it was up to me all the bandits
would be destroyed. It's not nice to see your friend's head blown
off by a grenade.''
 &HT;    I was one of a handful of foreigners who had tagged along with
Russian TV crews as they helicoptered in and out of Chechnya this
winter, the Russian forces blasting their way into the Chechen
capital. An obsequious military press service generated publicity
for Russia's field commanders.
 &HT;    These officers were a blustery lot, boasting about their
triumphs and reveling in the medals that Vladimir Putin, Russia's
acting president, bestowed on them. What interested me, though, was
not these officers but the soldiers who fought under them _ young
men who, like Chechnya's civilians, bore the brunt of Russia's
``victories.''
 &HT;    These soldiers were not the grizzled combat veterans the Kremlin
insisted it was sending to the front. They were untested conscripts
plucked from Russian factories and farms in the provinces,
down-on-their-luck mercenaries unable to find steady work at home,
militiamen more accustomed to policing a rock concert than
searching for snipers.
 &HT;    And they were young officers like Vyacheslav, who went to a
military school to become a border guard and never imagined he
would end up in the Chechen caldron.
 &HT;    They suffered thousands of casualties in the course of seizing a
ruined capital and chasing bands of battle-hardened militants into
their lairs in the Caucasus mountains. No one considered himself a
hero, and nobody was anticipating any parades when, or if, he
returned home.
 &HT;    In Mozdok, a dismal military town, besieged by fog and drowning
in a sea of mud, the hospital where I met Vyacheslav is situated
inside a guarded compound near the base. According to official
figures, more than 1,100 Russian soldiers and Interior Ministry
troops have been killed and more than 3,500 wounded since the
campaign in Chechnya began Oct. 1.
 &HT;    Even before the Kremlin began to acknowledge that casualties
were high, it was obvious in Mozdok. You don't erect a small tent
city in winter on the grounds of a hospital unless you have run out
of room to accommodate the wounded. Some of those wounded die after
reaching the hospital but are not listed as having been killed in
action. They are included in a separate, Orwellian category: Those
who perished as a result of trauma.
 &HT;    When I spoke with Col. Vladimir Ivantsov, the deputy chief of
the military's medical service here, he explained that the wounds
suffered by soldiers in Grozny were particularly severe because
troops fighting block by block in a city are likely to meet the
enemy up close _ and be met by accurately fired bullets.
 &HT;    ``There are more head injuries, more brain and skull injuries
and more abdominal injuries too,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, our
soldiers don't always use their protective gear, and large-caliber
bullets can punch through our bulletproof vests.''
 &HT;    Snipers took their toll. And though Ivantsov did not say it, so
did Russian ``friendly fire'' from artillery and air strikes.
 &HT;    The generals like to boast about their ``precision strikes.'' In
the time I was in Chechnya, I never heard a general admit to a
single instance of friendly fire. The soldiers often talked about
it, however, with the same resignation that they spoke of the
frigid weather.
 &HT;    The assault on Grozny was carried out by a hodgepodge of units
with somewhat convoluted command relations: Interior Ministry
troops, the Russian army, militia from Russian cities,
rapid-reaction teams and pro-Russian Chechens. The Russian troops
in Grozny said the pro-Russian Chechens followed behind during the
assault on the capital.
 &HT;    The Mozdok hospital offered terrible evidence of the Russian
army's fighting in Chechnya. Noncommissioned officers,
inexperienced conscripts and ``kontraktniki'' _ generally older
mercenaries who sign six-month to one-year contracts and fight for
pay, a totally unknown category in the old Soviet army _ all were
represented in the Mozdok hospital.
 &HT;    When I visited, Room No. 8, which also doubles as a ward, had
about 20 double-decker bunks pressed together.
 &HT;    Vyacheslav told me he was born in the Amur region of eastern
Siberia, a stunning swath of coniferous forests, rivers and dormant
volcanoes, and wanted to be a forester when he grew up. ``I used to
pick up my rifle and go to the taiga every weekend to hunt,'' he
said. ``I'd go after small game like wolverine, or if I went with
some of my relatives we might go after bear.''
 &HT;    But he is also a young man from the old school _ that is, part
of that shrinking sliver of Russian society that still aspires to
join the military, a faint echo of the old Soviet patriotism. He
found that the soldier's life was not so bad at first. The troops
fed on kasha and tins of meat. Mail arrived once a week. There was
only one radio for the soldiers of his unit, but it was enough to
allow them to follow the news, which was not particularly grim.
There was fighting, but it was limited, and the Russians soon had
things under control.
 &HT;    It might have all ended in Dagestan for Vyacheslav had not
President Boris Yeltsin installed Putin as Russia's prime minister.
Putin, a former KGB officer determined to make his mark as a
Russian strongman, saw Chechnya not as a quagmire, but as an
opportunity.
 &HT;    Sergei Stepashin, Putin's predecessor, told me that he had urged
Putin to take a cautious approach by sealing the borders and taking
the northernmost, pro-Russian third of Chechnya, which is separated
from the rebellious part of the republic by the Terek River.
 &HT;    But Putin, backed by Russia's generals, who were looking to even
the score for their humiliating defeat in the 1994-'96 war in
Chechnya, opted for an all-out invasion, which culminated in bloody
street fighting in the Chechen capital.
 &HT;    ``I have some experience in taking Grozny,'' said Stepashin, who
had served as the head of the Federal Security Service, an heir to
the old KGB, during the first Chechen war. ``So I knew the
resistance would be fierce.''
 &HT;    The generals this time promised a ``special operation'' to
liberate Grozny, saying they would not storm the capital. But their
tactics displayed little finesse. The Russians leveled blocks of
apartment buildings, as if Grozny were not a city containing
thousands of Russia's own citizens. The generals decided to make
war this way, and soldiers like Vyacheslav Kiselyov were sent to
fight it.
 &HT;    ``The soldiers I had were too young,'' Vyacheslav said. ``They
were just 18 years old. I had a sniper in my unit. He leaned out of
a window for 10 seconds and a Chechen grenadier blew his head off.
Only the lower jaw and ears were left.''
 &HT;    Conscription was a holdover from Soviet times, and during the
1996 presidential election campaign Yeltsin promised to do away
with it altogether. But as with most of Yeltsin's plans, the one to
create an all-volunteer force foundered for lack of funds. And
these days more than 90 percent of the privates and noncommissioned
officers in the Russian army are conscripts.
 &HT;    The Moscow establishment, which has hailed Putin's war and which
is trying to ride his coattails, beat the system. It shielded its
own sons with student deferments.
 &HT;    But others, such as Viktor Zlodeyev, 19, didn't even think about
trying to find a way out. The product of a flawed conscript system
that sent ill-prepared young men to war and paid them virtually
nothing for their trouble, he was precisely the kind of soldier
Vyacheslav Kiselyov worried about.
 &HT;    Wounded in Grozny, Viktor, who was also in Room No. 8, told me
he was from the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where his
father works as a truck driver and his mother serves as an
administrator in a nursery school. He completed nine years of
schooling and then transferred to a trade school to learn how to be
a bricklayer. The army grabbed him before he found a job.
 &HT;    ``My mother did not want me to go into the army,'' he said with
a shrug. ``She said, 'Why do we need all that?' But she said I
should go if I had to, and I never thought about faking a health
problem. After they took me I told the army I did not care what
kind of unit I was in but wanted to serve in Krasnodar, where my
parents live.''
 &HT;    Instead, the army sent him to Chechnya in October. To comfort
his parents, he did not tell them he was in Chechnya. When Viktor
writes his parents he tells them that he is with his brigade in
Budyonnovsk, a town in southern Russia.
 &HT;    Young conscripts told me their base pay was about 40 rubles
($1.40) a month before they arrived at the Mozdok base. Once there,
the pay was boosted to 400 rubles ($14) a month. Indeed, one of my
enduring impressions of the Russian army is that it seems to be
manned by a legion of beggars _ troops without the money to buy
decent cigarettes, which they are forced to bum from visitors.
 &HT;    As part of the orchestrated patriotism of the Chechen campaign,
local governments throughout Russia sent ``humanitarian aid'' to
the troops: candy, canned food and the like. But the officers took
it all, the soldiers told me. Even the officers are not above
asking for favors.
 &HT;    Despite his inexperience, Viktor was given one of the toughest
jobs. He was made a scout in the 205th Reconnaissance Battalion.
His first duty in Chechnya was on the Tersky Ridge. He did not fire
a shot, however, until just before New Year's Day, when he was sent
to Grozny. He was shocked by what he saw.
 &HT;    ``I experienced real fear when I saw the 200's for the first
time,'' he said, referring in Russian army-speak to the corpses of
fallen soldiers. ``They had lain there for a week before we came
in, and we had to bring them out. Some were lying on the street.
Some were in a burned-out armored personnel carrier.''
 &HT;    The ``200's'' is army shorthand for the Russian dead, and some
say it is derived from the fact that a zinc coffin and the wood
crate in which it is shipped together weigh 200 kilos.
 &HT;    A battered old bus used to travel from Grozny to Mozdok carrying
dead Interior Ministry troops. To expedite its passage through the
numerous checkpoints a small sign was placed inside the windshield:
``Cargo 200.''
 &HT;    One and all, the soldiers gave it a wide berth.

 &HT;    They convey the Tom Wolfe-ian nature of the story, its tragedy
and circuslike aspects.
 &HT;    I spent the first day of Ramadan, Dec. 9, with Kadi Diallo,
Amadou's grieving mother.
 &HT;    At one point, our driver, an Israeli, deduced who she was and
effusively offered his condolences.
 &HT;    We visited a 96-year-old Guinean immigrant to the United States,
Mohammed Korka Diallo (no relation), at his senior citizen's
residence in Harlem. He was from their village, Kadi said. She had
visited him often for conversation and comfort since coming to New
York.
 &HT;    Korka wanted to get out of his apartment for a while, so we set
up a triangle of chairs in the building's austere lobby. He told me
how he had served in the U.S. Army in World War II, how he had been
the host of Sokou Touro, the future president of Guinea, on Touro's
trip to New York on the eve of the country's independence in 1958.
 &HT;    Of Amadou's death, he said angrily: ``That should never happen
here. Never! America's the greatest country on earth. And America
is the worst country on earth.''
 &HT;    Korka, with his rheumy eyes, gazed at Kadi admiringly. ``Each
time I look at her,'' he said, ``I feel like crying. How does she
hold herself? How does she go through life? It's too much _ but
she's strong. Such a strong person _ more than a man.''
 &HT;    Kadi began to weep. He patted her leg. ``Sometimes I cry, but
it's just to let it go,'' she said. Two women recognized her as we
left and expressed sorrow for her loss. She told me that people
recognized her everywhere.
 &HT;    Back in the car, she said she had been upset all day. ``Ah,
because no food in your stomach?'' I asked, referring to the fast
of Ramadan. No, she said, because she was so far away from home on
such an important holiday. ``Some days I just want to drop
everything and go back.''
 &HT;    She began to weep again. ``I lost my son,'' she said. ``He was
23 years old and 5 months. We all expect to die, but not _ like
that.''
 &HT;    Back in the apartment, I asked her about the trial of the four
policemen accused of killing Amadou. She would be there every day,
she said, to be sure that justice was done.
 &HT;    ``And if they are acquitted?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``I will be very disappointed,'' she said.
 &HT;    Two days later she called me back. She had been thinking about
that quotation and wanted to improve on it. ``I hope and pray that
there will be a conviction _ that's why I'm calling for all the
people to stand together, so that there won't be this kind of
incident again.'' Use that, she said.
 &HT;    It reminded me of something she had also said about limiting her
public appearances so as not to abuse the sympathy people felt for
her: ``I have to think which is good to do as a grieving mother.''
 &HT;    Both quotations showed an awareness of the power of the image,
which is perhaps unseemly in a mourner _ but which, in the media
circus of New York, is probably indispensable.
 &HT;    By now, in the archives of many newspapers her name is
misspelled ``Kadiadou,'' because one of the first reporters she
talked to, she says, misheard her, and thought her name ended like
her son's. She liked that, the melding of Amadou's name with her
own.
 &HT;    Her father, she says, was unusual, insisting on the importance
of education not just for his sons but also for his daughters,
perhaps owing to his having an outspoken wife. (''I inherited that
from my mom,'' Kadi told me.
 &HT;    Even as a girl she was a beauty; when she was 14, a trader from
a nearby village asked her father for her hand in marriage.
 &HT;    Her father said he couldn't answer for Kadi: ``Go and talk to my
daughter first,'' he told Saikou Diallo, 30, a man who already had
a wife and two children. ``I don't want to give you any hope before
you do.'' Kadi was unsure but willing; she is proud now that her
father insisted that as a condition of marriage she be allowed to
continue her education.
 &HT;    Amadou, the first of their four children, was born two years
later, when she was 16. ``I was very young, and I thought I was too
young to keep him,'' she told Newsday. ``At night, I woke up to see
if he was there.''
 &HT;    As a boy, Amadou developed a lisp. His mispronunciation of her
name became a treasured nickname. ``Tatatou,'' he called her.
 &HT;    By then the family was living in neighboring Liberia, where
Saikou had a trading business. After a coup in 1980, they returned
to Guinea to escape the instability.
 &HT;    But Saikou found that the socialism of President Sokou Touro
made life hard for a businessman; he took his family to Togo. They
returned to Guinea in 1984 when the president died, and before long
moved to Thailand.
 &HT;    Saikou had mainly been trading in gold and gems and, Kadi says,
had a large store of low-quality Guinean rubies. A company in
Thailand told him they had a heat treatment for the gems that could
increase their quality. But Saikou ended up losing a lot of money
and wanted to move to Singapore.
 &HT;    Tired of constantly moving the family, Kadi refused to go and
Saikou threatened to leave. ``Maybe he was thinking I would come
back,'' she said. ``Divorce is like a threat to the woman, to have
more control _ because only a small number of women can survive
alone. Women are very disadvantaged in Africa.''
 &HT;    But she would not be dissuaded, and the marriage ended. ``I was
determined to support myself and live on my own.''
 &HT;    Having learned her husband's business, she began to trade gems
in Bangkok. Before long she moved her four children back to
Conakry, the capital of Guinea. Through connections in the mining
industry she ended up the highly paid representative of an
Australian company interested in opening a gold mine. She went to
the office every day, helping to arrange the needed permits and
permissions.
 &HT;    Amadou, who had earned a degree in computer science from a
college in Bangkok, left on a tourist visa for the United States in
September 1996.
 &HT;    ``He told me he wanted to realize his dream'' of working in
computers or electronics, his mother, Kadi Diallo said, ``because
he had seen me struggle to bring the children up and wanted to help
me. His plan was to come back and assume his place as head of the
family.''
 &HT;    But all of that would dissolve into grief.
 &HT;    For Americans, the sight of Kadiatou Diallo stepping from a
police van last February in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the
Bronx, seeing the place where police officers had killed her
unarmed son and helplessly crying, ``Amadou, Amadou,'' until she
collapsed in the arms of other West African Muslim women in
traditional robes, was a haunting spectacle, replayed endlessly on
television.
 &HT;    Her grief attached poignancy to what until that moment had
simply horrified: the unbelievable fusillade of bullets mistakenly
aimed at this particular dark-skinned man.
 &HT;    It let the world know that this victim was beloved, would be
missed.
 &HT;    At one point she told me of a sympathizer who had said to her,
``I'm very sorry for your son _ he was just in the wrong place at
the wrong time.''
 &HT;    ``No!'' she had responded sharply. ``He was in the right
place!'' Amadou, I had heard his uncle assert in the same vein,
``loved America more than most Americans.''
 &HT;    And she graphically recalled the terrible phone call from New
York when it was barely light on the morning of Feb. 4. On the
other end of the line was Abdul Karim, Amadou's cousin.
 &HT;    ``They didn't tell me how many bullets, because all the family
wanted to protect me from the shock. But little by little I found
out. Our Australian investor came in the evening, and he said, 'I'm
sorry, but they shot him many times.' And I screamed, 'Why didn't
you tell me?' Because the bullets and everything, they tried to
minimize. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'but they shot him many times,
Kadi, too many times.' And I told him: 'You must tell me. How
many?'
 &HT;    ``He said, 'It's 41 bullets.'''

   BUSHTV _ The always-tentative dance every political season
between national candidates and the powerful electronic press is
swaying to a new beat this election year. Republican candidate Sen.
John McCain welcomes reporters onto his bus with open arms, and his
so-called ``Straight Talk Express'' has produced lots of stories
that show the Arizonan in a positive light. Accesibility, the
theory goes, leads to more _ and usually more favorable _ coverage.
But has the ``McCain Phenomena,'' as some reporters have dubbed his
renegade campaign, resulted in coverage that serves the voting
public? (Holloway,Austin American-Statesman). 37.

   BUSH-JEB _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's Catholic, interracially
married governor went on national television Wednesday to defend
brother George W. Bush's visit last month to a South Carolina
college that frowns on both Catholicism and interracial marriage.
Jeb Bush said he himself would speak at Bob Jones University, even
though its published rules would mean he and Mexican-born wife,
Columba, would have been expelled for dating had they met there as
students. Bush said it was incumbent on political candidates to
spread their message to groups they might not agree with, and
accused GOP presidential rival Sen. John McCain of stooping to a
divisive ``wedge issue.'' (Date, Palm Beach Post).

sentence for murder in South Carolina for the ghastly 1994 drowning
of her two young sons in a lake. ''She has mutilated herself,
cutting her arms and wrists with whatever object she could find,''
Linda Russell writes in ''Susan Smith My Daughter,'' scheduled for
publication April 1, the latest book and one of several new media
projects focusing on the case. ''It is still as simple as everybody
still wants to know why,'' said Andrew Yex, a Los Angeles producer
working on a Learning Channel documentary, one of several recently
produced or in the works about the crime that shocked America.
Production crews for MSNBC, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Tampa television station WTSP recently interviewed people around
Union, S.C., who were involved in the case. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 35.

   LEWIS-RACE _ ATLANTA _ Lt. Mike Smith is the commander of
Atlanta's homicide unit. He also is the investigator who arrested
football great Ray Lewis. Smith also gave the most damning
testimony at Lewis' bond hearing, calling the football star a liar.
Now Smith is in hot water for allegedly making a racial remark to
two witnesses who know Lewis. The men walked out of the city's
homicide office about three weeks ago after the remark was made and
would not talk to or cooperate with police. Now the incident is
under investigation by the APD's Office of Professional Standards
and the Criminal Investigations Division. Smith confirms he said
something that was taken the wrong way. We have on the record
confirmation about the investigation, as well. (Longa-Sanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

&HT;     FIREFIGHTER'S SUIT AGAINST DOOR OPENER COMPANY NEARS COURT
DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The case of a severely injured firefighter who
has sued a leading manufacturer of garage door openers is scheduled
to go to trial next week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Stapper, 39, is seeking nearly at least $8 million from
the Genie Corp. She contends that she and a fellow firefighter were
trapped inside a garage while fighting a house fire on March 9,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers contend that the garage door opener did not work,
and that the nylon cord that can disengage the door from the
automatic system had burned.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper, who no longer works for the Fire Department, suffered
burns over 40 percent of her body and was left permanently scarred
and legally blind.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Mambretti, a 25-year veteran of the department, died in
the fire. Two other firefighters, Keith Onishi and John Pieretti,
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melanie can't work anymore,'' said Browne Greene, a lawyer
representing Stapper. ``It was one of the most tragic fires the San
Francisco Fire Department ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   During a pretrial hearing on Tuesday, Genie lawyers argued that
their product was not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that what happened to Melanie Stapper is a tragic
situation,'' said Mary Wirth, one of the lawyers representing the
company. ``But it didn't happen because of a faulty garage door
opener. She was injured because the firefighters did not watch her
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapper and the other firefighters entered the burning home
through the garage door. According to reports, there was no smoke
or flames in the garage when the firefighters carried a hose
through the garage to get to the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   Heat and smoke forced Stapper and Mambretti to retreat to the
garage, but by then the door had closed and would not open. It took
firefighters outside more than 10 minutes, according to reports, to
cut a hole in the door and get their colleagues out. Stapper was
badly burned and Mambretti died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper's lawyers said they were seeking more than $1 million
for medical expenses, $5 million for future medical bills, more
than $2 million for lost wages and an unspecified amount for
general pain and suffering.

&HT;     DAVIS' REMARKS ON JUDGES IRKS LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis shocked some legal scholars and
high-powered members of the Legislature by saying he had a litmus
test for appointing state judges.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, said the judges ``are there to reflect the
sentiments that I expressed during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that if judges broke their promise to follow his
philosophy, they should resign.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, made Tuesday at a breakfast meeting while attending
the National Governors' Association in Washington, reminded
lawmakers in Sacramento of Davis' declaration last year that the
Legislature's job was to implement his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the former lieutenant governor of California, was elected
governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Davis showed contempt for the legislative
process. Now, they say Davis is showing contempt for the judicial
process and could jeopardize fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could abolish state government and let him run it
by fiat,'' said state Senate President pro tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't support an independent Legislature,'' Burton said,
``so why would he support an independent judiciary? It's consistent
with his view that the other two branches are irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he had told all prospective judicial appointees his
views on important issues, including the death penalty and
abortion. He supports both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've let every judge know that while they do have to follow
the law, they're there because I appointed them, and they need to
keep faith with my electoral mandate,'' Davis said. ``Obviously
judges have to follow the law. But in interpreting the law, I
expect them to keep faith with the representations I made to the
electorate. Otherwise, we're doing a great disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outrageous,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor
at the University of Southern California. ``A judge is not a
Cabinet member who is there to carry out a governor's or a
president's policies.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the governor appoints trial judges directly. For
appellate court and state Supreme Court positions, the governor
makes appointments that are reviewed by a commission made up of the
attorney general, chief justice of the state Supreme Court and a
senior appeal court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Davis so far has appointed 16 judges to the state trial courts
and four to the state courts of appeal, all of whom have been
confirmed by the state Commission on Judicial Appointments.

   Warner also has made the DVD titles available on VHS, along with
15 other movies featuring Bogart. Furthermore, the video company
has put together a ``Bogart &AMP; Bacall Collection'' that contains
four films the witty, romantic couple made together.
</P>
<P>
   Because the most memorable of Bogart's characters _ damaged,
reluctant heroes _ are from the film noir period, the DVDs
concentrate on them. They are good examples of the work that gave
birth to the legend. In these movies, few of the men he portrays
are old-fashioned protagonists, courtly men who make no mistakes:
Bogart's greatest characters are busted by the depression,
brutalized by war, made violent by their dealings with criminals
and, sometimes, broken by the loss of love.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to misconstrue the offscreen ``Bogie,'' as he
came to be affectionately known, as an on-the-level, average Joe
with whom male moviegoers could identify. He possessed an
off-handed amiability, even in some of his criminal parts, that
audiences recognized as genuine. In the beginning, he seemed like a
blue-collar actor, and his studio, Warner Bros., did produce
populist melodramas, works that depicted poverty and class conflict
as major sources of crime.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, he was the privileged son of a Manhattan surgeon
who briefly attended Yale. Behind his down-to-earth facade resided
a worldly man respectful of his own limitations, who rarely
harbored aspirations that defied the odds.
</P>
<P>
   The working-class, ill-defined Bogart of the 1930s often played
second fiddle to James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson in the Warner
films. Cagney became a star by combining the graceful movement of a
dancer with his psycho-killer frenzy, and Robinson, occasionally
maniacal himself, played crime bosses who were, to some degree,
insulated by their position in the mob aristocracy, a hierarchy
that mimicked that of big business.
</P>
<P>
   But Bogart plugged away, paying his dues and perfecting his
skills in roles that ranged from comedy to tragedy and all points
in between. He appeared in Westerns, comic parts, a trucker movie,
crime films, a Runyonesque spy spoof and, of all things, a horror
movie in which he was made up to look like the sinister Boris
Karloff (``The Return of Dr. X'').
</P>
<P>
   Bogart wasn't an ideal leading man in a moral sense because he
specialized in frightening displays of hatred, uncontrolled
violence and a bitterness toward the world that are remarkable for
one who became such a beloved figure.
</P>
<P>
   Three things contributed to his rehabilitation, in spite of the
nihilistic impulses that often were hinted at: The idolization of
Bogart by the French, particularly in Jean-Luc Godard's use of his
image in ``Breathless,'' a film in which he's alluded to in a
stripped-down version of himself, a representation of debonair
nonconformity (the snap-brim hat, trench coat, shot of whiskey and
ever-present cigarette); the extremely romantic reduction of his
``Casablanca'' character, Rick Blaine, as someone worthy of
emulation in the Herbert Ross/Woody Allen ``Play It Again, Sam,''
and, during the existential disenchantment that swept American
campuses in the 1960s, the developing presumption that he embodied
a vogueish anti-heroism.
</P>
<P>
   The last conclusion was a consequence of a slight, but critical,
misreading of his celluloid nature. It wasn't that Bogart's
characters refused to do good, but recognized, as denizens of noir,
that they were operating under severe constraints, locked into
morally compromised positions from which the idea of what
constituted victory or virtue was unclear. Such men have no strict
code of honor like a knight, a soldier or a cowboy: They just
continue on as best they can, with whatever they have left to give,
or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart's characters are surprisingly complex, but, in noir,
their faces are transformed into impenetrable masks, purposefully
designed by the wearer to obscure expression. Smoking a ritualistic
cigarette, a sign of confidence and virility in the 1940s, they
withdraw into the shadows of fatalistic movies, penumbras that
conceal their motives and unspeakable vulnerability. Their verbal
forays are evasive, ironic, sardonic, even cruel _ straightforward
only when a life is on the line and then, overcompensating,
violently assertive. It's clear such men were deeply hurt.
Isolation suits them.
</P>
<P>
   But, had Bogart the actor remained a stereotypical Lone Wolf, he
might have been forgotten. For at his best, he was defined in
relation to a woman, and that is how we remember him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Maltese Falcon,'' Bogart sells out Mary Astor, whom he
loves, to satisfy his obligation to his dead partner; in
``Casablanca,'' he sacrifices his affection for Ingrid Bergman to a
greater cause than that of the individual; in ``High Sierra,'' his
death is protective of Ida Lupino's future; and in every picture
with the woman who became his wife, Lauren Bacall, he's overcome by
her affirmation of his worth and gives in to her unique, sexy
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Movie dancer Fred Astaire was incomplete without Ginger Rogers,
and that's the way Bogart was without his Bacall or Bergman.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   As Bogart's image was made whole by actresses, so were the works
of talented directors and novelists complemented by his presence.
Through his collaborations with John Huston and Howard Hawks, and
his interpretations of the detectives that communicated the beliefs
of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Bogart helped compose the
essential visage of the alienated, urban, 20th century man.
</P>
<P>
   In Huston's ``Falcon,'' Sam Spade resigns himself to Hammett's
pessimism, the author's view that love is impossible, that lies are
the true language of the world and that anything salvaged from a
bad situation by a good act is, itself, inevitably corrupted.
Hammett accepts the world as he sees it and wastes no time with
regrets. It is to Bogart's credit that he creates so much tension
in his final, condemnatory tirade against Astor's Brigid
O'Shaughnessy that he momentarily flirts with the escape that love
might provide, then, in a gesture of utter bleakness, rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, on the other hand, is a romantic who's disheartened by
the fallen paradise of Los Angeles, and his detective, Philip
Marlowe, barely survives by leading a life of unrewarded morality
and poetic solitude. In Hawks' ``Sleep,'' Bogart captures Marlowe's
ethical quality when, after his repudiation of all commitments, he
watches a little guy die to keep secret his unworthy lover's name
and whereabouts. Marlowe then pursues the crime boss and hit man
responsible for his death.
</P>
<P>
   As illuminating as these roles are, however, it's most fruitful
to consider Bogart's turning point role as ``Mad Dog'' Roy Earle in
Raoul Walsh's ``High Sierra.'' After the enjoyable, but not
likable, grotesques of Cagney and Robinson, Bogart ingeniously
humanizes the criminal. In this breakthrough performance, just
before he was assumed into the elite pantheon, exalted as a
permanent part of the Hollywood mythos for ``Casablanca'' and the
other classics, he hooks up with the general audience for the last
time as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With the Great Depression only a few years in the past, and the
people's memories still fresh with experiences of deprivation and
predatory capitalism, Bogart identifies with them, takes up the
iron pride of the worker and creates a fugitive hero. He strikes
back at the repressive monolith of a society that does not
recognize redemption and becomes a legendary outlaw for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sierra,'' Bogart undergoes the metamorphosis into Bogie, a
man in whom the audience has a loving investment, and takes his
first step, with guns blazing, into film history.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, March 2:
</P>
<P>
   NY-VILLAGE-HOUSE (New York) _ Like many people who meander
regularly through the storybook streets of the West Village, Tom
Fontana had always wondered about the strange house on 13th Street
near Eighth Avenue. Set at the end of a row of brownstones, with
its elegant Moorish window arches and stepped gable, the
three-story brick house looked like a reproduction of a
17th-century Dutch guild hall. But the formal front doors and a
chunk of the ground floor had been hacked away. By the time that
Fontana _ the television writer and mastermind of ``Homicide'' and
``Oz'' _ first stumbled upon house, in the 1980s, it looked as
though it had been through a bummer of a trip. By Nancy Hass.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT6,7,8.
</P>
<P>
   COLLECTING (Undated) _ It was a night like any other. Until I
knocked over the two and a half foot tall Finnish glass candle
pedestal, designed by Oiva Toikka in 1964. It stood in my living
room behind the Florence Knoll sofa. I paid $1,600 for it two years
ago at the Triple Pier Expo, a collectibles show in New York. The
purchase broke the ceiling on my expenditure for glass, ever. It
smashed into loose change in seconds. But that was only the
beginning of the crisis. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   LEWITT-MURAL (Undated) _ Last fall, Carole and Dick Cline were
looking for something to hang over the fireplace in the sitting
room of their new home, which overlooks a golf course near Chicago.
The couple's art consultant, Deborah Lovely, brought by a few
paintings but none that worked with the couple's antique furniture
and multicolored rug, Cline said. Then Ms. Lovely suggested a Sol
LeWitt mural _ a ``wall drawing'' in the artist's parlance. By
Christmas, the couple had something to match the rug: a geometric
drawing in diluted inks applied with sponges, covering two walls of
their sitting room _ about 250 square feet. They just didn't have a
chance to meet LeWitt. By Fred Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-DOORS (Undated) _ Leave it to Italians to solve a design
problem homeowners didn't know they had: clunky doors. Try
achieving a sleek and modern interior while dealing with throwback
terms like doorjambs and thresholds, lintels and hinges, much less
carved paneled doors. It's enough to make a minimalist swoon. By
Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   FLOWER-SHOW (Undated) _ The snowdrops are blooming and the
species tulips are popping up. Some mornings, the air is balmy and
the sun has that golden light that says, ``Spring!'' And you put on
a lighter coat and freeze to death by the afternoon, when the
winter wind blows up again. That's the signal to get on the train
and head for your favorite flower show _ to wallow in woodland
gardens impossibly blooming with dogwoods and shadbush; to bury
your nose in acres of orchids, to drool over English gardens
stuffed with blue delphiniums you could never grow. By Anne Raver.

THE PIED PIPERS OF MADISON AVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all the tens of millions of dollars spent by the George W.
Bush campaign, could no one afford a history book? Among the 174
paid staff members working in 34 Bush headquarters offices, had no
one ever heard of ``rum, Romanism, and rebellion?''
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is eerily exact. In 1884, the consensus choice of
Republicans, James G. Blaine of Maine, was plagued by ``mugwumps,''
Republicans attracted to his Democratic opponent, Grover Cleveland,
a reformer. On Oct. 29, a delegation of clergy visited the
candidate at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York. The Rev. Samuel
Dickinson Burchard, a Presbyterian minister, spoke to Blaine and to
a crowd of his supporters: ``We are Republicans and don't propose
to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose
antecedents have been rum, Romanism, and rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   A stenographer paid by the Democratic National Committee later
showed his report to Arthur P. Gorman, a Democratic senator from
Maryland. ``Surely, Blaine met this remark?'' the senator asked.
Told that he was silent, Gorman said, ``This sentence must be in
every daily newspaper in the country tomorrow, no matter what it
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   With no Internet and no television, the remark ricocheted
throughout the city and across upstate New York. Cleveland won the
state by 1,047 votes out of a million cast. New York's 36 electoral
votes meant Cleveland's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Silence is golden, but not always in presidential politics. When
the Bush campaign limped into South Carolina after losing in New
Hampshire, all its operatives could see was a captive audience of
7,000 telegenically polite supporters at Bob Jones University. None
of the campaign's many foreign-policy advisers seems to have
informed Bush that among the university's prominent supporters is
the Rev. Ian Paisley of Belfast, whose affinity for the Bob Jones
philosophy is obvious.No Bush adviser seems to have pointed out a
principle on which Americans of all faiths and parties agree, as
enunciated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, that the presidency
``is preminently a place of moral leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won South Carolina, but at a severe cost. On Feb. 25, when
he took pen in penitent hand to write a letter of apology to
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, Bush was a prisoner of history,
still a regional candidate, a stronger candidate in the late
Confederacy than in the Union. His only two primary victories,
Delaware and South Carolina, were below the Mason-Dixon line.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate apologized to Cardinal O'Connor because New York
Republican Catholics, though still conservative, share a tribal
memory of how the South rejected Al Smith when he ran for president
in 1928. Blood tells. In some high-Irish precincts in Westchester
County, many voters chose John F. Kennedy in 1960, then switched
back to Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   However Christian he is, Bush must be seething. John McCain's
attack on the broken-down Pharisees of the Christian Coalition is
pharisaic itself: ``God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men
are'' (St. Luke 18:11).
</P>
<P>
   Politics is seldom fair, nor, hallelujah, dull. Bush's brother
is Catholic, but his ``some-of-my-best-friends'' response echoes
that of Blaine in 1884. His mother was Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884, Cleveland was accused of fathering a child by Maria
Halpin, a Buffalo woman, who called the child Oscar Folsom
Cleveland. When the news broke, Cleveland did not take a poll, but
told his supporters in Buffalo in a telegram, ``Tell the truth,''
which was that he had supported the child. Negative ads in those
days were street chants. ``Ma! Ma! Where's my Pa?'' competed with
``Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the
state of Maine!'' Democrats enjoyed the last shout: ``Hurrah for
Maria! Hurrah for the kid! I voted for Cleveland and damned glad I
did!''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA SKI RESORTS ARE BRIMMING WITH SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Notes from the outdoors:
</P>
<P>
   Wall of snow: As March opens, Kirkwood Ski Area south of Tahoe
on Highway 88 near Carson Pass now has 24 feet of snow at its top
lift staging area. Other ski areas with more than 200 inches of
snow are Sugar Bowl with 228 inches (19 feet) and Alpine Meadows
with 210 inches (17.5 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Wall of water: Shasta Lake, California's biggest reservoir, has
been climbing so fast from storm runoff that water officials are
now dumping water to make room for spring snowmelt. Releases into
the Sacramento River are now at 34,000 cubic feet per second (seven
times that of a month ago), and the lake is still only 26 feet from
filling. The inside word is that the giant lake, with 370 miles of
shoreline, will be allowed to fill in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake watch: You might start bracing for a big earthquake.
California typically has 1,500 to 1,600 earthquakes per week, but
that number has fallen to under 200 for two weeks running, perhaps
indicating that pressure could be building up at the faults for a
significant shaker.
</P>
<P>
   The real record: After a 30-inch, 17-pound trout was caught two
weeks ago at Shadow Cliffs Lake in Pleasanton, it was mistakenly
reported that the fish was a lake record. Nope: An 18 1/4-pound
rainbow trout was caught last year by Roland Gove of Fremont,
raising talk that it is inevitable that a first-ever 20-pound trout
will be caught at a Bay Area lake.
</P>
<P>
   Deer draw: The Department of Fish and Game will implement a new
deer tag drawing system, called ``Draw By Choice,'' designed to
give California deer hunters a better chance of hunting in their
first-choice deer zone. In the old system, there were lots of valid
squawks where some hunters received premium tags with their second
or third choice over hunters who selected the same zone with their
first choice.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon experiment: Another 10,800 salmon have been planted at
Del Valle Reservoir south of Livermore, joining 15,000 planted a
year ago. The salmon from last year's plant now weigh almost 2
pounds, and with plenty of non-game forage available in the lake,
are expected to start hitting 3 to 5 pounds by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   California ranked No. 2?: The most recent boat registration
statistics have been released, with California (894,347 boats)
ranked No. 2 behind Michigan (980,378), but ahead of No. 3 Florida
(805,581), No. 4 Minnesota (780,097) and No. 5 Texas (625,754). But
hey, California does not require registration of non-motorized
canoes, kayaks and rowboats, as does Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Boating up, Jet Skis down: Every segment of boat sales is up
except for Jet Skis and other personal watercraft. Up: Outboard
boats and motors, inboard runabouts, inboard cruisers, canoes and
sailboats. Down: Personal watercraft, with only 106,000 sold
nationally last year.
</P>
<P>
   Camping way up: Of 59 recreational activities, wilderness
camping had the second-highest increase nationally last year of all
recreational activities, up 58.9 percent with 14.6 million
participants. Analyst Kathryn Kloppenburg credited outdoor family
adventuring for the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Slam dunk for Forest Service: A majority of America's 50 million
hunters and anglers want existing roadless areas in national
forests to remain roadless, according to a recent national survey
commissioned by the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Alliance. The
survey found that 86 percent of anglers and 83 percent of hunters
supported efforts by sportsmen and women to keep the remaining
roadless areas in national forests free of roads.
</P>
<P>
   No logic: The U.S. commercial catch quota for small coastal
sharks is 790,000 pounds. But the number of dead sharks discarded
as unwanted by shrimp netters in the Gulf of Mexico is 5 million
pounds, the International Game Fish Association report.

COLOMBIAN ALVAREZ DRAWS ON HIS LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ From the time Leonel Alvarez was a
youngster in Remedios in the mountainous region of Antioquia,
Colombia, he knew soccer would be his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 7 or 8 years old and my mother used to lock me in
the house,'' Alvarez recalled recently. ``I would have to climb out
the window to go play soccer. Everyone always wanted me to play but
I would have to make a deal with them _ after the game, they would
have to lift me up so I could climb back through the window so I
wouldn't get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez grew up to become one of Colombia's most revered
sportsmen. The image of the innocent youngster sneaking out the
window contrasts with the imposing, even threatening-looking
Alvarez, his long, curling black locks framing a sharp nose and
steely eyes. Alvarez, who joined the Revolution late last season,
can be an intimidating presence on the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   But when Alvarez is explaining the tactics of soccer to younger
players, or conducting an interview, he exudes the confidence and
warmth of a gregarious person who is comfortable with his celebrity
status.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was a part of the most celebrated generation of
Colombian soccer players ever, along with exuberant midfielder
Carlos Valderrama, extroverted goalkeeper Rene Higuita, and the
late Andres Escobar.
</P>
<P>
   They brought Colombia to the World Cup finals for the first time
and became the first Colombian team to win the South American
championship, the Copa Libertadores. They captured the imagination
of a nation and attracted a following that included Nobel
prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia was ill-prepared for this sudden success. And the
combination of fame and fortune, plus a volatile socioeconomic
situation, led to disappointment and tragedy in the 1994 World Cup
as Escobar was assassinated after a 2-1 loss to the US.
</P>
<P>
   This signaled the beginning of a decline in fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The group aged. Higuita was imprisoned after intervening in a
kidnapping. Freddy Rincon moved to Brazil, Alvarez and Valderrama
to the United States, where they are helping to guide and inspire a
new enterprise called Major League Soccer.

   ``I never imagined playing in the US,'' Alvarez said. ``But this
is a league that, in time, will be very strong. I don't know how
long it will take, though it will become a very competitive league.
The players have the qualities, they work hard, they have the
conditioning. They need a little more professionalism. They don't
need foreign players coming here on vacation, but they need the
help and support of experienced players.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Alvarez is a natural for the guidance role. On the field, he is
a commanding, composed presence, reading the game and distributing
the ball with poise and precision. In Colombia, Alvarez's hard
tackling and physical presence allowed the midfield creators such
as Valderrama to express themselves. If Colombian soccer were a
Latin Jazz band, Alvarez would be the bassist, able to lay down a
strong background rhythm whether they were playing cumbia,
merengue, vallenato, or straight-ahead jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played my first professional game Dec. 18, 1983, for
Medellin,'' Alvarez said. ``They saw me in the pre-Olympic
tournament in Bolivia, and that is where this generation all
started. Colombia always used to go home after the first round of
those tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we had Luis Perea, Bernardo Redin, Arnoldo Iguaran,
Andres Escobar. We went to the Copa America 1987 in Argentina. We
played Argentina, which had that whole band of guys, including
Maradona, who had just won the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. And we
defeated them, 2-1.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Colombians began capturing attention. Guided by
coach Francisco Maturana, an orthodontist, they expressed the
creativity and passion of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Copa America, we toured Europe and it was the first
time at Wembley for a Colombian team,'' Alvarez said. ``We made a
pact to present a great image of Colombian football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the game, and ping, ping, ping _ 18 touches, all
over the field, the English could not do anything about it. It was
a full stadium, we tied, 1-1, Andres Escobar scored the goal and
(England coach) Bobby Robson gave us great compliments. People said
we played like Brazil. In my whole life this was the very best
experience I have ever had in soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   But signs of trouble soon appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the national team players joined Maturana with Nacional,
the Medellin club that traditionally comprises only Colombian
players. Nacional won the Dimayor title and became the first
Colombian club to win the Copa Liberatores. Next would be the
Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo, another chance to project a positive
image for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, a (linesman) was killed and they suspended the season,''
Alvarez said. ``We had no games and we trained only sporadically.
And there we were, in Japan, playing a great organization like
Milan. We lacked rhythm, fitness. Despite this, we played 118
minutes even with them before (Alberigo) Evani scored.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombian national team adventure was only starting. It
qualified for the World Cup for the first time and brought an
adventurous and inspiring style to a conservative Italia '90.
Higuita was caught far out of goal by Cameroon's Roger Milla, and
the Colombians were eliminated in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombians had established themselves as a factor, not a
fluke or a novelty act. They would be back for USA '94.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, La Seleccion went to Buenos Aires and
defeated Argentina, 5-0. They were applauded off the field by a
crowd that included Maradona, who said the Colombians ``played like
we used to play.'' Pele' designated the Colombians as heirs to the
Brazilian legacy and predicted they would win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This was the highest of praise from the living masters of the
South American game. After decades of being trounced by the
Argentines and Brazilians, the Colombian Aguila (Eagle) was flying
over everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The populist bandwagon expanded to every sector of the Colombian
population. To Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the team was the
personification of magic realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Marquez came to the games and we met him and talked a
lot,'' Alvarez said. ``He is an excellent person, very intelligent,
spirited. He had a lot of hope for us. He believed we represented
the color and imagination of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fervor went beyond reason. Even Marquez got into the
spirit, wagering his automobile that Colombia would defeat the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started receiving threats before the game,'' Alvarez said.
``One of our players (Gabriel `Barabbas' Gomez) did not play
because they threatened his family and the family of the coaching
staff. It's very difficult to play with threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was this. We had beaten the US almost every time
we played, 95 percent of the games, so everyone was betting on
Colombia. Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably 95 percent of the population had wagered on Colombia.
So, it would have been disastrous for those controlling the bets
had Colombia won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere around the team had been damaged. But it
started because of the game before that, with Romania. If we had
won that game we would only need a tie against the US. We could
have tied and advanced.''

<P>
   For every bullet that pierced Amadou Diallo, there was a ``not
guilty'' written on it, and five left in the chamber. Diallo's body
is deep under Guinean soil. His four killer cops have been
unleashed back to the streets of New York. America was left
staggering, riddled in the vestibules of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal of the white officers in the massacre of the black
Diallo was almost inevitable. The prosecution had made an acquittal
a likely possibility from the start, going all the way for murder
when the cops were saying it was an accident. The verdict was
virtually sealed when Judge Joseph Teresi gave strict instructions
that played to the tears of the cops. The jury was essentially
reminded that the police have a right to shoot if they honestly
felt the object Diallo pulled out of his pants was a gun instead of
the now famous black wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The right to shoot was made clear even though it could not have
possibly been clear to Diallo that the four men, exploding upon him
out of an unmarked car and in street clothes, were indeed cops and
not muggers. The cop's right to react to fear obliterated any
consideration why they went nuts with 41 shots. These rights were
so deeply imprinted on the jury that John Patten, one of the
defense attorneys for the officers, said, ``the 41 shots dropped
out of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one shots, 19 wounds. BlamBlamBlamBlamBlamBlam! Yet, in
the jury deliberations, the shots did not exist. The acquittals on
all 24 charges _ six for each officer _ even of reckless
endangerment, said the police can fire without thought and without
conscience. They can fire without any obligation to challenge their
perceptions of Diallo, not only in the vestibule of his apartment,
but in the very first moment they decided to chase him. The verdict
said that cops can fire at will even if their perceptions led them
down a blind path.
</P>
<P>
   Justice in this trial was blind to any other consideration. What
remains is whether America will solve the riddle of the blind path.
It is a national question because this is more than just police
tactics. It is more than telling black folks to keep their hands
out of their pockets when confronted by the cops.
</P>
<P>
   America killed Amadou Diallo, with a barrage of our perceptions
that led the officers to assume that a hard-working black street
merchant could be a hardened black criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the cops think that Diallo, who was on the stoop of his
building after midnight, looked like a serial rapist instead of a
guy just trying to get some fresh air after one of his 12-hour work
days? Was it the same reason that 1988 presidential candidate
George Bush used a black rapist to symbolize crime?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Carroll, one of the four officers, said it never entered
his mind that Diallo might have been a resident in the building. He
never stopped to think that Diallo had a right be on that stoop.
Why was that? Was it the same reason that innocent black folks are
being pulled over on highways for drug searches? Was it the same
reason that nearly every black person who frequently hails cabs can
tell stories about being passed up?
</P>
<P>
   Why was it, ultimately, that when Diallo pulled that wallet out
of his pocket that the cops thought ``gun!!!'' instead of wallet?
Was it because of all the disproportionate media coverage of crime
committed by black assailants? Was it because of the all the
television and newspaper coverage of violence that has convinced
Americans, even in an era of dropping murder rates, that the
streets are meaner than ever?
</P>
<P>
   Why was it that, after the first few shots, the cops could not
realize Diallo was not firing back? Even though Diallo was a mere 5
feet 6 inches and 150 pounds, did the centuries of stereotypes,
still reinforced by network news, Hollywood, and our politics, go
from the big screen into that squad car and then into that
vestibule, turning this gentle man into a monster?
</P>
<P>
   In their tearful, yet arrogant testimony, the officers blamed
Diallo for making the fatal ``error'' in reaching into his pocket.
Right. A skinny guy is going to whip out a palm-sized pistol and
waste four armed men? More likely, Diallo saw himself being
ambushed by four armed bruisers in street clothes and wanted to
say, ``Please! Take my wallet! Just let me live!
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the police took Diallo's life and riddled the heart of
justice. This will not change unless America stops sending the
message that a dark man, by definition, is a dangerous man. Nothing
will change unless this nation stops poisoning police officers
until they are blind to Diallo's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Blam! Not guilty. Forty-one shots, 19 wounds, 24 ``not
guilties.'' For every puncture of Amadou Diallo, there was a ``not
guilty'' verdict, and five left in the chamber. Over what dead,
dark body will the next jury fire those unspent verdicts?

MCCAIN'S HISTORY-MAKING SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the highest stakes speech of the campaign to date, and
with it John McCain carved out a slot in our nation's political
history, never mind what happens with election results.
</P>
<P>
   By flying into Virginia Beach and challenging the big-money TV
preachers of the religious right, as well as their big-money
political pals in the GOP establishment, McCain laid bare the fault
line between political conservatives and religious fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The old fighter pilot put the stick over, throttled to the
redline, and screamed in low over the conservative heartland,
firing off rockets, bullets, bombs, the works. He was never the
kind of naval aviator to return to his carrier with unused
ordnance. And by the time McCain finished strafing the command
posts of the religious right Monday, both sides knew this was a
battle to the finish. Either the Arizona senator crowbars the
faithful and their votes away from the evangelical
influence-peddlers _ somewhere between one-sixth and one-third of
Republican primary turnouts, depending on the state _ or he flames
out.
</P>
<P>
   By taking dead aim on the influence of preachers like Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson, by reading Bob Jones University out of
the canon of acceptable political discourse, and by challenging
fundamentalist voters to choose between their principles and their
sheeplike fealty to the merchants of televangelistic political
palaver, McCain upped the ante. It's now a battle for the soul of
the GOP, between McCain and his band of patriotic but secular
conservatives and the political preachers embraced by the faltering
campaign of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's strident entry into the primary fight on Bush's
behalf was a sort of fatwah against McCain, in which the television
preacher castigated McCain and his followers as somehow ungodly.
After doing a slow burn for weeks, McCain stunned the party with
his rhetorical assault. Twenty-nine times McCain's audience at a
Virginia Beach high school gym erupted. The 63-year-old Arizonan
laid down a withering assault on the ward-heelers who use Bible and
brimstone to herd their flocks into voting the way big-money shoves
them.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the men he denounced as money-changers in the temple
of government, as ``people who have turned good causes into
businesses,'' McCain rallied his backers: ``America is greater than
the accumulation of wealth _ and so our party should be.'' But the
Republican establishment he rails against are ``forces that have
turned politics into a battle of bucks instead of a battle of
ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, Falwell, and the antiabortion financiers who make a
living culling money from the like-minded ``distort my prolife
positions and smear the reputations of my supporters,'' McCain
charged. ``Why? Because I don't pander to them, because I don't
ascribe to their failed philosophy that money is our message.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious right has been coddled by Republican leaders since
the Reagan success of 1980. But not till Monday did any major GOP
figure go this far: ``The political tactics of division and slander
are not our values. They are corrupting influences on religion and
politics, and those who practice them in the name of religion or in
the name of the Republican party or in the name of America shame
out faith, our party, and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech will become a landmark. It surpasses in scope
and gravity Bill Clinton's shrewd denunciation of Sister Souljah in
1992, after the black entertainer made intemperate remarks whites
found objectionable. McCain's challenge ranks up there with Mario
Cuomo's bearding the Roman Catholic antiabortion lobby in his 1984
Notre Dame speech after the Catholic bishops sided with Ronald
Reagan over Walter Mondale. And McCain's eloquence is similar to
Jack Kennedy's speech to Protestant ministers in 1960, when he
challenged the fundamentalists to accept his sophisticated
elucidation of faith vs. patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone is coming to understand, once McCain sets a course,
he does not pull his punches. Surging in the affection of most
categories of voters, save those of the orthodox Republicans,
McCain tried to go over the heads of the establishment leaders who
troop along behind the shadow of the Incredible Shrinking Texas
Governor. Bush wanders between aimlessness and apology, wanly
accusing McCain of religious bigotry after he himself was forced to
apologize to Catholics for whomping up the rednecks at retrograde
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   If you read no other political text this year, go to
www.mccain2000.com and scan the contents of McCain's speech. Some
passages will give liberals heartburn, but you don't have to buy
all of the boilerplate insertions intended to placate conservative
activists to marvel at the derring-do of the challenge to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was hushed as McCain told of how a North Vietnamese
prison guard used to sneak into his cell at night to release the
torture ropes, enabling the badly injured POW to pass the night in
some comfort. At dawn the guard would noiselessly return to
retighten the ropes. One Christmas morning, the same guard slyly
drew a cross in the dirt of the prison yard, letting McCain know he
too was a Christian. ``That is my faith,'' concluded McCain, ``the
faith that united and never divides, the faith that bridges
unbridgeable gaps in humanity. It is the faith I would die to
defend.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may yet turn out to be the faith that drives the
televangelical money-changers from the temple of politics.

 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.: ... and advanced.''

<P>
   On June 22, 1994, the US broke a 10-year losing streak against
the Colombians. Escobar, retreating to cover a sharp cross from
John Harkes, deflected the ball into the Colombia net. The bookies
breathed easier and an entire populace went into shock. The
Americans were actually winning. Ernie Stewart would make the score
2-0. A desperate rally cut the deficit to 2-1 on a late header by
Adolfo ``El Tren'' Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Escobar was gunned down outside a Medellin
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the news I broke into tears and couldn't stop
crying all night,'' Alvarez said. ``We had played together and been
through so much, counting on Andres to give us security in the back
in so many big games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian soccer boom effectively had ended. The Colombians
would continue to enchant with their imaginative play. They would
produce precocious talents such as Ivan Cordoba, who is starting
with Inter in Milan, and 16-year-old Johnnier Montano of Parma.
</P>
<P>
   But the inconsistencies and incongruities persist. One day,
Colombians are euphoric because the team has reproduced the magic
of the recent past and the next day it has lost to Brazil, 9-0.
Coach Javier Alvarez was fired after that defeat, and noted ``a
week ago we were gods.''
</P>
<P>
   La Seleccion has provided an avenue of hope, sense of pride, or
at least an outlet from tensions, for Colombia. But the
socioeconomic problems are now inhibiting the progress of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people don't have work, so they can't buy a ticket to the
stadium,'' Alvarez said. ``They can't get work because of what is
going on there. Trucks are stuck on the road with fruit rotting.
The people want to work, but jobs are becoming scarce. And now, no
one is going to invest in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seleccion needs to play games against top teams to
improve. Look at who they have played and lost to recently _ El
Salvador, Trinidad. But you call Scotland and tell them you will
pay them $100,000 to come to Colombia and they will say they can't
come. They are afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Seleccion can help the image of the country but not if they
lose, 9-0. But the problem is not coaches or players. The new coach
could lose a game, 8-0, then what happens? The problem is the
directors. They always remain the same and this is the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia and the US could be headed for another showdown in the
Gold Cup in Miami. The Colombians beat Jamaica and the US defeated
Haiti in their opening games. Alvarez is there, a symbol of his
country, but with sensibilities for both nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is a small country and we have a civil war, yes,''
Alvarez said. ``We have bombs, narcotrafficos. But it is a very
beautiful country, very pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am worried. Everybody has fear in a civil war. I want
my family to come here but they want to stay in Colombia. It is
their home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez's wife, Maria, and children, Leo Estefano, 8, and
Valentina, 6, will join him in Boston. His mother, Fabiola Zuleta,
a clothes designer, and sisters, Maria, Gudiela, and Sandra, will
remain in Colombia. And his father?
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is Dios,'' Alvarez said. ``I say that because he
abandoned us when we were kids. So, God became my father. Now, I
remember that when my kids are sick, and I run to get them what
they need because I remember the sadness of not having a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to mature quickly. I had to supervise my sisters with
their boyfriends, tell them what time to leave. It would be 10:30
at night and they would have to leave because I had to get up to
play soccer the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my sisters got married, since we had no father, I had to
go to the church to give away the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was acquired by the Revolution from Dallas in a trade
for Ecuadoran striker Ariel Graziani late last season. The team
struggled under player-coach Walter Zenga but his replacement,
Fernando Clavijo, is building the team through the middle, using
Alvarez as a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for (Zenga) as a player and as a coach,''
Alvarez said. ``Unfortunately, things didn't work out. He did the
best he could and the important thing is, he put his heart into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando was a great player and knows a lot about futbol. We
have to be willing to die for him and the other coaches on the
field. It's all about heart. You play every game like it is a
final, and you are playing for the title. We have a coach with a
human side and if we don't play for him they are going to bring in
an army-style coach to order us around. We have to set our goals
high, to win the title, and then we will at least make it into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in two World Cup finals, the Copa Libertadores,
Copa Intercontinentale, Copa America, Olympic qualifying. And now,
I want to win a title in the US.''

LOW EARNERS, DISTRUSTFUL OF BANKS, TURN TO CHECK CASHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Armed with utility bills and clutching checks, the
crowd begins forming every morning shortly before 8.
</P>
<P>
   One recent frigid day, the regulars hovered in the cold,
patiently waiting for the doors to the Boston Checkcashers office
to open so they could pay bills, send money electronically to
relatives, and cash weekly paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd and some say pernicious twist, low-income Americans
are so distrustful of banks that they are shunning offers of free
checking and savings accounts and choosing instead to pay stiff
fees at check-cashing outlets and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   These businesses are booming, enjoying the support of the 10
million Americans who do not have checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust banks and I don't trust myself with checks,''
said Carolyn Brown, 31, a single working mother who frequents a
Boston Checkcashers store near her home.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a cashier at a grocery store, used to have a checking
account, but had to give it up after she ``bounced too many
checks.'' She decided then that her banking days were over. No more
ATM cards, no monthly checking-account fees, and no worrying about
balancing checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the high fees that the check-cashing stores
charge, but I'm generally satisfied with them,'' Brown added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's suspicion of banks is not rare. About 40 percent of US
families with incomes below $10,000 don't have a checking account,
compared to the 1 percent of families with incomes above $50,000,
according to a 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, released by the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ``unbanked'' citizens and many community activists
say check-cashing stores have historically served as an alternative
to established banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The check-cashing stores have been here for residents when
banks wouldn't come into our neighborhoods,'' said Joyce Stanley, a
community activist and executive director of the Dudley Square Main
Streets, a city-run effort to help revitalize economically
depressed neighborhoods. ``I think they'll be around for a long
time, especially since certain people have established a loyalty
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics charge that check-cashing companies, which charge as
much as 10 percent of a check's value to cash it, are draining the
wallets of poor and working-class people already struggling to cope
on limited means.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford the check-cashing fees, but many of us have
tried to get bank accounts before but were turned down,'' said
Regina Woods, 44. ``It's a no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a fundamental ignorance,'' said Kevin
Dillard, executive director of the Organization for New Equality, a
Boston-based national organization that has been critical of the
check-cashing industry. ``It's all in the spirit of good
old-fashioned laziness. These people go into the same check-cashing
store, and they don't look at the fact that they're being taken
advantage of by the check fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond having to pay high fees, people who patronize
check-cashing outlets also are hurting their financial future,
Dillard said, because ``saving money isn't possible, and
establishing credit isn't possible either.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Powers, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of
Transitional Assistance, said expensive fees at check-cashing
firms, along with fraud problems, led the department three years
ago to give clients Electronic Benefit Transfer cards instead of
checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get rid of the exorbitant charges that
check-cashing stores charged,'' Powers said. ``Now, individuals can
go right to the ATM machine and withdraw funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials for check-cashing companies say that while it may
cost more to do business with them, the higher price allows them to
provide better services to customers who do not want to deal with
the rules and regulations of traditional banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the people who come into our lobby are here for a
reason,'' said David Backman, assistant director of Boston
Checkcashers Inc, which operates a chain of 19 stores in and around
Boston. ``We provide a service to the blue-collar person who
doesn't have an ATM or checking account and who don't want to be
nickel and dimed by the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Backman noted, many check-cashing stores do things that
many banks don't, such as wire money electronically or allow
customers to pay utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a 7-Eleven,'' Backman said. ``You can come to us
for convenience, but you're going to have to pay for the
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation and popularity of check-cashing companies has
made it difficult for banks trying to move into neighborhoods and
attract customers they had in the past ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Bank has launched a $250,000 campaign in Massachussetts to
encourage residents to open up basic checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check-cashing stores offer a convenience to many customers
that banks didn't offer several years ago; that convenience now
exists with banks,'' said Jim Schepker, a spokesman for Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling residents that if they establish a relationship
with a bank, they'll gain access to a full gamut of products and
services,'' Schepker said. ``They can open a lifeline checking
account and deposit their check in an ATM machine and immediately
draw funds from that check. But I don't think many people are aware
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A basic checking account, Schepker noted, could cost customers
as little as $2.50, which allows for 10 monthly transactions _ a
much lower cost than traditional check-cashing fees.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than 100,000 people streaming in and out of Boston
Checkcashers stores every year, Backman said, the industry is now
branching out beyond low-income customers to try to tap
middle-class residents.
</P>
<P>
   Backman would not release profit figures for his company, but
nationwide the industry makes millions of dollars each year,
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sowyrda works for Boston Cashcheckers as a Beacon Hill
lobbyist. One result: MBTA bus passes are sold at the check-cashing
stores. ``In the last five years, we've become respected.'' he
said. ``The stigma of welfare mothers coming in here to cash their
checks has disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Backman said, there is a price to be paid for making it
easy for customers to cash checks. Sitting at his desk, he
periodically glanced down at the returned checks piled high on a
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these people walked away with money,'' he said,
pointing to checks that were sent back after payment was stopped or
rejected due to insufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making money, but we still lose money each year,'' he
said. ``We've got to spend money and time trying to collect on
these checks. We don't like cashing personal checks. It's too much
of a risk.''

NO RAIN ON THIS PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take that, Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth effect bothering the Federal Reserve chairman so much
got a little richer Tuesday, as the Nasdaq stock index roared ahead
by another 118 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, loaded with the hot technology stocks worrying
the Fed, has gained a whopping 15.4 percent over the first two
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is everybody else. Though the Dow Jones
industrial average enjoyed a relatively upbeat session Tuesday,
gaining 89.7 points to 10,128.3, the ``old economy'' benchmark is
still down 11.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The widening gulf between old economy stocks and the shares of
high-tech ``new economy'' companies is startling by any measure. It
certainly isn't what Greenspan had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   He is not wholly responsible for what analysts today call a
bifurcated market. But there is no doubt that the Fed's push toward
higher interest rates has dragged down many stocks while having
virtually no impact on the most speculative highfliers Greenspan
would like to temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he intended to do was take the wind out of the sails of
the speculators, but all he did was kill the old economy,'' said
Scott Black, president of Delphi Management Inc. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates to slow an economy it believes is
growing too rapidly. But Greenspan has clearly raised a ``wealth
effect'' caused by huge stock market gains as a factor stoking the
hot economy. He may not really care about the value of stocks, but
is keenly worried about how those high prices ripple through the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Those higher rates, the traditional stick used by
Fed chairmen to tame excesses, haven't made a dent in the dot-com
stock world. The Nasdaq index has soared by 71 percent since Sept.
30. Tuesday was just another sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to dampen the expectations of investors today you'd
need to have a lot higher than a 7 percent Treasury bond,'' said
Robert Goodman, chief economist at Putnam Investments in Boston.
``You would need 10 percent to kill the market, expectations are so
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the market has been wilting in the face
of rising rates. Some sectors, such as bank stocks, are slumping by
25 percent or more since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more (Greenspan) has jawboned and the more the Fed has
acted to raise rates, the more he's harmed these old economy
stocks,'' said Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at
FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For all the impact Greenspan has had on the stock market in
recent months, he has been explicitly reluctant to use one tool at
his disposal that would likely hit those hot stocks in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   Initial margin requirements, the rules that govern how investors
can borrow money from brokers to buy stocks, are controlled by the
Fed but have not been touched since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules require buyers to put up at least 50 percent of
the cost of stock purchases. Increase that ratio and you deflate
some leverage in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you changed the margin requirement, it would be
targeted directly at the frothiness of the market,'' said Samuel
Hayes, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School. ``My
guess is the Fed is afraid to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes thinks there is a good reason to think twice about that
course, comparing it to a ``firecracker'' that could spook stocks
and send them sharply lower. He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing margin requirements is a very public, symbolic event
that can possibly lead to a significant correction and he wants to
avoid that at all costs,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA
Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes, Zandi, and others think there are more discreet ways
for the Fed to put more pressure on borrowing by stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   Margin debt has increased substantially over the past two years,
but has absolutely soared since last November. Margin loans
increased by 25.4 percent to $228 billion in the last two months of
1999 and jumped by 62 percent for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of margin is stunning,'' said Frank Fernandez,
chief economist for the Securities Industry Association. ``The rise
we saw toward the end of the year exceeded our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that brokerage companies have already
begun to tighten some margin requirements on their own. Many have
increased so-called maintenance margin requirements on the market's
most volatile stocks, even refusing to loan customers any money to
purchase a select few.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance margin, the rules governing cash-to-borrowing
percentages in a brokerage account on an ongoing basis, is changed
daily on specific stocks at some brokerages based on market
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The list of stocks with higher maintenance margin requirements
set by US Clearing, a division of Fleet Securities Inc. whose rules
affect accounts at Quick &AMP; Reilly, Suretrade, and other brokerages,
rose to about 100 by January 1999. The same list covers about 250
stocks today.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy borrowers are not always buying stocks with all the
online discount brokerages you might expect. Fidelity Investments
reports only about 6 percent of its online brokerage customers are
borrowing on margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As markets get more volatile, that's why you look at it more
closely,'' said Tracey Curvey, executive vice president of Fidelity
Online Brokerage. ``We've always looked at this stuff very closely,
particularly in those accounts that are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Greenspan would have no better luck cooling the market's
hot engine by pressing banks and brokers on their stock lending.
But it can't hurt to aim a little closer at the real target.

BOSNIA MEETS LONDON IN `BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's hope for Europe yet in ``Beautiful People,'' Jasmin
Dizdar's absurd, mean-spirited and finally optimistic comedy about
Yugoslav refugees and multiculti Londoners, contrary to all their
basic impulses, finding ways to get along.
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian living in England, Dizdar packs this multicharacter
roundelay with what initially appear to be ideas borrowed from
leading British filmmakers of the moment: Danny Boyle's visual
flash, Mike Leigh's eccentric character condescension, Ken Loach's
lefty social agenda. But gradually, a surreal yet humanistic humor
all his own emerges in Dizdar's film. ``Beautiful People,'' like
any number of movies from Britain or the Balkans, wallows in the
self-destructive tendencies of both individuals and tribes. The
difference with this one is in how it draws sentimental jollity out
of any number of ugly messes.
</P>
<P>
   Types from opposite ends of the continent, the class system and
the tolerance pool find their generally unsatisfactory lives
improved by interacting with foreign individuals. Dizdar, who also
wrote the screenplay, follows through on this central premise
without letting things get too schematic _ different story lines
have nicely varied comic tones and gradations of nastiness _ and
allows stories to overlap in a loose, natural-seeming way.
</P>
<P>
   On the wackier end of the narrative scale, a Croat and a Serb,
former neighbors, end up in side-by-side hospital beds after
chasing and pummeling each other through half the city. With the
ingenuity of determined invalids, one continues trying to kill the
other, always to be thwarted by an unflappable nurse and their ward
mate, an angry Welsh arsonist burned in his efforts to destroy
English vacation houses in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Even crazier is the tale of the young, junkie soccer hooligan
(Danny Nussbaum) who, too stoned to make it across the tarmac to a
plane headed for a Dutch World Cup qualifier, passes out on a
pallet of supplies that is then air-dropped into the war zone,
where his vice takes a topsy-turvy heroic turn.
</P>
<P>
   On the soapier side of things, a schlubby ob/gyn, his own family
in tatters, convinces a war rape victim and her husband to love the
baby that they don't want. There's also a BBC reporter who goes
barmy in the Balkans, comes back thinking he's a refugee and
somehow confuses his employer with Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In the plotline that best combines humor, horror and feel-good
forgiveness, a romance blooms between a displaced Bosnian
basketball player (Edin Dzandzanovic) and the rebellious
doctor-daughter (Charlotte Coleman) of a family of Tory twits. ``I
am, personally, very much against ethnic cleansing'' the sniggering
future brother-in-law says at one of those painfully awkward
meet-the-family dinners, but darned if the snooty Brits and the
regretful, penniless athlete don't find some kind of common ground
through love.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there's a lot of wishful thinking in ``Beautiful
People.'' The ongoing refrain of the oversimplifying peacemaker _
if only we could get to know each other as people, we'd discover we
have nothing to fight about _ echoes throughout the film. But
Dizdar and his cast (which blends experienced actors with talented
amateurs) go to great lengths to ensure that we do get to know the
people on screen. And he doesn't let any of them off easy, which
helps a great deal to make the film's polemics personal and alive.
We're glad when these characters' conditions improve, and even
happier that most of them learn how to be a little kinder in the
process. &QL;

HARVARD INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the famous place, after all, that not so long ago
licensed its famous name for T-shirts sporting that famous
yabba-dabba-doo Harvard man Fred Flintstone. It did, however, say
no to Bart Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   And now Harvard University is saying no _ maybe _ to Harvard
Pilgrim as it teeters on the brink. Let's see: Fred Flintstone yes,
Harvard Pilgrim, maybe, maybe not. This makes sense?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is, indeed, one famous name. Punch up Switchboard.com,
the online telephone directory, and you'll come up with 725
individual listings for Harvard nationwide. There are more than 250
in Massachusetts alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so confusing. Maybe I can help. My credentials? I live
on Harvard Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Business Review is part of the university, the
Harvard Gay &AMP; Lesbian Review is not. Harvard Book Stores in
Cambridge, Harvard Gulch Golf Course in Denver, Harvard Coney
Island in Detroit, and Harvard Drive-In Liquors in Santa Paula,
Calif., are not. The Harvard Course of Bartending, on the other
hand, is. So is the Harvard Independent, a magazine, though it
isn't independent.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has been making news in recent years. Harvard Financial
Services (not to be confused with the keeper of Harvard's billions)
admitted it was broke several months back. Harvard Industries,
however, has been out of bankruptcy protection for more than a
year. Harvard International Technologies (stock symbol: HIT) folded
when its french fry vending machine fizzled. My favorite: Harvard
Scientific Corp. recently ran afoul of the Food and Drug
Administration for misleading test results on its male
anti-impotence drug. The stock sells for 51 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard tells me it is most concerned about protecting its good
name when it involves its core missions like education. These
schools then should be receiving a letter any day similar to the
one the university just sent Attorney General Tom Reilly on Harvard
Pilgrim: the Harvard School in Chicago; Harvard Academy in
Flushing, N.Y.; Harvard Academy in Sunrise, Fla.; Harvard-Westlake
School in North Hollywood, Fla.; Harvard-Kent School in
Charlestown; and Harvard public schools from Tacoma, Wash., to
Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard says the move to assert its rights regarding Harvard
Pilgrim is in line with its increased vigilance in protecting the
name over the last few years. The university's doomsday scenario in
Harvard Pilgrim's case is that a for-profit firm will buy it and be
able to use the name to sell almost anything without the
university's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Harvard? It's happening. There's Harvard Group (in five
cities), Harvard House (in four cities), Harvard Hall in
Washington, and Harvard Hall Bingo in Philadelphia. It's hard to
figure out what is not being hawked with the Harvard name.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (the university) is, in fact, a jewel that is woefully
underappreciated here. Without Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, on a
good day, wouldn't be Topeka. The two universities, hands down,
have done more than any other two institutions to make Boston the
place it is today.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard, for all its good intentions, has managed to pull
off a remarkable feat: In the course of a couple of weeks the
university has gone from a potential hero in the Harvard Pilgrim
mess to a potential goat. Harvard has no responsibility to bail out
Harvard Pilgrim from its own stupid mistakes, but it also shouldn't
be throwing a monkey wrench into Reilly's delicate attempts to save
the HMO, either.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, the Coke of education, has a responsibility to protect
its name. But it must pick its spots; Harvard Pilgrim is neither
the time nor the place. If Harvard wants exclusive control of its
name, it should find a name that every pizza shop and financial
planner on the block isn't already using.
</P>
<P>
   Something catchy like The World's Greatest University, which was
coined by my modest pal Alex Beam. And Beam might just be willing
to license it to Harvard _ for a fee and subject to the proper
restrictions, of course.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Proving you don't necessarily need to whack somebody over the
head with zaniness to get them giggling, the makers of ``Drowning
Mona'' get a lot of mileage out of elements that its characters
don't acknowledge. Consider the vanity plates on the Yugos driven
by every character in the town of Verplanck, N.Y.; or the ``As Seen
on TV'' sign above the local mortician's shingle. Wacky stuff of
that ilk is constantly flitting across the screen and disappearing
before we're even aware we've been goosed.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, this screwy whodunit starring Danny DeVito and
co- produced by his Jersey films doesn't exactly get by on nuances.
Writer Peter Steinfeld milks a running gag about a character having
one hand _ the local cops are practically obsessed with it. And
exactly how subtle can you be depicting a town floozy (played with
seen-it-all blowziness by Jamie Lee Curtis) who totes a Wheel of
Fortune board game to her motel room trysts? (``I let you buy a
vowel. Then you wanted a free spin!'')
</P>
<P>
   Forced? Occasionally. Offbeat? Definitely. Funny? Oh yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of a trailer trashy ``Ruthless People,'' ``Drowning Mona''
has Bette Midler at her shrewiest, DeVito doing Columbo and any
number of brain-challenged Verplanckians acting like they've been
spent the past 10 years sniffing model airplane glue in a Mayberry
watering hole. Nobody's a great character study, but they're sure a
kick to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with much-hated Mona Dearly (Midler) driving a
sabotaged Yugo off a cliff into the lake, thereby forcing the
town's Broadway show tune-loving sheriff Wyatt Rash (DeVito) to do
some actual detective work. The suspects include Mona's
philandering husband Phil (William Fichtner), her son Jeff (Marcus
Thomas) and possibly even Phil's mistress Rona (Curtis).
</P>
<P>
   Also under suspicion is Bobby Calzone (a blond-mopped Casey
Affleck), a sweet but dim-witted type who operates JB landscaping
with Jeff. Bobby is someone the sheriff would rather not have to
arrest, since the kid's about to marry Wyatt's daughter, Ellen
(Neve Campbell). Through flashbacks, dear old Mona gets plenty of
opportunity to show why she richly deserves to sleep with the
fishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt's work isn't all that challenging, since every citizen
seems to live within a 10-mile radius, and, except for Bobby,
nobody in Verplanck seems to work much. They're too busy moteling,
boozing, fishing or composing musical odes to Mona's death. Wyatt's
deputies are far more interested in finding out what
!ital!really!ital! caused Jeff to lose his hand than in determining
who took Mona down.
</P>
<P>
   Director Nick Gomez, who has directed episodes of ``Oz'' and
``The Sopranos'' for HBO, demonstrates a deftness at comedy both
broad and deadpan. Certainly we're expected to laugh at these
upstate yokels, but their foibles resonate as well. (As a favor,
Bobby asks his brother to perform a ``brotherly de-boning'' for the
wedding dinner.) Steinfeld's script zings one-liners pretty much
from start to finish. Not all of them hit, but those that do are
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Since her turn in ``Ruthless People,'' Bette Midler has turned
playing a harpy into an art form; Mona's a cakewalk for her.
DeVito, who might otherwise have been cast as Phil, plays it
straight and calm here, although Sheriff Wyatt's a bit of an
oddball himself. Nearly walking off with the movie in a great cameo
is ``Saturday Night Live's'' Will Farrell (a dead ringer for Chevy
Chase) as Cubby the mortician.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case anybody wants to visit Verplanck _ a real
place, by the way, population less than 4,000 _ its on-screen
version is played primarily by Sierra Madre, a little town east of
Pasadena which, I would wager, does not have a single Yugo in its
entire city limits. &QL;

The film: ``Drowning Mona'' (PG-13, language, some sexual
material). &QL; 
The stars: Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Neve Campbell, Jamie Lee
Curtis. &QL;

GOOD BUZZ FOR `WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, March 3 or later. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women are from Venus, men are from Microsoft in Garry
Shandling's shaggy, soft-centered comedy ``What Planet Are You
From?'' Created and co-scripted by the erstwhile star of ``The
Larry Sanders Show,'' it features Shandling as an alien from an
all-male world of technologically advanced, emotion-free,
genitalia-deprived takeover artists whose assignment is, with the
help of a loudly buzzing mechanical aid, to get an Earth woman
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   While the line ``What's that noise?'' invariably proves a
running joke in the movie, what comes out of Harold the alien's
mouth elicits a wider range of puzzled responses because, of
course, the space guy's come-on lines aren't exactly deft. That's
to be expected from this kind of premise, as is, perhaps, Harold's
eventual conversion by a good woman to a guy-thing with feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise here, though, is that rather than the burlesquey
tone you'd reckon would go hand-in-hand with interplanetary sex
comedy (remember ``Earth Girls Are Easy''?), director Mike Nichols
keeps the humor behaviorally based and psychologically credible.
The film is greatly aided in this by an Annette Bening performance
that's every bit as good as her Oscar-nominated work in ``American
Beauty.'' She may marry a man from outer space in this one, but
it's more of a relationship than anything she had with Kevin
Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to come from Seattle (see? Microsoft), Harold pretends
to be a banker and makes a fool of himself on the Phoenix dating
scene until his smarmy, duplicitous co-worker Perry (Greg Kinnear)
shows him where to really score: at an Alcoholics Anonymous
meeting. And he does, more or less, with Bening's winsome
recovering groupie Susan.
</P>
<P>
   She's led a pretty indulgent life up until then, and even though
Susan's sworn off sex before marriage as determinedly as she's
kicked the juice, something about Harold's straightforward yearning
for a family really turns her on. Against her and her best friends'
better judgment, Susan rushes into a Vegas quickie with the earnest
suitor. The weeklong honeymoon breaks all previous consummation
records. Susan doesn't even mind the buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   But serpents slither around this galactic Eden. An obsessed FAA
investigator (John Goodman) is onto Harold's true origins. The
visitor's own world leader (Ben Kingsley, appropriately humorless)
is impatiently asking why all the furious activity is taking so
long to produce a zygote. Meanwhile, the once attentive Harold not
only seems interested in only one thing when it comes to Susan; she
starts suspecting that he's incapable of even understanding
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Reductive as all this sounds, Nichols and his two leads do an
impressive job of making the story's dating manual insights feel
organic. In his first movie starring role, Shandling refracts that
Sandersian discomfort through a detached, slightly surreal mask
that fits remarkably well on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   And when Harold starts to get it _ I mean the emotional stuff _
the expressions on Shandling's face are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Bening who really anchors the piece. She brings out all
of Susan's disappointments, longings, high hopes (her impromptu
pajama performance of the old song, by the way, is the most
disarming movie moment so far this year), affection, insecurity and
distemper without ever straining a feeling or transition between
them. And, somehow, she remembers to stay funny most of the time.
Nichols keeps a light comic rhythm percolating, too. He paces the
laughs, and the attempted laughs, at a leisurely enough clip to
give us time to get involved with the characters. There's also
ample opportunity to savor Bo Welch's production design, which
makes the most of Arizona red rocks, sterile otherworld sets and
airplane bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In his maturity, the director of such word-driven movies as
``The Graduate,'' ``Carnal Knowledge'' and ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?'' has developed a deeper appreciation for film's
visual pleasures. At the same time, Nichols' instinct for what can
go right and doesn't between women and men-creatures remains
sophisticated and, still, a yearning, exploratory thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' never reaches real
out-of-this-world heights. But it's grounded in smart, solid human
comedy of a kind that's all but alien to Hollywood these days. &QL;

MAKESHIFT FAMILY OFFERS DELIGHTFUL DISFUNCTION IN `MIFUNE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For release Friday, March 3 or later. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Mifune,'' a successful young Danish businessman gets an
alarming call the morning after his remarkably strenuous wedding
night. His father has suddenly passed away, which comes as a shock
to his bride (who is, of course, his boss' daughter). She, like all
of Kresten's other Copenhagen acquaintances, believed that he was
an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, you see, that Kresten (Anders W. Berthelsen) was
ashamed of his rural origins in apparently urban-prejudiced modern
Denmark. While this may come as a surprise to those of us who
primarily associate the tiny country with dairy products, Kresten
must, embarrassing as it may be, go back to the family farm and
settle affairs. He figures it'll take a few days, tops, to engage a
real estate broker and arrange for institutionalizing his mentally
handicapped brother, Rud (Jesper Asholt).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things don't quite go according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically _ and this being one of those Dogma 95 Vow of
Chastity productions, everything here should theoretically be quite
theoretical _ the connection between the film's title and bucolic
Scandinavian comedy goes back to ``The Seven Samurai,'' in which
the great Toshiro Mifune played a peasant masquerading as a member
of the warrior class. To make matters more accessible for the
cinema illiterate, Kresten dresses up like Mifune every now and
then to calm his disturbed brother's jangled nerves, since
something about the Japanese actor provided childhood amusement.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take long for our corporate warrior to go pretty
country himself, slacking around the back 40 and putting on
flannel. He can claim he's stuck there because Rud violently
resists resettlement, but he really digs the comparative lack of
responsibility. And when he entices a city girl _ actually, a
prostitute _ to come out and care for the brother, Kresten has even
more incentive to get in touch with his inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Liva (Iben Hjejle) is lovely, and Rud likes her because he
thinks she's one of his favorite comic book heroines. She has a
bratty adolescent brother herself _ she only hooks, golden heart
that she is, to fund his boarding school education _ and when that
kid moves to the farm, the surrogate family is complete.
Dysfunctional maybe, but then, troubled movie clans rank right up
there behind cheese when we think of Scandinavian exports, don't
they?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the thing about this Dogma nonsense: It is, with some
evidence of self-joshing, a list of back-to-basics rules filmmakers
agree to follow that will supposedly result in more honest,
character-based movies. In practice, it kind of works. The first
Dogma film to reach these shores was ``The Celebration'' a couple
of years ago, and it fooled some into thinking that its angry
cliches about incest were fresh and stimulating because the movie
wasn't lit very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mifune,'' too, eschews all but natural light sources. But this
film's more experienced director, Soren Kragh-Jacobsen, composes
much better-looking pictures than ``Celebration's'' Thomas
Vinterberg showed us. The older filmmaker's characters are also
quirkier and funnier, although they exhibit bracingly credible
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Mifune,'' like ``Celebration,'' bears an almost
hokey devotion to tried-and-true narrative notions that are hardly
out of step with Hollywood formula. The championing of simplicity,
ad hoc family values and lovable fools the film revels in may be
presented with more rigor and honesty than cutesy commercial fare
would allow.
</P>
<P>
   But farm fresh, these insights ain't. &QL;

MCCAIN AND BUSH TAKE TO THE LATE-NIGHT AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the clock edges toward midnight, Senator John
McCain and Governor George W. Bush were to sharpen their wits and
vie for votes in televised campaign forums that are about as far
from C-Span as they can get.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be on NBC's ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,''
while Bush will appear via satellite on CBS's ``The Late Show With
David Letterman.'' They are the latest in a bipartisan parade.
</P>
<P>
   As politics steadily morphs into a branch of popular culture,
and as young and undecided voters become harder to reach, leading
candidates are jostling more eagerly than ever for a spot on the
couch next to Leno, Letterman, and the other barons of wee-hours
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``These appearances have become mandatory,'' said Steven
Redicliffe, editor of TV Guide. ``It's like a comedy primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In that ``primary,'' it is the youth vote that counts. Most
late-night shows target viewers who are 18 to 34. A recent survey
by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that
nearly 1 in 10 Americans said they regularly pick up information
about the presidential campaign from Leno, Letterman, and their
cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   But of those respondents younger than 30, the percentage was
much higher _ 47 percent _ who said they were informed ``at least
occasionally'' by the late-night shows.
</P>
<P>
   In appearing on shows that use politicians like them for
monologue fodder, Bush and McCain, the GOP presidential hopefuls,
will join a list that has included both Democratic candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, and First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a candidate for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are simply going where the voters are. ``If you
want to reach nonpolitical people _ which is, let's face it, most
Americans _ then you go on Letterman or Leno,'' said CNN analyst
William Schneider. ``Gore knew it, Hillary knew it. It's become
part of the political circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the rules of the stand-up comedy circuit that
apply on these shows, and candidates ignore them at their peril.
While the questions tend to be softballs, there are certain
hard-and-fast rules political guests must follow to avoid becoming
show-biz flops, which Leno spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring some stories, have some fun,'' advised the Andover-born
comedian. ``It's not `Meet the Press.' We tell the candidates to
`Avoid the stump-speech answer; people are looking for the other
side of you. . . . Show a sense of humor, show a lighter side.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``No one wants a candidate to come out and say `Jay,
here's my position on the S &AMP; L tax credit.' '' Leno groaned at the
very thought. ``Shaaaddduuuppp!'' he said to the phantom candidate.
``You're supposed to show you're a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently enough, that is exactly what the candidates have in
mind. If all goes well, as it did when Hillary Clinton appeared on
Letterman's show last month, the one-liners they have assiduously
rehearsed will appear spontaneous when delivered on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary did wonders for herself here,'' observed Rob Burnett,
executive producer of Letterman's show. Her appearance also
resulted in a ratings spike, but Burnett said the idea behind
booking Bush and other candidates is to have them ``come
face-to-face with Dave, and Dave's sensibility, and see how they
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   By venturing into the late-night arena that young people have
always embraced as their own, a candidate's goal is to achieve a
quick image makeover as hip, fun, iconoclastic, and a good sport _
in sum, a figure for whom young people should vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers you an opportunity to show you're one of the guys,
you can laugh at yourself,'' said TV historian and analyst Steven
D. Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Bush and McCain campaigns did not return
requests for comment. On the Democratic side, Gore spokesman
Douglas Hattaway said the late-night shows enable candidates to
``speak to people through the programs they actually like to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more about showing the personal side of the candidate
than people really get through the evening news,'' said Hattaway.
``What's more important than the message is the impression: that
they can take a joke, and make a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Josh Galper said his candidate doesn't let the
monologue barbs dissuade him from sitting down with the hosts who
delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You roll with the punches on these things,'' said Galper.
``They're shows where you need to have a sense of humor.'' From the
standpoint of the Bradley campaign, the candidate's appearances on
``The Tonight Show'' and ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' are ``a
great way to make outreach to all sectors of the population,
because the demographics are very wide and the audience is very
large,'' according to Galper. Leno and Letterman average around 4
million households per night.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy candidates have long known the benefits of appearing on
comedy shows. Stark noted that John F. Kennedy appeared on ``The
Tonight Show'' when it was hosted by Jack Paar, and that Richard M.
Nixon did a memorable stint on ``Laugh-In,'' where he intoned the
show's trademark line, ``Sock it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Bill Clinton who capitalized most fully on the
political possibilities of these shows. First, Stark said, Clinton
went on ``The Tonight Show'' in 1988 to redeem himself from a
disastrously long-winded speech at the Democratic National
Convention. Then-host Johnny Carson pretended to time Clinton with
an hourglass.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the fall of 1992, presidential candidate Clinton played
the saxophone on ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' endearing himself to
younger voters and beginning a trend that has only accelerated
since then.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are so eager for late-night exposure that they
overlook months of scathing treatment at the hands of the hosts.
Booking Bush on Letterman's show took ``one phone call,'' according
to Burnett. ``Bush and McCain are in a dogfight, so they're doing
everything they possibly can,'' Burnett observed.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bush has been skewered relentlessly on ``The Tonight
Show'' _ Leno cheerfully admitted that ``We've done a lot of jokes
about drug use'' and about the high rates of executions approved by
the ``compassionate conservative'' _ but the Texas governor finally
decided that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. He'll take his
chances with Leno on Monday as a ``Tonight Show'' guest.
</P>
<P>
   As for Leno, all he hopes for is a few minutes of good
television. As is his policy with all candidates, he sent McCain
and Bush a highlight reel of ``all the jokes I've done about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Meet the Press,'' the ``Tonight'' show isn't looking to
break any earth-shattering news. ``You can't hope the whole
republic goes in the toilet because you get 20 good minutes,''

   ANDOVER, Mass. _ The Oakland Museum was planning an exhibition
on the California gold rush. Among experts whose advice the museum
sought was Patricia Nelson Limerick. Why not have a ``smell''
booth, the University of Colorado historian suggested, a display
where museumgoers could experience the odors of a 19th-century
mining camp: ``sewage, rotting food, and a collection of people not
overly committed to bathing''?
</P>
<P>
   The museum demurred, but the suggestion was classic Patty
Limerick: iconoclastic, unblinking, very down to earth. It was also
good for a laugh. These qualities have helped make Limerick, 48,
the best-known living historian of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody asks `Patty who?,' '' says Richard White, Byrne
Professor of History at Stanford University and a longtime friend
of Limerick's. ``They always know who you're talking about.'' It's
a knowledge that extends beyond academe. Throughout much of the
Mountain time zone, Limerick is a familiar figure as no academic is
two hours to the east. From newspaper op-ed pages to legislative
conferences, she maintains a very high profile.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Limerick so influential _ and controversial _ is her
central place in the New Western History, the revisionist movement
that came to dominate the field in the '90s. ``I really don't know
`New Western History' is a term we would have chosen,'' Limerick
says, ``but it exists.'' To critics such as Gerald D. Nash,
Distinguished Professor of History emeritus at the University of
New Mexico, the movement ``politicizes'' and ``oversimplifies''
with a ``politically correct'' version of the Western past. To
adherents, it offers an understanding of the region that is far
richer and more nuanced, as well as darker and more overtly
ideological, than did the largely triumphalist interpretation of
Western history that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   The movement received its calls to arms in 1987 with the
publication of Limerick's ``The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken
Past of the American West.'' ``It aroused more controversy _ or got
more attention _ than any book I can think of in Western history,
unless you go back to Frederick Jackson Turner'' in the 1890s, says
Nash. The New Western History has produced more impressive works of
scholarship _ William Cronon's ``Nature's Metropolis,'' for
example, or Donald Worster's ``Rivers of Empire'' _ but none has
had the impact Limerick's did.
</P>
<P>
   Partly that was happenstance: She was writing at the right time
about the right place, with the old Western history starting to
crumble and its successor about to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it was personality: ``The worst thing you can ever do is
to try to follow her on a podium,'' says White, who along with
Limerick, Cronon, and Worster formed what came to be known as the
movement's ``Gang of Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a cross between Diane Keaton's Annie Hall and Jane
Darwell's Ma Joad in John Ford's version of ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' and you have some idea of what Limerick's presence is
like. Setting off her sad eyes and grave face are the merriest of
laughs and a gently madcap manner. Indeed, when she was an
assistant professor at Harvard in the early '80s, she had herself
appointed the university's first, and as yet only, official fool.
At Colorado, she holds no such post, but comedy has contributed no
small part to her intellectual impact. She doesn't so much tell
jokes as offer an endless stream of antic throwaways. When she
compares her situation as a present-minded historian to that of ``a
medical practitioner getting stuck in a coroner's office: The
coroner's work is very interesting, but it's sort of after the
fact,'' she delivers that ``sort of'' with an aplomb worthy of Bob
&AMP; Ray.
</P>
<P>
   At once self-effacing and forthright, Limerick is that rarest of
creatures: a soft-spoken fast talker. A murmury cataract of words
and ideas issues from her. She digresses. She rambles. She
digresses within a ramble, as when she likens herself to ``a bull
out of a chute _ well, a heifer out of a chute _ of course, heifers
don't come out of chutes, do they? _ so let's say a highly
energized animal coming out of a chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's surname befits her style. She owes it to her husband,
Jeff, an architect. ``It's a shame to think that that name could be
wasted on people who don't make the most of it. But even the
options that would be closest to it _ Patricia Nelson Doggerel? _
are nowhere near as sprightly and satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's first book since ``Legacy'' has just been published,
``Something in the Soil: Field-Testing the New Western History.''
The subtitle is somewhat disingenous: The results are long since
in, as Limerick's own career attests. In the past decade, she has
served as president of the American Studies Association, won a
MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant, and is currently on the
board of the Organization of American Historians. Most notable of
all, she's current president of the Western History Association _ a
state of affairs that only a few years ago might have been likened
to Crazy Horse taking command of the Seventh Cavalry. ``We're now
what the people we attacked were in the 1980s,'' laughs White,
himself a past WHA president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad in some ways. I was such a good young
rebel,'' Limerick laments. ``My editor said a few weeks ago, `We'll
probably do a reissue of ``Legacy'' with a new foreword. You can
describe how the field's changed and you've moderated some of your
positions.' I said, `What! Moderated my positions? I haven't
moderated my positions.. . . All that's happened is I've gotten
sneakier!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The sneakiness is a function of Limerick's having become such a
public figure in the West. She long ago outgrew preaching just to
the converted. Limerick may be the only historian, for example,
ever to have addressed the International High-Level Radioactive
Waste-Management Conference (``I got some very funny looks when I
stepped up on that dais, let me tell you, but afterwards at least
20 engineers asked for my business card and a copy of the
speech'').
</P>
<P>
   Her critics write off Limerick's public speaking as self-
promotion. ``I don't know any other historian who holds press
conferences,'' says Nash. Limerick sees it quite otherwise: as, for
lack of a better term, good citizenship. Her goal is nothing less
than ``the reinvigoration of the academic world through engagement
with public audiences.'' She considers the idea of the university
as ivory tower _ detached, aloof, oblivious _ to be inimical to its
educational function and lethal to its long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's critics also indict her for confusing history with
current events. If there's one complaint about her work that
friends and foes agree on, it's that she's much more a synthesizer
than researcher and far more at home writing polemical essays than
roaming archives. Limerick concedes the point, but doesn't
necessarily see what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``An armchair quarterback is what a historian is,'' she says.
``Now some historians are in denial about their involvement in the
present: `I am writing about the past purely on its own terms and
transcend my presence in this moment.' I guess that's nice work if
you can get it, but it's not the most productive kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   What brings Limerick to Andover is an example of the unexpected
approach she can bring to the study of the West. She's here to give
a talk at Phillips Academy about a guide she is helping to prepare
on, of all things, cultural literacy and etiquette for the West.
That would seem to have about as much to do with the region as does
Phillips Academy (which if it were any less Western would quite
literally be in the Atlantic Ocean). What does Annie Oakley have to
do with Amy Vanderbilt _ and at an august New England prep school,
no less?
</P>
<P>
   Well, raised pinkies and finger bowls is the least of etiquette.
What it really concerns is the maintaining of a common set of
assumptions about how people should behave in society. And it's
precisely a society that's diverse and fractured that most needs
one. The idea of Western etiquette helps reminds us of just how
varied the West is: native Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Anglos,
Mormons (a category that can comprise all the preceding), the list
goes on. A guide to cultural literacy and etiquette for the region
is, in fact, nothing so much as a sly and user-friendly venture
into thick-description sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Andover also underscores one of the fundamental tenets
of Limerick's writing. As White puts it, ``She's hammered on a
theme, which because she's been so successful people don't realize
how original it was: You simply can't write about the history of
the United States as if it happened mostly in the Northeast and,
during the Civil War, for a little while in the South. This is a
large and diverse country, and what happens in the West makes a
great deal of difference in how it turns out. She's never been
somebody who's tried to segregate Western history from larger
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Herself a product of the West, Limerick grew up in the small
Mojave Desert town of Banning. ``It was very interesting,'' she
says, ``though I did not know that at the time.'' She recalls a
youth mostly spent playing Ping-Pong, reading too much, and looking
forward to leaving.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz
(the most countercultural campus in the UC system), then went to
Yale with the intention of studying aging in America. Limerick had
never been east of Salt Lake City, and things did not get off to an
auspicious start. ``I was in tears for three months,'' she says
with a laugh, but it wasn't so funny at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In her second year, Limerick took a course on the American West
with the Yale historian Howard Lamar. ``He was so kind and so nice
and so pleasant and so encouraging and so human,'' she says, ``I
think I would have followed him anywhere.'' Her intellectual course
was set. After completing her doctorate, she spent four years at
Harvard, then went to Colorado in 1984. Neither Limerick nor the
region has been quite the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Boulder, even though I was grumpy and
homesick and missed Cambridge (Mass.), I still was aware that I had
received one great boon in life. If I left a very irritating
department meeting and started walking home, when I did that in
Cambridge all I did was walk into crowds in Harvard Square and get
more irritated as I crammed onto the Arlington bus and got
crankier. In Boulder, especially if the faculty meeting let out at
sunset, you start walking home and you're stalking along, and you
look at the Flatirons, and that golden glow they get, and within a
block or two you're thinking, `I don't know if that meeting was so
important.' It's a wonderful thing . . . to be in a place where the
wonder of the Creation is called to your attention as often as it
is there.''

MASTER VIOLINIST ALEXANDER TREGER SHARES HIS EXPERTISE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he took away nothing else from his training, violinist
Alexander Treger learned the pivotal lesson that a teacher _ no
matter how accomplished he becomes at his craft _ never stops being
a student. It was internationally renowned violinist David Oistrakh
who imparted that bit of wisdom back when Treger was a student at
the Moscow Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I have always remembered,'' said Treger, 51.
``Every student, every group, every orchestra. You can learn a lot.
It's a two-way street, and I definitely feel comfortable with this
way of teaching where I trust my students.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good outlook for a man whose career has seldom been
without a student to teach or a young orchestra to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   There have been the master classes Treger has taught all over
the world, and his 20-year affiliation with UCLA's Music
Department, where he taught violin. Since 1993, Treger has been the
music director and conductor of the chamber orchestra at Crossroads
High School, and, most recently, he took over at the helm of the
American Youth Symphony following the retirement of the orchestra's
founder, Mehli Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about his work with young musicians that gets him
so fired up? Treger said it's the thrill of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you come to rehearsal on a Saturday morning, and you
have a group of young people playing a familiar piece of music _
like Beethoven's Fifth or Tchaikovsky's Fifth _ something a
professional orchestra has performed thousands of times,'' said
Treger from his home in Tarzana. ``What I experience with the young
people, most of them are experiencing it for the first time, and
it's that enthusiasm, that novelty of playing something that is so
familiar to professionals that makes the music that much more
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   When he talks about his AYS performers, who range in age from 18
to 25, there is nothing paternal or didactic in Treger's tone. He
is an instructor, yes, but one who knows his pupils are
exceptional, that they will move on. The constantly rotating crop
of musicians are among the finest in Southern California. Many of
them will ``graduate'' AYS _ considered a training orchestra _ and
move on to positions with the L.A. Philharmonic and with prominent
orchestras across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While they're here with AYS, they'll learn from maestro Treger,
and he'll learn from them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell my friends and supporters, `Please come to the
rehearsals on Saturday mornings,''' said Treger. ``Performances are
one thing, and the environment is more formal, but to see the
interaction, the learning process, the experience young people get
of trying to learn a new repertoire ... part of my biggest pleasure
is sharing with them the experience I had of playing in orchestras
for more than 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his second season as music director-conductor of the AYS,
Treger is only the second person to occupy the position. Mehta led
the symphony for 33 years before retiring at the age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Treger tell it, there was little disruption when the
orchestra switched leaders. While the two men have different
conducting and musical styles, the tradition Mehta established
remains in good hands with his hand-picked successor, said Julia
Cser, AYS concertmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them have a great love for music,'' said Cser, 22, a
five year-member of the AYS, who has worked with both men. ``Both
of them had that basic hope and goal to make beautiful music, which
I definitely think is the best thing for us to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first worked with Treger, during his stint as a guest
conductor, Cser found herself intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in the back of my mind, he's this great violinist,''
said Cser. ``I was always very insecure, and I was the principal
second violinist, so I was sitting right under his nose. I was so
scared I couldn't even move.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has put us all at ease. He's so sweet, so kind and very
helpful. He's putting his heart and soul into this.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra rehearses once a week, performing once a month
between October and May, in free concerts at UCLA's Royce Hall.
Sunday will be its annual gala benefit at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, a performance featuring guest soloist John Nakamatsu and
actor Gene Barry as the guest narrator during the performance of
Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait.'' Nakamatsu's performance is donated
free of charge, as is the case with all the guest artists
performing with AYS.
</P>
<P>
   The evening will also feature Bernstein's overture to
``Candide,'' Rachmaninoff's ``Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini'' and
a segment from Gershwin's ``An American in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   It's primarily an American program, which, according to Treger,
was a deliberate choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be quite interesting for our audiences,''
said Treger. ``Also it was something the young people in our
orchestra need to know. So that was the idea behind it. We are,
after all, the American Youth Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Treger said he is delighted whenever the orchestra gets
attention but is unwilling to single out individual members for
praise. That wouldn't be fair to the rest of the ensemble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that in years to come, we will hear about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll continue to hear from their leader as well. In addition to
his solo violin performances, Treger is the concertmaster with the
L.A. Philharmonic, a position he has occupied for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as a musician,'' he said. ``There are many
aspects of being a musician, in my opinion. Performing, teaching,
conducting _ that's what I do. That's what makes my life as a
musician full.''
</P>
<P>
   But not composing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that very early in my life,'' Treger said with a
laugh. ``It wasn't very good.'' &QL;

<P>
   CIR-DENTAL-SCHOOL (Undated) _ Starting this fall, students at
seven dental schools will be spared the strain of toting heavy
textbooks to and from the library. They won't even need to go to
the bookstore to buy a single textbook, workbook or laboratory
manual. Instead, each incoming student will be asked to purchase a
DVD containing the entire curriculum _ textbooks, manuals and
lecture slides _ for all four years of dental school. By Lisa

<P>
   CIR-ONLINE-PAYMENT (Undated) _ Cyberspace is littered with the
flotsam of online-payment schemes that have failed. Companies like
DigiCash, First Virtual Holdings and CyberCash have either gone
bankrupt or undergone extensive makeovers. Now, just when the
language has begun to absorb the letter ``e'' as a prefix, comes
the latest twist on electronic money and the language of the
digital age: mobile commerce, or m-commerce, which promises to turn
your cell phone or handheld organizer into an electronic wallet. By

   CIR-ONLINE-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The column: The problem with
Marthastewart.com has nothing to do with the selection. Covering
all facets of housekeeping from kitchen storage to soap making, the
site sells useful, high-quality tools to help you in many
endeavors, from dispensing aluminum foil to treating your skin to
the exfoliating wonders of crushed apricot seeds. No, the problem
is this: many of the nonexclusive products at MarthaStewart.com are
overpriced. By Michelle Slatalla.

   CIR-SWAP-SITES (Undated) _ Much of what is on the Web these days
has a price tag attached. But with a string of new sites devoted to

be bought with that old sewing machine in the garage or your
lightly dog-eared Dean Koontz novels. By Catherine Greenmabn.

they are. By Julie Flaherty.

</P>
<P>
   NY-VILLAGE-HOUSE (New York) _ Like many people who meander
regularly through the storybook streets of the West Village, Tom
Fontana had always wondered about the strange house on 13th Street
near Eighth Avenue. Set at the end of a row of brownstones, with
its elegant Moorish window arches and stepped gable, the
three-story brick house looked like a reproduction of a
17th-century Dutch guild hall. But the formal front doors and a
chunk of the ground floor had been hacked away. By the time that
Fontana _ the television writer and mastermind of ``Homicide'' and
``Oz'' _ first stumbled upon house, in the 1980s, it looked as
though it had been through a bummer of a trip. By Nancy Hass.

   With photos, NYT6,7,8.
</P>
<P>
   COLLECTING (Undated) _ It was a night like any other. Until I
knocked over the two and a half foot tall Finnish glass candle
pedestal, designed by Oiva Toikka in 1964. It stood in my living
room behind the Florence Knoll sofa. I paid $1,600 for it two years
ago at the Triple Pier Expo, a collectibles show in New York. The
purchase broke the ceiling on my expenditure for glass, ever. It
smashed into loose change in seconds. But that was only the
beginning of the crisis. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   LEWITT-MURAL (Undated) _ Last fall, Carole and Dick Cline were
looking for something to hang over the fireplace in the sitting
room of their new home, which overlooks a golf course near Chicago.
The couple's art consultant, Deborah Lovely, brought by a few
paintings but none that worked with the couple's antique furniture
and multicolored rug, Cline said. Then Ms. Lovely suggested a Sol
LeWitt mural _ a ``wall drawing'' in the artist's parlance. By
Christmas, the couple had something to match the rug: a geometric
drawing in diluted inks applied with sponges, covering two walls of
their sitting room _ about 250 square feet. They just didn't have a
chance to meet LeWitt. By Fred Bernstein.

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>

   ITALY-DOORS (Undated) _ Leave it to Italians to solve a design
problem homeowners didn't know they had: clunky doors. Try
achieving a sleek and modern interior while dealing with throwback
terms like doorjambs and thresholds, lintels and hinges, much less
carved paneled doors. It's enough to make a minimalist swoon. By
Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   FLOWER-SHOW (Undated) _ The snowdrops are blooming and the
species tulips are popping up. Some mornings, the air is balmy and
the sun has that golden light that says, ``Spring!'' And you put on
a lighter coat and freeze to death by the afternoon, when the
winter wind blows up again. That's the signal to get on the train
and head for your favorite flower show _ to wallow in woodland
gardens impossibly blooming with dogwoods and shadbush; to bury
your nose in acres of orchids, to drool over English gardens
stuffed with blue delphiniums you could never grow. By Anne Raver.

   Steely Dan/``Two Against Nature'' (Giant/Reprise)
</P>
<P>
   In Steely Dan's universe, time moves at a snail's pace, but
their sound remains as sharp and engaging as it did on ``Gaucho,''
the tightly wound duo's last studio outing nearly 20 years ago.
Mixing pop hooks with jazz harmonies and sly, cryptic lyrics, the
instantly recognizable Dan still fashions music that arguably
deserves its own category. Too edgy for smooth-jazz radio and too
sophisticated for most pop and rock stations, Dan's Walter Becker
and Donald Fagen seem destined to reach a loyal following that
includes adult rock radio, critics and a bunch of unusually patient
fans. Too bad for everyone else because ``Two Against Nature'' is a
superb record, immaculately crafted and a perfect fit next to such
gleaming Dan highlights as the timeless ``Aja'' and ``The Royal
Scam.'' There's no museumlike quality here. The songs, including an
infectious, radio-ready ``Cousin Dupree,'' the darkly poignant
``What a Shame About Me'' and the top-notch groove of the title
track, are fresh and exciting, making for delicious repeat
listening. ``Two Against Nature'' starts the year on a joyous note.

<P>
   Smashing Pumpkins/``MACHINA/the machines of God'' (Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, the Pumpkins released the
electronica-tinged ``Adore,'' a dour collection that suggested rock
auteur Billy Corgan had hit a creative wall. For the band's
hideously titled fifth effort, Corgan attempts to balance his
pretentious ballad leanings with his pretentious metal fixation
with often unlistenable results. It's not just Corgan's strangled
I'm-so-scary delivery that grates this time. On such plainly
unappealing tracks as the winsome ``Heavy Metal Machine'' and the
10-minute ``Glass and the Ghost Children,'' you hear the
self-indulgent blather of someone who's been told he's an Artist so
much he actually believes it. It's a shame because Corgan has
created some memorable music, chiefly on the band's 1993
breakthrough, ``Siamese Dream,'' which remains the Pumpkins' only
essential disc. 1 1/2 stars &QL;

   Yo La Tengo/``And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out''
(Matador)
</P>
<P>
   Yo La Tengo's hushed, gently melodic music stems from the
musical and marital union of drummer Georgia Hubley and guitarist
Ira Kaplan, who have taken the Velvet Underground's inspiration to
gorgeous heights of indie-pop minimalism. On the guitar band's
recommended 10th album, the group's moody sound and textures are
expanded. Frequent listenings turn up new spices simmering
alongside pulsing beats, the strum of an acoustic guitar, nearly
whispered vocals, washes of organ and shimmering vibraphone. The
band appears March 13 at the El Rey Theatre. 3 1/2 stars &QL;

   Various/``Organ-ized'' (High Street)
</P>
<P>
   This 13-track compilation proves that the Hammond B3 organ is
alive and well. Indeed, organ-led jazz has been enjoying a bit of a
renaissance these days, and ``Organ-ized'' features some of the
instrument's young lions (Larry Goldings, Joey DeFrancesco) along
with the grand master himself, Jimmy Smith. There is a bit of
sameness to some of the modern-style selections, but the album
includes enough variety (fusion, blues, r&AMP;b) to keep any party
movin' and groovin'. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR;

</P>
<P>
   Sheila Chandra/``Quiet'' (Narada World)
</P>
<P>
   Chandra _ a fiercely independent singer of Indian descent, who
melds her otherworldly vocal talents, East-meets-West sensibilities
and minimalist accompaniment in often startling intersections of
atmospheric sound _ here reissues one of her oldest solo
recordings, from 1984. This is, indeed, ``quiet'' stuff, wordless
waves of vocalizing laid over spare Western and Indian
instrumentation, hypnotic in an understated way, but without the
driving bliss-trance sounds of more traditional South Asian
artists. She covers some of the same interesting if geographically
indefinable territory as Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, with
roughly the same admirably high success rate. More recently,
Chandra's work has been combined with more explicitly
dance-oriented sounds by others, a fusion that promises fruitful
new avenues for the work of this distinctive artist. 3 stars &QL;

By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who believe the joy in farming has disappeared, we'd
like to introduce Clare and Bill Braden.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves fruit peddlers. We'd say they're symbols of
Texas spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late-life entry into the business, despite a
devastating freeze, despite farming as corporate culture, this
couple has made a success of the orchard business in one short
decade.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't come by their 44-acre citrus grove in the usual
inheritance manner. Instead, they sailed around the world before
they found their senior calling.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer by training, Bill designed and built projects as
diverse as marinas and meat plants. Finding the 1970s a frustrating
business climate, the couple sold their business north of Amarillo
and took off on a seven-year sea voyage that registered 44,000
nautical miles. They sailed to California and over to Hawaii, and
then spent three years in the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought we'd retire in St. Croix,'' says Clare,
``but if you need a doctor there, you're out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   While sailing the oceans blue, the couple tied up at Port Isabel
for several weeks. They fell in love with the Rio Grande Valley and
the possibility of a retirement surrounded by fragrant citrus
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sharp decline in farming in the Valley (before 1962
there were 176,000 acres in citrus cultivation, today there are
35,000) the Bradens figured they could build the house of their
dreams and hire a grovekeeper to ``do the citrus thing.'' In 1987,
they bought their property.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Rio Grande Valley, as in most agricultural areas,
time is marked by the last weather disaster. In the Valley,
conversations are constantly peppered with the phrases ``the 1983
freeze'' and ``the 1989 freeze.'' In 1989, the Christmas freeze was
so devastating that acreage in citrus production plummeted to zero.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Braden says the freeze was the best thing that happened
to his little grove, the smallest commercial property in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We designed our new farm by the book. We had the planting
areas laser-leveled; we installed a new irrigation system; we
planted the newest varieties of grapefruit and orange; we enclosed
our 6,000 trees with a chain-link fence.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the couple had also designed and built a processing
plant for their fruit. But that wasn't quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bill bought and installed a tram for the property, to entertain
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had ordered the thing to run back and forth from Texas
to Mexico and then found out there were all sorts of international
regulations. He told the guy to sell it to the first sucker who
came in,'' Braden says.
</P>
<P>
   So now the tram and Clare's ``shed,'' actually a gift shop at
the orchard, make up a ``citrus Knott's Berry Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the gift shop and the fruit production, the couple have
made the orchard self-sufficient. They also have an interest in son
Jim's Las Colinas Pharmacy _ ``it's nice to get a check every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998-99, the couple shipped more than 5,000 cartons of citrus
and sold an additional 800 tons in their gift shop. And you just
know that when there is another freeze, the Bradens will weather it
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Getting there:
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Pride Orchard is at 14748 Hoss Lane, Harlingen. The
orchard sells its fruit through its Web site, www.riopride.com, and
by phone at (800) 864-7728. Grapefruit season begins in late
October and runs for 25 weeks.

Attorney Robert Johnson for saying they ignored key evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am livid about what he said,'' juror Charise Smith said
Tuesday. ``He threw it back on us. ... It was sickening, to throw
it back in our laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, Timothy A. DeTraglia, said: ``Where was the DA?
Why wasn't he there?'' Johnson did not go to the Albany County
Courthouse, where the trial was held, until four weeks into the
case, when the jury started deliberating.
</P>
<P>
   The four white officers, Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward
McMellon and Richard Murphy, were cleared of murder, manslaughter,
criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment charges for
the shooting death of Amadou Diallo. The 22-year-old immigrant from
Guinea was gunned down in the vestibule of his Bronx home on Feb.
4, 1999. The officers fired 41 shots, striking him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism for the way the case was handled, Johnson on
Monday said the evidence was ``loud and clear that Amadou Diallo
was prejudged.''
</P>
<P>
   DeTraglia, who is white, disputed that. ``This was not a black
and white issue that I could see from them,'' he said. ``He was so
concerned about racial profiling, why wasn't he there? ... This is
not a slam on him, but if he wants to make it a racial issue, he's
got to prove it, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson criticized the legal system for moving the trial from
the Bronx to Albany. The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court
ruled that pretrial publicity would make it difficult to conduct a
fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told a news conference that he disagreed with some
jurors who said they had no choice but to acquit based on the
evidence presented to them. ``I don't think anybody can say that
they couldn't come to those conclusions if they wanted to,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called the news conference to answer charges that his
office mishandled the case. The jury announced its decisions on
Friday after 21 hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Johnson's remarks were irresponsible. ``He's putting
fuel on a fire that's already burning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Lavette Freeman, said in a television interview that
the prosecution had given her no basis to return a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that hurts,'' said Freeman, who is black. But, ``I have
to take it back to the district attorney's office. They didn't give
me anything. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, Helen Harder, said the panel was ``unhappy'' with
the result of the case, but that the jury as a whole felt the
evidence against the officers was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bronx prosecutor declined to comment on the
juror's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough. We are not commenting,'' said spokesman
Steven Reed, adding, ``We don't beat up on jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also sharply criticized the prosecution's case, saying she
could not understand the decision not to question a key defense
witness, who testified that the officers acted properly when they
approached Diallo. She said that left the impression that the
officers acted properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only testimony we had on the approach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other jurors, Smith and DeTraglia said they had
received harassing telephone calls.

   Hollywood big shots are heading to Santa Barbara this week, not
to get away from it all as usual, but to meet, greet, see movies
and do business at the 15th annual Santa Barbara Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival, running today through March 12, boasts 20
world premieres and 15 U.S. premieres, as well as tributes to
Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Pryor and Ivan Reitman.
</P>
<P>
   The festival opens tonight with a screening of ``The Big
Kahuna,'' a new drama starring Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and Peter
Facinelli, at the Arlington Theatre. Facinelli and first-time
filmmaker James Swanbeck, who directed the original Chicago run of
the play, will answer questions about the film.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins will receive the
festival's Modern Master Award for his body of work in an event
hosted by Edward Norton. Film critic Leonard Maltin will interview
Hopkins on stage about his career, from his debut in ``The Lion in
Winter'' to his latest release, ``Titus.'' A screening of ``Remains
of the Day'' follows.
</P>
<P>
   The closing-night event is the world premiere of the family
drama ``Price of Glory,'' starring Jimmy Smits and made by
first-time feature director Carlos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other world premieres are:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Astoria,'' a drama about a young man in New York, who tries
to break away from the strict values of his Greek-American family,
directed by Nick Efteriades and starring Paige Turco and Rick
Stear.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story,'' a
documentary about the legendary Disney animator made by his
granddaughter, Leslie Iwerks.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Noriega: God's Favorite,'' director Roger Spottiswoode's
take on the final years of Manuel Noriega's reign. Bob Hoskins
stars as the Panamanian dictator.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Steal This Movie,'' a biopic about '60s radical Abbie
Hoffman starring Vincent D'Onofrio and directed by Robert
Greenwald.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also offers nine seminars and panel discussions,
five of them dealing with digital technology. This Saturday's
topic, ``Has Indiewood Taken Over Hollywood?,'' addresses a broader
issue: The new trend among studios to produce films with an
``independent'' feel to them, apparently in response to the
commercial and critical successes enjoyed by Miramax, New Line and
other indie companies.
</P>
<P>
   Passes range in price from $225 to $750. For more information,
call the festival office at (805) 963-0023 or go to

ISRAELI LEGISLATIVE OBSTACLE COULD IMPERIL SYRIAN PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak suffered a political blow
Wednesday that revealed the instability of his broad-based
coalition and complicates his peacemaking efforts at a time when he
is trying to entice Syria back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Defying Barak's appeals for coalition unity, three of the six
parties in his government joined forces with the opposition to
approve a preliminary bill that would make a referendum on peace
with Syria extremely difficult to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require an absolute majority of all eligible
voters, and not just those Israelis who report to the polls, to
approve a referendum. It is a draft bill, and could well get tied
up in committee deliberations and prevented from returning to the
floor for months. Many doubt it will ever become law.
</P>
<P>
   But its approval Wednesday, by a 60-53 vote, sends a signal to
Syria, which is already skittish, that even if Barak is willing to
concede the full Golan Heights in negotiations, he may not be able
to win public backing for what he promises.
</P>
<P>
   It also reveals a collapse of discipline within Barak's
coalition, points at the possibility of defections, and bodes ill
for the array of key decisions ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments, Barak characterized the vote as a
``parliamentary trick'' and said it would not deter him from his
goals. ``I don't take lightly what happened today in the parliament
but we can't read too much into it,'' he said. ``Some 1.8 million
citizens have given me a mandate to bring a new future to the state
of Israel and no parliamentary trick will stop the majority from
deciding its stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition did not elect me,'' Barak said. ``The people
did. And what is connected to the coalition, believe me, I will
deal with the coalition at the proper time.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition parties which chose to challenge Barak were
Yisrael Baaliya, the Russian immigrant party, the National
Religious Party, which represents the Jewish settlers; and Shas,
the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party that has been Barak's most
difficult political partner.
</P>
<P>
   They rallied behind a young Likud leader, Silvan Shalom, who
sensed the possibility to thwart Barak and limit prospects for
peace with Syria at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom, rather than Ariel Sharon, the aging Likud leader,
succeeded in galvanizing the opposition by luring the Likud's
natural allies within the government back to conservative
ideological ground.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom criticized Barak for neglecting domestic concerns and
abandoning his entire original agenda to concentrate on one goal:
``leaving the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about all the things you promised, Mr. Prime Minister?''
Shalom said, speaking in the Parliament. ``What happened to the
social issues?
</P>
<P>
   Where are the students that were promised free tuition? What
abut the parents of three- and four-year-olds that were promised
free education? What about the taxi drivers and the handicapped and
all the rest? The only thing that concerns you is the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   Any withdrawal from the Golan Heights will have to be approved
by an absolute majority _ 61 members _ of the Parliament. Shalom
said he believed that an absolute majority of the people was
needed, too. Since voter turnout is about 80 percent here, that
would require the government to win 65 percent of those votes, by
the estimates of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many saw this as a thinly disguised attempt to nullify the
pro-peace Israeli-Arab votes and insist on a ``Jewish majority.''
Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, said the bill was not only
``anti-democratic and racist,'' but ``empowered the abstainers,
those who left the country, those who don't care whether there is
peace or not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli-Arab lawmaker, said the effort was as
discriminatory as anything discussed by the right-wing Austrian
party that Joerg Haider just quit as leader, a party that Israel
has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who attacks Haider should have clean hands himself,''
Tibi said. ``This proposal is Israeli Haiderism in its most clear
form and a mark of Cain on a democratic society that wants to tell
others what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning the broadness of Barak's coalition was a
risky proposition. He intended to marry left and right, secular and
religious, dove and hawk inside the government to obtain maximum
backing for his diplomatic efforts. But he ended up with a balky,
riven government that cannot be counted on to support him. He was
forced to ask three Cabinet ministers to return from trips abroad
to cast their ballots in Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, which with 17 seats is the third-largest party, has
threatened to quit the coalition several times, but never did.
While Shas leaders said that they were voting Wednesday on their
ideological opposition to a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, many
suspected a more parochial concern.
</P>
<P>
   In their ongoing battle with the leftist education minister,
Yossi Sarid, they have been frustrated recently at Sarid's
reluctance to grant more authority to a deputy education minister
from their party. On Wednesday, even if they were voting their
hearts, they also wanted to encourage Barak to push Sarid to give
in to their demands by flexing their political muscles, party
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers in Barak's party criticized him for failing to
take the time to win over Shas and its leader, Eli Yishai, before
such a critical vote. ``He should have sat with them for four
hours, eight hours,'' said Uzi Baram. ``He should have listened to
them. To what Eli Yishai has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as many of Barak's critics were forecasting the demise
of the coalition, some centrist and leftist lawmakers called on him
Wednesday to reshape his government. ``The prime minister has two
choices: change his coalition or call early elections,'' said Amnon
Rubenstein of the leftist Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russian immigrant party, said he
was not defying Barak or backing Shalom but acting on principle.
``When you are making painful decisions with the potential to split
the people of Israel,'' he said, referring to the withdrawal from
the Golan, ``you cannot do it with a majority of one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barak takes this as a suggestion to include the views of his
coalition partners in his decision-making, it will have served a
purpose, Sharansky said. For now, he said, his party, which
consists of only four members, will remain in the government and
try ``to bring broader consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian immigrant lawmaker, Yuli Edelstein, said the
vote should send a message to Hafez Assad, the Syrian president.
``Under no situation will there be a majority in the Parliament or
in the public for a withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for
obscure guarantees from a dictatorial regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a different perspective, Shimon Peres, the former prime
minister and an ardent dove, agreed that Assad should learn from
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could create a problematic situation,'' he said. ``I
believe the Syrians must understand that they cannot go on
attacking the peace process and keeping away from the table and
doing whatever they can to make a negative impact on the Israeli
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have been disappointed that Barak's recent
overtures to Assad _ hinting that he would back a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights _ have gone unanswered.

BOB'S INTERNET ROCK SHOP

<P>
   With all the different ways rock and mineral fans can amuse
themselves _ gem cutting; jewelry making; prospecting; fossil,
mineral and crystal collecting; and micromounting (preparing
dime-size crystal specimens that would cost a fortune or be
impossible to obtain in large sizes but that look gorgeous under a
microscope) _ one would expect a bewildering maze of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of sites, but a huge number of them are linked
to one pre-eminent address: Bob's Rock Shop (www.rockhounds.com).
</P>
<P>
   This is the Amazon effect: the Web site that gets there first
often rules, sometimes even by accident. There is no rock shop.
Never was. There is a Bob: Robert D. Keller, 47 a computer
programmer and electrical engineer in Tucson who describes himself
as a ``common-as-quartz rockhound.'' He is not a mineral or gem
dealer and never took a college course in geology. He will,
however, show you some pictures of his crystals if you're
interested. Rockhounds understand that impulse.
</P>
<P>
   He distinctly recalls his first find. Growing up on a farm
outside Kansas City, Mo., he used to play along Lime Creek and
found a crinoid stem, a limestone fossil of an ancient marine
animal. It looked like a pile of stacked coins, and he imagined
that he had Indian wampum.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, he decided to advertise his computer-related
services _ putting people and their pictures on the Internet. ``My
first Web site was not so much about rocks as how to make Web sites
and image acquisition,'' Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   He built a site of his own to serve as an example, but he had to
name it and illustrate the home page. So he took a picture of one
of his specimens, a nice quartz crystal from Mount Ida, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Bob's Rock Shop, he said, was a joke name, ``kind of intended to
be a parody of the very first commercial sites that were beginning
to appear on the Web.'' The pictures were just window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   He sat back and waited. Nobody flooded his In box with requests
for help on building Web sites. ``What people were sending me
e-mails about were pictures of rocks,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The niche he began filling was extraordinary: an estimated
100,000 members of 1,000 rock and mineral clubs (a friend, Albert
Zabinski, helps list them); dealers, many of whom work out of their
homes and find the Internet a blessing; teachers (Keller said his
proudest moments are when he gets letters about taking classrooms
to his site); and buyers (his most popular page is the
classifieds).
</P>
<P>
   Information runs from basic (how to make a kind of unfaceted
polished gem known as a cabochon, by Keller) to advanced (a
nine-part online course on crystallography). An arrangement with
Rock and Gem magazine, the most popular American publication on the
hobby, provides Bob's Rock Shop with online articles and features
in return for its serving as the magazine's host.
</P>
<P>
   A RockNet line lets obsessed hobbyists ask and answer questions.
Keller said 40,000 people browse the site each month.
</P>
<P>
   Bob's ``You know you're a rockhound when ...'' page is magnetic
for fellow sufferers. Contributors' finishing lines include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your pet turtle hisses and spits every time you walk near his
aquarium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can distinguish agate from quartz by the sound they make
in the clothes dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't even consider dating a woman unless the directions
to her house contain the phrase, `then you turn onto the gravel
road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keller moved to Tucson 15 years ago. Soon afterward, a friend
asked, ``Bob, you ever been to the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show?''
He had not. He hadn't heard much about it. It was like moving to
Kansas City and being asked, ``Ever tried steak?''
</P>
<P>
   Keller went and his jaw dropped. It is simply the World Series
of mineral shows.
</P>
<P>
   From 40,000 to 50,000 people attended this year, Keller said.
During show week, he doesn't just cover it, he transfers his home
page to his Tucson show site, as if assuming that is why anyone
would be visiting Bob's.
</P>
<P>
   Keller now sells enough advertising to have quit his day job,
but Bob's is not a money machine, he said, just enough to keep
``food in my mouth, a roof over my head and an ISDN connection.''
That's all right, he quickly added; the site is fulfilling a goal
of bringing people together. ``I would not trade the job that I
have here with Bob's Rock Shop for any job I've had,'' he said. ``I
truly enjoy this.'' &QL;

WAYS TO INSTALL SINGLE-STRIP OR COMPOSITE BASEBOARD MOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(jt) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseboard molding is the wood trim that runs around the
perimeter of the wall at floor level. It serves as a decorative
accent; it also conceals the expansion joint between the edge of a
wood floor and the wall and covers gaps and flaws created as the
house settles and heaves.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, baseboard molding is just a single strip of
wood with a simple contour, but it can also be made up of several
moldings with different profiles, called composite molding.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you choose to install single-strip molding or composite,
the same basic techniques _ mitering, coping and scarfing _ are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must buy the molding. To calculate the amount of
molding you need, measure the perimeter of the room. When
purchasing molding, try to buy long lengths to avoid having to
splice pieces together and, if possible, hand-pick the boards so
you can match grain patterns and color.
</P>
<P>
   Start the installation by locating all the wall studs with a
stud finder. Mark their location with light pencil lines slightly
above the molding height. Next, cut the pieces to approximate
length and place them against the walls around the room. If you
have two shorter pieces that must be spliced, plan for the joint to
fall over a wall stud.
</P>
<P>
   Choose the longest wall and cut the molding so it fits the
length exactly, from corner to corner. Both ends of the piece
should be cut square. Use 8d finishing nails to attach the molding
directly to the wall studs. If you are installing hardwood molding,
first drill pilot holes (the diameter of the holes should be
slightly smaller than the nails) to avoid splitting the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the molding for the adjacent wall. It should be long enough
to run from wall to wall and not from the wall to the face of the
newly installed piece. This extra length will give you enough stock
to cut the coped joint.
</P>
<P>
   You will now cope the end so it fits snugly against the face of
the installed piece. To do this first cut an open miter (a
45-degree bevel with the back of the molding longer than the face)
at the end. This bevel will highlight the profile of the molding.
Clamp the molding on a flat surface and use a coping saw, held
vertically, to cut along the profile and remove the mitered
section.
</P>
<P>
   The newly coped end will be shaped so it mates perfectly with
the face of the molding attached to the wall. Use sandpaper or a
file to remove excess wood and adjust the shape of the coped end to
ensure a tighter fit.
</P>
<P>
   When the joint fits snugly without any noticeable gaps, nail the
molding to the wall studs. Move to the opposite wall and use the
same technique to install the molding along it.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple room with four straight walls, the four corners will
be inside ones and you will be able to install all of the molding
using the coping technique described. Some rooms, however, may have
walls that project outward to wrap around a chimney or form a
divider. Here you will have outside corners to contend with.
Outside corner molding must be joined with a miter.
</P>
<P>
   First, determine the length of molding by placing it along the
wall and against the corner. Use a pencil to trace the inside
dimension (the length of the wall) directly on the back of the
molding. Clamp the molding in a miter box, making sure that the
back of the molding is flat against the wall of the miter box, and
use a back saw to make the cut. Before cutting, make sure that the
saw is angled correctly for an outside, or closed, miter. With an
outside miter the face of the molding will be longer than the back.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pieces, then test fit them to make sure the joint is
square with no noticeable gaps. If the pieces are too long, you can
file the mitered surface down a little. If the pieces are too
short, you will have to try again with fresh molding. When the
pieces fit together precisely, apply glue to both surfaces and nail
the molding to the studs.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal situation, you will have long lengths of molding to
span the wall. Sometimes, however, you may have to joint two pieces
together. You could, of course, butt the two pieces together, but
over time the molding may contract, allowing the joint to open to a
noticeable gap. It is better to join them with a technique called
scarfing.
</P>
<P>
   To scarf a joint, cut both pieces a little longer than
necessary, then cut the ends at opposite angles so they overlap.
Nail the molding in place. If the wood does contract, the outside
piece will still cover the joint.

SECRET OF GRAPEFRUIT PIE RIPE FOR SPECULATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rio Grande Valley has its share of Texas staples _ Tex-Mex,
southern-fried blue plates and barbecue. But the Valley is also
home to grapefruit pie, a dessert that showcases the ruby red fruit
of the surrounding citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   The pie, in its homey gelatin-based guise, has vague roots. But
it was at Ferrell's Pit, a barbecue spot in Mission, that it gained
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ferrell introduced the pie to the restaurant menu in
the late 1960s. She got the recipe from a friend and was sworn to
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her sister-in-law Louise Waymire owns the restaurant _
and keeps the secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not Jell-O,'' she says by phone. And it's not whipped
cream on top? ``It's your story, write what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``no-I-won't-tell-you-my-age-but-I'm-over-60'' Waymire says
the restaurant sells 50 to 150 of the pies daily, many sold whole,
to-go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of them for Valentine's Day and birthdays and
holidays. We've sold them to people who've taken them to San
Francisco and Mexico City.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell's bakes the pie crusts in advance and assembles the pies
as they're ordered _ probably by combining peeled grapefruit pieces
with a glaze and then topping it with a stabilized cream topping.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooks in the area each seem to have their own variation on
the grapefruit pie _ some with gelatin, some without.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is now an upscale version that is a
specialty of Valley caterer Diane Shea. She makes a custard from
scratch but says that boxed vanilla pudding made with heavy cream
would work equally well.

NOTE TO SELF: READ NEW BRIDGET JONES BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MIllIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 15
</P>
<P>
   12:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Editor arrives at my desk, breathless. ``Bridget Jones: The Edge
of Reason'' to arrive on bookstore shelves Feb. 28. We need story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write in her style,'' editor tells me. Agree, but wonder: If I
could write in the style of smashing British author Helen Fielding,
why would I be working at a newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   Fielding created fictional character Bridget Jones in a
serialized column in the London Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget, painfully single, struggles in frenetic fashion through
a world of unfaithful boyfriends, maddening jobs, spicy e-mail with
a romantic interest, hostile co-workers and wacky parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the runaway bestseller of 1998, ``Bridget Jones's Diary,''
she shares hopes, dreams, foibles and a chronicle of the number of
cigarettes she smoked (5,277), pounds she gained (74) and lost (72)
as she stumbles through the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'' is the much-awaited madcap
sequel. The same characters and the same up-and-down ride through
giddiness and suffering run like rapids through this second look at
Bridget's diary. In fact, the second is oh-so-similar to the first,
although her relationship with that caddish former boss, Mark
Darcy, finally gets resolved after many anxious moments.
</P>
<P>
   Write in her style? Editor must realize my life isn't half as
interesting as Bridget's. I am so not Bridget. I wear sensible
shoes. Bridget never would.
</P>
<P>
   And I am far more private than Bridget. I will not account for
each cigarette (5-10 daily, v. good!), each calorie (2,000-10,000),
each romantic encounter (0).
</P>
<P>
   I am so private, the sole reason I moved to Texas is that the
Department of Public Safety does not require that weight be printed
on driver's licenses, unlike other insensitive states where I have
lived and lied. It was a long search, but finally I found Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One preview copy of ``The Edge of Reason'' exists. It is on the
desk of the book reviewer who sits across from me. Book reviewer
will not surrender the copy. I reach across the partition and grab
it. Consider running down hall with book.
</P>
<P>
   Book reviewer is nice person. She just organized an all-girl
outing to see ``Tap Dogs.'' This tap dance at Bass Hall adds up to
the sum of my social life for coming week (tragic).
</P>
<P>
   No need to make scene. I give the preview copy back.
</P>
<P>
   I call New York directory assistance. Operator has never heard
of the publisher, Viking, nor does operator give any sign he could
find his own name and number. I look on the Internet and find
46,352 references to Viking, the scanning of which will take longer
than a trip to New York on a camel.
</P>
<P>
   I walk to Barnes &AMP; Noble in downtown Fort Worth, find Writer's
Market on the shelf, look up Viking and find the telephone number.
Worry I might leave fingerprints from the sausage kolache I just
bought at Stein's Deli. I wipe hands on my skirt (a hideous $5
dry-cleaning mistake). I buy February Vogue. In it, and this is
from God as well as a tip from my editor, is excerpt of ``The Edge
of Reason.'' There goes that completely mad Bridget again,
drenching her diary with references to popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Leave B.&AMP;N. feeling wan, like shorter, OK maybe wider, version
of model in Donna Karan advert in Vogue. Buy another kolache.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Viking publicity person has not returned calls.
</P>
<P>
   I try to remember why I laughed so hard and so frequently when I
read the first of Fielding's Bridget books. Bridget encounters
common problems, but in their comic extreme. Embarrassment caused
by mothers, for instance, becomes in Bridget's world embarrassment
caused by her married mother returning from a trip to Africa
wearing Bo Derek braids and dressed in a batik caftan like Winnie
Mandela, with a man in tow.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   I look up ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' on Amazon.com and discover,
to my delight, that Amazon has rated the book highly among readers
in the U.S. Senate as well as the House of Representatives. (How
funny! Those Congress people must have read Starr report just
looking for the ``good'' parts.)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., John McCain's ``Faith of My Fathers'' is
only slightly more popular than ``Bridget Jones's Diary,'' which is
ranked as 13th among people who are supposed to be working to make
America an even better place, but really are spending time looking
for their own names in co-workers' books, plus reading Bridget's
wonderfully ditzy fictional diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Dumb Century'' is rated 20th.

</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Feb. 17
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. I am still reading ``The Edge of Reason,'' plus working
on two stories _ OK, let's make that four. I am working on four
stories, but after entering Bridget's world I find my mind drifting
back to etymology of word ``shag.'' Think of calling long-lost
English friend who married computer guy in Seattle. Maybe she
knows. Then have to admit I work in job describing popular culture
and I didn't see ``The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' Feel humiliated, just
like Bridget, who always feels humiliated due to silly antics of
parents, boyfriend, boss and self.
</P>
<P>
   Look helplessly around office, wondering about origin of word
``shag.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop music critic is walking out the door playing air guitar.
Senior writer is trying to get all the other features writers to
snap their fingers, as if maybe if we practiced we could do a music
video. Can't see another writer because she's sitting behind a rose
bouquet so big it looks like a beautiful shrub. Not that I am
jealous. Note: forget how ``shag'' came into the language. Another
note: must learn to snap fingers in case music video opportunity
arises; must send self roses.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   11:06 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gaaaahhhh! Another editor arrives at my desk. Urgent tone. He
stands above me and I feel like patient ready to be intubated by
Dr. Greene on ``ER.'' He wants story on why there is so much bird
poop downtown (glamorous story!). This is why I got into
journalism, I tell myself. I go for walk to see just how bad of a
problem we have here on Fort Worth sidewalks. It's pretty bad. Walk
with purpose and carry a notebook; pretend I am not really out
walking around looking for bird poop. Can't wait to get back to
``The Edge of Reason.'' What a great title.

SPIRIT IN THE SKY: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WOOS CHEERLEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Dallas Convention Center opened the floodgates Saturday
to thousands of pleated polyester miniskirts and white anklets,
there was surely no more spirited a place on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of little- to medium-sized girls scooted through the
hallways, hair pulled tightly off their bright faces and glitter
schmeared across their eyelids. Music from the adjoining arena
thumped steadily, and, as the line for free chicken sandwiches
swelled, Gina Taylor waded into the crowd, offering a barf bag to
anyone willing to pause.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleaders had arrived, and Southwest Airlines was right
there to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Dallas-based Southwest had a brainstorm. Anyone
who flies the airline knows its staff takes a comparatively
irreverent, fun attitude toward the whole business (I was once
personally serenaded on a trip from Detroit to Chicago by a hammy
steward). The company prides itself on its perky disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the cheerleaders _ or rather, a savvy effort on
Southwest's part to recruit cheerleaders and their presumably
equally peppy friends and family to work for the airline. Southwest
sends representatives across the country to events like this one,
the National Cheerleading Association All-Star National
Championship, to, as they say, ``plant the seed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Taylor and Leigh Hassell stood at the Southwest
Airlines booth, passing out little white bags printed with the line
``Sick of Your Job?'' The bags included a ``Now Hiring'' brochure
explaining how to apply and which positions are available, a mini
``Boarding Pass'' with the job hot-line number, and a bag of
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Hassell, both in-flight recruiting coordinators for
the airline, stuffed the bags with the help of Hassell's
13-year-old daughter, Danielle, and good-naturedly worked the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you go, Southwest Airlines, tell your friends and family
about us,'' Taylor calls over the din. ``Hi, do you have a bag?''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has worked for the company for five years and says this
effort is ``just another sourcing way to get the word out about
Southwest Airlines.'' These young people, she stresses, possess the
kind of qualities _ ``spirit, teamwork, confidence, attitude'' _
that make successful employees. (An NCA survey found that 82
percent of cheerleaders and dance-team members maintain a B average
or higher and 82 percent are accepted to college.)
</P>
<P>
   Southwest plans to hire 1,000 flight attendants this year and
hired an equal number last year. The company is confident that its
recruiting strategy works, despite the fact that most of the
potential applicants sidling up to the booth today have yet to get
their first zit.

<P>
   (You have to be at least 20 and able to lift 50 pounds ``from
floor to above shoulder height,'' among other things, to qualify as
a Southwest flight attendant.)
</P>
<P>
   A trio of older girls confess that, though the job of flight
attendant doesn't top their list of career choices, they might be
willing to give it a try. Sixteen-year-old Chelsea Hooten, a member
of Houston's Texas Cheer team, really wants to be a ``play
therapist,'' but her mom has suggested that she be a flight
attendant ``because I pick up languages really fast,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Fowler and Kristofer Gertsen, two college-age competitors
from New Jersey, each take a barf bag from the Southwest booth and
agree that the airline came to the right place to find ``outgoing,
friendly'' people. Fowler, who's taking flying lessons, says he
would ``definitely'' think about pursuing a career with Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the Southwest booth falls somewhere between
the neighboring, always crowded Pantene Pro-V table _ where girls
are lined up for a satiny bag of free shampoo and conditioner _ and
the lonely, unmanned Nair display _ a table strewn with sample hair
remover.
</P>
<P>
   To Southwest's right, Princeton doctoral student Mary Wright is
having a tough time luring kids and coaches to fill out a survey or
give an interview. She's writing her dissertation on the evolution
of cheerleading music and its reflection of the larger culture, but
by 11:30 a.m. she had run out of jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Southwest gives away 2,000 bags of information on
Saturday. Most of the girls competing at the NCA championship
couldn't care less. But somewhere out there, a tired cheerleader is
unpacking her suitcase and curiously studying the ``Now Hiring''
pamphlet she half-consciously picked up over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She might just be serving your next bag of in-flight peanuts.

HOUSE LIFTS LIMITS ON EXTRA INCOME FOR MOST SOCIAL SECURITY
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted 422-0 Wednesday to allow most
Social Security recipients to work without sacrificing any of their
retirement benefit, repealing a Depression-era policy intended to
discourage older people from holding jobs so younger people would
have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote was a rare display of bipartisanship in the
House, and reflected a consensus that the earnings limits placed on
Social Security recipients had long since become counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up a similar measure soon, and
President Clinton has said he would sign the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people aged 65 through 69 lose $1 of their
Social Security benefit for every $3 they earn above $17,000. A
67-year-old man who earned $20,000 last year, for example, would
have lost $1,000 of his Social Security retirement benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings limit, which does not apply to people 70 and above,
is already scheduled to rise to $30,000 in 2002, but the
legislation passed Wednesday by the House would eliminate the limit
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted under the terms of the House bill, the change would
apply retroactively to earnings since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people aged 65 or above lost some or all of their
benefit last year because they earned more than the limit,
according to the Social Security Administration. But the real
significance of the shift might come only over the next few decades
as the population ages and the baby boom generation moves into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors said repealing the earnings limit would
benefit the entire economy by making a bigger pool of experienced
workers available, especially now, when the unemployment rate, at 4
percent, is so low that employers are having trouble filling all
the jobs they are creating.
</P>
<P>
   They said the change also reflected increases in life expectancy
and the fact that more and more people 65 and older continue to
work at least part time by choice or necessity. But they said the
main justification for the change was simple fairness, calling it
unconscionable for the government to deny workers benefits they had
earned over their careers simply because they chose to remain
employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would we want to discourage any American _
whether they're 17 or 67 _ from working?'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living longer now, and older Americans can work,
they want to work and they shouldn't be punished by an outdated law
if they choose to work,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the provisions that the bill would repeal are more complex
than Wednesday's debate on the House floor would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security recipients lose some of their benefits in
years in which they earn more than the limit, they get some or all
of the reduction back after age 70, when their benefits are
readjusted to reflect their decision to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the change would not apply to people who take early
retirement benefits from Social Security. People age 62 through 64
would continue to be subject to a strict earnings limit, losing $1
in benefit for every $2 in earnings above $10,080 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agreed to leave the earnings limits in place for
early retirees _ effectively encouraging people not to take Social
Security before 65 _ because research has shown that people who
take a reduced Social Security benefit at age 62 are more likely to
end up in poverty than those who work to full retirement age. The
problem strikes particularly hard at widows of men who retire early
and rely on their late husbands' benefits to live.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In Russia, the March 26 presidential election offers no
alternatives. It seems that Vladimir Putin, the acting president,
has an obvious advantage. I know Putin. He is an intelligent and
serious man. But to hold any position on him, it is necessary to
see more: who he relies upon and in what manner he works and which
goals he sets. As yet, none of this is clear.
 &HT;    I make no secret of the fact that I regret that former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov pulled out of the race.
 &HT;    I had spent two years trying to persuade everyone and myself
that he would be the best choice for president. Primakov is well
known in Russia and the West and that is a very important
qualification.
 &HT;    More importantly, if Primakov, whom I have always supported,
were participating in the election today, at least he would pose an
alternative. But Primakov was unable to withstand the ordeal of
what the Kremlin-controlled media did to him during the
parliamentary election campaigns _ the blatant smear tactics. We
must call things by their names: His knees simply gave way.
 &HT;    Now, from my knowledge of all the candidates in the race, I
would say that critical questions must be asked of all of them,
primarily Putin. Nothing is known about the foundations of his
program. But as to the issues, and what must and must not be done,
certain things are quite clear.
 &HT;    First, dictatorship is impossible in Russia anymore under any
regime in the Kremlin, Putin's or anybody else's. This is the point
everyone raises, the question I am always asked, especially by
people in the West: Is it possible that Russia will turn back? No.
 &HT;    What I would say is that a system of effective authority is
needed, that law and order are needed; but that such an imperative
should not be confused with a dictatorship.
 &HT;    Today's political leaders are being confronted with new problems
for which they are unprepared and have no solutions _ not only in
Russia but also in the West. The confrontation of opposing blocs
has ended, the Warsaw Pact organization has dissolved and many new
independent states have appeared. We have lost the system of
relations that previously held the world together and organized it,
however defective that system was.
 &HT;    As yet there is no good replacement. We now have ``goods'' that
seem as threatening as evils. For example, freed from the threat of
a nuclear nightmare that hung over everyone's head during the Cold
War, and freed from the discipline imposed by each of the rival
blocs during that time, every country finds that it now possesses a
certain new freedom of action. And yet nowhere, despite this
``freedom,'' do we see nations fostering truly genuine democratic
and peaceful international relations.
 &HT;    The United States viewed the end of the Cold War as essentially
the removal of obstacles on the road to achieving longstanding
goals of American policy. Even though the United States spoke about
a new world order, it essentially meant a continuation of its own
policies. The existing order in world economic affairs was
essentially to Washington's liking.
 &HT;    And so, in this new century, while the Cold War on the whole has
passed into history, its legacy and many of its elements have
persisted, although in changed form. We still have the concept
that, somehow, the West ``won'' and Russia ``lost.'' No wonder,
with such viewpoints, the two ``partners'' are not closer than they
are.
 &HT;    Both Russia and the United States are on the eve of presidential
elections, but there is fear and tension. What does Washington have
in store for us? ask Russians who have become disappointed with the
West's promises and fiercely loyal to their own heritage. In turn,
the West tries to analyze whether Putin, or some other successor to
former President Boris Yeltsin, will be the new Stalin, and foment
war.
 &HT;    We wonder, so long after the Berlin Wall has come down, why the
fact that the world has become pluralistic is not a greater cause
for celebration and respect and trust. Instead, the idea of various
``dangers'' coming from the East is expressed in Western
publications and sometimes in the speeches of Western political
leaders.
 &HT;    Still, Russia will not go back.
 &HT;    It is true that instead of the euphoria of 1989-90, a certain
pessimism has set in. In Russia and the former republics, any
leftover memories of that ``new world order'' are being considered
either a myth or a utopian idea.
 &HT;    But for an authoritarian or totalitarian system to flourish, as
we in the Soviet Union very well knew, there must be more _
something more sinister than disappointment. There must be closed,
secretive behavior relative to the outside world. When a regime
tightens the reins on its own population and uses any form of
coercion it desires, one result is that it will choose
confrontation as the most comfortable foreign policy.
 &HT;    And so it will be incumbent upon the two new presidents _ those
of Russia and the United States _ to raise to a qualitatively new
level the kind of international dialogue that played an
irreplaceable role in ending the Cold War. Without democratization
of international relations, we cannot arrive at any new, genuinely
peaceful world order.
 &HT;    Our people must hold the politicians precisely to these goals.

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious
experiencekneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal
prayer, congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the
better.
 &HT;    Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection
to the divine. The stuff of traditional religionfrom liturgies to
pie supperscannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists only
in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of candle
smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

   Watching video images on the Internet is one of those computer
tasks with more next steps than a mambo. Viewers have long been
forced to download many programs with many levels to squint into
little windows on computer monitors to see smudgy, sputtering
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   But with steady improvements in streaming technologies, online
video is beginning to approach _ at best _ the outer edges of
television-quality video. And for the first time, video on the
Internet can do something television video cannot: permit viewers
to take a virtually step into moving pictures and change their
perspective on what they see as easily as if they were turning
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   This immersive, interactive video has already been used by
Superbowl.com and ESPN.com to stream 360-degree videos of
behind-the-scene action at the Super Bowl in January. More examples
may soon show up in baseball dugouts and concert seats.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that makes immersive video possible is being
advanced primarily by two companies, the Internet Pictures Corp.,
or iPIX, based in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Palo Alto, Calif., and the
Be Here Corp., based in Cupertino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For years, computer users have been able to view still pictures
that took advantage of immersive technology on CD-ROMs and DVD
discs. Pictures taken with a fisheye lens and processed with
software that stitched together two 180-degree shots of a single
scene or object let viewers rotate a 360-degree panorama by simply
moving their mouse around over the picture.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Technology, Entertainment and Design conference
in Monterey, Calif., iPIX unveiled its immersive application for
moving images. Called iPIX Movies, the technology permits users to
tilt and pan across the image through 360 degrees, looking left and
right, up and down without interrupting the flow of various moving
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown its incredible capabilities,'' said James
Phillips, iPIX's chairman and chief executive, speaking of his
company's new video technology. ``It captures everything. It is an
application that transports you into spaces where otherwise you
could not go.'' The iPIX technology can be used in digital video as
well as in traditional movie cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the company announced its first commercial
applications of iPIX movies, in a deal with Discovery Online and
the Hawaiian Visitor and Convention Bureau to produce interactive
movies of the Hawaiian islands.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of an iPIX movie showed a lush scene of a Hawaiian
waterfall shot from a helicopter high above. By moving a computer
mouse over the scene, the viewpoint smoothly shifted within the
movie and kept shifting as long as the mouse was moving.
</P>
<P>
   While the film clip was shot with a single camera using a small
new iPIX lens and camera, the scores of possible angles from which
to view the scene gave viewers the impression that the waterfall
had been photographed with dozens of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the applications of what the company calls
360-by-360-degree video were almost endless. He said he could
easily imagine iPIX cameras being strapped to race cars or athletes
so viewers could get a first-person point of view. He also noted
that an iPIX camera could serve as an all-seeing security camera.
</P>
<P>
   (Phillips even suggested that if iPIX movies had been around at
the time of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the
mysteries of the grassy knoll might have been solved in playing
back video that would have photographed Dealey Plaza from
practically every angle.)
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way, Be Here's immersive video, called 360
iVideo, can capture full panoramas of moving images and play them
back. Unlike iPIX movies, however, Be Here's iVideo technology
captures and shows a more narrow range _ 360 degress horizontally
and about 110 degrees vertically.
</P>
<P>
   But Be Here's president and chief executive, Ted Driscoll, said
his competitor's system actually captured only 180 degrees
vertically and that much of that was at viewing angles unnatural to
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to focus our attention on the part of the sphere
around your head,'' Driscoll said. ``Your eyes spend most of their
time looking along that equator. We rarely look straight up unless
you are at a sporting event and on the court with Kareem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this new field is hotly competitive, neither company
leader offered precise details on how their video technologies
actually work. Phillips talked briefly about a new lens design and
powerful software to blend the images together. Driscoll said his
company's technology was less dependent on software and more
dependent on special optical systems in the camera itself.
</P>
<P>
   And while Driscoll said iVideos, like iPIX movies, could be
burned onto CD-ROM and DVD discs, his company's emphasis is on
putting the images on the Internet. Samples of iVideos can be seen
at the 360 Gallery at www.behere.com.
</P>
<P>
   Be Here's immersive videos can be seen using the Internet's
three primary streaming formats: RealVideo, Windows Media and
Quicktime.
</P>
<P>
   The iPIX and iVideos technologies may be adapted someday for
consumer use, but both Phillips and Driscoll said that would most
likely have to wait while the new format became established in the
commercial world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the summer you are going to begin seeing this on broadcast
television,'' said Phillips, of iPIX.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, he promised, immersive video technology is going to
capture Dad's face from behind the home video camera and put him
back in the family picture where he belongs.

HOW TO UPGRADE THE PROCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like to increase the speed of my computer and have
already added more RAM. What is involved if I wish to upgrade my
processor? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Upgrading the computer's central processing unit, or CPU (or
microprocessor, as it is often called), is another way to extend
the life of an older machine. While the hard drive, with all your
programs and personal files, may be the heart of your computer, the
CPU is the brain, sending out instructions for the rest of the
machine to follow. In an older CPU, the rate at which it can send
out these instructions is slower, which affects the speed of the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Your upgrade options will depend on the type of computer you
have, so consult your system's manual or manufacturer to see what
is possible. Upgrade kits for specific types of machines are
available in computer stores. Depending on the type of kit, you may
be able to plug in an upgrade ``daughtercard'' to your motherboard
or stack the upgrade processor on top of your existing one. Some
kits have you replace the entire processor with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   You will probably notice improved performance after you upgrade,
but don't set your standards too high, as there is only so much
even an upgrade can do for an older machine. New computers are
relatively inexpensive these days, and if the upgrade kit costs
more than a few hundred dollars, you may want to weigh all your
needs carefully before deciding which way to go. &QL;

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious experience _
kneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal prayer,
congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the better.
Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection to
the divine. The stuff of traditional religion _ from liturgies to
pie suppers _ cannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists
only in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of
candle smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the
carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

<P>
   Cyberspace is littered with the flotsam of online-payment
schemes that have failed. Companies like DigiCash, First Virtual
Holdings and CyberCash have either gone bankrupt or undergone
makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just when the language has begun to absorb the letter ``e''
as a prefix, comes the latest twist on electronic money and the
language of the digital age: mobile commerce, or m-commerce, which
promises to turn your cell phone or handheld organizer into an
electronic wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of cell phones are hooked to the Web for
sending and receiving e-mail and for calling up weather reports,
stock quotes, movie listings, sports headlines and travel tips. The
Yankee Group, a technology research firm in Boston, predicts that
by the end of this year, 15 million phones in the United States
will be equipped to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step, at least according to some visionaries,
is to turn cell phones into devices for handling any number of
purchases made on the fly: movie tickets, soft drinks or Happy
Meals. Some developers envision the eventual use of cell phones to
make major purchases and transfer cash from bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It will be years before m-commerce takes hold in a serious way.
But when it does, ``m-commerce will be bigger than e-commerce,''
declared Richard Siber, an analyst at Andersen Consulting in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines are a favorite example among those peddling the
m-commerce concept. Rather than stand in front of a soda machine
fishing for a dollar bill that is neither too faded nor too
wrinkled, or one last nickel, you may someday simply dial the phone
number posted on the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine will be equipped either with the radio
portion of a cell phone so that it can receive the call, or with a
transceiver that works using Bluetooth, a wireless connection that
allows high-speed communication among devices within a short
distance of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The machine will then offer you a menu. You'll choose, say, a
Diet Pepsi for 75 cents and enter a PIN (or the machine will
recognize your telephone automatically), and out will tumble your
soft drink. For additional security, a few phone manufacturers are
experimenting with thumb-print recognition technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the advances in m-commerce are being made in Europe and
Asia, where Web-ready phones are increasingly commonplace. That is
because wireless companies in those parts of the world have
leapfrogged their U.S. counterparts by adopting a single technical
standard for digital cellular. The United States, by contrast, is
burdened with three different and incompatible standards. The
seamless consistency of the systems that are in place in Europe and
Asia makes innovation easier there.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Visa and the Finnish-Swedish bank
MeritaNordbanken, Nokia, the Finnish cell phone manufacturer, is
testing a system for making point-of-sale purchases with cell
phones. And at the CeBIT computer show in Hannover, Germany, this
past week, Nokia showed off a prototype of a mobile payment system
called PayPal.com. The system is also being demonstrated at the
Wireless 2000 show, put on by the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, in New Orleans this week.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal.com, which is owned in part by Nokia, plans to merge with
X.com, an online financial services company. The PayPal.com system
has been in place for several months, and it is now migrating to
cell phones. It works like this: After opening an account on the
company's Web site, people can send money to one another via
e-mail. The PayPal.com method calls for just an e-mail address (or
eventually a phone number) to send, beam or dial in a payment. Once
the money is sent, the amount is charged to a credit card or bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient retrieves the money by filling out a form attached
to the payment, which in turn registers the recipient for the
service. PayPal.com then credits a credit card, deposits money to a
bank account or sends out a check.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal.com is especially popular for paying for merchandise on
eBay and other online auctions because it eliminates the need to
send checks through the mail. Since the service began last October,
some 350,000 users have signed up, and more than 10,000 new users
sign up each day.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the cell phone into the process can change
things greatly, said David Sacks, vice president for strategy at
PayPal.com. He conjured a scene from the wireless future: ``Walk
down the street, a few blocks away from your favorite Starbucks,
pull out your Web-connected cell phone, you get a Starbucks menu,
click espresso, and it's sent. And you've not only ordered it, but
you've paid and you can go pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   PayPal.com does not displace credit cards or electronic bill
payment services. Rather, it extends the use of electronic fund
transfers to person-to-person payments and small cash payments.
That has made it particularly popular with eBay users who have
usually relied on checks.
</P>
<P>
   Tapio Hedman, vice president for communications at Nokia Mobile
Phones, said that m-commerce, when combined with information
delivery via the Web, makes the cell phone an especially powerful
tool. Not only can a phone be used to buy a bus ticket, but, he
said, ``if you're waiting for a bus in Finland in February, you
definitely want to know if it's 5 minutes or 25 minutes for the
next bus to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks, of PayPal.com, said, ``There are all sorts of things you
can do by wedding the payment to information about the payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the systems planned for m-commerce require that the cell
phones be linked to the Internet. Handset manufacturers like Nokia,
Motorola and Qualcomm, along with carriers like AT&AMP;T Wireless and
Sprint, are all complying with a standard called the Wireless
Application Protocol, or WAP, which optimizes the delivery of
Internet data to small-screen devices over digital cellular
networks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wireless 2000 show, ``the buzz was all about wireless
Internet,'' said Mark Lowenstein, an analyst with the Yankee Group.
But in the United States markets, the number of cell phones that
are used for Web access remains small compared with the number in
Europe and Asia. ``We're culturally and technically embarrassingly
behind,'' said Mark S. Anderson, a computer industry analyst and
president of Technology Alliance Partners.

</P>
<P>
   TeleVend, a small start-up based in Israel, plans to sell its
own solution for the U.S. market, one that will work with any
mobile phone and will not require Internet access. The cell phone
user dials the phone number displayed on the vending machine, and
after a brief authentication process, out tumbles the candy bar.
The transaction can be charged to the customer's cell phone bill,
credit card or bank account.
</P>
<P>
   There's another twist as well: since the machine now has the
personal information associated with your phone, it can display a
brief advertisement customized to your tastes or dispense similarly
tailored discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   TeleVend is planning a pilot program for the spring in a
commercial neighborhood in New York, in cooperation with a number
fast food and retail businesses, said Gedaliah Gurfein, TeleVend's
vice president for marketing. Later this year, TeleVend's
technology will include a speech recognition feature that will
allow consumers to make purchases based on a ``voice signature.''
</P>
<P>
   The high level of security provided by speech recognition will
pave the way for situations like the following one, Gurfein said:
``Imagine walking into Bloomingdale's and simply saying, `I'll buy
this, thank you,' to which a `voice' responds: `That will be $220.
Do you confirm?' You then say, `Yes, I confirm.' The machine says,
`Thank you, have a nice day,' and you walk out the door with your
purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines is working with International Business Machines
and an e-commerce company called Modem Media to develop and test a
service that not only gives customers wireless access to flight and
gate information, but by next year will also allow travelers to
purchase tickets and change flight schedules using their handheld
organizers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that once the technical hurdles are overcome,
widespread acceptance of m-commerce will require a shift in how
consumers think about making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is essentially modifying the behavior of
consumers,'' said Chris Shipley, publisher of DemoLetter, an
industry newsletter. ``Because if you're used to digging in your
pocket for loose change, picking up a phone and making a call to a
machine might be a little odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson agreed. ``You have to get people thinking about their
phones that way,'' he said. ``Even if they're using phones just
once for some kind of product purchase, then the door is open a
crack, and that's a huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies don't want to be left out, of course.
Executives at Visa are experimenting with m-commerce in England,
where a pilot program in Leeds allows mobile phone users to
download money to their chip-based ``electronic purse.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1,000 card holders are taking part in the trial,
which involves custom-designed Motorola StarTac mobile phones.
People insert a credit or debit card into a slot in the phone and
key in the amount to be transferred and a PIN. The e-cash is
deposited onto the card.
</P>
<P>
   Visa is also working with Nokia and MeritaNordbanken to put a
second chip into Nokia phones. ``We envisage the card holder using
it to make payments on the Internet,'' said Sandra Alzetta, senior
vice president for electronic commerce for Visa in Europe, ``but
also to make local payments, such as standing next to a parking
meter and sending details to the parking meter, or being able to
use it for payment inside a shop.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, another m-commerce cheerleader, is developing a speech
recognition system that could be used for wireless purchases. ``Our
view is that instead of using keyboards or punching up numbers on
cell phone pads, people are going to be speaking to do any kind of
transaction,'' said Stephanie Hahn, a general manager at IBM.
``That can be speaking through your phone, or through a PDA device
or to your computer to do purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in the world of vending machines, those toiling
in the trenches of the automated merchandising industry are
slightly more skeptical of the notion of m-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that some day this kind of thing will happen,'' said
Kyriakos Spentzos, an engineer in Santa Rosa, Calif., who designs
control systems for vending systems. ``But for now, if I want to
buy a soda, I'm more likely to have 75 cents in my pocket than my
cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Spentzos said, it can cost as much as $40 per vending
machine to equip it with the electronics to perform such a
transaction. ``If you want to see these machines on every corner,
the price will have to drop considerably,'' he said. ``Unless the
cost comes down to around $5 extra per machine, no one will put it
into their machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedman, of Nokia, agreed that even in Helsinki, the capital of
Finland _ the country with the highest per capita cell phone use _
there are only a handful of experimental vending machines that can
handle a purchase from a mobile phone. Hedman said he had yet to
use his phone to buy a Coke. But, he added quickly, he had used his
phone to pay at the car wash.

   &UR; What's Eating Ficus? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was washing the leaves of my ficus tree when I discovered
that underneath every leaf, right at the base, there are small,
pinhead-size bumps, whitish and waxy, always in the same place. I
know ficus is susceptible to scale, so how do I deal with an
infestation this large?
</P>
<P>
   A. Anything on a plant that is so uniformly spread, so
consistent, is probably not an insect. Insects are freethinkers,
and are rarely much good at organizing (ants and bees excepted, of
course).
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the waxy spots on your Ficus benjamina are
glandular spots, characteristic of ficus. Different species have
different sites and numbers of spots. There is a theory that the
glandular spots exude a substance that attracts tiny fig wasps,
which are the plant's pollinators, but no one knows for certain.
One thing I am certain of is that they serve some purpose. Nature
almost never does anything just for fun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Eon Here, an Eon There &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am interested in finding a source for tree seeds. Starting
a yew (which might grow for 1,000 years) or a sequoia (which might
grow for 3,000) seems an easy way to achieve immortality.
</P>
<P>
   A. With a tree's long view of life, it shouldn't be surprising
that their seeds are remarkably patient. Growing trees from seed
isn't like growing annuals or vegetables, where germination is
quick and everything happens during daylight time.
</P>
<P>
   In nature, seeds germinate only when they and the world are
ready for each other. Some seeds are not fully mature when they
leave the tree and need a warm or cool period to finish developing.
Others, including fringe tree and Carolina silverbell, need both
warm and cool periods, and in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   Some seeds have a hard coating that needs to wear away before
moisture can enter and germination can begin. Years of rain, being
blown over rocky terrain or a trip through an animal's digestive
system can do the trick. But for gardeners there are techniques of
scarification (sanding, nicking or filing nearly through the seed
coat) and stratification (controlled periods of moist warm or cool
temperatures).
</P>
<P>
   Tree seeds are more of a commitment than marigolds, so be sure
to get advice on the seeds' needs when buying. Of course, plant
only trees suited to your climate. There's not much immortality
having the tree wiped out by a New York winter.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for tree seeds include F.W. Schumacher Co., 36 Spring
Hill Rd., Sandwich, Mass. 02563, (508) 888-0659, free catalog; and
Sheffield's Seed Co., 273 Auburn Road, Locke, N.Y. 13092; (315)
497-1058; free seed list, with a lot of additional information at
www.sheffields.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Helping Holly &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please tell me why the holly branches I cut are not growing
roots, even though they have been in water for three months. The
water has been changed regularly, and their leaves are still green.
What can I do to help them grow roots?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very little. Most shrubs are not like willows, where a casual
glance at a glass of water will prompt cuttings to grow roots.
Cuttings have to be taken at the right growth stage.
</P>
<P>
   For hollies, use 4- to 6-inch cuttings of semihard wood (after
that first flush of spring growth begins to harden, a few months
after it appears), with the lower leaves removed, so that just two
to five leaves remain. Remove a thin slice of bark along the lowest
inch or two of the stem. Dip the stem in rooting hormone powder,
covering the new wound, and stick the stem in a moistened medium,
half sphagnum peat, half perlite. Cover the pot with a plastic bag,
seal the bag to keep it humid and place in bright light but not
direct sun. Wait six weeks before gently tugging to see if there
are roots. If there aren't, wait longer.
</P>

ECONOMIC SCENE: DEMISE OF LONG-HELD THEORY ON INFLATION AND
UNEMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: J. Bradford DeLong is a professor of economics at the
University of California at Berkeley and co-editor of The Journal
of Economic Perspectives.)  
 (bl)  
 By J. BRADFORD DE LONG    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the Phillips curve?
</P>
<P>
   You remember the Phillips curve, the relationship between
unemployment and inflation proposed by the British economist A.W.
Phillips in the late 1950s and developed into its present form in
the late 1960s by Ned Phelps and Milton Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years mainstream economists' forecasts have
rested on the idea that should unemployment fall below an unknown
(but very real) level called the natural rate of unemployment, then
inflation would start to rise. And inflation would keep on rising
further until unemployment climbed back to or above its natural
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the Phillips curve is missing. All of a sudden,
economists are a lot less useful as forecasters. For as it stands
now, economists' forecasts of economic growth, unemployment and
inflation are no longer projections based on historical patterns
but, instead, pure guesses based on gut feelings about when, how,
and if the Phillips curve will return.
</P>
<P>
   If economists are to be of any use for forecasting, they need to
come up with a better _ and probably more complex _ theory about
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen during the 1990-92 recession, the Phillips curve
looked very healthy. In the second half of the 1980s the
unemployment rate fell to a low of 5.3 percent in 1989 and
inflation, which had averaged 2.4 percent a year in 1984-87, picked
up to 4.1 percent a year and rising by early 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the Federal Open Market Committee _ under the
leadership of Alan Greenspan, who was relatively new as chairman at
the time _ reacted sharply by pushing up interest rates. Tighter
monetary policy and the shock to expectations from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait caused total spending to fall. Unemployment rose
above its natural rate to a peak of 7.6 percent in June 1992. And
inflation fell.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the end of the 1980s knew exactly what the natural
rate of unemployment was. But even the most optimistic did not
think it could be lower than 5.5 percent, and even the most
pessimistic knew it could be no higher than 6.5 percent. Still, the
end of the 1980s retaught the lesson that the Phillips curve was
very real and had to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   That is why officials in the Clinton administration and the
Federal Reserve, as well as independent analysts, bit their
fingernails throughout the 1990s as they awaited the return of
rising inflation. By 1994 unemployment _ at 6.1 percent _ was in
the range where inflation had started to accelerate in the late
1980s, so the Fed spoke of undertaking pre-emptive strikes against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no inflation followed. By 1996 the unemployment rate was as
low as it had ever been in the 1980s. Yet inflation fell to less
than 2 percent a year. By 1999 unemployment was at 4.2 percent _
well below anyone's previous estimate of the natural rate _ yet
inflation was an even-lower 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the Phillips curve? There was confidence until the end
of 1997 that the Phillips curve would soon return. Temporary
special factors _ health care costs, rapid falls in computer prices
and so on _ were momentarily retarding the tendency of inflation to
rise when unemployment was lower than its natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors could not last forever, could they? Of course not.
So when their influence came to an end, inflation would begin its
rise. But years passed, and inflation did not rise.
</P>
<P>
   So mainstream economists' opinion shifted to the belief that the
natural rate of unemployment had fallen, though how far no one
really knew.
</P>
<P>
   Economists began spinning theories of what had caused the
natural rate to fall. Jim Medoff of Harvard began arguing in the
early 1990s that technological and organizational changes had led
the labor market to do a better job of matching workers needing
jobs to vacancies, thus substantially lowering the natural rate.
Others pointed to faster productivity growth that allowed higher
wage increases to be consistent with relative price stability.
Still others pointed to workers' fears for their jobs generated by
the memory of the recession and layoffs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at some primal level, economists continue to believe in
something like a Phillips curve. They believe that unemployment
will fall if demand expands faster than the economy's long-run
productive capacity. And they believe that if demand keeps
expanding faster than the economy's long-run productive capacity
then, in the long run, inflation will rise.
</P>
<P>
   It is just, they kept saying, that the natural rate of
unemployment _ the signal that this long run had arrived _ has
fallen mysteriously far and mysteriously fast.
</P>
<P>
   But, truth be told, the Phillips curve has not worked well
outside America. Only in the United States has there been a
relatively stable natural rate of unemployment to serve as a
reliable indicator of when demand pressure is about to raise
inflation. Elsewhere, the causes of rising inflation have always
been too complex to be summarized by simply comparing unemployment
to even a semistable natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the United States, Doug Staiger, Mark Watson and Jim
Stock pointed out in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, the
Phillips curve relationship was never as strong or as good at
forecasting inflation as was taught in intermediate macroeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus perhaps the surprising thing is not that forecasts of
inflation based on the Phillips curve have gone awry the last half
decade. Perhaps the surprising thing is that the complicated
economic processes determining changes in inflation could be
summarized for so long by such a simple relationship as the
standard Phillips curve.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is now clear that the simple theory of the
relation between inflation and unemployment that economists have
peddled for a quarter-century no longer works. If economists are to
be of any use, they need to come up with a better _ and in all
likelihood more sophisticated _ approach to understanding why
inflation rises.

 &HT;    DAYTON MAYOR LAUDS SUCCESS OF SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP WITH
SARAJEVO
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Holding his city up as a model, Dayton, Ohio Mayor
Michael Turner Wednesday said personal relationships have fueled
the success of their sister city relationship with Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, speaking at the National Press Club here, said the
people of Dayton worked to establish individual ties of friendship
to the people of Sarajevo, in war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to call the people of Dayton their friends,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was the site of negotiations between Serbs, Croats, and
Muslims to end the 3 1/2 year Balkan War. During the talks leading
up to the signing of the 1995 Dayton Accords, residents learned of
the toll of a bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Turner said, ``Our new friends in the Balkans have
given us a new perspective on our own city, and a greater
understanding of the importance of individual relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships have grown into a successful trans-oceanic
partnership, with the cities operating numerous individual exchange
programs. For example, more than 100 Dayton-area residents have
travelled to Sarajevo. While in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the Daytonians
stay in private homes. After their visit, the guests invite their
hosts on a trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exchanges have formed lasting friendships that have
changed the lives of Daytonians,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   To help prolong the friendship between the two cities, Turner
said other programs focus on young people. The University of Dayton
offers a scholarship program to Bosnian students that allows them
to interact with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what we have in common that can assist us in maintaining
the peace,'' the mayor said, adding that the exchanges have allowed
Dayton residents to discover the similarities between themselves
and the Bosnian people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of there sister city relationship, Turner believes
that Daytonians have a distinct world view.
</P>
<P>
   While he believes that Dayton has proven that individual
relationships have an impact far beyond official government
intervention, financial aid, and military force, he adds that the
city's residents realize the importance of the United States'
attempts to mediate world conflicts _ even those that seem
insignificant. That's because sharing their homes with Bosnians has
brought the story of suffering straight to Daytonian's living
rooms.

 &HT;    DAYTON MAYOR LAUDS SUCCESS OF SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP WITH
SARAJEVO

   WASHINGTON _ Holding his city up as a model, Dayton, Ohio Mayor
Michael Turner Wednesday said personal relationships have fueled
the success of their sister city relationship with Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, speaking at the National Press Club here, said the
people of Dayton worked to establish individual ties of friendship
to the people of Sarajevo, in war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to call the people of Dayton their friends,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was the site of negotiations between Serbs, Croats, and
Muslims to end the 3 1/2 year Balkan War. During the talks leading
up to the signing of the 1995 Dayton Accords, residents learned of
the toll of a bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Turner said, ``Our new friends in the Balkans have
given us a new perspective on our own city, and a greater
understanding of the importance of individual relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships have grown into a successful trans-oceanic
partnership, with the cities operating numerous individual exchange
programs. For example, more than 100 Dayton-area residents have
travelled to Sarajevo. While in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the Daytonians
stay in private homes. After their visit, the guests invite their
hosts on a trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exchanges have formed lasting friendships that have
changed the lives of Daytonians,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   To help prolong the friendship between the two cities, Turner
said other programs focus on young people. The University of Dayton
offers a scholarship program to Bosnian students that allows them
to interact with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what we have in common that can assist us in maintaining
the peace,'' the mayor said, adding that the exchanges have allowed
Dayton residents to discover the similarities between themselves
and the Bosnian people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of there sister city relationship, Turner believes
that Daytonians have a distinct world view.
</P>
<P>
   While he believes that Dayton has proven that individual
relationships have an impact far beyond official government
intervention, financial aid, and military force, he adds that the
city's residents realize the importance of the United States'
attempts to mediate world conflicts _ even those that seem
insignificant. That's because sharing their homes with Bosnians has
brought the story of suffering straight to Daytonian's living
rooms.

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Thursday suffered a political blow that reveals the instability of
his broad-based coalition and complicates his peacemaking efforts
at a time when he is trying to entice Syria back to the negotiating

   YUGOSLAVIA-REBELS (Dobrosin, Yugoslavia) _ Just across the
boundary line from Kosovo, guarded more visibly now by American
troops in watchtowers, armed Albanians wearing uniforms of a new
branch of the Kosovo Liberation Army are training for a battle the
West doesn't want them to have. Their numbers and leadership are a
mystery, but on this day fewer than 20 men, wearing a mixture of
German and American fatigues, did exercises in a muddy field with
their weapons, including a heavy machine gun on a tripod. On their
arms, they wear a cloth badge of red, black and yellow that looks
exactly like that of the supposedly disbanded and disarmed Kosovo
Liberation Army. The only difference is their name: the Liberation
Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, all towns in Serbia
itself, although their populations are largely ethnic Albanian. By

Thursday after a surprise raid on the sect's facilities on Tuesday.
The discovery has raised widespread fears in Japan that Aum, which

intended to discourage older people from holding jobs so younger
people would have a chance. The unanimous vote was a rare display
of bipartisanship in the House, and reflected a consensus that the

become counterproductive. The Senate is expected to take up a
similar measure soon, and President Clinton has said he would sign

total of 73 days, all 45 days of spring training and the first four
weeks of the season. But the arbitrator, Shyam Das, cut in half, to
two weeks, the in-season part of the suspension. And he eliminated
the remainder of the spring training suspension, ending Rocker's
exile at 13 days. Das also virtually eliminated the $20,000 fine
that Selig levied, reducing it to $500, which the Players
Association contended was the most Rocker could be fined under the
collective bargaining agreement. By Murray Chass.

A FRAME TO HOLD YOUR PIXELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with old-fashioned picture frames is that they can
display only one photograph at a time. If you have a lot of
pictures, you need a lot of frames, and if you have a lot of
frames, you need a lot of space on your desk, bedside table,
mantel, walls and so on. That is rarely a problem for grandmothers,
who miraculously seem to have infinite space for photos of the kids
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But grandmothers of the near future are likely to display their
pictures in digital photo frames, which can show a nearly infinite
number of photographs, digital postcards and, in some cases, short
digital movies. The photos are shown on a flat-panel, liquid
crystal display mounted inside the frame, and the image quality is,
well, nearly photo quality. And the future starts now.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these new digital frames are already available, one from
Sony and another from a new company, Ceiva Logic. Several other
companies are planning to introduce frames in the next few months.
The first models range from expensive to absurdly expensive, and
they suffer from the usual first-run glitches and annoyances common
to groundbreaking products.
</P>
<P>
   But even with their faults, these new digital frames are so
compelling that they will probably be hot items when Mother's Day
arrives. Some 1.8 million digital cameras were sold in 1999, and
billions of digital photos are filling up hard disks and flying
around on the Internet. It is inevitable that demand will grow for
a convenient way to share and display all these photos, even among
people who get red-eyed and blurry just thinking about computers.
</P>
<P>
   These digital frames do not do anything that cannot be done, and
done better, on a desktop or laptop computer, but who wants a
computer hogging the bedside table?
</P>
<P>
   Sony introduced its PHD-A55 CyberFrame last year as a prototype
to show off its Memory Stick data storage device, which is used in
some of its digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberFrame, priced at $899, has some impressive features,
including a small but bright 5.5-inch active matrix screen and the
ability to pivot automatically between portrait and landscape
formats and to display not only photos but also short video clips
with sound. It has been in such demand among gadget fiends that
Sony is scrambling to make more affordable models for the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   But the CyberFrame suffers from complexity, from its industrial
plexiglass design and from its total reliance on the Memory Stick
to get pictures and video clips into the device. If you cannot get
pictures onto a Memory Stick, the frame is just an expensive
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   A more practical alternative is the Ceiva Internet Connected
Picture Frame, which costs $249 plus a monthly service fee of $2.99
or $7.99, depending on the plan. Although it lacks the superior
picture quality of Sony's active matrix screen, the Ceiva's clever
online connection, simplicity and lower price make it the more
compelling choice.
</P>
<P>
   Using Ceiva's technology, one can send up-to-the-minute pictures
of the kids to Grandma's bedside table anywhere in the country,
assuming that Grandma has a phone jack and a power outlet nearby.
The frame can store up to 10 pictures at a time, and it can display
them in sequence, like a slide show. As many as 250 photos can be
stored in a digital photo album on line, all of them ready to be
cycled through the frame. The owner of the frame can grant
permission for designated individuals to send photos to the frame
as well, but there are security safeguards to keep Grandma from
receiving unsolicited risque photos from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, one does not need a computer, an
Internet account or any computer experience to enjoy digital photos
on the Ceiva frame. Technically that is true, but someone has to
set up an account, manage the photos and fiddle with various
settings on Ceiva's Web site to use the frame to its fullest. And
someone has to have a digital camera, or a scanner to digitize
traditional photos, and a computer to send the photos over the
modem and through the net to Grandmother's house, tra la.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the Ceiva looks just like a black wooden picture
frame. In the center of the frame is a passive matrix screen big
enough to display a 5-by-7 photo. Viewed straight on, pictures on
the Ceiva screen are bright and colorful. From an angle, however,
pictures wash out or flip to negative colors, a common drawback of
passive screens.
</P>
<P>
   On the back of the frame are two ports, one for a standard
telephone wire and one for a power plug. Connected to the telephone
line, the Ceiva's built-in modem automatically makes a local call
(the $2.99 plan) or toll-free call (the $7.99 plan) to connect to
Ceiva's computers, where pictures are stored. The calls are usually
made each night after midnight, when the phone line is unlikely to
be in use, and typically last just a few minutes, long enough to
download a new batch of photos.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient viewers can press and hold a white button on the back
of the frame to force Ceiva's network to download new pictures
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Ceiva frame is simple to use and will undoubtedly improve
over time. But it is facing tough competition from a couple of
upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   One is Digi-Frame, which will soon be selling two models,
including a small, battery-powered digital frame for travelers
($399). A larger Digi-Frame model ($599) has no direct Internet
connection, but it can retrieve pictures directly from a personal
computer or Mac via a standard cable. It can also take a memory
card directly from a digital camera. Prices have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the Storybox Connected Frame from Weave
Innovations. It is expected to go on sale in July for $299 plus a
monthly fee starting at around $5.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a sneak preview last month, the Storybox frame appears
to borrow the best features of the Sony and Ceiva models, including
an active matrix screen and a phone-line connection to the
Internet. It also adds an assortment of new tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The Storybox frame allows owners to share photos over the
Internet, but, like the Digi-Frame, it also has slots to accept the
standard memory cards used by most digital cameras, enabling people
to bypass the network. Through an alliance with Kodak, owners of
nondigital cameras can have their film developed and sent as
digital images to their personal storage space on the Storybox
network.
</P>
<P>
   Besides displaying photo-quality images, the Storybox frame can
also display news headlines, local weather and traffic reports,
stock quotes and other information (these services will cost extra
and may include advertising). Storybox owners will also be able to
order high-quality prints of favorite photos, plus a variety of
photo gifts, including T-shirts, coffee mugs and even old-fashioned
picture frames.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may find it hard to justify spending $300 on a
digital picture frame when a fully functional PC costs just a few
hundred dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   But digital frames of some sort are likely to be part of the
houses of the future, and these new digital frames are a window
into the future of Internet appliances.

BEHIND THE DEADPAN, A TALENT IS IN ACTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bruce Willis feels ``unappreciated,'' to quote his character
from ``Die Hard,'' it's easy to understand why. ``The Sixth
Sense,'' the other-world thriller, was one of the biggest hits of
1999. The movie has earned six Oscar nominations, including
deserved acknowledgment of the young Haley Joel Osment and Toni
Colette, as the mama lion whose belief in her tormented son is
steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Willis' considerable effort in that film went unnoticed by
the Academy. By now, he may feel that the most memorable line from
``The Sixth Sense'' _ ``I see dead people'' _ refers to the way
Oscar voters feel about him.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start in films, Willis claimed his place in the
star firmament fully 12 years ago with ``Die Hard.'' But he has
rarely been taken seriously as an actor whose clarity is an
integral element of his films: he can be so subtle he might well be
a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   There's no subtlety in ``The Whole Nine Yards,'' a mindless
comedy whose appeal _ it topped the box office in the two weeks
after its release _ apparently stems from the fact that Willis
doesn't break a sweat. His filmography is stocked with choices that
allowed him to work hard as an actor, movies with performances as
noteworthy as the one in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Willis isn't saving the day, armored with an
impermeable coat of street-corner suavity, his audiences generally
stay away.
</P>
<P>
   It's been true in movie history that audiences buy so deeply
into an actor's image that they're unwilling to watch him venture
into uncharted territory. Generally, it happens to masters of savvy
casualness, like Humphrey Bogart or Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Sense'' is a genre picture, though an unusually
thoughtful and elegant one, it serves as an exception. In it,
Willis gets to demonstrate class and humility, and his performance
offers texture. Were ``Sense'' a straight-ahead melodrama, he'd be
laughed off the screen, though he's often available for such a
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not penalized so much for starring in bad action
pictures _ and he's made his share _ because that kind of role is
expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   It may be because he started in television and therefore it's
hard to take him seriously. Or it may be attributable to his rakish
smirk. His moue and his party reputation from the '80s can make him
seem insignificant, a frat-boy actor in a world of Method brooders.
The slender, crooked smirk communicates so much leisurely
confidence that it must make people feel as if Willis were tossing
off an upstage wink, letting audiences in on the fact that he's
just hanging until the limo pulls up to swoop him off for the next
gig.
</P>
<P>
   Willis' mini-grin was a perfect appliance for David Addison, the
noisy, failing private eye he played in the old ``Moonlighting''
series on TV from 1985 to 1989. Addison's glib one-upmanship caused
as much trouble for him as the cases he and his partner, Maddie
Hayes (Cybill Shepherd), investigated while they tumbled through
the tides of a comic romance.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Willis' performance was sheer bemused
effrontery, picking up the White Negro gauntlet that Robert Culp
had laid down two decades earlier in ``I Spy.'' From the mob flash
of his clothes to his breezy way with lines dense with pop culture
references, to his penchant for bursting into song from what seemed
like the entire Stax catalog, Addison strove to be the man he
thought he should be, but whose coolness had passed its expiration
date: an exuberant and likable player-manque.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Moonlighting,'' Willis showed that depth of feeling, an
emotional delicacy that contrasted with the sure banter, was not
outside his range. (That contradictory fluidity, which is slightly
reminiscent of Jackie Gleason, is one of the keys to his appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   In the series' ``Brother, Can You Spare a Blonde'' episode,
which gave us the first intimation of yearning in the show, the
camera pans across a room from Shepherd, who is flirting and
laughing with the actor playing Willis' brother, to Willis. His
face torn between a glare and a grimace, he casts a look at her,
tightens his mouth and looks down, an expression of frustration and
dejection he'll never let her see.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first time Willis got a chance to unearth
something beneath the groovy young hipster arrogance. He's capable
of suffering, a quality that gives weight to the bounce in his
stride. His silent pain was an updating of a screwball comedy
tenet: feelings are all the more meaningful if you keep them to
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   That capacity for ache was the core of his performance onstage
in Sam Shepard's ``Fool for Love,'' where I caught him in 1984. His
face was closed off, and his presence was riveting. He wasn't quite
able to use his voice onstage; he got by on ambition and the energy
expended for a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, this offered a pre-vision of later work; the
taciturn mask he tends to fall back on as shorthand in third-rate
action pictures like ``Mercury Rising'' or ``The Jackal,'' when he
can't connect to a character, most likely because it's the standard
Man With a Past. Or in ``The Siege,'' where he looks as if he's
still trying to remember his lines. But this austerity is a
protective reflex, coasting on his movie star sinecure.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets a chance to use his voice, occasionally dropping
into a murmur of plaintiveness, Willis is astonishingly effective.
(This is what the movies offer him that the stage cannot.) Much of
the success of ``The Sixth Sense'' comes from Willis' performance;
he pitched his voice into an unguarded whisper as Malcolm Crowe,
the child psychologist determined to help the hypersensitive young
boy played by Osment.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is so empathetic he seems to have been born without a
layer of skin, and Willis is essentially a straight man. It would
have been easy for Willis to upstage Osment, simply by calling
attention to his own hurt and showing us the little boy within. He
makes a trickier choice: he shows patience and awareness of another
actor, a subtle fanning of technique that builds dread _ and
sympathy for his character.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, whenever Willis underplays and shows some
sophistication as an actor, he is, for the most part, ignored. In
Norman Jewison's ``In Country,'' the 1989 adaptation of Bobbie Ann
Mason's novel, Willis' turn as Emmett, a Vietnam vet whose soul is
a running wound, eschews the exhibitionistic explosiveness that's a
stock reaction for actors in such parts.
</P>
<P>
   Willis plays Emmett as a man who's lost in his own skin, and is
past caring how others think of him. Yet his discomfort over being
damaged goods makes him wary of how he's regarded; he foolishly
clings to his conception of masculinity because it's all he has.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That may be Willis' biggest asset: his ability to find the
contradictions in a working class man's sense of self and to
wrestle with his own vulnerability. In the first ``Die Hard,'' in
1988, John McClane is not a supercop with Teflon-coated nerves.
(Such action-hero corniness becomes his stock in trade in the two
sequels, which made them increasingly more irrelevant.) In fact
he's bewildered, and the comedy comes out of the fact that he can't
believe what's happening to him.
</P>
<P>
   The movie relies on his regular-guy expressiveness, right down
to his desire to apologize to his wife. His needs are a touch of
sanity that somehow makes the ridiculous proceedings seem real.
Willis' melancholy flipped the script, humanizing a genre that had
atrophied into, at best, a home for archetype. Imagine ``Die Hard''
with the Zen placidity of Richard Gere, who turned down the role,
and you get an idea of what it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   (In Willis' commentary on the DVD of the ``Moonlighting'' pilot,
he reveals that Glenn Gordon Caron, the series' creator, told him
that taking the ``Die Hard'' role was a bad idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the biggest risk that Quentin Tarantino took with ``Pulp
Fiction'' in 1994 wasn't in casting John Travolta, but in hiring
Willis. ( Willis' throwaway riffing in ``Moonlighting'' must have
left a mark on Tarantino; a tag-team version of that chatter fills
his films.) By then _ seven years into his film-star career _
Willis was already a punchline in search of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the time sinking in the morass of ``The Color of
Night,'' a title that was becoming way too prophetic for his
career. And ever since ``Die Hard'' put him on the A-list, any time
he has tried to experiment and turn his ready-for-anything iron-man
persona on its head, audiences have taken his grasping for
something other than playing a guy's guy as a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   His fan core was probably appalled by a man who was starring in
a series of wine cooler ads trying to convey an inner life in his
films.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``Die Hard,'' Willis will probably always get work as
an action star, the kind of hood ornament who stands for American
swiftness and brutality around the world. Pictures like 1998s
``Armageddon'' will ensure an eight-figure paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's as if fans missed the point of the flesh-and-blood
humanity he radiated amid the gore of ``Die Hard.'' His
accomplishment was to raise the stakes for the action film, but the
only lesson the movie industry seemed to learn from ``Die Hard's''
success was to turn that picture into a mini-genre: ``Die Hard'' on
a bus (``Speed''), ``Die Hard'' as a live-action cartoon (``Home
Alone'') or ``Die Hard'' on Air Force One (``Air Force One'').
</P>
<P>
   Willis' triumph laminated him as a two-fisted type, and his
public was uninterested in accepting him in movies that deviated
from action and, eventually, in action movies that deviated from
``Die Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the films he made in the time directly following ``Die
Hard'' played to theaters where the projectionist might have been
the only audience member, so thoroughly did they repel. Few stars
were rejected as fully for attempting material that offered rewards
different from their bread-and-butter work.
</P>
<P>
   Willis' predicament is similar to that of Burt Reynolds', who
became a redneck in a gilded cage because of his skill at
portraying high-living backwoods slickers. (Fortunately, Willis
doesn't have a resume full of ``Cannonball Run's'' and ``Smokey and
the Bandit's.'' Those pictures stuck to the talented Reynolds like
tattoos.)
</P>
<P>
   Willis films like ``In Country'' or ``Death Becomes Her'' (1992)
or ``The Color of Night,'' and films in which he had smaller parts
like 1991's ``Billy Bathgate'' (where he was the only credible
person in the picture) and ``Mortal Thoughts'' (his seedy pleasure
seeker seemed to have crawled out of a Buick ashtray), were not
only failures, but were also interpreted by hardcore Willis fans as
insults.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Hudson Hawk,'' a misbegotten and smug adventure
spoof, audiences were justified in feeling insulted. His Peter
Fallow, the wrecked journalist in the hollow 1990 adaptation of
``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' was a marvel, but he was treated as if
he had no business being in it, and as if its failure were his
fault. (His spoiled-brat behavior during its making, detailed in
Julie Salamon's book ``The Devil's Candy,'' didn't do him much
good, either.)
</P>
<P>
   It's in these other kinds of parts that he shows the hunger that
sparked his best acting. Unlike other stars who are stunted when
they deviate from their specialite de la maison, Willis seems
liberated by a fresh take. In ``12 Monkeys'' (1995), for example,
he centers Terry Gilliam's conversion of Chris Marker's ``La
Jetee'' from a bravura art-film gesture into a hothouse noir and
gives one of the best and most undernoted performances of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Willis isn't interested in just squandering his
currency in action, preferring to shift his attention outside his
normal purview (though someone should have talked him out of
starring as the neurotic car salesman in last year's ``Breakfast of
Champions''). Such an instinct shows Willis' compulsion for making
the odd bets _ and often as not, he rolls a winner.

A VIRTUAL POP STAR ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, pop stars are so carefully packaged that critics
constantly harp about artificiality. But a new German crooner is
reveling in it.
</P>
<P>
   According to its creators, E-Cyas _ for Electronic Cybernetic
Artificial Superstar _ is the first fully virtual male character to
release a hit recording and video. The avatar's recording, which
has entered at least one German Top 100 chart, has the appropriate
if colloquially awkward title ``Are You Real?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the basic question, isn't it?'' said Walter Grassl, a
spokesman for I-D Media, the company that created E-Cyas. Before
his recording debut, E-Cyas had been the digital host of a German
chat room. The move from the Web to recording came through a
collaboration of I-D Media, Edel Records and Alex Christensen, a
techno-music producer. Grassl would not say if E-Cyas is merely
fronting for a human vocalist or if his voice is computer
generated. A sample can be downloaded at www.e-cyas.com.
</P>
<P>
   If I-D Media's plans come to fruition, E-Cyas will follow a
typical career track. The single will probably be distributed in
the rest of Europe and Japan (home to the first female virtual pop
star, Kyoko Date) later this year before reaching the United
States. A full album is in the works, and concerts featuring
projected images of E-Cyas are being planned (or threatened).
</P>
<P>
   E-Cyas faces a problem common to many celebrities: He receives
up to 100 e-mail messages daily, including some marriage proposals.
``It's strange,'' Grassl said. ``It's like a real pop star.''

ITALIAN DESIGNERS MAKE DOORS FADE INTO THE SUNSET

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Italians to solve a design problem homeowners didn't
know they had: clunky doors. Try achieving a sleek and modern
interior while dealing with throwback elements like doorjambs and
thresholds, lintels and hinges, much less carved paneled doors.
It's enough to make a minimalist swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Consider instead a glass-and-aluminum wall system. It is so
sophisticated, it is not even known as a door, much less as a room
divider. Architectural without being massive, the wall system has
glass panels that are set into an aluminum frame and hung from
ceiling tracks. The system, which also comes in a variety of
materials and colored glasses, glide with barely a touch, lapping
one over the other in various combinations. They can even pull a
disappearing act, like a good major-domo, into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Several Italian companies have recently introduced these
un-doors in America to an audience hungry for renovation ideas that
can transform a space. Needless to say, these new sliding wall
systems help make any space look like a show loft.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Post, a Manhattan designer who works the contemporary
all-white vein with a vengeance, was an instant convert. ``From a
Tudor in Greenwich to a prewar on Park, if you're going to get rid
of the Aubisson rug, the heavy drapes and the traditional decor in
order to go clean and feel the light and space, this is the way to
go,'' Post said. She has already installed the Italian-made wall
systems in five residential projects, as well as in her own
apartment on Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Before she made the discovery, Post was forced to devise her own
version _ traditional doors with glass panels. The demand was
great, she said, for doors that didn't block the free flow of space
in modern apartments. ``Let's face it, families don't all sit
together in one room anymore,'' Post said. ``Someone's in the
kitchen cooking; the kids are doing their homework in the family
room. Rooms have all become multipurpose, and they all need to be
connected. And yet for resale, apartments still have to have
separate rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   She found that the chief advantage of the panel system, which
typically comes in clear or translucent glass, is that they ``add
an architectural edge while still creating the illusion of
expanding space,'' Post said. Standard room dividers, she added,
``are so tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Post has installed them in a number of ways, from a single panel
to close off a kitchen to four panels that divide her home office
from the living room. The four-panel combination, with one fixed to
the wall and three floating, can be rearranged to entirely seal or
partially reveal.
</P>
<P>
   For a small Manhattan apartment, Post is planning to knock out
the wall separating two bedrooms and insert a wall system. The
couple who own the place use the second bedroom only once or twice
a year, when a mother-in-law visits; it will be furnished with a
leather sofa bed and a desk. Otherwise, they will leave the panels
open to create their master suite. ``If I put in old-fashioned
doors, you would always have this sense that you were leaving one
room to enter another,'' Post said.
</P>
<P>
   At another apartment belonging to a couple with two small
children, Post located the sliding walls between the living room
and the family room. ``I use them constantly,'' Jenny Symonds, the
client, said. ``They are so sheer, they make the apartment loftlike
without losing any sense of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three Italian companies that sell the
aluminum-and-glass wall systems in New York. One of them is the
Tre-Piu Pavilion, and Post was introduced to it by the Italian
manufacturer Poliform, which is represented in New York by Nova
Studio International. The Tre-Piu Pavilion was designed by Antonio
Citterio, the Clark Kent of Italian design, whose subtle way of
making modern furniture a tad more sensual has been a huge success
in attracting Americans to Italian high design.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tre-Piu Pavilion was introduced here 18 months ago,
more than $1 million worth of panel systems have been sold, said
Cinzia Fama-Agnolucci, the vice president of sales and marketing.
``It sold basically right off the pages of our catalog without even
being installed in our showroom,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Their appeal, Fama-Agnolucci said, besides tapping into the
contemporary look of the moment, is that they do not require a
track in the floor, but hang from a overhead track. The track can
be attached within an opening or mounted in front of one. When used
as a pocket door, the panels do not require a casement box to be
embedded within the wall, she said. The average cost,
Fama-Agnolucci added, starts at $1,500 for a panel two to four feet
wide. The maximum height is 10 feet. One thing to note: the doors
do not lock.
</P>
<P>
   Post added that she has paid $1,800 to $11,000 for Tre-Piu wall
systems, depending on the number of panels. Her own combination of
four panels to cover a nine-foot opening cost approximately $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Tre-Piu will take orders from both designers
and individuals. Design services are offered and include taking
proper measurements and providing an installer.
</P>
<P>
   The Tre-Piu Pavilion system is available at Nova Studio
International, at the Architects and Designers Building, 150 East
58th St., New York. Interni, in the same building, distributes the
Lema Stile wall system. And the Rimadesio Siparium system is at the
Domus Design Collection, 215 East 58th St., New York City.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a night like any other.
</P>
<P>
   Until I knocked over the 2-and-a-half-foot-tall Finnish glass
candle pedestal, designed by Oiva Toikka in 1964. It stood in my
living room behind the Florence Knoll sofa. I paid $1,600 for it
two years ago at the Triple Pier Expo, a collectibles show in New
York. The purchase broke the ceiling on my expenditure for glass,
ever. It smashed into loose change in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned. Then, I was weirdly sobered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddha's first message _ Line 1,'' Richard Shweder, a cultural
anthropologist at the University of Chicago whose field study is in
India, said to me two weeks later, when I started looking into the
incident, ``All suffering comes from attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Shweder ever seen Kaj Franck's barware? I don't think so.
Buddha used his hands to drink. What did he serve his gimlets in?
</P>
<P>
   I have been collecting modern design for the last 10 years,
specifically Finnish glass. I wait for the spring show at the piers
the way other people wait for robins, or the first asparagus.
Breaking my biggest piece of it was anything but an act of design.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it? Setting up for supper with the television, I swung an
Alvar Aalto nesting table past it (only the best for the clumsy),
hit it on the chin, and over it went in an elegant back dive, like
an acrobatic swan.
</P>
<P>
   The Toikka Majakka (Lighthouse in Finnish) was a prize. Toikka,
a glass artist still working today, developed the technique
(blowing glass into a mold, then turning it like a lathe) that
produced the Majakka's beam of frozen light as the art director at
Nuutajarvi. The company, established in 1793 as a window and bottle
maker, employed other designers in the 20th century, including
Gunnel Nyman, Franck and, through its consolidation in 1987 with
Iittala, Tapio Wirkkala and Timo Sarpaneva, whose names crystallize
what is most collectible in midcentury-modern Finnish glass.
</P>
<P>
   When the bright surface of my living room floor rocked to a
stop, it was broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   I called a friend, dialing in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg, I broke something,'' I said, too numb to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? An arm? A leg?'' he said. I stopped grieving.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at work, colleagues laughed. They laughed again
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the confessions started.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing?'' another friend said, relieved. ``It made me
nervous. I always thought I was going to tip it over.'' Others
agreed. Too many others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold winter scene when I deposited what was left of my
$1,600 of 1960s Finnish glass in the metal-mesh trash bin on the
corner of 20th Street and Ninth Avenue _ like a Chelsea version of
a mob dumping ground. The shapely leg of crystal startled patrons
at Le Bergamot as they left with breakfast croissants.
</P>
<P>
   At home, I started to question the existence of what survived.
The glitter that greeted my eye rang false.
</P>
<P>
   I'm middle aged (as I write, I've turned 48). Why did I suddenly
want to sell everything in my apartment? Was I ``in crisis?''
</P>
<P>
   I started making the calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a silver lining,'' said Dr. Carol Ryff, a professor of
psychology at the University of Wisconsin, speaking to me about the
incident. Ryff is a member of the MacArthur Foundation Research
Network on Successful Midlife Development, which released the
initial results of its 10-year study of midlife adulthood last
year. Researchers found that ``midlife crisis'' was a phrase, not a
fact: people in the prime of midlife were generally happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reaction is obviously wrapped up with bigger issues than
the item,'' she said. Really? ``It's a kind of shattering of a
fantasy.'' (I wish she hadn't used that word.) She explained that I
had momentarily come to terms with my mortality, investing my
psychic energy, much like an emotional attachment to another
person, in an object that I then lost. The Toikka and I were both
living on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things break; people die _ it's all a flash in the pan,'' Ryff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, where was the silver lining?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those midlife adults who have these sobering moments about
what it's all about,'' she concluded, ``who spend time reflecting
on those issues, who look at all of the past with equanimity and
say, `It's OK,' will have an easier time growing old.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that I decided to replace the Majakka. I did not
want to look at the past with equanimity. I wanted to collect the
past, and rearrange it attractively.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem _ we'll find another one,'' said Eeva Musacchia, my
Finnish dealer. This roiled another wave of reaction: how rare
could an easily replaceable object be? I squelched it. ``Were you
insured?'' Musacchia asked casually.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't; I'm not. Now that I knew my self-worth had a glass
jaw, I called an insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a tenants policy, if you break something yourself, you're
not covered,'' said Alan Breslow, a vice president of Ralph Parnes
Associates, a New York insurance agency. ``If somebody else breaks
it, you're covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslow recommended scheduling the collectible items in it in a
separate, second policy, which would insure me against myself. A
professional appraiser would determine the value of them; a
dealer's detailed receipt, upon purchase, would also suffice in the
event of a claim, Breslow said. I would have to work hard with a
``wear and tear'' item like my Knoll sofa to distinguish it from an
old couch, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Fine arts are comparatively inexpensive to itemize from an
insurer's point of view, Breslow said, less expensive than other
kinds of valuable property, like jewelry or cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In a fast-moving market like midcentury-modern design, it would
be advisable to reappraise a collection every year, not within the
standard three to five years _ or if you buy things frequently.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't replaced Toikka's candle pedestal, but 18 drinking
glasses in two sizes, designed in the 1970s by Wirkkala in amber
and light violet were an inexplicable gap in my collection _ the
minute I saw them.
</P>
<P>
   I really need drinking glasses more, don't I? People break them
all the time.

Countdown commentary column.)

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The Bush campaign has often called the GOP primary contest a
roller-coaster ride. And, for the past few weeks, its tone should
have made everyone aboard sick.
 &HT;    The lowest dive so far came with Sen. John McCain's orchestrated
``Catholic Voter Alert'' telephone calls in Michigan and
Washington, the calls the senator first denied making, then denied
denying.
 &HT;    McCain's goal was to hurt front-runner George W. Bush by tying
him to religious intolerance at Bob Jones University, while helping
himself with his own base _ the media, Democrats and moderate
voters.
 &HT;    Even though he was forced to repudiate the ``Catholic Alert''
calls, McCain's attacks _ which he somehow maintains are not meant
to paint Bush as a bigot _ led the Texas governor to issue a
statement of ``regret'' for any misimpression left by his
appearance at the college.
 &HT;    Bush had a good night on Tuesday, but he shouldn't let his
delegate mop-ups in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington convince
him that McCain will ease up on his ``intolerance'' charge anytime
soon.
 &HT;    After all, McCain's salvo against Bush supporter Pat Robertson
and the Rev. Jerry Falwell came only a day after Bush's statement
of regret. The Arizonan singled out two dinosaurs of the Christian
political-activism network, while praising two lesser-known figures
who generally keep their outreach away from politics _ apparently,
the acceptable sort of Christian conservative.
 &HT;    McCain's strategy is obvious: He's writing off the South in hope
of winning California, New York and New England. He aims to chalk
up delegates by convincing voters that he's the best firewall
against those horrible, nasty zealots from down South, ``agents of
intolerance'' such as Robertson, Falwell and, by extension, Bush.
 &HT;    No, most Republicans aren't buying this, and won't. But many
moderates and Democrats are, and they can vote in open primaries.
That means Bush has to stop complaining about McCain ``sleaze'' and
do something about it _ as one Bush supporter said Tuesday on Rush
Limbaugh's show, ``Get off defense and hit hard.''
 &HT;    What had everyone so excited about George W. in the first place
is that he seemed to have a conservative message with a
multicultural constituency. When he broke into Spanish with ease
and reached out to minority communities in California, people took
notice.
 &HT;    This wasn't your dad's brand of conservatism. It was more
inclusive _ not because he was out criticizing bedrock Republican
principles, the way McCain does, but because he was speaking in a
more welcoming tone and reaching out to groups that most
conservatives had long written off.
 &HT;    It's time Bush got back to that approach. In the days between
now and the crucial California and New York primaries, he should go
where most Republicans fear to tread _ into the barrios, Harlem and
South Central, into community centers and inner-city high schools.
He should reopen the dialogue that he has been leading in his state
for the past five years.
 &HT;    Some of his advisers would deem such events ``too risky'' _
heaven forbid if someone heckled poor Georgie! But that sort of
``safe'' thinking is what got Bush into this mess in the first
place.
 &HT;    Taking his message of educational choice and equal opportunity
without quotas into urban areas may not win Bush many votes there,
but it's a start. And it would highlight McCain's weaknesses on
domestic issues and spike his attempts to tar Bush with the brush
of intolerance.
 &HT;    Imagine if, next time McCain tries to hint that Bush is
intolerant, the Texas governor has spent that morning meeting with
black ministers. Which candidate will sound disingenuous and petty?
 &HT;    If Bush is actually hopelessly ``trapped on the right,'' as
McCain and the media want voters to believe, why does the latest
Washington Post-ABC News poll still show him beating Al Gore in the
general election? And why does his base still include not only
Christian conservatives but also moderate, mainline Republicans?
 &HT;    On the heels of his wins on Tuesday, Bush has a major
opportunity to do far more than merely put Bob Jones University
behind him. With the right offensive-driving moves, he could run
the Straight Talk Express off the road, right into the Gore
campaign bus.
 &HT;    He might start by giving a major address on race in America,
praising the diversity of states such as California and denouncing
those who would seek to severely curtail immigration. Then go to
Tuskegee, Ala., and speak about the injustices perpetrated there
against black Americans.
 &HT;    Remember, when the leaves are starting to turn, Al Gore can be
counted on to be coloring the political landscape with racially
divisive rhetoric. We recently saw a hint of what to expect when
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, charged that ``Republicans
would rather take pictures of black children than feed them.''
 &HT;    The more Bush does now to undercut those attacks, the more time
he'll later be able to devote to blasting Gore. Maybe he can start
by pointing out that Gore also made a controversial visit to a
religious institution _ a Buddhist temple.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The unfinished attic in my house has fiberglass insulation on
the floor with a vapor barrier under the insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation was put down between the joists and I want to add
more insulation on top.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no more space left between the joists because
the old insulation fills the space up to the top of each beam.
</P>
<P>
   Should I install an additional vapor barrier and should I lay
the new insulation on top of the old fiberglass batts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Put down the new insulation by rolling the new batts across
the top of the joists and at right angles to the original
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   This provides another layer of insulation on top of the wood
joists (wood is not a good insulator) while also serving to cover
up any gaps left by the old insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the insulation out near the eaves and work your
way in toward the center, using only unfaced batts. You do not want
an additional vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a family room on the side of our house that was added
on some years ago. It has wood paneling on the inside and is fully
heated and insulated.
</P>
<P>
   This past month we noticed some kind of flying insects that look
like ants with wings. These seem to congregate down near the floor
in one corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried that these may be termites, but some say they are
merely flying ants.
</P>
<P>
   Without calling in a professional, how can we tell if these
really are termites or ants?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a difference in appearance if you examine one of the
insects closely.
</P>
<P>
   Both a flying ant and a termite has four wings, but if it is an
ant the two wings in front will be a little larger than the two in
back. A termite's wings are all the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the termite will have a straight, one-piece body, while an
ant has a narrow-waisted body that looks like it is made of two
segments or parts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can we paint our dull looking light gray asphalt roof
shingles a more colorful and darker color?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can paint the shingles with a good quality exterior latex
house paint, but bear in mind that at least two coats will be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Also remember that you will have to repaint regularly to keep up
the appearance _ probably once every three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our living room was paneled years ago with plywood that came
with a dark finish.
</P>
<P>
   Can we apply a paint over this paneling in order to brighten the
room, and if so, what kind of paint would you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can paint the panels with any flat or semi-gloss finish,
but I would recommend a satin finish rather than a flat.
</P>
<P>
   You will first have to remove all wax, polish and soil on the
wood by wiping down with very fine steel wool dipped into paint
thinner, then wipe again with a rag dipped into the same solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Sand lightly and wipe off all sanding dust before applying the
first coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Use a stain killer such as Kilz or BIN for this first coat, then
apply the finish coat of satin enamel.
</P>

 DON'T TOUCH THE WALL! IT'S BY SOL LeWITT  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, Carole and Dick Cline were looking for something to
hang over the fireplace in the sitting room of their new home,
which overlooks a golf course near Chicago. The couple's art
consultant, Deborah Lovely, brought by a few paintings but none
that worked with the couple's antique furniture and multicolored
rug, Cline said. Then Lovely suggested a Sol LeWitt mural _ a
``wall drawing'' in the artist's parlance. By Christmas, the couple
had something to match the rug: a geometric drawing in diluted
India inks applied with sponges, covering two walls of their
sitting room _ about 250 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't have a chance to meet LeWitt. ``The joke around
here is, `Does Sol LeWitt really exist?''' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred of the artist's wall drawings have been installed in
homes around the world, said Susanna Singer, LeWitt's longtime
agent. None was actually put there by LeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   What LeWitt sells _ for up to $100,000 a wall _ is a design,
with detailed instructions for how it should be carried out. (Among
other things, he recommends priming the wall with six coats of
Benjamin Moore Regal Satin Latex in Decorator White No. 215-01.)
His representatives, including the Paula Cooper Gallery in New
York, offer lists of qualified installers, who work at the
homeowner's expense.
</P>
<P>
   One LeWitt, a 10-by-12-foot rectangle of yellow paint and white
crayon, resides in the Greenwich Village town house of the artist
Pat Stier. ``It's very subtle,'' Stier said of the piece, which she
acquired about six years ago. ``People have leaned against it at
parties,'' she said, ``and I've had to rush over and tell them not
to. And the people who clean never know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt's drawings have appeared in kitchens, exercise rooms and
on stairways _ though that is his least favorite location, because,
he said, ``there tends to be a lot of traffic, and they can get
beat up.'' Lately, the artist, who is 70, has been declining
stairway commissions, he said, asking clients to ``please try to
find another wall.''
</P>
<P>
   One of LeWitt's first jobs, 45 years ago, was working as a
graphic designer for the architect I.M. Pei. (Among other things,
he designed the architect's stationery.) LeWitt said that was when
he realized he wanted to work like an architect: conceiving
projects, then letting others carry them out. Now he uses that
approach on public commissions, like the mural at the entrance to
Christie's in Rockefeller Center, and the wall drawings in a
retrospective now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A part
of that show will arrive in November at the Whitney Museum in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To LeWitt, having his drawings in homes is a ``two-headed
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have them any place, but in homes they get a lot
of wear and tear,'' he said. ``It's impossible for people to take
really good care of these things. They have kids, they have dogs,
they have cats. A museum has a staff.''
</P>
<P>
   People _ unlike museums _ move around. Frederieke Taylor, an art
dealer in SoHo, bought her LeWitt wall drawing in 1971 for $600. It
was a charity auction, she recalled, and ``nobody else bid.'' Since
then, she has moved three times _ on each occasion arranging to
have the drawing painted over, then recreated at the new location.
Twice LeWitt reconfigured the drawing to fit new room dimensions.
Taylor plans to call on him again, now that she has relocated to
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt doesn't charge for reworking an existing drawing _ it's a
service he provides, because it has to be done right.'' Lately, he
said, he has been thinking about ``what happens when I'm not
here.'' He toyed with the idea of letting people he's worked with
make aesthetic decisions about placement and modifications. ``But
the trouble is, they'll die too,'' he said. ``And then you'll have
third and fourth generation people, and you'll be getting too far
from the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he has decided that the ability to change drawings _ at
least officially _ will die with him. ``I can't think of any other
way to do it,'' he said. ``I don't see how it can be passed on.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be more LeWitts in homes if it weren't for the
price, a shortage of blank walls in most houses and the danger of
people bumping into the finished artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One friend of mine has an early wall drawing, in graphite,''
said Arlene Semel, a Chicago decorator who has installed LeWitts in
several of her clients' houses. ``Whenever she has a party, she
positions a member of the wait staff right in front of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clines chose a room that's not frequented by their 13
grandchildren. But another of Semel's clients recently installed a
LeWitt in an exercise room. The opposite wall has a mirror, Semel
added, ``so the clients get two drawings for the price of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer, Lewitt's agent, said the artist occasionally rejects
residential commissions. ``He wants to make sure his drawings work
with the architecture, that they're not just decoration,'' she
said. That means it's all right to choose a wall drawing because
the colors are appealing, but don't ask LeWitt to change the orange
to blue because it goes with your decor,'' she said. ``And don't
send carpet swatches or paint chips.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt said he tries to be accommodating. ``It's hard to say no
to somebody who really likes the work,'' he said. ``But the space
has to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt has no plans to install a drawing in his own house in
Connecticut. ``It's an old house, and there aren't any big
expansive walls that I could use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the Clines picked a wall drawing they liked from
several catalogs of LeWitts. Over the years, the artist's works
have gone from strictly geometric to far more colorful concoctions.
Lovely helped the Clines select a 1990 drawing, in colors created
from diluted Pelikan-brand inks. To be sure they liked the effect,
the Clines used a slide projector to display a transparency of the
drawing right on their wall. It looked good,'' Cline said. ``We
thought we were buying a nice little square over the fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rhona Hoffman _ a Chicago gallery owner who represents
Lewitt _ had bigger ideas. She arranged to have a scale model of
the room, along with photographs and elevations of the wall, sent
to LeWitt. He in turn adapted the wall drawing to fit the space,
covering not one but two walls with 200 triangles in combinations
of four colors. Soon, installers began painstakingly drawing the
outlines of the mural. Eventually, they began surrounding sections
with tape and applying the colored inks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they did all of one color at a time, you could almost
see it growing as each color came in,'' Cline said. The process
took 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Clines have not received is a certificate of
authenticity. (Their drawing is 639a and 639b _ for the two walls.)
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there may be duplicates, as when a museum asks to
``borrow'' a wall drawing for a show. Hoffman said owners have sold
wall drawings (meaning the diagrams and certificates) at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said she expects to take the artist to see the Clines'
drawing this summer. LeWitt said that he just might decide change
it (meaning the installers would have to come back).
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I work with are great, but they can't read my
mind,'' he said. ``There are some decisions only I can make.''

VALUE OF HONG KONG INTERNET-TELEPHONE DEAL SHRINKS AS SHARES
TUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Shares of Pacific Century CyberWorks swooned
Wednesday, as the Internet start-up company suffered a hangover on
the morning after its audacious takeover bid for Hong Kong's
flagship telephone company was accepted by the company's British
parent, Cable &AMP; Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's stock declined 7.9 percent, to 20.40 Hong Kong
dollars, or $2.63, a share. That had the effect of slicing $3
billion from the value of its $38.1 billion all-stock offer for
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT. Pacific Century's alternative stock-and-cash
offer of $35.9 billion, which analysts said Cable &AMP; Wireless and
other HKT shareholders were more likely to accept, declined in
value by $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's bruising ride on the stock market did not
surprise analysts in Hong Kong, who had expected the company's
shares to tumble as investors digested the mammoth size and
expensive terms of the acquisition. The shares had been suspended
from trading for two sessions while the company battled Singapore
Telecommunications for Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a new-economy company buys an old-economy company, its
stock price adjusts to old-economy values,'' said Marc Faber, the
head of an investment firm in Hong Kong. He said he expected
Pacific Century stock to fall to $1.29 a share within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, however, said Pacific Century's shares would be
bolstered in the short run by being added to two influential stock
indexes: Hong Kong's Hang Seng and a regional index of Morgan
Stanley Capital International.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT's shares plummeted 12 percent, to 22.75
Hong Kong dollars, or $2.93, a share, as the stock adjusted
downward to reflect the value of the Pacific Century offer. Those
shares had also been halted for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the gyrations on the stock market, Pacific
Century's 33-year-old founder, Richard Li, has assumed the mantle
of one of the power players in Asia's Internet future. Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., which had thrown its last-minute support
behind Singapore Telecommunications with a $1 billion investment,
was eager to extend an olive branch to Li on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a relationship for a long time with Richard,'' said
James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's 27-year-old son, who oversees News
Corp.'s Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   James Murdoch had a drink with Li in Hong Kong on Wednesday
night to discuss the future of a pay-television and Internet
venture between Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT and Star TV, which is owned by
News Corp. Because News Corp. had backed Li's foe in the bidding
war, many analysts said they expected the joint venture to end
after Li took control of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century has done little to dispel those expectations. A
senior executive, who insisted on not being identified, said
Tuesday, ``We don't know whether the joint venture is even worth
keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at News Corp., however, said it would be hard to
unravel the venture without substantial financial costs. Murdoch
said, ``I can't imagine a scenario in which Pacific Century would
want to forgo all the content we bring and our expertise in
starting the world's only fully digital service.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   News Corp. does own extensive programming through its Fox
television network, film studio and sports rights. And it has
agreed to set up a similar Internet and interactive television
joint venture with Singapore Telecommunications. But the fact that
one of the mightiest media conglomerates is making overtures to
stay in business with nine-month-old Pacific Century is a testament
to how Li has overnight become a giant on the Asian landscape.
</P>
<P>
   By taking over Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, Pacific Century gets a
network of high-capacity phone lines that passes a million homes in
Hong Kong. HKT has signed up only 90,000 customers for its
interactive TV service. But analysts said Li could strengthen that
with better marketing and improved service.
</P>
<P>
   Before Li can set about building the future, however, he must
close the deal with Cable &AMP; Wireless. His stock may come under more
pressure as investors dissect the balance sheet of the combined
entity. Pacific Century borrowed $13 billion to finance its bid,
meaning the merged company will lumber under a heavy debt load at a
time when its core telephone business is under attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take time for people to absorb the full consequences
of the deal,'' said David Webb, editor of Webb-site.com, an
Internet site for investors. ``Then they will realize they own the
world's most expensive utility stock.'' &QL;

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After visiting Martha Stewart's Web site last week, I would have
liked to talk to Stewart, one Polish-American to another.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to speak with her because as Polish-Americans, we
appear to have a lot in common. Stewart's site certainly makes the
most of her heritage. Her maiden name is Kostyra (that's ko-STY-ra,
according to the highly detailed About Martha page of her site),
and mine is Slatalla (that's sla-TELL-a, according to my dad).
</P>
<P>
   The similarities don't end there. Many of the old-fashioned,
frugal housekeeping techniques she remembers so well from her
childhood are familiar to me, too. Like her mother, my grandmother
saved the uneaten rice from Sunday dinner and fried it brown the
next day. No wonder, then, that Stewart's site sells such
food-saving staples as a set of glass refrigerator boxes to store
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   So I would have liked to speak to Stewart. In the manner of my
rice-frying babka, I would have leaned forward, put my hand on the
sleeve of Stewart's crisply ironed blue work shirt (her tasteful
attire never fails to remind me of the generations my ancestors
spent toiling in the fields of Europe) and whispered, ``Martha,
droga Martha, you grew up in a house where people knew the value of
leftovers. Why are you trying to rip me off?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem I have with www.marthastewart.com has nothing to do
with the selection. Covering all facets of housekeeping from
kitchen storage to soap making, the site sells useful, high-quality
tools to help you in many endeavors, from dispensing aluminum foil
to treating your skin to the exfoliating wonders of crushed apricot
seeds. The inventory of more than 1,500 items includes a mix of
both nonexclusive, brand name products like Pillivuyt French
porcelain and Braun travel clocks and exclusive items like the
pressed-glass bunny dish ($18) Stewart cunningly commissioned after
being inspired by her own collection of early-20th-century
glassware.
</P>
<P>
   No, the problem is this: Many of the nonexclusive products at
Martha-Stewart.com are overpriced. Painfully overpriced. I know
this because I found some of the same items, with little effort,
for sale elsewhere on the Internet at much lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how she would have responded to my criticism,
unfortunately, because Stewart referred my questions to Lauren
Stanich, the executive vice president for consumer marketing at
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.
</P>
<P>
   And since I spoke with Stanich on the phone, I was not able to
clutch at her clothes either, or to hiss, ``Pani mnie
zawstydzasz,'' the Polish phrase I had memorized in the hopes of
persuading Stewart to rethink her pricing strategies. (Of course,
in retrospect, I'm not sure that telling Stewart ``I am ashamed of
you'' would have done the trick anyway. I found the phrase
underlined in my late grandmother's yellowed Polish-English
language guide.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I told Stanich the same things I would have told
Stewart, omitting the Polish curses. Stanich assured me that the
Web site was not trying to rip off anybody. ``Many times if we
don't have the cheapest price, the way we're trying to get around
that is by adding value to the customer, providing things like
instructions,'' Stanich said. For instance, she said, if you are
planning to buy an iron, you can click on a product preview that
instructs you in how to iron a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I already knew about the site's value-added features, having
recently been in the market to buy an iron. In fact, that's how I
discovered the pricing problem in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart may well be, following the death of my grandmother and
the decline of the wringer washer, the nation's best-known expert
on laundry. And when it comes to ironing a shirt, I may take
certain liberties that Stewart would frown on, like not always
ironing the inside of cuffs. You will be able to read a defense of
that technique in my forthcoming book about modern housekeeping,
which I have tentatively titled ``I Rozkosze Maja Swoje Niesmaki,''
loosely translated as ``Even Pleasures Have Their Stings.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to choosing an iron, I was willing to follow
Stewart's advice only so far. The price for a premium iron on the
site was $125, awfully expensive considering that you can purchase
an iron at the local hardware store for as little as $20. Of
course, the site was selling the Cadillac of irons: Rowenta's
1,200-watt professional steam iron with a stainless-steel sole
plate, an auto-off safety feature and a fearsome ability to unleash
a ``powerful burst of steam'' when held either horizontally or
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, I went in search of a more detailed description of
the features of the Rowenta DE-871 at the manufacturer's Web site
and decided _ after reading about its powerful steam production
capabilities _ that I still needed it. But not at $125. A quick Web
search showed me I could save $35 by buying it from the Authorized
Appliance Service Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even better for someone as cheap, er, frugal, as myself, the
site also sold remanufactured models of new irons that had failed
factory inspections and were subsequently repaired, for $59.99; I
bought one of those.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The price difference prompted me to take a closer look at
MarthaStewart.com. I found that the Silpat nonstick baking sheets,
made of rubberized silicon ($24 or $38, depending on size), were
available from BridgeKitchenware.com for $17.95 and $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Gingher scissors. MarthaStewart.com was
selling the dressmaker's shears for $30 and the pinking shears for
$40. But at Allbrands.com, you could buy the same models for $19.98
and $27.98.
</P>
<P>
   Have I mentioned the flashlights? MarthaStewart.com had a
Pelican Pet Tracker light for $18; the same model was selling for
$10.99 at Fogdog.com. The Pelican VersaBrite II Big Beam, $25 at
MarthaStewart.com, costs $11.90 at the MEI Research site.
</P>
<P>
   A Rowenta steam brush, $52 at MarthaStewart.com, was $34 at
Appliances.com. Also, MarthaStewart.com was selling an Atlas
Marcato cookie press for $35; the color was the only difference I
could find between that model and one for $22.99 at InterCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Even a book by Martha Stewart, ``The Best of Martha Stewart
Living: Weddings,'' which costs $50 on the author's site, was
available for a lot less: $35 at both Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   When I pointed all this out to Stanich, she acknowledged that
``we should be doing a better job to match pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that in the catalog world,'' she continued, ``but the
online world is a little more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say. I would expect Stewart, who has been selling things
online since 1997, to be shrewd enough to have figured out that she
should be leveraging the power of her popular brand to offer
products at more reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she seems to be hoping that the site's customers (who
Stanich says tend to be 40-year-old women who own homes, have
children and buy more than one item at once) will think that saving
time is more important than saving money, said Lisa Allen, a senior
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some shoppers for whom convenience is everything,
and even having to make a few more mouse clicks may be a pain in
the neck for someone in a hurry,'' Allen said. But she added,
``That said, if I had bought one of those irons from Martha
Stewart, I would be miffed.''
</P>
<P>
   So I would say to Stewart, ``Kiedy pociag do Milwaukee
odchodzi'' _ no, wait, that means ``When does the train leave for
Milwaukee?''
</P>
<P>
   I meant to use the phrase right below it, ``Z calego serca,''
which means, colloquially speaking, ``I agree with all my heart.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Not all McCain campers happy
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's some squabbling within John McCain's campaign. His
communications director, veteran California strategist Dan Schnur,
reportedly will leave the campaign soon, apparently because of
McCain's initial decision to skip today's Republican debate in
California _ a decision McCain reversed with plans to appear by
satellite. Schnur likely will leave the campaign March 8, according
to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH TO SHOW ON DEBATE STAGE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says there's a ``little spring'' in his step
after his victories in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
Bush also said he's planning to attend today's debate in California
in person, reversing earlier hints he would appear by satellite.
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush will be there in person
``to send the signal we believe California is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ALL-IMPORTANT DELEGATE COLUMN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's primary trifecta in Virginia, North Dakota and
Washington state raised his delegate count to 170. John McCain has
105 and Alan Keyes five. A Republican needs 1,034 delegates to win
the nomination. On the other side, Al Gore has 42 of the necessary
2,170; Bill Bradley has 27.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE A MARATHON RUNNER IN THE BACK OF THE PACK
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers may be hinting that he quit the race, but Bill
Bradley insisted Wednesday that Super Tuesday is just ``the
starting point'' for his campaign. ``Mark Twain put it best when he
said, `Reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated,' '' Bradley
told reporters after speaking to Hispanic voters about health care
in Huntington Beach, Calif. He predicted his showing next Tuesday
would ``surprise some people'' and talked about campaigning for the
next group of primaries March 14.
</P>
<P>
   A READY-FOR-PRIME-TIME PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   Well behind and struggling to keep his campaign alive, Bill
Bradley will have five minutes of prime time on national TV
Wednesday to make a direct appeal to voters five days before the
crucial Super Tuesday primaries. In a taped spot at the end of CBS
News' ``48 Hours,'' Bradley will talk about why he would make the
best president of the four major candidates. It's scheduled for
10:54 p.m. EST and PST, and 9:54 CST and MST. But Bradley will be
competing with ``E.R.'' on NBC, a popular program.
</P>
<P>
   GOTTA BE NOTHING BUT NET FROM 3-POINT LAND
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Bradley turned out to be the ``ugly duckling'' in
Washington state's ``beauty contest'' primary, one of his
best-known supporters gave him slim odds of winning New York's
Democratic primary, and said losing it would cost him the
nomination. ``If he loses New York, he's out,'' former New York
City Mayor Ed Koch told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. Koch said he gives ``odds 5-to-1 against'' Bradley in
the state's primary March 7. Said William Cunningham, a Democratic
strategist and informal Bradley adviser: ``Maybe he just has to
sink a few three-pointers.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD TO THE BIG ONE IN NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has begun to look past a fast-fading Bill Bradley to the
fall campaign, and is expected to take what aides call ``a more
presidential'' approach. Gore's camp believes it has the Super
Tuesday states locked up and must now look ahead to the general
election where the challenge will be to have Americans view him as
more than just President Clinton's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF BIG BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Having blown the bulk of his $70 million war chest, George W.
Bush's campaign is ready to go back on the fund-raising circuit
with hat in hand. Bush aides told ABC News they have at least four
fund-raisers planned for March that are expected to raise several
million dollars. Bush himself is not likely to attend a fund-raiser
before March 14.
</P>
<P>
   GOING WHERE THE RATINGS ARE
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats are duking it out on the debate platform
Wednesday night, the GOP presidential race will lighten up. George
W. Bush and John McCain are taking their acts to competing
late-night shows: Bush on David Letterman; McCain on Jay Leno. Al
Gore tried to loosen up his image with an appearance on Leno's show
Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERMON FROM BOB JONES U.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University in South Carolina had declined to comment
on the hubbub surrounding George W. Bush's visit. But it has
finally responded on its Web site to attacks against it. The
university described John McCain, Al Gore and Bill Bradley as ``the
political `three tenors,' '' who together ``sing the same off-pitch
tune of the liberal left.'' The statement added: ``Isn't it really
a compliment to Bob Jones University that the likes of John McCain,
Al Gore and Bill Bradley seethe and fulminate against us?''
</P>
<P>
   GAYS FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's presidential campaign announced the formation of Gay
and Lesbian Americans for Gore. ``The group will work over the
Internet and in local communities to mobilize volunteers and
organize support for Gore,'' said a campaign press release.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY PATTERN CONTINUES, PART 1
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's victory in Virginia fit a pattern set in the
early primary fights: John McCain wins if non-Republicans swarm to
GOP primaries; the Texan wins if Republicans dominate their
primaries and caucuses. In New Hampshire and Michigan, where
McCain's had two victories over Bush, Democrats and independents
accounted for about half the total vote. In South Carolina and
Virginia, two Southern conservative states won by Bush, two-thirds
of the vote came from self-identified Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY PATTERN CONTINUES, PART 2
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is in position to wrap up the Democratic nomination _ in
practical reality if not in delegate strength _ by the time the
votes are counted next week in contests in 15 states. Bill Bradley,
whose insurgent's campaign soared in November and December, fell
short in Washington state on Tuesday, and Iowa and New Hampshire
before that. He's fallen virtually everywhere in the polls, and
faces the possibility of a coast-to-coast rout next week, unless he
unexpectedly decides to quit sooner.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-FLYING ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   John McCain raised about $10 million in February in a
fund-raising push that helped him gain ground on better-financed
rival George W. Bush. McCain aides said more than 40 percent of
McCain's February money came from donors on the Internet. And
because so many were small contributions, McCain will qualify for
an additional $5 million in federal matching funds. The government
matches the first $250 of each individual contribution for
candidates who agree to limit their spending. Bush, who did not
agree and is free to spend unlimited amounts, has not released his
February numbers. Final February figures are due March 20.
</P>
<P>
   PRO-MCCAIN INDEPENDENTS SHUT OUT IN N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for John McCain, a federal judge refused to allow
voters who are now registered as independents to participate in the
New York state's closed GOP presidential primary. Wendy Van Wie, a
McCain supporter, had asked that the state's 2.2 million
independent voters be allowed to participate in next week's
Democratic and Republican primaries. U.S. District Judge David Hurd
said that Van Wie could have become an enrolled Republican before
the Oct. 12, 1999, deadline if she wanted to participate. But Van
Wie registered as a Republican only after another federal judge
ordered McCain be placed on the ballot statewide Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   POINT AND CLICK GETS JUDICIAL GO-AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge's ruling has cleared the way for Arizona
Democrats to use the Internet to cast ballots in the March 11
presidential primary there. U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt
denied a temporary injunction sought by the Virginia-based Voting
Integrity Project, trying to block what would be the nation's first
binding election for public office using the Internet as well as
traditional paper ballots. The group claims it would discriminate
against minorities and the poor. The Arizona Republican primary was
held Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S APOLOGIES PAYING OFF
</P>
<P>
   John McCain faces an increasingly tough contest Tuesday in New
York because Catholic voters are responding to George W. Bush's
repeated apologies for his appearance at Bob Jones University.
Independent, New York-based pollster John Zogby said another factor
was the tens of thousands of pro-Bush phone calls orchestrated by
Gov. George Pataki and state GOP leaders. Zogby said the 16
percentage point edge that McCain held over Bush among Roman
Catholic voters as recently as last Saturday has been eliminated by
Bush's repeated apologies. Catholics make up about 45 percent of
New York's GOP primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   PAT BUCHANAN'S ON BUSH'S SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential contender Pat Buchanan has come to
George W. Bush's defense, saying he is being unfairly targeted in a
``religious war'' within the Republican Party. ``I have opposed the
Bush family in politics for almost the entire decade of the
1990s,'' Buchanan said. ``Let me say there is not a shred or iota
of bias or bigotry or anti-Catholic bigotry in any member of the
Bush family.'' Buchanan was in St. Louis to court Reform Party
members, but in a meeting with reporters spent most of his time
defending Bush.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA POLLING INDICATES IT'S BUSH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush retains a comfortable lead over John McCain in
California, according to the San Francisco Examiner poll conducted
for the newspaper and KTVU-TV by the Research 2000 polling
organization in Rockville, Md. Bush outpaces McCain 28 percent to
24 percent among all California voters, but his lead mushrooms to
41-30 percent among the Republican voters whose votes alone will
determine convention delegates. The poll has a margin of error of
3.5 percentage points for all voters, and 6 percentage points for
Republicans only because the sample size was smaller.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, JOE D'MAGGIO?
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President
Clinton of making made a sexual advance toward her in 1993, said
she supports John McCain because she needs a hero as her president.
``He has integrity. He's honest,'' she said at a primary night
McCain rally in Richmond, Va. ``You just know you'll always get the
truth from him. I think we need a hero. I do.'' Willey also said
she thinks Al Gore would be as untrustworthy as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLETELY FLUENT? QUE DICES?
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Los Angeles, Al Gore referred briefly to the
fading campaign of his rival, Bill Bradley, saying it is time to
unite. Paying attention to the diverse ethnic populations in
California, he had an interview with Univision, which he was asked
to conduct in Spanish. He declined, but he said he once ``was
completely fluent'' in the language.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO GOING WITH THE FAVORITES
</P>
<P>
   An independent statewide poll in Ohio shows George W. Bush ahead
of John McCain 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of likely
Republican voters was conducted by the Institute for Policy
Research at the University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely
Democratic voters showed Al Gore ahead of Bill Bradley 66 percent
to 22 percent. The poll's margin of error is 5 percentage points.

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using Jarrett's software and checking all 44 of the 30-year
periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical
performance 64 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are
virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we'll probably do better accumulating money than we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, we'll probably do worse in retirement, so spending
needs to be managed with great care. &QL;

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL;

SENDING OUT A SEARCH PARTY FOR THE WESTERN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two movies set in a once-renowned but now rarely visited arena
will open this year. Next month, Miramax will release ``Texas
Rangers,'' starring the television pinups James Van Der Beek and
Ashton Kutcher, among others, as wet-behind-the-ears recruits in
Stetsons and bandoliers who take on a band of renegades.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Shanghai Noon,'' starring Jackie Chan as a
19th-century Chinese man trailing a Chinese princess in the
American West, follows in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Canada, the British director Michael Winterbottom
is shooting a frontier version of Thomas Hardy's novel ``The Mayor
of Casterbridge''; in the film, an Irish immigrant sells his wife
and child for a mine during the California gold rush of 1849 and 18
years later seeks to reclaim his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingdom Come,'' as it is called, is ``not about shootouts,''
Winterbottom said recently, ``but about the emotional connections
between people.''
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine what John Wayne would have said if he'd been
asked to saddle up, by John Ford, say, for a movie based on such a
premise. In the words of Ethan Edwards, the driven, psychotic man
Wayne played in Ford's ``The Searchers'' (1956): ``That'll be the
day.'' (In his finest westerns, including ``The Searchers'' and
1948s ``Red River,'' Wayne played men who are often  &UR; unable  &LR; to
connect emotionally.)
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Western? The question is not unreasonable, given
that Americans born since 1975 _ the biggest moviegoers _ are the
first modern generation for whom Westerns and the cowboy mystique
are not a thread in the weft of their daily lives. The films that
have replaced the Western do not offer the cohesive reflection or
ongoing critique of the American way that it did, even as the most
nostalgic and sentimental of entertainments.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has emerged to replicate the Western's heady blend of
action, excitement, romance and poetry. Of course, try explaining
to a 20-year-old why the moment at the end of ``The Searchers,''
when Ethan turns in a ranch house doorway and saunters off into the
saffron desert behind him, is more tragically and hauntingly
beautiful than Leonardo DiCaprio's icy demise in ``Titanic,'' and
you will be regarded as insane. In the age when Leo is king, John
Wayne is a creature from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that the Western was America's pre-eminent
genre. Its ethos and its codes were bound up with America's sense
of itself as the nation for which no frontier was uncrossable, no
enemy untameable, no mountain too high or forest too dense for
conquest.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Westerns were jingoistic lies, and often worse,
and Ford, the director who is widely considered to be their
greatest proponent, was, at least until the twilight of his career,
the greatest liar of them all.
</P>
<P>
   However fallacious, the Western's blood-stirring representations
of the taming of the West held such recent sway over the public
imagination that, as late as 1995, Wayne and Clint Eastwood, the
actors most indelibly associated with the genre, ranked first and
second in a poll of the country's most popular stars _ and Wayne
had been dead for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   It could be further contended that the winning of best picture
Oscars by ``Dances With Wolves'' (1990) and ``Unforgiven'' (1992)
pointed to the Western's durability after it had supposedly been
laid to rest. More truthfully, these two ideologically opposed
films were signposts on the western's path to Boot Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Western went in and out of favor during the first 70 years
of its existence without relinquishing its status as the populist
national myth, the iconographic representation of the years of
westward expansion between 1865 and 1890 when the Indian resistance
was destroyed and the frontier was closed. It was not simply the
receding of the historical events on which the Western was based
that caused its eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Samuel Peckinpah's ``The Wild Bunch'' allegorically
inscribed the failure of America's anti-Communist mission in
Vietnam, and in so doing proposed a counter-myth to the Western's
myth of righteous progressivism from which the genre has never
recovered. The jungle terrain of Vietnam _ ``Indian country'' in
American soldiers' parlance _ was an uncrossable frontier, the
North Vietnamese Army an unassailable enemy.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Soldier Blue'' and ``Little Big Man'' (both 1970) made
references to the My Lai massacre through their respective
depictions of the U.S. cavalry's slaughter of Cheyenne Indians at
Sand Creek (1864) and Washita (1868), they attacked not only
American intervention in Vietnam but also the Western's ingrained
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Little Big Man'' deconstructed and devalued a big
chunk of Western iconography _ the captivity tale, the saintly
townswoman, the gunfighter, Custer's Last Stand. Richard Slotnick,
author of ``Gunfighter Nation: The Myth of the Frontier in
20th-Century America'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1992), noted
the failure of ``assertively traditional or reactionary Westerns''
like ``Two Mules for Sister Sara'' and ``Ulzana's Raid'' that came
after ``Little Big Man'' and suggested ``the rejection of the
Western had gone beyond antipathy for a particular ideology to
rejection of the very idea that the frontier could provide the
basis of a national public myth.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' supplied another
counter-myth, based on political correctness and historical
inaccuracy, that was fatal for the traditional Western.
</P>
<P>
   A relentless sentimentalization of Plains Indian culture,
Costner's film tapped into the New Age sensibility by turning the
Sioux with whom Costner's cavalry officer bonds into
environmentally conscious peaceniks. That the Sioux were as warlike
as the Pawnee Indians, whom the film vilifies, and rapaciously
wasteful in their slaughter of buffalo, was ignored by this box
office smash, which effectively terminated the racist dynamic of
the old-fashioned ``cowboys and Indians'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   (Released two years later, Michael Mann's ``Last of the
Mohicans,'' with its good and bad woodland Indians and its
unflinching images of their atrocities, was a much more authentic
portrait of the frontier than Costner's rhapsodic apologia.)
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, ``Dances With Wolves'' feminized and disempowered the
Western by bowdlerizing its violent _ that is, masculine and
imperialist _ ideological imperatives. Retrospectively, Eastwood's
``Unforgiven'' (1992) now looks like a reaction to it, just as
``Rio Bravo'' (1959), a championing of the communal macho
professionalism of lawmen, had been a reaction to ``High Noon''
(1952), the screenwriter Carl Foreman's bitter allegory of
McCarthyism in which Gary Cooper's hunted marshal goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Unforgiven'' was probably not intended as an allegory
of America's righteous war against Saddam Hussein in 1991, it may
certainly be construed as a justification of necessary violence,
however elegiacally framed. Eastwood's character, William Munny, a
widowed hog farmer, returns momentarily to his old life as a lethal
gunfighter, purging a corner of Wyoming of the forces of corruption
and cruelty with five quick killings at the picture's climax. So
nostalgic in tone was ``Unforgiven,'' that even in 1992 this seemed
like the Western's ferocious culmination.
</P>
<P>
   Munny, though, is also a single parent and the defender of dumb
horses and victimized prostitutes; in these respects he is not so
distant from Costner's Indian-loving cavalryman. At the end of
``Unforgiven,'' we learn that Munny purportedly took his children
off to San Francisco and became a dry-goods merchant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The domestication of Eastwood's persona _ once the amoral
mercenary of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western ``Dollars'' trilogy
(1964-66) _ canceled the sustaining myth of the Western hero that
had been established in the first half of the 19th century by James
Fenimore Cooper's five ``Leatherstocking Tales,'' including ``The
Last of the Mohicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's Hawkeye, modeled on Daniel Boone, had posited for the
first time in a literary form the archetype of the rugged
individual who furthered the cause of civilization on the frontier
but whose use of violence to combat savagery, usually that of
Indians, condemned him to remain an outsider. This was the classic
situation, and the fate, of such followers of Hawkeye as Alan
Ladd's courtly gunfighter in ``Shane'' (1953) and of Wayne's Ringo
Kid in ``Stagecoach'' (1939), his Ethan Edwards in ``The
Searchers'' and his Tom Doniphon in ``The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance'' (1962).
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Valance,'' Ford's last great Western and his saddest,
was a crisis for the genre that turned on the usurpation of the
primitive man of action's role in taming the West by the man of
words, the Eastern lawyer Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart).
</P>
<P>
   Ford undercut his earlier mythographic representations of the
West by showing how another kind of lie could be perpetuated: the
erroneous belief that it was Stoddard, not Doniphon, who killed the
monstrous Valance (Lee Marvin). The Western could not recover from
that theft anymore than it can recover now from the image of Clint
Eastwood wearing an apron and standing behind a counter.
</P>
<P>
   Our gunfighters have been emasculated, our Indians have been
politically corrected, and we live in an era of a president and
presidential candidates who, unlike Teddy Roosevelt, John F.
Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, naturally avoid _ in the absence of
geopolitical frontiers _ the propagandist rhetoric of
frontiersmanship. The absence of a frontier with a native foe
standing behind it is, of course, a happy absence, whatever that
may signify about such cultural products as films.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it say about the Western's prospects in the 21st
century? Frankly, no art form predicated on racism and imperialist
aggression is tenable these days: The only ``good'' Indian is a
living Indian. Thanks to ``Dances With Wolves,'' the educated
American public will not accept otherwise and nor, therefore, will
the studios.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the codes of the Western will continue to be
remythologized in urban or extraterrestrial settings, as ``The
Searchers'' was in ``Taxi Driver'' (1976) and partly in ``Star
Wars'' (1977), remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Ford's ``Stagecoach,'' John Wayne's outlaw and the
prostitute, played by Claire Trevor, ride off for a future together
that Thomas Mitchell's redeemed drunken doctor hopes will be ``safe
from the blessings of civilization!'' That dream of an agrarian
never-never land was, even for 1939, as featherbrained as the
utopian Indian encampment of ``Dances With Wolves,'' and is as
irrelevant to today's film audience as the genre's aesthetic values
and its imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The Western's West _ the wagon trains encircled by whooping
Indians, the ritual showdown between a sheriff and a gunslinger in
a deserted street, the heaving, smoky saloon with its ``dance hall
girls'' and hurdy-gurdy tunes, the endless vistas of Monument
Valley in Ford's films, the epic topographies of Anthony Mann's _
amounted to a magnificent spectacle. But even the Western addict
knows that for the mass-market moviegoer it has little currency in
the age of ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Western is not yet extinct, surviving, just
about, on television. Bill Pullman recently directed himself as the
title character of TNT's ``The Virginian,'' a faithful adaptation
of the seminal, oft-filmed Western novel by Owen Wister.
</P>
<P>
   Pullman's portrayal of the lean, virile cowboy from the South,
who courteously but ardently woos the schoolmarm and defeats
rustlers, reminds us that there is at least one contemporary actor
with the aura of Gary Cooper, who played the Virginian on screen in
1929.
</P>
<P>
   If the Western finally evaporates for good in the early years of
a new century, historians may point to Jim Jarmusch's ``Dead Man''
(1996) as the genre's distinctly nongeneric epitaph. In this bleak,
sometimes comic parable, which looks nothing like a traditionalist
Western, Johnny Depp plays an Ohio greenhorn called William Blake
who heads West to find that the ``dark satanic mills'' alluded to
in a poem by his namesake have swallowed up the prairie and turned
the new Jerusalem of the West into a capitalist hell.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in the company of an Indian named Nobody, he drifts
into the Nowhere the frontier has become, a locus of madness,
squalor and disease, and dies there alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch's surreal movie gives an impression of a West far more
realistic than that depicted in most Hollywood Westerns. It is the
dystopian West one can read about in recent writings of revisionist
historians of the pioneer era _ and the West that John Wayne and
John Ford never knew or cared to know.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Western at the end of all Westerns, and it may prove
impossible to follow.

<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

   LEWIS-RACE _ ATLANTA _ Lt. Mike Smith is the commander of

football great Ray Lewis. Smith also gave the most damning
testimony at Lewis' bond hearing, calling the football star a liar.
Now Smith is in hot water for allegedly making a racial remark to
two witnesses who know Lewis. The men walked out of the city's
homicide office about three weeks ago after the remark was made and
would not talk to or cooperate with police. Now the incident is
under investigation by the APD's Office of Professional Standards
and the Criminal Investigations Division. Smith confirms he said
something that was taken the wrong way. We have on the record
confirmation about the investigation, as well. (Longa-Sanders,

 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

   HOW HOUSE, SENATE BILLS ON H-1B VISAS DIFFER
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith's House bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the H-1B visas from 115,000 to 160,000 for one year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Double the fee for each visa to $1,000 to fund college
scholarships in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant visas only to companies that are also hiring Americans
and giving raises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require H-1B visa aliens to work full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Orrin Hatch and Spencer Abraham's Senate bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase H-1B visas to 195,000 for each year through fiscal
2002.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempt from the cap any foreigners working for U.S. colleges
or research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempt foreigners who received a master's or doctoral degree
in the last six months from a U.S. college.
</P>
<P>
   _ Retain the $500-per-visa fee to go toward U.S. worker training
programs.

 &HT;    HOUSE BILL WOULD GIVE TECH INDUSTRY FEWER VISAS THAN THEY SEEK

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. companies could hire an additional 45,000
high-skilled foreigners this year under a bill introduced in the
House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than applaud this attempt to relieve labor shortages,
many technology-driven companies will be disappointed. They want
permission to hire far more foreigners for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration
subcommittee, submitted a bill to immediately increase the number
of immigrants allowed under the H-1B visa program, boosting the
visas issued this year from 115,000 to 160,000. ``Our bill seeks to
solve an immediate problem,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal looks meager compared with a technology
industry-backed bill introduced last month in the Senate to boost
high-tech visas by nearly 300,000 over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in the booming technology sector have long said they
need foreign workers to fill vacancies until U.S. colleges can turn
out more graduates with math and computer skills. In response to
industry demands, Congress agreed in 1998 to raise the annual cap
on the H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for both fiscal 1999 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas allow highly skilled workers to come into the United
States for three years. Usually, the visa can be renewed once for
an additional three-year stay. Unless Congress acts, the H-1B visa
cap will fall to 107,500 when fiscal year 2001 begins next Oct. 1.
The next year, the limit will fall back to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies say that such strict limits will hamper
growth. The Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade
group, claims that nearly 269,000 high-tech jobs currently are
going unfilled, and that U.S. businesses are losing $4.5 billion a
year as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said there is no ``credible or objective study
documenting the high-tech labor shortage.'' The National Science
Foundation, which was directed by Congress in 1998 to study
high-tech job needs, isn't expected to complete its work until
October.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's bill was co-sponsored by Reps. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
whose district includes Silicon Valley; Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who
co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Chris Cannon,
R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith's bill falls far short of what industry wants,
technology executives are praising a Senate bill introduced last
month by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   That bill would increase H-1B visas to 195,000 for each year
through fiscal 2002. It also would exempt from the cap any
foreigners who work for U.S. colleges and universities or research
institutions. New exemptions would go to those foreigners who
received a master's or doctorate in the last six months from a U.S.
college.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would retain a provision of the 1998 bill
requiring a $500 per visa fee to go toward scholarships and worker
training programs in this country. In contrast, the Smith bill
would boost the visa fee to $1,000 per foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who has been a leading proponent of
increasing foreign tech workers, introduced his own bill to raise
the visa cap to 200,000 through 2002. But he has since indicated he
will back the Hatch version.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to H-1B visas comes from both the left and right.
Liberal Democrats with close links to labor unions and conservative
Republicans who want to limit immigration are united in their
dislike for an expanded visa program. Critics of the program also
say it is plagued by fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such objections, some sort of visa expansion seems
likely this year for two reasons: the high-tech sector is flush
with cash to support congressional campaigns this election year,
and union leaders are focused on limiting trade with China, leaving
them with relatively little time or energy for the visa issue.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Late winter weather will return to the Northeast as a
slow-moving storm in Maine strengthens and draws chilly air from
Ontario into New England. Periods of snow will accumulate several
inches in northern New York and Vermont with snow showers dusting
the higher terrain of the northern Appalachians. A sharp and colder
wind from the northwest will gust to 35 miles an hour at times from
southern New England to the Middle Atlantic region. While clouds
occupy the interior sections, the North Atlantic coast will turn
brighter.
</P>
<P>
   Drier and somewhat cooler air will move into the Southeast
behind a cold front. An active breeze from the north will combine
with clear skies to produce a cool day in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   A dome of cool, dry air will be centered over the Middle West
promoting sunshine and a milder afternoon in the Great Lakes and
upper Mississippi Valley. Moisture streaming north from the Gulf of
Mexico will bring clouds to much of the Plains. A small, intense
disturbance traversing northwest Texas should bring a swath of
heavy wet snow from southeast Colorado to northwest Kansas.
Meanwhile, a cold rain will dampen the central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few heavy thunderstorms will form over north Texas
and Oklahoma along a warm front. A narrow band of strong to locally
severe storms may grow along a push of dry air in central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will spread back into northern California as a cold
front weakens over the interior West. The Northwest will stay dull
and damp, but the Southwest should be brighter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fine in Fairbanks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks had one of its finest Februarys of record. The mercury
never stayed below zero for an entire day and only two occasions
brought a few flurries. The month ended with a mere trace of snow
for only the second time this century. Temperatures averaged more
than 10 degrees above seasonal levels with the mercury rising to a
record 41 degrees on February 2nd. Sunshine was abundant during the
second month in the central Alaskan city adding to the pleasantness
of mid-winter in the Arctic. Days are rapidly lengthening with
nearly 7 minutes of additional sunlight each day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Extended Forecast &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday: The deep chill of winter will remain well
north of the U.S.-Canada border as the polar jet stream retreats
northward. Across the contiguous states, scattered showers will
accompany low pressure crossing the Southeast while partly cloudy
and mild conditions cover the central states. Gusty breezes will
import cooler air in the Northeast while showers and mountain snow
affect the southern Rockies and Southwest.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday: Warmer air will surge northward into the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on breezes from the south. A
return to milder conditions will also occur in the Northeast.
Formidable low pressure will churn though the Southwest states,
bringing heavy snow to the southern Rockies. Ahead of the low,
potent thunderstorms will erupt over Texas and the southern Plains
as humid air returns from the Gulf of Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

PHOTO SITES COMPETE TO OFFER CHOICES, EVEN PHOTO CAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Andrea Millrad sent a roll of film to Seattle FilmWorks, an
Internet-based processor, she didn't know what to expect, but she
got a bonus that she shared with about 100 friends: an e-mail link
that let her view a virtual photo album of her snapshots online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really excited me to see them on the Internet before they
were in my mailbox,'' she said. ``Then I forwarded the links to 100
of my closest friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Millrad, who sells custom-made cards and invitations on the
Internet from her home in Deerfield Beach, Fla., has incorporated
services like the one from Seattle FilmWorks (which is changing its
name to PhotoWorks _ both names are still on the site, at
www.filmworks.com) into her business. She views clients' photos
online, with the option of ordering prints herself or simply
downloading them into her computer for use later.
</P>
<P>
   There is a land rush of sorts among Web sites that are competing
for the attention of people like Millrad and her clients, friends
and family. Right now there are more than 115 sites set up to
develop film or let people send photos via e-mail to friends and
create virtual albums, or to offer some combination of those
services. By 2002, when photo finishing will be a $3.3 billion
industry worldwide, almost 10 percent of the photo finishing
revenues will come from online services, according to a forecast by
Chuck Davenport, an analyst for Lyra Research, a market research
company.
</P>
<P>
   That means a staggering array is very likely to become even more
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The services available range from developing film and making
prints and digital images to allowing customers to store, share and
edit photos. Some sites can even put your pictures on products like
T-shirts or cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the field of Web-based photo services is relatively new,
the sites and services are constantly changing. To help you sort
through them, here is a sampling of sites, based on the services
they offer.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using a film camera, you may want to start by looking
at sites that process film and post the pictures on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fujifilm.net, for example, lets you deliver film to its partners
like Wal-Mart, and for $4.95 above the price of regular processing,
your photos will be scanned and placed on a Web site
(www.fujifilm.net). Up to 40 exposures can be stored on the site
for 30 days. If you want your photos to be posted longer, $19.99
buys one year of storage for 100 pictures; annual storage for each
additional set of 25 shots is $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   A customer can share digital photos by sending single images by
e-mail or sending links that will take the recipient to a whole
folder of photos. Prints ordered over the Web and mailed to the
customer cost 99 cents for a 4-by-6-inch print. Shipping charges
are $2.95 per item, up to a total of $9.90. Fuji expects to allow
customers to upload and store their own digital images on
fujifilm's Web site around the end of May, which will allow
customers to save valuable storage space on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has joined with Kodak to offer a service called
You've Got Pictures, which will develop AOL members' film and put
the images on line for $5.95 above the price of regular processing.
Kodak says it has 38,000 drop-off locations, or film can be mailed
in. Each AOL member can permanently store 50 pictures online free
and can buy additional storage at $1.49 for each block of 30
images. Low-resolution digital images can be downloaded free, but
downloading a high-resolution version costs $1.
</P>
<P>
   People who are not AOL members can find virtually the same
service on the Web (but free storage for only 30 pictures for 30
days) through Kodak's PhotoNet.com (www.photonet.com). It allows a
customer to upload and store digital images, but imposes the same
$5.95 fee it charges for developing a roll itself.
</P>
<P>
   In general, photo-sharing sites allow you to create a password
that you can send to friends or family so only they can see your
online photos. But look into what the site rules are _ while some
automatically give you privacy, others make your pictures available
to the public unless otherwise instructed. And anyone who can see
one of your pictures can order a copy.
</P>
<P>
   If you own a digital camera or a scanner and do not need photo
developing, try uploading-only sites, like Shutterfly.com
(www.shutterfly.com) and Zing (www.zing.com). These sites, like all
photo sites that offer uploading, say that it is easy to send them
your own digital images. How easy it is may depend on how well
their software works with your particular camera or scanner. The
best way to determine how easy a site is to use is to try it out.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the prints ordered online will rely partly on the
resolution and quality of your camera and partly on the photo
processor. Some customers say that a good digital print looks like
one made from regular film, though others have found inconsistent
results at some sites.

   A low-resolution image can produce a decent 3-by-4-inch print, a
medium-resolution image can be good at 5 by 7, and a
high-resolution image will probably work for sizes up to 8 by 10.
Most of the Web sites will alert you if you have chosen a print
size for a given resolution that will produce a fuzzy or grainy
photo. Almost all the sites offer a money-back guarantee if the
digital prints fail to meet a customer's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Shutterfly is making a bid for users by offering 200 free prints
and free shipping for people who sign up this month and ship within
six months. The service offers free storage, with conditions. If
you do not make printed copies of the photos, Shutterfly will keep
them (up to 50 megabytes' worth) on the site for three years.
Within that period, if you exceed 50 megabytes' worth of images,
you will receive an e-mail message telling you to throw something
out.
</P>
<P>
   If you order a print of an image, that image will remain on the
site for six years, and it will not count toward the 50 megabytes
each customer is allotted. A 4-by-6 print costs 49 cents, a 5 by 7
costs 99 cents, and an 8 by 10 costs $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Zing offers unlimited free storage with no time limit. The site
also lets users do simple editing of images. Pictures can be
rotated, cropped and corrected for brightness or color. Zing says
it will soon add a special-effect option that will make a photo
look like a painting. (Anyone who wants to do extensive photo
editing, however, would do well to purchase a full program, like
those from Adobe or Corel, rather than relying on the bare-bones
versions available at this or other photo sites.)
</P>
<P>
   Prints from Zing are available in five sizes and cost 39 cents
to $9.99 each, depending on size. Volume discounts are available.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites, in addition to Kodak's PhotoNet, aim to
attract photographers of all stripes by both handling film
finishing and letting customers upload images.
</P>
<P>
   PhotoWorks charges $12.25 (plus $1.49 shipping per order) to
develop up to 36 exposures for 3-by-5 prints, post
medium-resolution images online and send you a replacement roll of
film (www.photoworks &QC; .com). The film is mailed to PhotoWorks in
prepaid mailers. The digital images remain in a permanent archive
as long as the customer orders at least one print every six months.
For an additional $4.95, the company will put high-resolution
images on a CD that is mailed to the customer and post them on the
Web as well for free downloading for 15 days. Digital uploading and
storage is free. Prints are 25 cents each for either 3-by-5's or
4-by-6's, and 8-by-10's are $1.95 apiece, plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   PhotoWorks provides uploading software that includes a function
to remove red eye. More advanced editing functions are available
free on downloadable software.
</P>
<P>
   Club Photo, which offers film developing through a company it
recently purchased, Signature Color, charges a variety of prices,
depending on the number of exposures, the size of the prints and
the number of print sets ordered (www.clubphoto.com). Standard
print costs range from $6.95 for 24 3-by-5 prints to $13.95 for 36
5-by-7 prints. Uploading digital images is free, and the company
says that storage space is free, unlimited and permanent at any
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Club Photo lets you view your pictures in an album format, or
you can set up a slide show. It also offers Photo to Go, which lets
you download pictures to a Palm or Handspring personal digital
assistant so you can present a tiny slide show wherever you go.
</P>
<P>
   Ofoto will develop pictures, put them on the Web and return the
negatives to you at no charge (www.ofoto.com). The first 100 4-by-6
prints are also free, but shipping is free for only the first
order. The offer expires Dec. 21, 2000. Prints will then cost 49
cents for a 4 by 6, 99 cents for a 5 by 7 and $2.99 for an 8 by 10.
Uploading digital images is free, and the company says its storage
is unlimited, permanent and free. Ofoto also offers free software,
called Ofoto Now, for editing. It lets users remove red eye and
crop and lighten images.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photo sites offer a cornucopia of goods that can be
emblazoned with images from your photos. Or you can go to pix.com,
which prints your pictures on mundane items like T-shirts or coffee
mugs or puts them on objects like men's ties, watches, dinnerware
and cookies. You can buy 18 cookies with a photo reproduced in
edible icing for $33.95. Or you can buy a cake with photo icing for
$9.95. They may not taste as good as Mom's baked goods, but they
sure look a lot better.

&HT;     HOUSE VOTES TO WIPE OUT EARNINGS LIMIT FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted unanimously Wednesday to repeal the
65-year-old law that docks the retirement checks of Social Security
recipients who continue to work and earn more than $17,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of bipartisanship, the House voted 422 to 0 to
eliminate the Social Security earnings limit, which was enacted
during the Depression to encourage senior citizens to leave the
work force to free up jobs for younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, seniors who continue to work from age 65 to 69 lose
$1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn above
$17,000. About 800,000 seniors in that age bracket now lose some or
all of their benefits because of the earnings limit and that number
is expected to balloon as baby boomers reach the retirement age but
continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings limit does not apply to people 70 and older. The
cap is scheduled to rise to $30,000 by 2002 unless Congress
eliminates it.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the repeal of the earnings limit is strong in the
Senate, which is expected to consider the measure soon. President
Clinton pledged in a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., to sign it into law if it does not become bogged down with
other proposals.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas,
hailed the passage of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of
2000, calling the earnings limit ``a malevolent provision of age
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   As the law stands, a senior earning $26,000 per year would lose
$3,000 in Social Security benefits. Momentum for the change comes
as more Americans work well beyond the retirement age and are being
pressed into work because of a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Horace B. Deets, executive director of the AARP, formerly know
as the American Association of Retired Persons, said older
employees have the skills, expertise and enthusiasm employers
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when labor shortages loom in the horizon and people
are living longer, we should encourage, not penalize, older
workers,'' Deets said.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings limit has long been unpopular, but repeated
attempts to eliminate it have failed because lawmakers balked at
the cost. However, supporters gained new momentum this year because
the federal budget surplus can cover its short-term costs.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the cap is projected to cost $8 billion in 2001 and
nearly $23 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional
Budget Office. But the repeal of the earnings limit would pay for
itself after about 20 years, according to the Social Security
Administration, because people who work past the retirement age
continue to pay into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   During two hours of discussion on the House floor, Texas Rep.
Bill Archer, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said it
was a ``great day for hundreds of thousands of working seniors
across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who introduced legislation to repeal the earnings limit
when he was first sworn in as a congressman in 1971, said the
penalty was ``unfair and backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we want to discourage any worker _ whether 17 or 67
_ from working?'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the law would save as much as $150 million in
administrative costs, congressional supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to keep this resource _ these people who have
built this country _ we can't afford to keep them out,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who heads the Social Security
subcommittee of the House Ways and Means panel, called the earnings
limit ``shameful'' and said it sends a bad message to seniors. He
later told reporters that Wednesday's vote was ``a meaningful step
toward Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said the vote
indicated that Democrats and Republicans can work together to
rebuild the Social Security system and said the legislation would
``keep a generation of skilled workers in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that
threatens our economic growth,'' Gephardt said.

7 DENTAL SCHOOLS STUFF 4 YEARS' WORTH OF BOOKS INTO 1 DVD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting this fall, students at seven dental schools will be
spared the strain of toting heavy textbooks to and from the
library. They won't even need to go to the bookstore to buy a
single textbook, workbook or laboratory manual.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each incoming student will be asked to purchase a DVD
containing the entire curriculum _ textbooks, manuals and lecture
slides _ for all four years of dental school. Each semester,
students will trade the old DVD for an updated version. Creators of
the technology estimate that the DVDs, each weighing less than an
ounce, will replace more than 2 million pages, thousands of images
and more than 400 pounds of books and manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It essentially provides all of the textbooks, all the course
syllabi, all of the handouts and most of the images that faculty
will be using throughout the entire curriculum from the first day
of class,'' said Dr. Fred Moore, associate dean for academic
affairs at the College of Dentistry at New York University, which
is participating in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and electronic publishers have talked for years about
the advantages of creating digital replacements for heavy and often
quickly outdated printed textbooks. But digital textbooks have been
slow to appear, a lag that has been attributed to everything from
technological limitations to publishers' fears of copyright
infringements. Most students still buy printed textbooks, although
many books now come with CD-ROMs that provide supplementary
material.
</P>
<P>
   The dental schools' use of DVDs is a sudden leap forward.
Experts in textbook publishing say it is the first time that
digital content has completely replaced books for all students in a
school. And it is almost surely the first time that an institution
of higher education has attempted to put an entire curriculum _
from handouts to manuals _ in one integrated electronic format for
all four years of a degree program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether students will embrace an entirely digitized
curriculum is an open question. Some digital-textbook experiments
have shown that students facing a lot of reading prefer printed
books, said Gary Shapiro, senior vice president for intellectual
property at Follett, a company that manages college bookstores.
Follett, for example, has conducted focus groups to test students'
reactions to online or CD versions of textbooks. Based on the
company's findings, Shapiro said, ``It is unlikely that a student
will sit in front of a computer and read a textbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is another issue. Because the disks are designed to
include four times as much material as students are typically asked
to buy, the price for DVD's, or for other digital vehicles for
presenting information _ will be anything but cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say that a DVD with updates will cost roughly the
same as the total for the books students are expected to buy now:
$3,000 to $6,000, paid over time. And coordinators of the project
acknowledge that students will have no choice but to buy all the
books they might use in four years, instead of picking and
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wayne Loney, a third-year dental student who tested the
concept, said he thought that students would accept the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're paying for more convenience,'' said Loney, a student at
the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, where
the project originated. ``If I had to leave for the weekend, all I
had to do was just take my Powerbook and fire it up from wherever I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The software's searching capabilities provided an even more
important convenience, Loney said. ``If I was looking for a piece
of information, all I had to do was type it in, and the software
would give me a list of every place that topic came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even images of microscope slides could be found with a simple
search. ``It was like we had a full-blown histology lab at our
fingertips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the integration of four years' worth of laboratory
slides, textbook entries and professors' manuals that provided the
impetus for adopting the DVD model, administrators and professors
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year of school is basic science, and sometimes
students fail to see the relevance of that to what they will need
to know,'' said Pamela Jones, co-director of the project at the
dental school at the University of Buffalo, which announced its
participation two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jones said, once students are able to search across all
four years' worth of educational material, they will see the
connections. A student in an introductory anatomy class, for
example, could search the word ``maxilla'' and discover how an
understanding of the jaw's structure would help in advanced
orthodontics classes.
</P>
<P>
   The other four participants are the dental schools of Boston
University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey,
the University of Florida at Gainesville and the U.S. Navy
Postgraduate Dental School.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project was something of a surprise to observers of the
nascent digital-textbook industry, some of whom expressed
admiration for the dental schools' aggressive approach. ``It's the
kind of experiment that needs to be done,'' said Shapiro, of
Follett. ``It will be fascinating to see how the students react to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said that publishers of dental textbooks might
be better situated than other textbook makers for a transition from
print to digital. Because there are fewer than 10 publishers of
dental textbooks, it may be easier for dental schools and software
makers to agree on how to create digital textbooks, industry
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And the ease of searching digital information may be more
appealing to dental students, who often use their textbooks as
references to be read in short chunks instead of as continuous
text, chapter by chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of dental education also helps, administrators
said. Within a school, dental students take virtually the same
classes, are taught from the same books and are asked to read the
same manuals and handouts. Each dental school will choose the
books, handouts and slides that will appear on the DVD developed
for that school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the curriculum DVD, students will have to buy a
laptop with a DVD player. Most students, administrators say, will
add the cost of the computers and the DVDs to their requests for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the dental schools' strategy in making these purchases
mandatory is to ensure that the computers and disks qualify for
federal education loans, which cover only required materials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To further help with the costs of the laptops, the schools are
talking with computer manufacturers to come up with four-year
leasing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a company called Vital Source Technologies has been
digitizing hundreds of textbooks, manuals and professors' handouts
to be included in the DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Raleigh, N.C., has also been
negotiating with publishers on behalf of universities to license
the books in electronic form. (It will not disclose the publishers'
names until a formal announcement is made on April 1, but
representatives at the universities have said that most major
dental textbook publishers are involved.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's main contribution, however, is its technology. Dr.
Todd Watkins, the founder of Vital Source, has developed software
that will enable students to do several things with the same set of
digitized materials. During an interview in his office this week,
he demonstrated how it worked:
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on a title opens a window showcasing a book's cover. By
clicking on each page, students can turn pages as if they were
reading a printed book. Students will also be able to search for
specific words as they appear in the table of contents of one book,
the full text of one book or the full text of all books and images
that are included on the DVD. They will also be able to create
online bookshelves containing anything they wish to link together,
like chapters from several books that are related to the same
topic.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, who has a degree in dentistry, said his training
brought him much closer to understanding students' needs. He came
up with the idea for a fully searchable electronic curriculum
almost 10 years ago, when he was a new faculty member at the
University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, where he
also conducted research on how information technology could be used
in education.
</P>
<P>
   Health-science textbooks seemed ideal for digitizing, Watkins
said, because they are so expensive to print. Many textbooks, for
example, present diagrams in black-and-white, a process that costs
less than color. But in digital textbooks, color can be used
liberally with no added cost. Watkins said publishers had already
begun sending him color versions of diagrams for the DVDs to
replace the black-and-white diagrams in printed textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Watkins started to test versions of his software with
groups of students at the university. A few years later, he asked
William Chesser, a childhood friend with a background in education
issues, to help him design more substantial trials. Chesser is now
the company's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Kalkwarf, the dean at the Texas dental school, also
got involved, urging Watkins and Chesser to experiment with digital
content in all the courses, instead of focusing on one textbook for
one course. Dr. Kalkwarf soon put together the seven-school
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the universities that are demanding this,'' Watkins
said. ``We were never a technology in search of a market. We are
essentially trying to solve problems with technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of digital textbooks, electronic publishers said, may
also halt a nontechnological trend that has worried many schools:
Students, it turns out, are not always buying the books that
professors assign. Although national data about students'
book-purchasing habits have not been collected recently, some
industry experts estimate that as many as 50 percent of students in
some fields are either buying used editions or none at all. In
dental schools, the trend may be even more pronounced. Vital Source
found that in some classes, only 10 percent of dental students
bought the books a professor listed on a syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Textbooks are so expensive,'' Watkins said; they cost $100 to
$200 on average. ``Students are basically having to decide whether
to buy a book or pay the rent,'' Watkins added. From what he has
seen, he said, students get by with a hodgepodge of materials based
on chapters photocopied from textbooks in the library, paperback
workbooks and handouts from professors.
</P>
<P>
   By asking students to buy a DVD containing all the assigned
books, school administrators say, they are hoping to make the
content more accessible _ even if it means that students have to
pay for more material than some of them expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making sure that we are putting into the hands of our
students all the materials that they are expected to have,'' said
Jones, at Buffalo's dental school. ``This way we are getting around
the problem of students' not buying textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   And publishers are starting to embrace the idea of digital books
for exactly that reason. Their logic goes like this: If the books
are searchable, if they can be updated with a few clicks and an
online connection, and if they can be as weightless as digital
bits, students might actually spend money on them instead of
bypassing the cash register in favor of the photocopy machine.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill, a publisher that is responsible for a few thousand
textbooks, has started packaging CD-ROMs with textbooks to give
students enhanced versions of the printed material. The main point
of the CD-ROMs, which include animation and video, is to ``help
students learn more quickly,'' said Henry Hirschberg, McGraw-Hill's
group president for higher-education, professional and
international publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But the enhancements are also part of the company's strategy to
stay competitive and sell more books. Electronic books, for
example, can be revised much more often and more cheaply than their
printed versions, and professors may be more inclined to encourage
students to buy new CD-based editions instead of relying on used
but still current books.
</P>
<P>
   To make the electronic versions of its textbooks, McGraw-Hill
has hired Versaware, an electronic-book publisher that is working
with nearly 100 traditional publishers to digitize their books. By
the beginning of the next school year, 30 to 50 popular
college-level textbooks will be available on CD or through the Web,
said Julie Greenblatt, Versaware's vice president for business
development.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also creating online spaces where students can
create electronic libraries stocked with books they have bought and
downloaded. (Some examples can be found on Ebookcity.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology absolutely supports'' the kind of integration
the dental schools have adopted, Greenblatt said. Logistics and
politics are now the only barriers to having searchable digital
content available throughout high schools and colleges. For
example, some publishers are still leery of having their content
integrated with materials from competitors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenblatt said those hurdles could be overcome, especially
considering the current drive to embrace distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, she said, nearly 80 percent of universities are
expected to have some kind of online courses. Digital textbooks,
she said, go hand in hand with that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next five years,'' she predicted, ``you will have
pervasive electronic content.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, professors and administrators in the seven dental
schools are eager to see how the DVDs will change the way members
of next year's class absorb and understand what they have been
taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students will be taught more concepts and be given more
strategies to access much broader sources of information,'' said
Moore, of NYU. ``This changes the whole paradigm for learning.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The nanotube is the Hercules of the submicron materials world, for
it is nearly a hundred times as strong as steel. Now, like a  &UR; ' &LR; 90s
update of the manly man, the molecules are turning out to be
sensitive as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two research teams, one at Stanford University and the other at
the University of California at Berkeley, have demonstrated that
nanotubes work well as tiny chemical sensors, sniffing out faint
amounts of gas rapidly at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   This new property may make them highly useful for detecting
oxygen as well as toxic exhaust gases like ammonia and nitrogen
dioxide, implicated in greenhouse warming and acid rain. Because of
the relatively simple structure of nanotubes, it may be possible to
manufacture them as sensing devices very cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotubes are fullerenes, hollow molecules built of carbon atoms
_ like buckyballs, their soccer-ball-shaped chemical cousins. To
make nanotubes, carbon vapor is condensed into sheets of graphite
one atom thick, which spontaneously adopt a form resembling chicken
wire. To form a nanotube, a sheet spontaneously rolls itself into a
long, slender cylinder about a billionth of a meter in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotubes are the great hope of many laboratories not only
because of their strength but also because of their electronic
properties. They may one day be faster, cheaper replacements for
silicon-based integrated circuits because the atoms that make up
the wall of the nanotube can be arranged so the molecules conduct
electricity like a metal or like a semiconductor. There are already
nanotube transistors a fraction of the size of conventional ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of nanotubes as chemical sensors was completely
unexpected, said Alex Zettl, a physics professor at Berkeley who
leads a group that has worked for years on the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory never predicted this,'' Zettl said. ``Gases or
liquids weren't expected to have any effect on these perfect
wires.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Berkeley group put a nanotube in a vacuum chamber
and measured its chemical resistance after exposing it to oxygen,
``the resistance changed in less than a second,'' Zettl said.
</P>
<P>
   The major changes in resistance and conductivity reported by
Zettl's group came about as oxygen was added or removed because the
interaction of the nanotube with the gas molecules led to an
electrical effect that was easily detected in a circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The nanotube's potential as a chemical sensor is so unexpected
that much previous work on the tubes will have to be re-evaluated,
Zettl said. ``The tubes were thought to be insensitive to oxygen,
one of the most common gases of them all,'' he explained, so
laboratories often did not take precautions in keeping the tubes
away from air.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experiments with nanotubes were commonly done on
benchtops, not in enclosures like the ones used by Zettl's group.
``Now we will have to revisit all those old experiments to see if
they reflect intrinsic properties,'' he said. ``Even some of our
data will need to be re-interpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Zettl hopes that a complete report of his group's work will
appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal Science; Philip G.
Collins is the lead author.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, now a postdoctoral researcher in the nanometer science
research division at International Business Machines' Thomas J.
Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said that in
retrospect, it was not surprising that the carbon nanotubes
detected the gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually makes perfect sense that nanotubes should soak up
molecules and be affected,'' he said. Collins compared nanotubes to
a piece of activated charcoal placed in an aquarium to pick up
chlorine from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did oxygen exposure markedly change the resistance of
the nanotubes, Collins said, but it also changed some of the
nanotubes from insulators to conductors and transformed their
semiconducting properties as well. ``The experiments suggest we can
use gases to control the properties of nanotubes on the molecular
scale,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   While Zettl's group investigated the effect of oxygen on
nanotubes, the researchers at Stanford looked at the effects of
nitrogen dioxide and ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   Hongjie Dai, an assistant professor in the Stanford chemistry
department, and his research group demonstrated that nanotubes
could effectively detect those gases: In their experiments, the
flow of electric current in nanotubes increased in response to
nitrogen dioxide and decreased when the tubes were exposed to
ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   Dai's nanotube sensor, described in the Jan. 28 issue of
Science, is a nanotube with metal leads at either end. When exposed
to nitrogen dioxide at a concentration of 20 parts per million, the
conductance of the tube increased thousands of times within 10
seconds. Dai's sensor operates at room temperature; conventional
sensors based on semiconducting metal oxides must operate at very
high temperatures for high sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University has patented the device and is exploring the
possibility of commercial uses, Dai said. The device might be
fabricated very cheaply because of its relatively simple
solid-state structure, making it competitive with larger, more
expensive sensors currently in use.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback of the device, Dai said, is that the changes in
conductivity dissipate slowly. After a nanotube detects a gas, as
many as 12 hours at room temperature must elapse before it can be
used again; the time is shorter if the tube is heated. That could
preclude the use of a nanotube sensor in many applications, said
Charles E. Kolb, president of Aerodyne Research, of Billerica,
Mass., an instrument company that makes sensors that can detect
nitrogen dioxide and ammonia in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of applications of pollutant sensors require relatively
rapid measurements of up to 20 times per second,'' Kolb said.
Aerodyne's sensors, which are laser-based devices, cost as much as
$100,000. Instead of using a solid state sensor, like a nanotube,
to detect gases, Aerodyne's sensors use spectroscopic techniques,
measuring the infrared absorption of the gases, to map the
distribution of pollutants from a distance _ making measurements
from an airplane or a mobile van, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said Dai's devices might one day be useful for measuring
exhaust inside automobile pipes or factory smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are impressive for a solid-state sensor,'' he said.
``They have the potential to be very cheap and easy to fabricate,
if they can figure out how to get the gas out quickly and make
another measurement.''

TRANSLATIONS OF VATICAN APOLOGY ARE RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In preparation for Pope John Paul II's plan to deliver a
sweeping apology this month for the Roman Catholic Church's
historical failings, a Vatican document was released Wednesday
outlining the conditions and limits to the Holy Year act of
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the errors listed in the document are divisions within
Christianity, forced conversions, the use of violence and
anti-Jewish prejudice. However, the document, entitled ``Memory and
Reconciliation: The Church and the Mistakes of the Past,'' also
stresses that many acts of earlier centuries cannot be judged
solely by contemporary moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   It draws a sharp line between sins committed by the church's
``sons and daughters'' and the church itself, which is ``holy and
immaculate.'' Citing past writings by John Paul II and his
predecessors, the document explains that ``the purification of
memory'' that the pope seeks to conduct ``can never mean that (the
church) gives up proclaiming the revealed truth entrusted to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The text of the pope's apology, which he intends to deliver on
March 12, has not yet been finished, Vatican officials said.
Wednesday's preparatory document was to have been officially
released in Italian on Thursday in Rome by Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, who as head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the
Faith is responsible for its drafting. However, technical delays
forced the Vatican to delay its publication until next Tuesday,
while church leaders in France and Germany went ahead and issued
French and German translations Wednesday..
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accident,'' said the Rev. Georges Cottier, a Vatican
theologian whose International Theological Commission helped draft
the document.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who has made repentance one of the key themes of this
Holy Year _ and of his papacy _ has already delivered
groundbreaking apologies for the church's past errors, most notably
expressing regret in 1998 for the failure of many Catholics to help
Jews escape the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   That document, ``We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,'' went
further than any previous Vatican statement but disappointed many
Jewish leaders, who said the Vatican did not go far enough in
acknowledging the responsibility of church officials _ in
particular, the wartime pope, Pius XII, whose failure to publicly
denounce Nazism remains a bitterly contested issue between the
Vatican and many Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's document seems aimed more at reassuring
Catholics and church leaders who fear that the Vatican has gone too
far in apologizing for past sins. The document, which sets out a
theological framework for repentance by the church, notes that some
Catholics expressed ``reservations'' about a process of admitting
responsibility that could seem a concession to ``those who are
hostile'' to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The document sought to put the pope's call for a
``purification'' of the church within its proper theological and
historical context, Cottier said. He said that it would be
``absurd'' to take responsibility for all past mistakes and that
apologies worked best in an ecumenical sphere, where divided
branches of Christianity could seek mutual pardon and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be done with the Muslims, because Islam does not
recognize the Christian notion of pardon,'' Cottier said. ``In
places where Christians and Christian missionaries are in a
minority, it would be taken as a sign of weakness. We couldn't
write it down that way, but that was the thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The document did directly address another Vatican concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must also evaluate the connection between spiritual
benefits and the possible costs of such acts,'' it states, ``taking
into consideration the unwarranted accents that the media can put
on certain aspects of ecclesiastical declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   A little like a Supreme Court brief, the document lays out the
theological precedents for a church apology, with citations ranging
from the Old Testament to pronouncements by recent popes. The
document notes that ``there is no precedent for seeking pardon for
past mistakes by the Magisterium,'' referring to church teachings
that Catholics view as infallible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Paul II is frequently quoted on the need for the church to
``purify'' itself of the sins of its followers and seek renewal.
But the document does not review church history in great detail. In
1998, the Vatican assigned a commission to examine the Inquisition,
but it has not yet published its conclusions. Instead, the document
alludes to forced conversions and the torture and burning of
heretics by noting, ``on various occasions in the past millennium,
dubious methods have been used to obtain just results.'' The
document deplores ``intolerant methods and even violence in the
service of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It also dwells on contemporary Catholic lapses, including
indifference, ``ethical relativism,'' many Catholics' failure to
defend the unborn from ``abortion laws,'' as well as their neglect
of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mentioned a few errors, but we could have had a very
long list,'' said the Rev. Jean Louis Burgues, a French priest who
worked on the document and presented it in Paris on Wednesday. ``I
fear the list will never be finished.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Much of what you see on the Web these days has a price tag
attached. But with a string of new sites devoted to swapping
unwanted items, it is now possible that what you want can be bought
with that old sewing machine in the garage or your lightly
dog-eared Dean Koontz novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody has cash to throw around,'' said Mary Bowman of
Dallas, who traded her duplicate hockey trading cards on Webswap
(www.webswap.com) to a man in Latvia for a handful of collectible
Olympic pins. ``It may be junk to you, but it also might be exactly
what someone else wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of swapping used items like computers and sporting
equipment has existed within newsgroups and bulletin boards on the
Internet for years. But a number of sites, like WebSwap, Swap.com
(www.swap.com) and SwitcHouse (www.switchouse.com) have begun
operating within the last several months with the intention of
making online swapping as attractive as online auctions.
(SwitcHouse was called Swaprat.com until recently.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Swap meets have generally had to be pretty regional or local
to work, but the Internet allows them to take place on a new
scale,'' said Fiona Swerdlow, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At WebSwap, which went into operation last October, curious
swappers can pick from categories like coupons, clothing and video
games. The pages listing each category are organized by Haves, on
one side of the screen, and Wants on the other. Clicking on a
2-year-old computer in the Haves category, for example, will
display a brief description of the item and the approximate dollar
amount that the owner thinks it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what the owner wants in exchange for the computer,
swappers click on the owner's screen name to reveal a list of the
owner's Wants. The swapper can then click the Make an Offer button
and offer something on the owner's Want list or cash.
</P>
<P>
   WebSwap then notifies the owner that an offer has been made, and
it acts as a go-between for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Once an agreement is reached, WebSwap sends each swapper the
other's address via e-mail. The swappers pay for shipping the
items.
</P>
<P>
   But can you really trade a pair of old skis for a Cuisinart? For
now, finding someone who wants what you have and vice versa is
daunting. One WebSwap user, for example, includes a ``98 or newer''
Sea-Doo personal watercraft on his Wants list. But his Haves list
includes his collections of Chevy car parts and baseball caps. Not
exactly even-steven.
</P>
<P>
   People seem to be most comfortable trading similar items. Amanda
Mack of Durham, N.C., swapped an envelope of balloon-flower seeds
for an envelope of marigold seeds with a woman in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
via WebSwap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of chuckling because I didn't think anyone would
want them,'' Mack said. ``But this woman's grandmother had planted
balloon flowers years ago, and she'd been looking all over for
them, so she was very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who logged on to the Internet for the first time last
October, said she was still uncomfortable about online
transactions. ``I can't believe people buy things over the
Internet,'' she said. ``But this was fun, and if she hadn't sent us
the seeds it wouldn't have been the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although WebSwap features high-ticket offerings like vacation
time shares and cars on its site, items that carry less risk if the
swap goes sour, like video games, paperbacks and trading cards,
account for more activity.
</P>
<P>
   Martin DeBono, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors, an Internet
commerce research company, said that low-risk items seemed ``to
appeal to people who wouldn't feel comfortable buying at
auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality is that you wouldn't want to give out cash for
something you're not certain about,'' DeBono continued. ``The risks
are lower, so the appeal is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Swapping sites could become as popular as auction sites, DeBono
said, as people become more comfortable assigning values to their
unwanted items. ``As more people do it, the valuations will become
more robust, and people will have more information going into it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One company, ExchangeAnything.com, is focusing on people who
would prefer to conduct swaps in person rather than sending bulky
items in the mail and waiting for the other end of the bargain to
appear (exchangeanything.com).
</P>
<P>
   When the site opens in mid-March, consumers will be able to
create Haves and Wants lists for larger items, like musical
instruments and strollers, then exchange them in person with people
in their area. Chris Perkett, a spokeswoman for ExchangeAnything,
said the company was talking with fast food companies and mall
owners about providing coupons and other incentives on its site to
encourage people to make swaps at their stores.
</P>
<P>
   SwitcHouse, which began operating under the name Swaprat.com
last July, focuses on music CDs because they are easy to swap and
ship, said Michael Lin, the company's chief executive. The company
is expanding the site to include books, videos and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of addicted to it _ it's my version of day trading,''
said Mannie Rabara of Pleasanton, Calif., who has swapped about 25
CDs on Swaprat.com and who has 15 more in his queue. ``And I'm
definitely buying fewer CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bad swaps are more the exception than the rule. ``So far,
everyone's been really honest,'' said Alison Shelton of Olive
Branch, Miss., who has traded 12 music CDs on Swaprat.com.
``Everything I've gotten has been in very good condition. It's sort
of restored my faith in people.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they state in their user agreements, none of the sites
will accept responsibility if participants do not uphold their end
of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Although Swap.com, a site designed for children, boasts that
``you'll get the goods, guaranteed,'' the fine print says the
company cannot guarantee that anyone will complete a trade.
John-Paul Springer of Spring Hill, Kan., discovered the
no-guarantee policy when he traded a Gameboy for a Furby that would
not talk when it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was in excellent condition,'' Springer said, ``but
we've tried different batteries, and it won't work. We sent him a
note, but we haven't heard from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Swap.com ended up sending Springer a $25 Amazon.com gift
certificate toward the purchase of a new Furby. It said it would
handle problems like these on a case by case basis.
</P>
<P>
   One recourse swappers have if they feel cheated is to give the
other swappers a bad rating. All the sites, except Swap.com, allow
for ratings, similar to the participant ratings at eBay and other
auction sites. Swap.com said it would offer a ratings system in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   None of the swap sites charge a fee for swaps, but that could
change as the market builds. Swap.com said it would start charging
a minimum of 77 cents per swap beginning April 1.  &QL;

swaying to a new beat this election year. Republican candidate Sen.
John McCain welcomes reporters onto his bus with open arms, and his
so-called ``Straight Talk Express'' has produced lots of stories
that show the Arizonan in a positive light. Accesibility, the

Jeb Bush said he himself would speak at Bob Jones University, even
though its published rules would mean he and Mexican-born wife,
Columba, would have been expelled for dating had they met there as

spread their message to groups they might not agree with, and
accused GOP presidential rival Sen. John McCain of stooping to a

and wounded six classmates at Heritage High School in the Atlanta
suburb of Rockdale County last May, will have an opportunity to
enter a plea in Rockdale County Superior Court on April 6. Judge
Sidney Nation informed Solomon's attorneys of the date this week.
At the arraignment, Solomon could plead guilty, not guilty, not
guilty by insanity, or one of a handful of other available pleas.

   SUSAN-SMITH _ Susan Smith's mother says her daughter is so
mentally ill that she has attempted suicide while serving a life
sentence for murder in South Carolina for the ghastly 1994 drowning
of her two young sons in a lake. ''She has mutilated herself,
cutting her arms and wrists with whatever object she could find,''
Linda Russell writes in ''Susan Smith My Daughter,'' scheduled for
publication April 1, the latest book and one of several new media
projects focusing on the case. ''It is still as simple as everybody
still wants to know why,'' said Andrew Yex, a Los Angeles producer
working on a Learning Channel documentary, one of several recently
produced or in the works about the crime that shocked America.
Production crews for MSNBC, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Tampa television station WTSP recently interviewed people around
Union, S.C., who were involved in the case. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 35.

   LEWIS-RACE _ ATLANTA _ Lt. Mike Smith is the commander of
Atlanta's homicide unit. He also is the investigator who arrested
football great Ray Lewis. Smith also gave the most damning
testimony at Lewis' bond hearing, calling the football star a liar.
Now Smith is in hot water for allegedly making a racial remark to
two witnesses who know Lewis. The men walked out of the city's
homicide office about three weeks ago after the remark was made and
would not talk to or cooperate with police. Now the incident is
under investigation by the APD's Office of Professional Standards
and the Criminal Investigations Division. Smith confirms he said
something that was taken the wrong way. We have on the record
confirmation about the investigation, as well. (Longa-Sanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Corn has a special place in Mexico's diets and
souls; it's linked with the birth of the nation's civilization. So
when activists in Veracruz last spring attacked a U.S. cargo ship
carrying gene-altered corn, their protest had resonance throughout
the country. ``We can't risk a resource that has been in Mexico for
9,000 years,'' says Liza Covantes, a member of Greenpeace-Mexico.
 &HT;    Scores of environmental activists unfurled a giant banner
screaming ``Stop Genetic Imperialism'' and then spray-painted the
ship's bow with ``No Bt Maize.'' The protestors were angry that
gene-altered corn created by Swiss multinational Novartis AG was
included among the cargo's 10,000 tons of corn. Bt, or Bacillus
thuringiensis, is a bacterium that is inserted into a plant's
genetic makeup so it develops a toxin to resist insects.
Environmentalists believe it could accelerate the evolution of
resistant insects, harm consumer health and, perhaps most
important, alter corn at its center of origin forever.
 &HT;    For centuries, corn has been a basic food staple and a result of
traditional methods of crossbreeding and conservation. Today there
are some 300 varieties in Mexico and corn is considered by many of
the nation's indigenous peoples to be the sacred 'Madre Maiz.'
``Many major social, religious and agricultural historical events
are equated with the growth cycles of corn,'' says historian
Enrique Florescano.
 &HT;    As a neighbor and major trading partner of the United States,
the world's leading producer of gene-altered crops, Mexico began
exporting and importing transgenic products in 1996. The nation now
commercializes transgenic cotton, soybeans and tomatoes and has
experimental plots of corn, canola, squash, wheat, cantaloupe,
potatoes and alfalfa.
 &HT;    But there had been little public outcry as in Europe until it
became publicly known that transgenic corn comprised 25 percent of
the more than five million tons of U.S. corn imported in 1999.
 &HT;    In defense of government policy, Jorge Larson, an adviser to the
official National Council on Biodiversity, argues that corn imports
pose no threat to local types since they are not planted but
destined for food products and animal feed.
 &HT;    And large farming interests hail transgenic crops as the
solution to Mexico's perennial problem of low yield and high loss
to insects and disease. Jorge Kondo, head of the National Institute
for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research, believes
gene-altered seeds will give Mexican farmers a badly needed
competitive advantage. Most recently, the National Union of Cotton
Producers asked the federal government for permission to exceed the
current 40,000 hectares of transgenic cotton now under cultivation
in Mexico.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, biotechnology has also created new
possibilities for researchers and business. A leading global ``gene
giant'' is Mexican billionaire Alfonso Romo's firm Savia. It began
operation in 1999 after a series of strategic buy-ups aimed at
integrating agro-biotechnology research with seed and fresh produce
firms. Between 1994-1996, Romo invested US$480 million to purchase
two major seed companies, leading to the formation of a subsidiary
company called Seminis.
 &HT;    Despite the economic benefits, the Committee for Protection of
Our Natural and Cultural Heritage, a non-governmental organization,
has filed a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming Bt
corn and other transgenic crops threaten Mexico's cultural and
biological diversity. The lawsuit demands an immediate injunction
against corn imports pending a full public debate and reevaluation
of current policy that permits experimental plots of gene-altered
crops.
 &HT;    Genetically altered corn-farming would force farmers to abandon
their traditions, critics claim. Ana de Ita of the Mexican Center
for Rural Change Studies points out that the sharing and
stockpiling of seeds are customary among Mexican small farmers. If
gene-altered seeds rule the fields, that practice will have to end.
For example, Monsanto Corp. requires U.S. farmers to sign patent
agreements not to save seeds from one harvest to the next.
 &HT;    ``Some say foreign corn is better because the ear is larger, but
what will happen when our corn gives out?'' asked Alicia Blanco
Prieto, a farmer from Mazatlan Villa de Flores, a Mazateca Indian
village located in southern Oaxaca state. ``We can't afford to buy
seeds every year.''
 &HT;    Such fears have caused the National Union of Regional Autonomous
Peasant Organizations to call for a moratorium on commercialization
of all transgenic crops pending an environmental impact study.
Since there are nearly three million small farmers who produce 20
percent of Mexico's commercial corn crop, the union has asked for
public participation in decision-making, information about where
genetically modified crops are planted, and an end to all
experimental Bt corn plots.
 &HT;    The release of any gene-altered plant is a potential threat to
the environment since the seed of a modified living organism has
the capacity to reproduce inadvertently if crossed with native
varieties, ecologists say. They claim this could theoretically
occur at an experimental site or at a small farm owned by migrant
workers returning from the United States with a few test kernels.
 &HT;    Moreover, they cite recent studies at Cornell University that
showed that pollen from Bt corn, when eaten by larvae of Monarch
butterflies, killed nearly half and stunted the rest. Monarchs have
special importance in Mexico, where thousands of tourists flock
each year to Michoacan state's Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve
to see tens of thousands hover on branches in a scenic forest.
 &HT;    ``Since the North American Free Trade Agreement symbol is a
Monarch butterfly, Mexico, the United States and Canada should ban
the release of transgenic products into the environment,'' says
Homero Aridjis, one of Mexico's leading ecologists.
 &HT;    In the meantime, small farmers are meeting to discuss ways to
stave off Bt corn and protect their beloved ``Madre Maiz.''
 &HT;    In Mazatlan Villa de Flores, village leaders recently met to
debate strategy. After several hours, they agreed to continue to
produce traditional corn, grow hybrids on isolated plots, and avoid
transgenic crops for fear of becoming too dependent on foreign seed
companies.
 &HT;    ``If the community loses its corn, its Indian peasants lose
their dignity,'' says Joel Aquino, a Zapotec farmer from the nearby
village of Yalalag. ``Corn is our food and the life of our
culture.''

WOULD BRIDGET JONES   BE EMMA BOVARY?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana,
Angola, Lesotho, Swaziland, Portugal)  By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oddly enough, there can still be romance in being a bookseller,
an embattled yet ennobled calling these days. More accurately,
let's say there can be passion and adventure in trafficking in
books: buying, selling and bartering them, rather like dealing for
salt along the old trade routes. A woman who owns a bookstore in
Cape Town, South Africa, does just that. She bargains in books and
jokingly refers to herself as ``the last of the great salt-trading
people.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the profession of independent booksellers, which is filled
in fact and myth with people who think of themselves as selfless
evangelists, I was struck with one who could be called a true
literary explorer, if not revivalist. She is Henrietta Dax,
proprietor of Clarke's Bookshop. In a pickup truck or car she
wanders southern Africa, the lands south of the Zambezi River, as a
sort of Marco Polo of books. Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana,
Angola, Lesotho, Swaziland and, of course, South Africa. Dax buys
books at each stop with cash or through barter, books that are
indigenous to the land she's in, and then sells them to customers
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Her clientele includes collectors and governments and
universities. ``I have standing orders from a number of American
universities,'' she said. ``Yale says it will buy everything it can
get that is published in Mozambique and Namibia.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually when she leaves on her journey, the space under the
canopy of her pickup truck (or the back of the car, whichever she
happens to be using) is empty. But sometimes she takes a pile of
titles, mostly South African, to use in certain places to barter
for other books. This is particularly true in Mozambique, where the
buyers and sellers most often want books, which are hard to get,
not money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually bring about 50 books to barter in Mozambique,'' she
said, ``because there's so many rules and regulations it's
difficult for them to get the books they want from outside,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dax's odysseys are most often taken alone, although sometimes
she brings an assistant; the trips average 4,000 miles round trip
and last about two weeks. The roads are generally good, she said,
except for potholes, which are a problem. So she drives slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anything happen to me,'' she said. ``The people
along the way are very nice. In Mozambique they are very close to
me, wonderful people.'' She goes on buying trips there twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishing is filled with rituals and lore everywhere, and
there is an abiding tradition of printing books in Africa. When the
missionaries arrived in the 19th century, the first thing they did
was translate the Bible into local languages, a meaningless
exercise without copies to read.
</P>
<P>
   So the second thing they did was set up printing presses. Which
means that there are small presses all over southern Africa, many
that still use type set by the old hot-metal process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree of sophisticated publishing may seem surprising,''
Dax said. ``But there are books produced for near-illiterates, and
then the publishing continues on upwards to academic and literary
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing in Mozambique, where Portuguese is the language, is
especially developed, Dax said, because ``there is a very
sophisticated university press, which could put any university
press to shame by comparison, and all the books are printed on the
premises.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be fairly said that virtually all this publishing,
whether concentrated or seemingly helter-skelter, would be mostly
unavailable and even unknown to the world _ except for travelers _
if it weren't for Dax and the very disciplined roaming she started
when she bought Clarke's Bookshop 18 years ago. (She was born in
England, but she has lived in South Africa for 25 years.) ``Any
university doing any study of Mozambique will have to come to us,''
she said. ``This is where they get the books.''

   ``No one else is doing this, looking for these books and buying
them,'' she continued matter-of-factly. ``In essence I drive up in
a truck and bring back a load of books to Cape Town and sell
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition Dax makes buying trips outside Africa in search of
old South African books, many of which were banned in South Africa
during apartheid. In the United States, for instance, she searches
for South African novels that were published there, she said,
``books that were bound in the '50s and '60s but never seen in
South Africa because they forbidden in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her contractual clients, Dax reaches potential customers
through her Web site: -www.clarkesbooks.co.za. Buyers can browse
there through four catalogs of books from southern Africa on topics
ranging from architecture and art and photography to literature to
books for beginning readers, African equivalants of ``Dick and
Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalogs include books ranging in price from ``Island in
Chains,'' the story of a 10-year imprisonment on Robben Island, as
told by Indres Naidoo to Albie Sachs, for $8, to ``Flora
Herscheliana,'' by B. Warner and J. Rourke, for $500.
</P>
<P>
   The shop has an inventory of about 4,000 titles at any given
time and perhaps 50,000 copies, crammed in every nook and cranny.
On the shelves the books are displayed with their spines out, as in
libraries, to save space.
</P>
<P>
   It's the adventure of being on the road that excites Dax more
than the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the smaller places like Swaziland, in the more difficult
societies, I'm more likely able to find things for some reason,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how distressed the country, each has its own
hand-printed newspapers and its own printing presses, however
primitive, and ink. Book publishing exists, she said, because
``there's some extraordinary human need to put things down in
writing,'' To buy what's written, she might have added.

   UNDATED _ Three years ago, Dallas-based Southwest had a
brainstorm. Anyone who flies the airline knows its staff takes a
comparatively irreverent, fun attitude toward the whole business.
Enter the cheerleaders _ or rather, a savvy effort on Southwest's
part to recruit peppy cheerleaders and their presumably equally
peppy friends and family to work for the airline. By LIZ STEVENS.

call themselves fruit peddlers. We'd say they're symbols of Texas
spirit. Despite a late-life entry into the business, despite a
devastating freeze, despite farming as corporate culture, this

teams should conduct mandatory meetings of Narcotics Anonymous.
It's not just baseball, of course. Football has its Lawrence

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ El maiz tiene un lugar especial en el alma y
la mesa de Mexico: esta estrechamente ligado con el nacimiento de
la civilizacion mexicana. Asi que cuando varios activistas de
Veracruz arremetieron en 1999 contra un barco norteamericano que
transportaba maiz geneticamente modificado, la protesta resono en
todo el pais. ``No podemos arriesgar un recurso que nos acompana
desde hace nueve milenios,'' dice Liza Covantes, miembro de
Greenpeace de Mexico.
 &HT;    Muchos ambientalistas desplegaron un enorme letrero de tela que
decia ``Paren el Imperialismo Genetico'' y pintaron en la proa del
barco ``No al maiz Bt.'' Los manifestantes estaban furiosos porque
el barco transportaba una partida de maiz modificado geneticamente
por la multinacional suiza Novartis AG.
 &HT;    El Bt (Bacillus turingiensis) es una bacteria que se inserta en
los genes del maiz que hace a la planta resistente a los insectos.
Los ambientalistas creen que eso pudiera acelerar la evolucion de
insectos resistentes, afectar la salud de las personas y, quiza mas
importante, modificar de manera definitiva el maiz.
 &HT;    Durante siglos, el maiz ha sido un alimento basico y el
resultado de metodos tradicionales de cruce y conservacion. En
Mexico hay unas 300 variedades y muchos pueblos indigenas
consideran a la planta como la sagrada Madre Maiz. ``Muchos sucesos
sociales, religiosos e historicos se asocian directamente con el
ciclo del maiz,'' afirma el historiador Enrique Florescano.
 &HT;    Mexico comenzo a exportar e importar productos transgenicos en
1996 y ya comercializa algodon, soya y tomate transgenicos, y
cuenta con parcelas experimentales de maiz, canola, trigo, chayote,
melon, papas y alfalfa. En Europa el publico no protesto mucho
hasta que se supo que el maiz transgenico represento el 25 por
ciento de los mas de cinco millones de toneladas del grano
importado de Estados Unidos en 1999.
 &HT;    En defensa de la politica gubernamental, Jorge Larson, asesor de
la Comision Nacional sobre la Biodiversidad, una entidad oficial
mexicana, alega que la importacion de maiz transgenico no amenaza a
las variedades locales porque no se usa para sembrarlo.
 &HT;    Los intereses agricolas alaban las cosechas transgenicas, que
consideran la solucion al perenne problema del bajo rendimiento de
la cosecha mexicana de maiz y las grandes perdidas causadas por
insectos y enfermedades. Jorge Kondo, director del Instituto
Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agricultura y Ganaderia,
opina que las semillas modificadas daran a los granjeros mexicanos
una ventaja competitiva. Hace poco la Union Nacional de Productores
de Algodon pidio autorizacion al gobierno para aumentar la cantidad
de tierra usada para cultivar algodon modificado geneticamente.
 &HT;    No sorprende entonces que la biotecnologia haya creado
oportunidades para los investigadores y las empresas. Una de las
firmas de cultivos transgenicos mas importantes es Savia, del
multimillonario mexicano Alfonso Romo, que comenzo a funcionar en
1999. Entre 1994 y 1996, Romo invirtio US$480 millones en adquirir
dos grandes empresas de semillas, lo que llevo a la creacion de una
filial del ramo llamada Seminis.
 &HT;    A pesar de los beneficios economicos, el Comite por la
Proteccion de Nuestra Herencia Natural y Cultural, una organizacion
no gubernamental, ha presentado una demanda contra el gobierno
mexicano exigiendo una prohibicion inmediata a la importacion de
maiz hasta que se realice un debate publico y se revisen las
politicas que permiten las parcelas experimentales de cosechas
geneticamente modificadas.
 &HT;    Ana de Ita, del Centro de Estudios de Cambios Rurales de Mexico,
senala que los pequenos agricultores mexicanos estan acostumbrados
a compartir las semillas y almacenarlas de una cosecha para otra.
Si comenzaran a usar semillas geneticamente modificadas, esas
practicas tendrian que acabar. Por ejemplo, Monsanto Corp. prohibe
a los granjeros de EU guardar semillas de una cosecha para la
siguiente.
 &HT;    ``Algunos dicen que el maiz extranjero es mejor porque la
mazorca es mas grande, pero que pasara si se acaba nuestro maiz?''
pregunto Alicia Blanco Prieto, agricultora de Mazatlan Villa de
Flores, una aldea indigena mazateca ubicada en el estado de Oaxaca.
``No podemos comprar semillas todos los anos.''
 &HT;    Estos temores han hecho que la Union Nacional de Organizaciones
Campesinas Autonomas solicite una moratoria sobre la
comercializacion de las cosechas transgenicas hasta que se realice
un estudio sobre el impacto ambiental. Como el 20 por ciento de la
cosecha comercial de maiz de Mexico la generan unos tres millones
de pequenos agricultores, su sindicato ha solicitado la
participacion del publico en lo referente a la toma de decisiones,
en informar sobre que tipo de cosechas geneticamente modificadas se
plantan y en poner fin a todas las parcelas experimentales de maiz
Bt.
 &HT;    El uso en los campos de cualquier planta alterada geneticamente
es una amenaza potencial puesto que las semillas pueden cruzarse
con variedades locales, afirman los ecologistas, Esto podria
ocurrir, al menos teoricamente, segun los expertos, en una parcela
experimental o en una granja propiedad de trabajadores migratorios
que regresen de EU con semillas de prueba.
 &HT;    Lo que es mas, los expertos citan estudios recientes de la
Universidad de Cornell en que larvas de mariposas monarca se
alimentaron de polen de maiz Bt: casi la mitad murio y la otra
quedo atolondrada. Las mariposas monarca tienen una importancia
especial en Mexico, donde miles de turistas acuden cada ano al
estado de Michoacan para ver decenas de miles de mariposas de ese
tipo sobrevolar las ramas de los arboles de un bosque espectacular.
 &HT;    ``Como el simbolo del Tratado de Libre Comercio [TLC es una
mariposa monarca, Mexico, Estados Unidos y Canada deben prohibir la
diseminacion de productos transgenicos en el ambiente,'' afirma
Homero Aridjis, uno de los ecologistas mas destacados de Mexico.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los pequenos agricultores se reunen para debatir
las formas apropiadas de proteger su maiz autoctono. En Mazatlan
Villa de Flores, lideres mazatecas se reunieron recientemente para
buscar una estrategia comun. Despues de varias horas de discusion,
acordaron continuar produciendo el maiz tradicional, cultivar
hibridos en parcelas aisladas y evitar los granos transgenicos por
temor a depender demasiado de las companias extranjeras que
producen semillas.
 &HT;    ``Si la comunidad pierde su maiz, los campesinos indigenas
pierden su dignidad,'' dice Joel Aquino, un agricultor zapoteca de
la cercana villa de Yalalag. ``El maiz es nuestro alimento y la
vida de nuestra cultura.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Babbitt grazing reforms merit Supreme Court's OK
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Thursday's Grand Junction Daily
Sentinel)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Seven years after U.S. Secretary of
Interior Bruce Babbitt and the Clinton administration first
proposed to reform grazing practices on public lands, the U.S.
Supreme Court today will hear arguments over whether the Babbitt
reforms are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They should be. The reforms are a measured approach for
regulating grazing on public lands while recognizing the importance
of protecting other values.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Babbitt reforms have already been upheld by the
courts. Only three areas are disputed now. One is whether the U.S.
Department of Interior must recognize those grazing allotments
first approved under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 even though it
no longer allows ranchers to run as many head of livestock as the
original allotments authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Groups opposing Babbitt _ including farm-credit agencies _ argue
that those original allotments must be recognized because ranchers
obtain credit based on the higher allotments. It's tough to see why
private lending practices for ranchers should be a primary
consideration in forging policies of public-lands management.
</P>
<P>
   A more arguable point of dispute is whether ranchers or the
federal government should own any improvements made to a grazing
allotment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Babbitt's plan to allow organizations that
don't raise livestock, such as the Nature Conservancy, to obtain
grazing permits. The ranchers groups maintain that violates the
Taylor Grazing Act.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's first attempt to reform grazing was unquestionably
overreaching. With virtually no input from ranchers or lawmakers,
he proposed significantly raising grazing fees and changing the way
grazing allotments are overseen.
</P>
<P>
   When congressional representatives from Western states
understandably cried ``foul,'' Babbitt back-tracked. With the
assistance of then-Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, he engaged ranchers,
public officials, environmentalists and sportsmen in a series of
roundtable discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Babbitt issued his more carefully crafted reforms. They
included the establishment of revamped resource advisory councils,
which currently advise the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on
grazing and other matters affecting public lands, but no hike in
grazing fees.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the Babbitt reforms, led by the Public Lands
Council, argued that Babbitt overstepped his authority. But a
federal appeals court upheld Babbitt on all but the question of
whether non-ranchers can hold grazing permits.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped the Supreme Court also upholds the reforms.
They represent a fundamentally more balanced approach to
public-lands management, developed with broad public input and a
recognition that grazing must co-exist with other uses of the
lands.

 &HT;    Young singers seek to erase school violence with prayer
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's Saturday, and the kids at the
playground of Lake Worth's Bryant Park are mugging for the video
camera. There's 35 of them, all in black slacks and black shirts,
tossing footballs, playing with Hula Hoops. The oldest is 15 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who call themselves The Next Generation 2000, are
making a music video. Some have come from as far away as Tennessee
for today's filming.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by last year's violent tragedy in Littleton, Colo., the
group has released a locally produced single about ending school
violence and reinstituting prayer in public schools. About half of
the kids attend St. Ann School in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The children are led by Jacksonville resident Marie Drevet, a
voice coach who travels throughout the Southeast providing voice
lessons for kids. Last summer, Drevet began adapting new lyrics to
``A Little Good News,'' a song originally recorded in 1983 by
singer Anne Murray. As she traveled to Florida, Georgia and
Tennessee _ her home state _ Drevet talked to her students about
singing the adaptation. They agreed and eventually organized to fly
to Florida to film the video.
</P>
<P>
   In this new version, the children sing to America's adults,
pleading with them to help stop the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``School violence has gotten totally out of hand,'' Drevet
explains as the camera crew sets up a shot. ``Morality is no longer
taught in school anymore. That's why children have no respect for
each other, much less anyone else.... We believe every child should
be taught prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   This music video of the single is the culmination of work that
began last October, when the group did its first live performance
of the song at a Florida festival. A month later, the children
wanted to record it.
</P>
<P>
   Drevet contacted Rory Bourke, one of the three writers of the
original song.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out what it was about _ taking guns out of
people's hands _ I was behind it 100 percent....,'' says Bourke.
``It was a song that was used for a lot of good when it came out,
and it looked like somebody wanted to use it for some more good. We
were all behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the kids and their parents raised money to
record the song. Afterward, Drevet began pressing CDs at her home
to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   The harmonies are solid. The message, effective. Like children,
the lyrics ask big questions: Don't you think if the teachers would
only let us pray, show our friends a better way, we might save a
life today? ... Doesn't anybody understand what we're going
through? We need someone we can look up to, could that someone be
you?
</P>
<P>
   They're finding answers. Radio stations in Florida and southern
Georgia are playing the single. People _ including Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush _ have written the kids, offering emotional support. Others
are sending money, which will go to the costs of distributing the
video to television stations and school boards, and pressing 2,500
more CDs. They will be released to more radio stations March 15.
Folks who make a contribution will also receive a CD.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are smiling. The word is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that the song goes past Florida surprises me. I'm
really shocked. But I think it will make it,'' says Bianca Clark,
13, from Riviera Beach. ``Hopefully, we can get this message out
across the United States. I hope we can get the song in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Drevet wants that. And she wants to realize the children's dream
of singing the song to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we can raise enough money to do that, too,''
Drevet says, looking at the children as they play. ``Considering
the response from the people who've been hearing it and writing in,
I don't think that goal is unreasonable at all.''

BRITAIN TO ALLOW ONLY 4 ASYLUM APPLICANTS FROM HIJACKED PLANE TO
STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Only four of the dozens of passengers who applied for
political asylum after their plane was hijacked from Afghanistan
last month will definitely be allowed to remain in Britain, the
government said Wednesday night. Twenty-seven others have been
ordered to leave the country with their families, while the status
of the remaining passengers has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about the Afghans, who arrived in Britain on Feb. 6
and spent four uncertain days aboard an Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
at Stansted Airport, has been a monthlong political headache for
the government. In the face of virulent anti-immigrant sentiment
from the political opposition and from a number of newspapers, the
home secretary, Jack Straw, vowed in February to rule on the asylum
requests personally. He would, he told Parliament, seek to ensure
that the Afghans left Britain ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a written statement to Parliament on Wednesday, Straw
made it clear that it had not been a case of simply ejecting
unwanted people from the country. He had been obligated to consider
factors like the troubled domestic situation in Afghanistan, he
said, as well as the individual circumstances of each asylum
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Having done that, Straw explained, he had decided to grant
political asylum to two men ``because I am satisfied that their
applications disclose a well-founded fear of persecution'' as set
out by the 1951 U.N. convention on refugees. The wife of one of the
men is to be given what is called exceptional leave to remain,
which means that her case will be reconsidered in four years; the
couple's child also will be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 27 people he is ordering to leave the country, along
with five dependents, Straw said, ``I am not satisfied that they
have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their race,
religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or
political opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, however, Straw is not forcing the 32 to return to
Afghanistan, where many have said they fear reprisals by the
repressive Taliban military government. Instead, he is trying to
find a third country that will accept them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He is saying that while their specific fears of persecution
are not well-grounded, the way the Taliban regime is at the moment
means that perhaps Afghanistan might not be the best place for
them,'' a spokesman for the home office said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which figures are available, 1,600
Afghans sought asylum in Britain, the spokesman said. Of those, 35
were granted asylum, 1,500 were granted exceptional leave to
remain, and 65 were told to leave the country. Asked why these
Afghans were not given exceptional leave to remain, as would-be
immigrants from Afghanistan usually are, the spokesman said,
``They're not being rewarded for being on that plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw said as much in his statement. ``In these cases,'' he
said, referring to the people he had decided to eject from the
country, ``I have decided that the public interest in deterring
future hijacks for the purposes of claiming asylum is a very strong
one and, therefore, I have decided that they should not be given
permission to stay in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The ejected Afghans will have the right to appeal the decision
when the government decides where to send them, the home office
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   When the jet landed in Britain after being hijacked on a
domestic flight from Kabul, the Afghan capital, it had about 170
people aboard. Of those passengers, 73 returned to Afghanistan on
Feb. 14, and two more have asked to return home. Fourteen people
have been charged with hijacking the plane, and six others and
their dependents, who are seeking asylum and are related to the 14,
have had their decisions postponed until criminal trials are held.
In eight additional cases, Straw said, he needs more information
before he can reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Lord Avebury, a Liberal Democrat, condemned
the government's treatment of the Afghans and said that the
circumstances of their arrival in Britain should have no bearing on
whether they were allowed to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home secretary doesn't have to adjust our asylum policy to
the demands of the gutter tabloids,'' Avebury told the House of
Lords. ``The reception given to these people, and their treatment
since, has been not only inefficient and inhumane, but probably
unlawful.''

ROCKER'S SUSPENSION CUT BACK BY ARBITRATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's arbitrator Wednesday slashed by about two-thirds
Commissioner Bud Selig's suspension of John Rocker, the Atlanta
Braves pitcher who in a magazine interview had disparaged
foreigners, gays and members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means that Rocker can begin spring training
immediately and he was to report Thursday to the Braves' camp in
Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Selig had suspended Rocker for a total of 73 days, all 45 days
of spring training and the first four weeks of the season. But the
arbitrator, Shyam Das, cut in half, to two weeks, the in-season
part of the suspension. And he eliminated the remainder of the
spring training suspension, ending Rocker's exile at 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   Das also virtually eliminated the $20,000 fine that Selig
levied, reducing it to $500, which the Players Association
contended was the most Rocker could be fined under the collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, at first glance, would seem to be a sharp rebuke to
Selig. In a statement, the commissioner said: ``I disagree with the
decision of arbitrator Das. It does not reflect any understanding
of or sensitivity to the importance social responsibility that
baseball, an institution that has endured for more than 100 years,
has to the public. It completely ignores the sensibilities of those
groups of people maligned by Mr. Rocker and disregards the player's
position as a role model for children.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Players Association, which had filed a grievance
challenging the commissioner's action, contended from the start
that the heavy suspension and fine were more for public relations
effect. The penalty was levied, a union lawyer said, ``with an eye
toward the arbitration process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker must still undergo counseling, which Selig ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Das issued no written opinion with his decision, it
apparently was based largely on actions taken by commissioners in
the past. Some baseball officials felt Das' decision at least
upheld the commissioner's right to suspend a player for speech. The
Players Association had argued that the suspension was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time an arbitrator has reduced or
overturned a commissioner's disciplinary action against a player.
Baseball's drug history is filled with similar arbitration
decisions. Steve Howe, LaMarr Hoyt, Pascual Perez, Willie Wilson
and Ferguson Jenkins were among the beneficiaries of those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, for example, was suspended for life in June, 1992,
following another in a series of drug incidents, but the following
November an arbitrator ordered him reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the success of Rocker's appeal was the testimony of Scott
Sanderson, a former major league pitcher. Called as a witness at
the two-day hearing Feb. 10, Sanderson talked about the importance
of major league spring training to a major league pitcher. Selig
had said Rocker could begin participating in extended spring
training and/or with the Braves minor league teams April 3.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sanderson said, among other things, he
testified about the significance of facing in exhibition games the
caliber of hitters a pitcher will see during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a pitcher's out there and you're facing competition you
know you're going to be facing during the season,'' Sanderson said,
``you deal with the aspect of adrenaline kicking in and what
adrenaline will do to cause your body to react in ways it otherwise
wouldn't. You push yourself, your body reacts differently. If you
don't have any of that in the spring, the very first time you're
called on a game and ask your body to react it can't the way you
want it to. And you take a chance on getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator's ruling prompted some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Boazman, an Atlanta city councilman, who testified at
the hearing, issued a statement, saying, ``Hate and bigotry and
homophobia and racism have a place, evidently, and that place is in
major league baseball.''

DIGITAL MEDIA MAY BE EVOLVING INTO ART

<P>
   As entertainment, it has faced its share of criticism: that it
is all technological gimmickry, a useless diversion for people with
nothing better to do than sit for hours in front of a screen.
</P>
<P>
   A movie screen, that is. For that is how some critics described
the fledgling motion picture industry at the turn of the last
century. But by the 1920s, movies were being seriously discussed as
an art form. And the discussion hasn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Are video games, now at the quarter-century mark themselves, at
the same crossroads, between developing into a widely appreciated
art and remaining an amusement for a select group? Henry Jenkins,
director of the comparative media studies program at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would say they are. Jenkins
has spent 15 years studying the cultural and historical
relationships among film, television and, more recently, digital
media. At a recent conference on the future of video games he
organized at MIT, he proposed that the time had come to discuss
video games as an important art form.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins argues that this digital pastime will soon shake off its
label as a diversion for adolescent boys. In 1999, according to the
Interactive Digital Software Association, about 69 percent of PC
gamers and 54 percent of console game users were 18 or older. Women
accounted for 43 percent of PC video game players, a bigger
percentage than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is already recognized in terms of money. It was a
$6.1 billion business last year, up from $5.5 billion the previous
year and almost double what it was in 1995. According to the
software association, the day is not long off when money spent on
video games will be on a par with money spent on movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, domestic box office revenues totaled $7.3 billion,
while video game software sales brought in $6.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Jenkins says, it is time to give Pokemon, Super Smash
Brothers and Spyro the Dragon _ three of the best-selling games of
the last year _ some respect for their aesthetic and cultural
value.
</P>
<P>
   As a media researcher, Jenkins has only to look at his students,
the first generation of adults who grew up playing video games, to
see the influence of Pac-Man and Frogger. Ten years ago, most of
his students wanted to direct films. ``Right now, he said, ``more
of them are interested in being game designers than movie makers.''
They discuss game strategy ``the way a decade ago students were
talking about David Lynch or Peter Greenaway.''
</P>
<P>
   But many things need to happen before video games reach the same
artistic level of movies, Jenkins said. Like video games, many of
the first movies revolved around action _ car chases, pratfalls and
pies in the face. But cinema quickly ``developed a sense of the
richness of its own formula,'' Jenkins said, something the digital
medium is still struggling with. Human emotion, for example, is
still limited in games to expressions like the grunt of the
football player who fumbles or the yelp of joy of a warrior who
captures the enemy flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely play a video game that makes me cry,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Other aesthetic improvements might be easier to achieve. Music,
which is now used as little more than background noise in games,
will be used to provide tension, much as it does in movies. When a
group of Jenkins' students presented a 30-minute montage of video
game clips at the conference, it felt a lot like a movie trailer,
complete with operatic soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the measure of whether video games have come of age is
how deeply they have embedded themselves in our culture. The
students presented game clips that traced the evolution of video
games through games that included Pong and Myst. The clips began
with the plain text ``you are standing in an open field west of a
white house,'' the opening line of the Zork I text adventure game,
circa 1981. The phrase elicited the same nostalgic murmuring from
the audience that the words ``a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away'' would from film enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The grip that video games and their characters have on their
fans mirrors the way movies and their stars mesmerize their
audiences. Just as Clara Bow was proclaimed the first silver screen
star to have ``it,'' or sex appeal, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft is the
``it'' girl of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But where are the German Expressionists of the game world? And
the Charlie Chaplins? And can game creators overcome the inherent
repetition in their work, perhaps through advances in artificial
intelligence?
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins talks about creating a critical vocabulary to discuss
these questions. Right now, the only term he sees in that lexicon
is ``violence,'' a word that was often linked to video games in the
wake of the Columbine High School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the predominant story out there today about this form,
whether or not this game or that game is violent,'' said Jenkins,
one of the few defenders of video games at a hearing on Capitol
Hill last spring. ``There is a huge universe of important questions
that need to be addressed about this medium precisely because of
its economic importance, its cultural importance, its social
importance. If the only articles ever written about cinema were
`all movies are violent,' we would think the critics, the
journalists, had missed something that was vital about the
emergence of that form.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' point is that sociologists might find more to study in
video games than a possible link to aggressive behavior. Geoffrey
Goldstein, a psychology professor at the University of Utrecht in
the Netherlands who has studied video games, said at the conference
that video play was not a sport for loners because even if people
don't play together, they discuss playing with friends. It turns
out to be not just a phenomenon among competitive little boys,
Goldstein said. In a study in which he asked women in a nursing
home to play video games, he soon found them bragging about their
Tetris scores every day over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be the grandmothers who pull gaming into the
circle of social respectability and push newspapers to review games
alongside films and television shows on their culture pages.
Without some helping hand, the games could just as easily go the
way of comic books, which came of age in the 1920s. They are
another popular entertainment, but they have never expanded their
niche market much beyond the backs of adolescent boys' closets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most popular choreographer working today is Paul
Taylor. He needs no guest stars to fill a house, and his wide
appeal to a general theater audience does not run counter to the
seriousness of his enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, Taylor dances are often fun. But those that are fun
are always complex as well. To be accessible and obscure at the
same time takes some doing, and the success of a Taylor work is in
its several layers of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The gala evening that opened the Paul Taylor Dance Company's
two-week season at City Center on Tuesday night included an
unabashed crowd pleaser, Taylor's brilliant essay on the tango
without tango steps, ``Piazzolla Caldera.'' The piece was served up
as a treat for the gala and will not be repeated during the run.
But here, as in the rest of the program (``Company B'' and
``Arabesque,'' which had its New York premiere) there were several
options for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabesque,'' which is one of Taylor's most intriguing pieces
on a formal level, can be appreciated at face value. It is highly
pleasing to the eye and ear, especially in its use of musical
selections from Debussy. The imagery suggests one of Taylor's
musings on the antiquity of his imagination; it has a familiar
ritualized aspect with occasionally archaic postures.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the work's deepest values lie in its
experiments with structure, extraordinary speed and music.
</P>
<P>
   That Taylor is one of modern dance's most musical choreographers
is a given. Never one to follow a beat, he avoids two fashionable
extremes: to ignore the score or to illustrate it.
</P>
<P>
   To play with music is not enough for him. He reveals, rather,
its hidden aspects or translates it into unexpected stage images.
More than anyone else Taylor tells us what many musicians do not
like to hear: that music is transformed by dance.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has heard the turbulent side of Debussy's music here. The
flute solo, ``Syrinx,'' has been used by many choreographers, and
its plaintive poetic sound has a darker subtext for Taylor. The
idea of Syrinx, the nymph changed into a reed to escape Pan's
amorous advances, is a good springboard for Taylor's surprising but
related image of a figure straining for release. Sylvia Nevjinsky,
the witchlike outsider in ``Arabesque,'' gives a solo of
clenched-fist tension a superb dramatic quality. She is a spirit
trapped inside a body that is not hers.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening ensemble, danced to the Scherzo from the String
Quartet in G minor, Nevjinsky puts her hands over Michael
Trusnovec's eyes. Blinded like Oedipus, he gropes his way on stage,
arms held forward. In the fifth section the Scherzo is replayed
with the same ensemble choreography but now it is Trusnovec who
blinds Nevjinsky, who also gropes her way off.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has said that he did not start out with a scenario but
wished to see where the music would take him. He is not the only
choreographer to have form generate content, and one can accept his
claim insofar as the music has colored the dynamics of his usual
idiom.
</P>
<P>
   That coloration is more powerful than moments that recall other
pieces in the Taylor archaic style, like ``Runes'' and ``Images.''
In those works one sacrificial victim replaces another.
``Arabesque,'' whose title refers to one of the musical pieces and
a decorative design, reduces the ritual replacement to two people
and suggests a less universal cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that supposedly does not exist is something of a
weakness. Aside from the reversal between Nevjinsky and her victim,
the blinded blinding the blinder does not really tell us love is
blind. Revenge is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the music led him Taylor has come up with a neatly
packaged work, and its virtues are choreographic. It is unusual
that while the Scherzo is played twice, he does not run the
choreography backward the second time. Taylor likes to create the
equivalent of word games, and you have to look fast to see how
asymmetrical his changing patterns are throughout the ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Tipton's lighting creates a wondrous darkened space for
a royal cast. Santo Loquasto has costumed Heather Berest, Maureen
Mansfield, Annmaria Mazzini and Nevjinsky as little princesses in
gowns and tiaras, fugitives from Martha Graham's Greek pieces. Andy
LeBeau, Ted Thomas, Orion Duckstein and the marvelous Trusnovec are
bare-chested in tattered pedal pushers. Most of the choreography
has a familiar curved-arm look, but its signature is new: an
especially swift series of little leaps. Part skip, part stag leap
with knee bent up and other leg extended, this motor motif expands
into larger jumps that send the dancers flying across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nevjinsky, rotating her shoulders, locks into the fist-down
position that will later begin her solo. The second and third
sections, ``Reverie'' and ``Arabesque No. 2,'' usher in a playful
ensemble. Two dancers follow two more while crawling in a squat.
There is a sensuous tinge in the hip-thrusting silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Syrinx'' Nevjinsky, more intense than we have seen her,
stamps, tumbles, rotates her pelvis and ends in the flexed-wrist,
knee-up pose in front that is a recurring sculptural image.
</P>
<P>
   The company is in fine form and Francie Huber is stronger than
ever as the woman without a man in ``Piazzolla Caldera.'' Richard
Chen See and LeBeau are fine acrobatic drunks while Lisa Viola and
Patrick Corbin remain astounding in their convoluted encounter.
They make difficult partnering look like pure passion.

 &HT;    SENIOR CITIZENS FREEDOM TO WORK ACT PASSES HOUSE
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON and LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior citizens moved a giant step closer Wednesday
to being able to work without losing Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare show of unity for an issue involving change to the
Social Security system, the House voted 422-0 to repeal the Social
Security earnings test for those between 65 and 69. Currently, the
test reduces Social Security retirement benefits for workers in
that age group by $1 for every $3 they make above $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill does not affect people between 62 and 65 who
receive early Social Security benefits and continue to work. They
are penalized $1 for every $2 earned above $10,080.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the bill would take effect retroactively to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This Depression-era provision of the Social Security law was
designed to discourage the elderly from remaining in the work force
at a time of high unemployment. The limit has been gradually
increased and would have been raised to $30,000 by 2002. It does
not apply to those over age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders indicated they would take up the bill soon, and
President Clinton has promised to sign the bill if it is sent to
him without extraneous provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the baby boomers begin to retire, it is more important than
ever that older Americans who are willing and able to work should
not have their Social Security benefits deferred when they do,''
Clinton said in a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the earnings limit may be the only substantive reform
to Social Security this year. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who
introduced the bill with Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, said it was a
matter of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings penalty affects over 800,000 hard-working seniors
each year, seniors who work because they have to, or they want
to,'' Shaw said. ``Regardless of their reasons for working, they
are losing Social Security benefits that they earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said there was no longer a reason for the earnings test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would we want to discourage any American,
whether they're 17 or 67, from working?'' he asked. ``Americans are
living longer now, and older Americans can work, they want to work
and they shouldn't be punished by an outdated law if they choose to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing the elderly hailed the bill's passage as
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   AARP Executive Director Horace Deets called the bill ``good
labor, social and economic policy. At a time when labor shortages
loom on the horizon and people are living longer, we should
encourage, not penalize older workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra L. Butler, president of United Seniors Association,
called the bill ``great news for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The punitive nature of the earnings limit is obvious. By
itself, the earnings limit imposes a 33 percent marginal tax rate
on seniors. In combination with federal income and payroll taxes,
the earnings limit forces seniors to pay higher marginal rates than
millionaires. This is unconscionable,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   After years in which both political parties have preached the
need for Social Security reforms without coming close to agreeing
on a method, the easy repeal of the earnings test represented a
rare consensus. Still, each party accused the other of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson criticized
Vice President Al Gore for not responding to a letter he sent on
Monday urging Gore to endorse the earnings test's elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Gore promised seniors they'd eliminate the Social
Security earnings limit in ... their 1992 book 'Putting People
First,' but it was really a case of 'Putting Promises First,' ``
Nicholson said. He noted that Clinton vetoed a Republican tax-cut
bill last year that included a provision to eliminate the earnings
test.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., released
a statement noting that Democrats have supporting the Clinton
administration's call for repealing the earnings test as part of a
more comprehensive Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said the GOP plan to eliminate the earnings test last
year also would have raided the Social Security trust fund to pay
for a $700 billion 10-year tax cut.

`THE WAITING GAME': THE VERY BEST TIP: GO OUT AND GET A NEW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(js)

<P>
   Self-absorption is the primary characteristic of the
30-somethings who inhabit ``The Waiting Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Ken Liotti, who wrote the screenplay with
Kirk Lavine, plays like an 81-minute sitcom, which means that the
tone is light, the material is overly familiar, the execution is
unsurprising and frequently dependent on shtick, and many of the
characters occupy only one dimension. The cast nevertheless is
appealing, and when good fortune in career or romance eventually
befalls some of the characters, their happiness is the viewer's
reward for tolerating their unremitting egocentricity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those waiting in ``The Waiting Game'' are waiting for
roles as actors, and while they wait, they wait on tables at a
Manhattan restaurant called Peter's Backyard, one of those places
that will seem familiar to anyone who has ever hurried through
dinner on the West Side in the mid-40s to make an 8 o'clock
Broadway curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the aspiring actors at work in the restaurant is the
oft-rejected Lenny (Will Arnett), who likes to quote Jack
Nicholson: ``Everybody gets their shot. You just have to be
ready.'' But his longtime girlfriend, Merris (Debbon Ayer), who has
a career in business, is growing weary of the life he leads. Andi
(Terumi Matthews), one of the waiters, understands Lenny. They can
and do say anything to each other, but they share a rule against
romance with actors: too much career jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Dan (Daniel Riordan), the hunk of ham who looks like a Greek
god, is nearly at the breaking point while waiting for a break and
is bedeviled by one of those diners whose instructive way of
ordering drives him to inner fury. Joe (Dwight Ewell), who is black
and gay, and Derek (Eddie Malavarca), who suffers from impotence
and confusion about his sexual identity, fall into the
one-dimensional category.
</P>
<P>
   While Andi becomes involved with a construction worker whose
sexual fidelity she is hired to test and Lenny and Merris break up
and Dan mounts a squirmingly pretentious one-man show and later
erupts into an Etna-like tantrum at an audition, the movie eyes its
characters and the city around them with affection and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Waiting Game,'' their ordinary lives have become an
ordinary film.

LAWMAKERS QUESTION CLAIM THAT OIL PRICES WILL DROP   SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson withstood a
grilling from lawmakers over high oil prices Wednesday, as
legislators scorned his cautious forecast that oil-exporting
countries would increase production later this month and end a
year-long steep hike in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, testifying before the House International Relations
Committee, rejected calls from lawmakers to quickly draw down
emergency government oil stocks, although he indicated _ as
President Clinton did on Tuesday _ that that option is still ``on
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration is inching closer to dipping into the
600-million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and
Texas for the first time since the Persian Gulf War, but Richardson
cautioned prudence while talks were underway with OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guardedly optimistic that OPEC will increase production
when it meets on March 27,'' Richardson said. He noted that the
Mexican oil minister said Wednesday in Paris that he favored a
production increase. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela are also
considering increases.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, especially those from the Northeast, Midwest and
California, said the agreements to consider production increases
that Richardson brokered on a recent trip to six oil-producing
countries were vague and nonbinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, you came back with nothing,'' said Rep. Donald A.
Manzullo, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if OPEC boosts production at its March meeting,
it will be too late to address soaring home-heating oil prices now.
``We're running out of time,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why has the administration sat idly by?'' asked Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., who heads the committee. Gilman announced that he
would introduce legislation that would bar military aid to any
oil-exporting country involved in price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open the spigot,'' said Rep. Sam Gedjenson of Connecticut, the
ranking Democrat on the panel.

   SOCSEC-EARNINGS (Washington) _ The House voted 422-0 on
Wednesday to allow most Social Security recipients for the first
time to earn as much money as they want without sacrificing any of
their retirement benefit, repealing a Depression-era policy
intended to discourage older people from holding jobs so younger
people would have a chance. The unanimous vote was a rare display
of bipartisanship in the House, and reflected a consensus that the
earnings limits placed on Social Security recipients had long since
become counterproductive. The Senate is expected to take up a
similar measure soon, and President Clinton has said he would sign
the legislation. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   NY-BUSH-PATAKI (New York) _ With George W. Bush's convincing
victories in North Dakota, Washington and Virginia on Tuesday, the
governor of Texas turned yesterday to New York, hoping that the
vote in that state next Tuesday will help him finally nail down a
nomination that has eluded him through a frustrating six weeks of
contests. Bush, though, is not the only governor with a lot riding
on next Tuesday's vote, and that became abundantly clear on
Wednesday as Gov. George Pataki's apparatus lumbered to life,
trying to assure that Pataki does not join the list of Republican
governors who have failed Bush during his difficult political year.

President Al Gore. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   IMF-U.S. (Washington) _ When President Clinton pledged earlier
this week to block a German finance ministry official from assuming
the top post at the International Monetary Fund, in effect vetoing
the man the 15-nation European Union had collectively chosen to for
the job, he seemed to risk a diplomatic confrontation across the
Atlantic. What really happened, Clinton administration officials
and some European diplomats say, is that Clinton agreed to confront
Germany in a way that European countries applauded but were
unwilling to do themselves. By Joseph Kahn
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-REBELS (Dobrosin, Yugoslavia) _ Just across the
boundary line from Kosovo, guarded more visibly now by American
troops in watchtowers, armed Albanians wearing uniforms of a new
branch of the Kosovo Liberation Army are training for a battle the
West doesn't want them to have. Their numbers and leadership are a
mystery, but on this day fewer than 20 men, wearing a mixture of
German and American fatigues, did exercises in a muddy field with
their weapons, including a heavy machine gun on a tripod. On their
arms, they wear a cloth badge of red, black and yellow that looks
exactly like that of the supposedly disbanded and disarmed Kosovo
Liberation Army. The only difference is their name: the Liberation
Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, all towns in Serbia
itself, although their populations are largely ethnic Albanian. By
Steven Erlanger.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Miami woman who has been caring for 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez said Wednesday the boy's father has indicated that
he wants his son to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Marisleyis
Gonzalez said Juan Gonzalez has suggested in several phone
conversations that he does not want the boy sent back to Cuba. She
said the father told her during one call: ``I appreciate everything
you're doing for my son. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell
you? Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleyis Gonzalez, who is Elian's cousin, said she believes
the father was trying to tell her that he wants her to fight to
keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, Juan Gonzalez has publicly said that he wants his son
returned to his homeland. He has appeared with Cuban leader Fidel
Castro appealing for the repatriation of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who was 5 years old at the time, was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat
carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that the
boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, has sued the
INS in federal court in Miami, challenging the agency's decision.
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore plans to hear arguments in
that case next week.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carol Florman said Attorney
General Janet Reno ``continues to believe that this child belongs
with his father who continues to have sole legal authority over the
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the attorney general also ``hopes the case can be
resolved quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress is considering legislation sponsored by Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., that would confer citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Judiciary Committee, the estranged daughter
of Fidel Castro urged the United States not to deport the boy to a
``land dominated by fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot allow this unilateral victory on behalf of a
dictator,'' said Alina Fernandez, an out-of-wedlock daughter who
fled Cuba in 1993 and is one of her father's fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the rights of parents and family ``do not exist''
under Castro's Communist government and that Elian Gonzalez's
family in Cuba is being ``used'' and ``manipulated'' to generate
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
favors Mack's bill, said the dispute over Elian is not just a
``custody matter, but a case where one of the options considered is
returning this child to one of the last prison nations in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the panel's senior Democrat,
said the committee was making a mistake trying to intervene in an
immigration case that is before a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole matter has been politicized from the beginning, and
it's time we let the courts do their job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez did not make the trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to school and trying to lead a normal life,''
Roger Bernstein, the lawyer for the boy's Miami relatives, said in
a statement. ``We want a resolution to this.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the boy's grandmothers came to the United States to
appeal to Congress to allow Gonzalez to be returned to Cuba.

`THE NATURE OF ECONOMIES': SEEING HUMANS AS COGS IN THE WHEEL OF
NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a play on words in the title of Jane Jacobs'
illuminating new book, ``The Nature of Economies,'' that doesn't
become evident until you understand what she's up to in her text.
When you first see the title, you take her to mean that her book is
about the character of economies. Then, as you begin reading, you
realize she means that economies are part of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she sounds this theme immediately when she writes in
her foreword that ``the basic premise'' on which her argument is
constructed ``is that human beings exist wholly within nature as
part of natural order in every respect.'' She continues, ``Readers
unwilling or unable to breach a barrier that they imagine separates
humankind and its works from the rest of nature will be unable to
hear what this book is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   As we will shortly see, those works include economies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, this seems a departure for Jacobs, who is still best
known for her first book, ``The Death and Life of Great American
Cities,'' in which she argued passionately and influentially that
cities, essential to the economic life of societies, must be
allowed to develop freely and spontaneously. In her subsequent
books, among them ``The Economy of Cities,'' ``Cities and the
Wealth of Nations'' and ``Systems of Survival,'' she has worked to
develop a theoretical framework for the practical case made in
``Death and Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Systems of Survival,'' her new book takes the form of
conversation among a small group of fictional intellectuals. Two of
them, Armbruster, a retired publisher, and Kate, an editor at a
science magazine, meet in a coffee shop and express concern that
Armbruster's niece, Hortense, has taken up with another ecologist,
one Hiram Murray IV, her previous one, Ben, having been one of
those people who ``thought everything industrial or technological
was unnatural and that everything unnatural was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's meet this Hiram, says Kate, and so they do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course their meeting is just an excuse for Jacobs to record
their unspontaneous conversation, full of phrases like ``to be
sure'' and ``in sum.'' Hiram turns out to be exploring the field of
biomimicry, or ``trying to develop products and production methods
learned from nature.'' Explaining biomimicry gets him started on
how rooted in nature even human economies are.
</P>
<P>
   Development can be defined as ``differentiation emerging from
generality,'' Hiram explains, citing 19th-century embryologists and
evolutionists. ``Economic development is a version of natural
development,'' not ``a collection of things but rather a process
that yields things.'' (``The Thing Theory,'' he adds, ``supposes
that development is the result of possessing things such as
factories, dams, schools, tractors, whatever _ often bunches of
things subsumed under the category of infrastructure.'')
</P>
<P>
   Systems expand by capturing and using transient energy, Hiram
goes on. ``The more different means a system possesses for
recapturing, using, and passing around energy before its discharge
from the system, the larger are the cumulative consequences of the
energy it receives.''
</P>
<P>
   This principle applies to both ecosystems and economies of human
settlements, which in the book's perspective amount to the same
thing. ``Diverse ensembles expand in a rich environment, which is
created by the diverse use and reuse of received energy.'' Human
cities are such diverse ensembles, and both imports and natural
resources are considered to be received energy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a summary of Hiram's arguments leaves out how
concretely Jacobs illustrates his points, using examples ranging
from biology to technology to commerce. But a discerning eye will
see what Jacobs is driving at, namely that both biomasses and
economies grow most richly when nature is allowed to take its
course.
</P>
<P>
   In short, in ``The Nature of Economies,'' Jacobs has found the
most theoretical possible way to frame the vision she presented so
concretely in ``The Death and Life of Great American Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Her theory works as a weapon, too, with her characters
challenging thinkers like Marx, Adam Smith and even Keynes, and
policies like protectionism and full-employment programs. It also
suggests why Los Angeles added jobs in the 1940s despite declines
in exports and why Detroit lost jobs even as its automotive export
work boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she can't finally clinch her case, because, as
her characters concede, no one has yet bothered to measure the
vitality of cities by the gauges she would prefer economists to
use. Moreover, her conclusion lets you down a bit by debating what
economies are for (``I think economic life is for teaching our
species it has responsibilities to the planet and the rest of
nature,'' remarks Kate), as if something Jacobs has argued at
length is wholly a natural process could be judged to have any
purpose in the first place. Unless of course you believe that
nature itself has some purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her book does leave unusual cause for optimism.
Discussing evolution, her characters point out that all successful
species possess the capacity both to dominate their ecological
niches and to preserve them, as parasites live off their hosts
without killing them. Since humans are both entirely part of nature
and supremely successful as a species, then we can expect to
benefit from this paradox. We may well continue to exploit our
environment and yet somehow use it to survive.

FROM `ELEKTRA' TO ELECTRIC, THRONGS COME OUT IN SYDNEY MARDI GRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This city's summer festival season opened to
the conventional crescendos of grand opera and will close Saturday
with a three-hour gay and lesbian parade.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of performances by Vladimir Ashkenazy, Philip
Glass, the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Royal Court Theater and
30 other mainstream performers, the city's gays have taken over
with a three-week Mardi Gras, a collection of 130 diverse events
including body piercing and concerts by performers in drag.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the city's Anglican and Roman Catholic archbishops
to issue a joint statement last week denouncing the celebration as
``an exercise in gross exhibitionism that promotes a homosexual
lifestyle and does not merit our presence or support.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Mardi Gras, David McLachlan, replied that
he was raised as a Catholic and that for him ``it was sad to see
how out of touch these church leaders are in helping people deal
with their sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   For the mainstream Sydney Festival, which ended Jan. 31, about
130,000 tickets were sold, bringing in $2 million, and a million or
more other spectators attended free concerts and exhibits. A light
show bathed the sail-shaped roof of the Sydney Opera House with
kaleidoscopic colors each night.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, which has a budget of about $3
million, has brought in some $750,000 in theater and party tickets,
and about 250,000 people attended free events, said its general
manager, Mark Goggin.
</P>
<P>
   About 600,000 spectators are expected to line the 2-mile
downtown route to watch the 200 floats and 6,000 costumed
participants in the festival's finale Saturday. Television and
Internet rights to the parade, including live and recorded
coverage, have been sold in Australia, the United States and Europe
for a total of $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is bursting with crowd-attracting festivities this year.
The Summer Olympics, which start here Sept. 15, will have their own
cultural festival.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sydney Festival the Berlin State Opera's high-energy
production of Richard Strauss' ``Elektra'' filled a 2,000-seat
theater at premium prices, said the festival's director, Leo
Schofield. The Netherlands Dance Theater was another box-office
success, and the London production of ``The Weir'' by the Irish
writer Conor McPherson was sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Three local plays gave the festival some Australian flavor. In
``Small Poppies'' Geoffrey Rush depicted a 5-year-old's first day
at school. Six untitled sketches presented by Daniel Keene and
Arielle Taylor recalled the Beckett style, with bleak urban tales
played in half-light. ``The Sunshine Club'' was a feel-good musical
about interracial dating and dancing in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said Sydney's January season of music and drama, which
he has directed for three years, was similar in some ways to the
Lincoln Center Festival. An added attraction is this city's 25-year
tradition of free evening concerts in the Domain, a 100-acre
downtown park ringed with giant fig trees. About 80,000 people
turned out with hampers and wine for an 11-group night of jazz; a
Sydney Symphony Orchestra program of undemanding favorites,
including the ``Tannhauser'' and ``1812'' Overtures, attracted
about 140,000 under a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the major event of the Sydney Festival was an exhibition
of 242 drawings of the human figure, ``Michelangelo to Matisse,''
which was held over through Tuesday so more people could view it.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Mardi Gras has evolved from a kind of civil rights
march to an Australian institution that bills itself as the world's
largest gay carnival. This year's program emphasizes spectacle and
sponsors more than it does slogans, although social concerns
underlie the frills and frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mardi Gras, including the Council of Churches, oppose
the increasing involvement of public institutions like Sydney's
main museum. The museum has organized an exhibition of body art
that is considered the festival's most controversial event.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists regard the criticism as a remnant of intolerance.
Tony Knight, a longtime Mardi Gras participant who supervises the
acting program at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, said:
``Mardi Gras has become an institution, but it remains a political
statement. Rights have been won, but there is no cause for
complacency. Prejudice still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The glossy 140-page Mardi Gras catalog, paid for by sponsors in
the travel, media and liquor businesses, lists camp comedy,
feminist concerts, ``queer culture, soft-porn exhibitionism, artful
bad taste,'' social satire, sidewalk painting and plays with
messages from the gay world's frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 Americans visiting Sydney for the festival will see
some familiar acts, among them New Yorkers like Lypsinka, the drag
diva, and Patty Chang, a performance artist, as well as Randall
Wong, a male soprano from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   All this, taken in laconic stride, seems remote from the Sydney
of 1978, when homosexuality was illegal here (with penalties
ranging to 14 years in prison). Demanding changes in the law, about
1,000 gay Sydney men staged a a street demonstration that year.
Police officers arrested 53 of the marchers, but the courts
dismissed the charges. The protest developed into an annual rally
in a campaign that led to decriminalization of homosexuality in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, a multilingual melting pot of immigrant cultures, is now
considered a notably tolerant city. ``Inclusivity through
diversity'' is the buzz phrase here and the theme chosen this year
by the Mardi Gras artistic director, Jonathan Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, acceptance of Mardi Gras is far from unanimous.
Australia's prime minister, John Howard, declined to issue a
message of support for the celebration. But Sydney politicians
praise the carnival for contributing to acceptance and harmony, not
to mention generating about $60 million for the city's economy this
year.

   Several new audio players have the look and feel of anything but
digital technology. The recently released Rome, for example,
resembles a cassette tape, a pleasant retro shape for those MP3
users old enough to remember cassette tapes. The new Sony VAIO
Music Clip has the weight and dimensions of a pen you might have
received as a high school graduation gift.
</P>
<P>
   The novel shape of the Music Clip makes it ideal to carry
around, whether in a shirt pocket or dangling like a pendant around
your neck. The player also has 64 megabytes of flash memory and a
USB port for quick downloading. At $299, it's an expensive way to
listen to music, but the price is not out of line with other 64MB
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Clip does sacrifice some function for form. A small
LCD tells only the track number and has limited playback and EQ
options. Technically, the Music Clip isn't even an MP3 player _
Sony calls it a ``Personal Network Player'' _ although it can play
MP3 files once they have been converted to the ANTRAC3 compression
format with the help of the accompanying software. The company,
which also owns a lot of the music it wants you to listen to,
promises that the VAIO will be able to play other downloadable
music files in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the Music Clip succeeds, we can expect digital devices in
other retro clothing. How long before MP3 players begin to look
like transistor radios, player pianos or even an old-fashioned home
entertainment center, complete with teakwood cabinet and, for a few
dollars more, a fully compatible Barcalounger?

   A Boardroom Shares Its Art on the Net
</P>
<P>
   While members of the public rely on museums and galleries for
access to the work of famous artists, some privileged executives
can simply view artwork on display in their boardrooms. Starting
this month, however, a series of drawings and sketches hanging on
the walls of the boardroom of Corning Inc. will also be on display
on the Internet. A free video tour of works by Salvador Dali, Jean
Cocteau, Georgia O'Keefe, Henri Matisse and others is playing for a
limited time on arthistorytv.com, with commentary provided by
Michel Whitmer, a New York art dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing by O'Keefe, for example, is considered rare because
O'Keefe usually did not do preliminary drawings before painting.
She created the drawing so it could be engraved on a piece of glass
that was sold by Steuben, a division of Corning, in the 1940s.
``It's a wonderful treasure trove of drawings that is not open to
the public,'' Whitmer says at the end of the video.
</P>
<P>
   Survey Shows Americans Love Their Computers and the Net
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert may be right about the frustrations of the American
workplace, but when it comes to his take on the evils of computer
technology, he appears to be surprisingly out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what can be concluded based on a survey
released this week. Americans _ especially working Americans _ are
having what National Public Radio calls a ``love affair'' with
computers and the Internet. About 87 percent of adults under 60
said that computers were making life better for Americans, and more
than 80 percent of all adults surveyed did not expect that it would
eliminate their jobs. Nearly two-thirds of respondents selected the
computer as either the most or the second-most-significant
technological innovation of the last 100 years, well ahead of the
automobile, television and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   NPR sponsored the survey with the Kaiser Family Foundation and
the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The results, which are
posted at www.npr.org, are based on telephone interviews conducted
in November and December with more than 1,500 adults and 600
children, ages 10 to 17. Among children, 91 percent said that
computers were making life better for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The study also offered a few glances into how other technologies
are seeping into our lives. As many as 89 percent of Americans
under 60, it reported, have used a cellular phone. And when asked
which was more trustworthy, e-mail or the U.S. mail, a slim
majority of children picked e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One finding could have unintended repercussions, either raising
questions about the study's accuracy or putting an end to a tired
joke. More than 80 percent of adults (and 87 percent of those under
60) said that they had done what some would call an impossible
feat: program a VCR.

   Extensive Genealogy Package With a Focus on Ellis Island
</P>
<P>
   With all the major home genealogy programs providing users with
baskets of historical records on multiple CD-ROMs, it seems the
only thing missing in the box these days is Ellis Island itself.
Sierra Home's Generations Family Tree Millennium Collection fills
that particular bill with an extensive collection of data from the
Ellis Island station, including immigrant records, census images
and ship's passenger lists. The company says the package is ``the
first compendium of Ellis Island information available to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics from the Department of the Interior, 40
percent of Americans can trace an ancestor back to Ellis Island,
making it almost a virtual ground zero of U.S. immigration.
</P>
<P>
   To help educate users on the topic, the Millennium Collection
package includes an hourlong video called ``Remembering Ellis
Island, Everyman's Monument,'' with Telly Savalas as host, and a
multimedia virtual tour of the Ellis Island experience.
</P>
<P>
   The package contains a book, ``American Naturalization Records
1790-1990,'' and a search engine programmed for hunting down
genealogy information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program contains a total of 21 CD-ROMs, including Civil War
muster rolls, the Social Security Index and landowner records.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Collection, which offers access to a total of
three billion names, runs on Windows 95 or 98 and is expected to
cost $69.95. The program can be ordered online at
www.sierrahome.com or by telephone at (800) 757-7707, or purchased
in software stores.
</P>
<P>
   The software lets users create their own family trees with
drag-and-drop editing and compile an index of relatives. An
image-editing program for touching up scanned copies of old family
photographs is provided. Also included _ for those who may have had
a relative on that big boat _ is the passenger list from the
Titanic.

   TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of online travel arrangements has more than
doubled in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of 811 executives by the research firm
Greenfield On-line, 24 percent made hotel reservations online, up
from 9 percent six months ago. Airline bookings online went to 28
percent from 13 percent, and online car rentals were up to 19
percent from 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   FAST AND FASTER
</P>
<P>
   Fast food just got a little faster. Five McDonald's restaurants
in Southern California will now allow motorists with E-ZPass-type
transponders to order and pick up their Big Macs without stopping
to pay.  &QL;

THE DOUBLECLICK DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is an extraordinary tool for two-way communication.
Companies that wish to sell or exchange a user's personal
information ought to take advantage of this capability to get prior
approval from the person involved.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gained in importance since the DoubleClick company
purchased the databases of Abacus Direct, which has the ability to
access 2 billion catalog-sales transactions. DoubleClick planned to
combine this with its own proprietary information, gained from
``cookies'' embedded in computers during visits to Web sites. The
result would be detailed consumer profiles that would be valuable
to Internet advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Abacus database comes with millions of names attached.
Privacy advocates believe with good reason that, combined with the
DoubleClick data, companies would get a powerful tool to discover a
person's buying habits and any other information that could be
gleaned from their visits to Web sites. The Federal Trade
Commission is concerned enough to begin an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the advocates are right to worry. While DoubleClick
has yet to deploy its vast resources, the potential for abuse is
great. People with cancer might not want their insurance companies
or employers to know they have visited Web sites that discuss
treatment options. That is an extreme case, but even more routine
uses are troubling.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick spokeswoman Jennifer Blum says the company is trying
to make it easy for users to opt out. But the process it currently
uses encourages computer users to read a 730-word legal notice,
then switch to DoubleClick's own Web site, where they must scan a
294-word explanation of cookies before they can hit the opt-out
command. They ought to be able to do this with one click.
</P>
<P>
   Blum also says that DoubleClick will not include any information
on a person's health, finances, or anything of a sexual nature in
its advertising profiles. That's all to the good, but DoubleClick's
competitors, not in the spotlight, may not be as scrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   Blum also compares the collation of Internet data with the sale
of magazine subscription files to mail-order companies. But
direct-mail campaigns are a blunderbuss approach to advertising
compared to the finely honed approaches offered by Internet data
profiles. And consumer interaction with direct-mail solicitors is
far harder than the instant responses to DoubleClick and its
competitors over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   People throughout the Internet industry are concerned about the
privacy problem. The World Wide Web Consortium, which has an office
at MIT, is devising a compromise solution. Under this plan, people
would get a questionnaire in which they could specify the level of
Web privacy they prefer. Sites would automatically adjust their
information-gathering to an individual's level of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is not yet finalized, but in its latest version, people
would get this questionnaire only when they get a new Internet
Explorer or Netscape Navigator browser or upgrade the browser
program. This would leave millions of people, who are happy with
their existing browser, in privacy limbo.
</P>
<P>
   People who use the Internet deserve more comprehensive
protections. DoubleClick and other companies need only apply
technology widely available on the seamier side of the Web.
Whenever someone visits a pornographic site, he or she is
confronted with a prominent message warning that this is only for
viewers age 18 and over and that users should click a box to
certify that they qualify. Similar messages on less lurid sites can
offer people a choice of whether they will receive e-mail
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies are useful files that allow easy shopping on the World
Wide Web. Amazon.com and other companies who use them to get to
know their customers better should not have to change their
policies. But when companies seek to consolidate cookie-based
information and sell the results, Web users need to be forewarned
and armed with an easily used tool that allows them to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and
other members of Congress have filed legislation that will force
companies to adopt these protections. Rather than be compelled by
Congress, these businesses would be wise to settle on an
uncomplicated means to let people choose whether they want
information about themselves used for commercial gain.

   HANOI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is only one wing left of the stucco-walled and red-roofed
jail that the French called the Maison Centrale when they built it
104 years ago. The rest _ like so much else in Hanoi _ has been
torn down to make room for the new. Rising behind this remnant of
things past stands a new high-rise office complex called Hanoi
Towers.
</P>
<P>
   There are no prisoners now in what is left of the jail.
Vietnamese called it the Hai Lo Prison, but the American pilots who
did time here during the Vietnam war called it the Hanoi Hilton.
For the Vietnamese this is a shrine to revolutionaries whom the
French imprisoned and sometimes guillotined. ``Kept in prison cells
with chain, bare-handed patriots and revolutionaries yet fought
against Draconian custody regime, harsh living, and savage
suppression by the French colony,'' a brochure informs visitors.
Only in passing is it mentioned that from Aug. 5, 1964, until March
31, 1973, American prisoners of war were held here, mistreated and
tortured by their Vietnamese captors _ the same ``harsh living and
savage suppression.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of John McCain, who was imprisoned here for
five years, but on the shore of a lake into which he fell there is
a plaque commemorating his capture.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable is not so much McCain's undoubted courage in
the face of such adversity _ he refused early release that he could
have obtained _ but his lack of bitterness and his generosity
toward the Vietnamese people. He was a leader in establishing
diplomatic relations between Vietnam and the United States after
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to Hanoi, Pete Peterson, who did 6 1/2
years in the Hanoi Hilton, likes to tell visitors that he ``cannot
do anything about what happened yesterday, but I have an obligation
to do something constructive tomorrow and in the next hour.'' For
Peterson, too, there is no time and no room for bitter memories.
The past is the little that is left of the jail, now a museum. The
future, albeit an architectural disaster, is a new Hanoi Hilton
which actually is a hotel, with tourists and businessmen for whom
this broken jail is but a passing curiosity.

 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world as Dennis Cooper sees it is not for the
faint of heart. Out there in his slacker suburbia, beautiful boys
with vacant eyes wander aimlessly before being sodomized, mutilated
and hacked to pieces with an ax. But there is little hysteria amid
the bloodshed. Cooper keeps it cool with prose that evokes reverent
sound bites like ``intensely lyrical,'' ``smart and nervy'' and
``revolutionary'' from enamored critics.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are those who call his work pornographic and
antihomosexual, although the writer himself is gay. As Edmund White
wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ``This is the very stuff
of Jesse Helms' worst nightmares.'' He meant it as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Cooper and his work will be the subject of a
scholarly discussion at New York University in Fales Library, which
houses his archives. The symposium continues Thursday with an
exhibition of Cooper's papers and a reading by friends, including
the writer Bret Easton Ellis, the painter Robert Gober and Thurston
Moore, the bassist of Sonic Youth. The event coincides with the
publication of ``Period'' (Grove Press), the final book of the
``quintology'' that began in 1989 with ``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find Dennis' work to be some of the most exciting around,''
said Marvin Taylor, the library's director. ``The subject matter is
very, very difficult in that he tackles the aesthetic conundrum
that exists between the sheer beauty of the writing and the books'
content. Dennis brings us constantly to the moments of the
ineffable: love, desire, death, beauty. It is amazingly brilliant
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 47, has spent half a lifetime translating the
unspeakable into being. ``Ever since I was a kid, I've sort of
found this area that was haunting and confusing and riveting and
frightening,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Los Angeles. ``That's one of the reasons I started writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Arcadia, Calif., attended public school until the
eighth-grade, then transferred to a boys' school where, at 15, he
stumbled upon ``The 120 Days of Sodom'' by the Marquis de Sade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge influence,'' he said, recalling how the work
excited him into writing his own version. ``When I read Sade and
saw there was a piece of serious literature that dealt with these
issues that was brilliant, really intelligent and full of
philosophical rigor, it was quite a moment with me. I thought,
`This stuff can be literature and not just porn.'''
</P>
<P>
   After forsaking college on the advice of a writing teacher,
Cooper spent his 20s and early 30s writing short stories, essays
and poetry in Los Angeles and New York, discovering the films of
Robert Bresson along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found my voice when I saw him,'' he said. ``I had an
incredibly strong response because of the ways in which the work is
very controlled and meticulous. I saw how I could write about these
incredibly deep things and do it in a way that is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 Cooper moved to Amsterdam in the Netherlands in pursuit
of love and, he acknowledged, to rid himself of a drug habit. There
he wrote ``Closer,'' the cornerstone of the series, to be followed
over the next decade by ``Try,'' ``Guide,'' ``Frisk'' and finally
``Period.'' ``Closer'' earned him a substantial cult following, as
well as critical praise for his elegant prose and literary
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sense I wanted to do a series that would be one
work,'' he said. ``The actual structure was very calculated. This
one book would be slowly dismembered down to nothing, a kind of
stripping away of things. And everything had to be in `Closer' that
I would work with in the other novels. Each book formally would
reflect the damage caused in the content of the book before it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its themes of beauty, youth, death and desire wrapped in a
bloody dressing, ``Closer'' was the start of Cooper's attempt to
explain away his own childhood nightmares: the day, at 11, a friend
accidentally hit him on the head with an ax and abandoned him as he
bled; the time, at 13, three boys his age were found raped and
killed in mountains where he often hiked and camped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to find where it happened,'' he said. ``I made a whole
pilgrimage to the site. I thought it was terrifying, yet I was
completely fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the memory of George Miles, the painfully fragile
boy who appears throughout the series to torment his lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper met the real George when, as a sixth-grader, the boy
``freaked out'' on acid. ``I took him out to this field and I
talked to him,'' he said. ``We bonded over that and we became
really great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Older than George by several years, he assumed the role of
caretaker in their relationship, which, depending on the state of
George's mental health, fluctuated wildly. ``He made me realize
this kind of tendency to want to save people,'' Cooper said. ``He
also physically defined the kind of people I'm attracted to. I was
writing the books for him. Then I moved to Amsterdam and lost
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he returned in search of George, only to learn
that he had shot himself in 1987. In ``Period'' the character
George departs Cooper's fictional world as a suicide and returns as
a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   That his work should be relegated to the porn, gay fiction or
even horror sections in bookstores is something he still finds
startling. Some readers, he said, ``either turn it into something
by Stephen King or they denude it as just so much extraneous
psychological disorder. As for the gay thing, I find that
definition incredibly reductive for people like myself who feel
alienated from gay culture and its mindless hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when you write about this subject matter,'' he
added, ``it's so glaring and blinding that readers can't always see
what's really there.''

`3 STRIKES': AN EX-CON ON THE RUN, DUCKING BULLETS AND JOKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a scenario in which a young black man, just freed from
the penitentiary for the second time, haplessly stumbles into a
situation that, thanks to the popularity of ``three strikes and
you're out'' laws, could put him on ice forever. He must
simultaneously try to prove his innocence and evade the police and
the angry criminals who come after him. In the hands of a director
like Charles Burnett or Sidney Lumet, this story might yield a
rich, tense psychological thriller rippling with righteous
political anger. It would have everything going for it:
Hitchcockian suspense, heart-swelling melodrama, and up-to-the
minute social relevance.
</P>
<P>
   None of which has anything to do with ``3 Strikes,'' which
elects to play this potential tragedy as farce. ``3 Strikes'' is
directed by D.J. Pooh, a co-writer of the screenplay for the first
``Friday'' movie who clearly wants to cash in on the success of
that film and its lesser sequel. There is a decent hip-hop-driven
score, with a title track (performed by Snoop Doggy Dogg) that
should insure big sales for the soundtrack album. There is also a
clever, fairly recondite blaxploitation reference, to ``Truck
Turner,'' a 1974 picture starring Isaac Hayes as a bounty hunter on
the run from an assortment of bad guys. And ``3 Strikes'' shares
with ``Friday'' (though not with ``Next Friday'') an easygoing,
affectionate sense of place _ South Central Los Angeles, in case
you hadn't heard.
</P>
<P>
   But ``3 Strikes'' is definitely a second-string effort, compared
with which even the pathetic last third of ``Next Friday'' looks
like something out of Ernst Lubitsch, or at least Mel Brooks. Once
he dreamed up his story, D.J. Pooh decided to pad it out with a
series of comic situations so tired you can almost hear them snore.
Come to think of it, the loud snoring of drunken old men _ to say
nothing of the amusing guttural and gastric noises they continually
emit _ is one of the film's prized comic devices, as are the
uncontrollable lust of a fat woman, a gunshot wound in a man's
buttock, and the observation that policemen are fond of doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Running, scrambling and pratfalling through this mess is Brian
Hooks, who plays Rob Douglas, a young man who seems to have been
sent to jail for being unbelievably annoying and who has apparently
been paroled for the same reason. When the friend who was supposed
to pick him up is detained by an unexpected lap dance (don't ask),
Rob ends up in a stolen car on the Harbor Freeway. There follows a
shootout with the police, and Rob, who only wants to see his parole
officer, his family, and his sullen girlfriend, Juanita (N'Bushe
Wright), soon finds that he is Los Angeles County's most famous
fugitive, the elusive Freeway Gunman.
</P>
<P>
   There is some real possibility for knockabout satire here,
almost all of it squandered. Hooks seems to think that loosening
his neck muscles and bobbing his head around makes him an inspired
physical comedian. But he's more like someone who flunked out of
the Wayans Brothers slapstick academy. He is not helped by D.J.
Pooh's jokeless script, or by the plodding pace of the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``3 Strikes'' does have its moments, most of them supplied by
George Wallace as Rob's irascible father and David Alan Grier as a
dingbat LAPD detective. These men know how to be funny, even when
the material they're given fails to be. E40 also has an inspired
turn as Rob's protector, a sharp-dressing entrepreneur who speaks
entirely in mystical, freeform hip-hop poetry.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, ``3 Strikes'' feels like a very long
late-night comedy sketch that occasionally veers beyond
tastelessness toward something worse. The film's climax comes when
a crowd of police officers opens fire on an unarmed black man. Will
anyone, at the present moment, think this is funny?
</P>

<P>
   Watching video images on the Internet is one of those computer
tasks with more next steps than a mambo. Viewers have long been
forced to download many programs with many levels to squint into
little windows on computer monitors to see smudgy, sputtering
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   But with steady improvements in streaming technologies, online
video is beginning to approach _ at best _ the outer edges of
television-quality video. And for the first time, video on the
Internet can do something television video cannot: permit viewers
to take a virtually step into moving pictures and change their
perspective on what they see as easily as if they were turning
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   This immersive, interactive video has already been used by
Superbowl.com and ESPN.com to stream 360-degree videos of
behind-the-scene action at the Super Bowl in January. More examples
may soon show up in baseball dugouts and concert seats.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that makes immersive video possible is being
advanced primarily by two companies, the Internet Pictures Corp.,
or iPIX, based in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Palo Alto, Calif., and the
Be Here Corp., based in Cupertino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For years, computer users have been able to view still pictures
that took advantage of immersive technology on CD-ROMs and DVD
discs. Pictures taken with a fisheye lens and processed with
software that stitched together two 180-degree shots of a single
scene or object let viewers rotate a 360-degree panorama by simply
moving their mouse around over the picture.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Technology, Entertainment and Design conference
in Monterey, Calif., iPIX unveiled its immersive application for
moving images. Called iPIX Movies, the technology permits users to
tilt and pan across the image through 360 degrees, looking left and
right, up and down without interrupting the flow of various moving
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown its incredible capabilities,'' said James
Phillips, iPIX's chairman and chief executive, speaking of his
company's new video technology. ``It captures everything. It is an
application that transports you into spaces where otherwise you
could not go.'' The iPIX technology can be used in digital video as
well as in traditional movie cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the company announced its first commercial
applications of iPIX movies, in a deal with Discovery Online and
the Hawaiian Visitor and Convention Bureau to produce interactive
movies of the Hawaiian islands.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of an iPIX movie showed a lush scene of a Hawaiian
waterfall shot from a helicopter high above. By moving a computer
mouse over the scene, the viewpoint smoothly shifted within the
movie and kept shifting as long as the mouse was moving.
</P>
<P>
   While the film clip was shot with a single camera using a small
new iPIX lens and camera, the scores of possible angles from which
to view the scene gave viewers the impression that the waterfall
had been photographed with dozens of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the applications of what the company calls
360-by-360-degree video were almost endless. He said he could
easily imagine iPIX cameras being strapped to race cars or athletes
so viewers could get a first-person point of view. He also noted
that an iPIX camera could serve as an all-seeing security camera.
</P>
<P>
   (Phillips even suggested that if iPIX movies had been around at
the time of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the
mysteries of the grassy knoll might have been solved in playing
back video that would have photographed Dealey Plaza from
practically every angle.)
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way, Be Here's immersive video, called 360
iVideo, can capture full panoramas of moving images and play them
back. Unlike iPIX movies, however, Be Here's iVideo technology
captures and shows a more narrow range _ 360 degress horizontally
and about 110 degrees vertically.
</P>
<P>
   But Be Here's president and chief executive, Ted Driscoll, said
his competitor's system actually captured only 180 degrees
vertically and that much of that was at viewing angles unnatural to
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to focus our attention on the part of the sphere
around your head,'' Driscoll said. ``Your eyes spend most of their
time looking along that equator. We rarely look straight up unless
you are at a sporting event and on the court with Kareem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this new field is hotly competitive, neither company
leader offered precise details on how their video technologies
actually work. Phillips talked briefly about a new lens design and
powerful software to blend the images together. Driscoll said his
company's technology was less dependent on software and more
dependent on special optical systems in the camera itself.
</P>
<P>
   And while Driscoll said iVideos, like iPIX movies, could be
burned onto CD-ROM and DVD discs, his company's emphasis is on
putting the images on the Internet. Samples of iVideos can be seen
at the 360 Gallery at www.behere.com.
</P>
<P>
   Be Here's immersive videos can be seen using the Internet's
three primary streaming formats: RealVideo, Windows Media and
Quicktime.
</P>
<P>
   The iPIX and iVideos technologies may be adapted someday for
consumer use, but both Phillips and Driscoll said that would most
likely have to wait while the new format became established in the
commercial world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the summer you are going to begin seeing this on broadcast
television,'' said Phillips, of iPIX.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, he promised, immersive video technology is going to
capture Dad's face from behind the home video camera and put him
back in the family picture where he belongs.

<P>
   DEMS-OUTLOOK (Cincinnati) _ Confronted by Bill Bradley's
humiliating loss in Washington state on Tuesday, many Democrats,
including some of his supporters, said Wednesday that he has no
chance of snatching his party's presidential nomination from Vice
President Al Gore. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   MCCAIN (Los Angeles) _ Sen. John McCain on Wednesday softened
and played down his incendiary oratory about the religious right, a
risky line of attack that may be costing him desperately needed
votes among conservative Republicans and that prompted a public
complaint from one of his most prominent supporters, Gary L. Bauer.

</P>
<P>
   BUSH (St. Louis, Mo.) _ Buoyed by a string of victories, Gov.
George W. Bush moved Wednesday to press his advantage over Sen.
John McCain by saying he would participate in person in a
California debate to underscore his commitment to one of the most
critical states in next week's super Tuesday primaries. By Alison
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-MEDIA (Los Angeles) _ For all that has been made this
campaign season of Sen. John McCain's accessibility and how he has
used his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus to hold unending, rolling
conversations with his traveling press entourage, Al Gore's
campaign operation provides a vivid counterpoint. Reporters
covering the vice president can go for days without seeing him and,
because many are consigned to a press charter while the vice
president flies in Air Force II, they can sometimes be in a
different city. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-MEDIA (Los Angeles, Calif.) _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley
had just finished a talk on gun control at a San Francisco hospital
earlier this week when he looked into his audience and said, ``If
you'd like to ask any questions, I'd be pleased to answer them.''
Immediately, Pamela Tam, a reporter for KPIX, the San Francisco
affiliate for CBS, piped up from the rear of the crowd. ``No, no,''
he said, ``We were going to do the people.'' But mid-sentence, he
caught himself and relented. ``Go ahead,'' he continued. ``You
didn't know the rules.'' ``The rules,'' as Bradley's campaign has
unofficially sought to define them, go something like this: Voters
get to ask lots of questions at almost every event, almost every
day. Reporters must wait for news conferences. In a busy week,
there will be four of them. Sometimes fewer. And all tend to be
short. (15 minutes or less.) By James Dao.

Jay Leno has McCain. And then next week, they trade places. By
Caryn James.

Reagan, who says ``I know Ronald Reagan, and you're no Reagan
republican.'' By Peter Marks.

trail.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-DEBATE (Los Angeles) _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley face off

</P>
<P>
   NY-BUSH-PATAKI (New York) _ With George W. Bush's convincing
victories in North Dakota, Washington and Virginia on Tuesday, the
governor of Texas turned yesterday to New York, hoping that the
vote in that state next Tuesday will help him finally nail down a
nomination that has eluded him through a frustrating six weeks of
contests. Bush, though, is not the only governor with a lot riding
on next Tuesday's vote, and that became abundantly clear on
Wednesday as Gov. George Pataki's apparatus lumbered to life,
trying to assure that Pataki does not join the list of Republican
governors who have failed Bush during his difficult political year.

MORE MONEY, MORE AGENTS MEANS SLIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One prominent NFL voice was describing the ``slime factor'' at
the college scouting combine last week in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of walking through the hotel lobby,'' he grumbled,
``you could slide all the way to the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Very tacky stuff, but nothing new. It's just the sports
agent-types being image-trashed again. ``Slime'' is one of the few
printables these days when you are talking agents.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those of us in the media benefit greatly from this.
The way it once was in the jock kingdom, most all ill deeds were
somehow traced to ``taken out of context,'' ``misquoted,''
``tabloid mentality'' or ``I never read anything you write but a
friend of a friend's friend told me you said ...''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the agents who catch most of the blame, be it from the
college or pro ranks. Some of that blame is deserved. A low-rent
element seems to be growing rapidly in the agent business, where
new faces pop up overnight, lured by the scent of what is perceived
to be easy money.
</P>
<P>
   At the scouting combine, it was considered a record number of
agents who circled around Indy like buzzards on roadkill. All that
college football talent had gathered to be tested for football
skills. The agents were attempting to recruit their piece of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   A week never goes by when a story doesn't hit print about an
agent-gone-dirty. Undercover payments to college jocks leading to
suspension by the NCAA is normal for the sports page. There's also
Tank Black, the former college football coach who became a
high-profile agent. Now Black faces a long-stretch in the slammer
based on state and federal criminal fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, of course, says sports agents are no different from
doctors, lawyers, preachers, etc. The good ones, and honest ones,
far outnumber the ``slime'' factor, even though there is the
tendency to generalize it the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The college people, however, will tell you the agent business is
worse than ever. The pros don't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   What then does the good agent do in these troubled times?
</P>
<P>
   If you are Irving-based Jordan Woy, a second-generation agent,
the answer didn't come easy. But his decision had one benefit. He
does sleep better at night.
</P>
<P>
   Woy dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Not out of the agent business _ he still has 45 NFL players
under contract, and the list grows every year.
</P>
<P>
   But Woy canceled his ``recruiting'' trip to Indianapolis this
year. He also attended no college all-star games, which are also
must-be-there gathering spots for agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will no longer be involved in that area of the business,''
Woy said. ``To go through that process of dealing with the college
player, it almost makes you feel dirty. I don't like that feeling.
Working with the veteran NFL players _ and I've added like 12 new
ones this year alone _ is pure heaven compared to what goes on at
Indianapolis and the all-star games.''
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years, Woy has represented mainly football players, but
no matter the sport, the agent-business mushroomed during the
1990s. Why? Because the money also mushroomed in the '90s, more so
in the NFL than anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, no player in the NFL made a million
dollars a season,'' Woy said. ``Now punters can make that. Money
changes everything and everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the agent business, it's been like the floodgates opened.
Suddenly everyone wanted to be an agent. Suddenly everyone wanted
to sign a client, and to do so came the theory of
promise-them-anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know lawyers who became agents who do things they would
never dream of doing as lawyers. They'd lose their license if they
did. Very stupid business decisions are made.''
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition has pushed some agents to the illegal side.
And the college player of today who considers himself as draftable
by the NFL is aware certain agents have ready-made deals for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk to a kid you know to be a sixth- or
seventh-rounder at best, and it's a guarantee he will consider
himself a third-rounder at worse,'' Woy said. ``So what he wants
from you is a $40,000 Lexus, a personal trainer and living-expense
money going into the draft. Neither from an ethical or business
standpoint, could I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to recommendations from other clients, Woy will represent
about six college players in the April draft. ``And that was only
after I gave them my upfront speech about what to expect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many agents. Too many college players with their hands out.
It's a bad mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to now deal only with
veterans like a Ray Crockett, a George Teague and so on,'' Woy
said. ``Really, I do sleep better.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, can't be said for college coaches and
athletic directors. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports at Six'' can
be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

EXPERTS URGE U.S. TO FIND WAYS TO ENCOURAGE SPACE TOURISM,
BUSINESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Likely years away from sending the first
human explorers to Mars, the United States should encourage tourism
and foster other forms of private enterprise in space if it wants
to sustain a leadership role on the new frontier, a panel of
experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government should do for space travel what it did in the
early 1900s for civil aviation, the experts urged, such as
fostering a transportation industry that offers new opportunities
for private investment and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Without a successful transition away from glitzy but expensive
government-controlled projects, such as the U.S.-led international
space station and the Cold War-era Apollo moon landings, NASA faces
a loss of public and political support, some of the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever else this country is doing in space, our very
character as Americans dictates that we should be opening up space
for the general public,'' said Tom Rogers, who chairs the private
Sophron Foundation, a privately funded space advocacy group in
McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in early missile guidance systems, Rogers was among
four panelists who addressed 150 aerospace professionals gathered
for the Human Space Transportation and Exploration Workshop
sponsored by Lockheed Martin and the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rogers, NASA should pay private rocket companies to
launch the stream of supplies that will be needed by residents of
the new space station rather than haul them up on the space
shuttle. The $25 billion that the U.S. General Accounting Office
believes NASA will spend on shuttle supply flights over a decade of
space station operations could finance the development of two or
three new private rockets that would cost less than the shuttle to
launch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also said that the federal government should sponsor the
development of orbiting satellites that generate electrical power
used on Earth from sunlight. NASA could even look for ways to
sponsor human sporting events in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these would use people in space in novel ways that
would work to restore the zest for space activities on the part of
the general public,'' said Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' views were shared by Gary Payton, NASA's deputy
associate administrator for space flight, who for three years has
led efforts to develop a low-cost successor to the space shuttle.
The effort has been marred by delays and cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Payton noted that 55 years after Orville and Wilbur Wright's
first airplane flight in 1903, Boeing 707 jetliners began carrying
paying passengers. A similar period of time has passed since the
first launchings of the German V-2 rockets in World War II, and
still it is impossible to predict when the public might begin
boarding a passenger rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the way to show adequate leadership in human
spaceflight,'' Payton said. ``We need to engage the entrepreneurial
energy of the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joe Rothenberg, NASA's associate administrator for
spaceflight, told the conference that his agency remains the solid
global leader in human space exploration despite a succession of
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with adequate funding, NASA lacks the technologies to
protect its explorers from the threat of solar and cosmic radiation
as well as the other ill health effects that humans would face
during a long journey to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the public will remain supportive of NASA as it
attempts to overcome those obstacles with the research it plans
aboard the space station.

HOUSTON CABLE AUDIENCE MAY LOSE ABC AFFILIATE THURSDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Time Warner and KTRK-Channel 13 flap continued
Tuesday, with the ABC affiliate saying it still plans to leave
Houston's largest cable system by week's end _ as soon as 12:01
a.m. CST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney/ABC has been negotiating 10-year retransmission
agreements for its stations in Houston, New York, Los Angeles and
other cities, representing 3.5 million Time Warner subscribers in
all.
</P>
<P>
   The parties agreed to a 30-day extension on the current
agreements, except in Houston, which ABC apparently is using as a
test case.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner spokesman Mike Luftman said a deal had been worked
out in early January to include the Disney Channel, now a premium
service, in the expanded basic cable package and to carry two other
Disney properties, Toon Disney and SoapNet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an actual written document, with all the i's dotted
and all the t's crossed, and it was ready to be signed,'' Luftman
said. ``(Disney/ABC) basically pulled it off the table and reneged
on it. Instead they said here's another deal, take it or leave it.
The additional cost of that deal was more than $100 million over
the (10-year) deal we had already agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner had agreed to pay Disney 30 cents per month per
customer for the Disney Channel, Luftman said, but ``they basically
turned around and said now we want 71 cents per customer. ... There
were other additional costs in the take-it-or-leave-it deal, but
that was by far the largest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those costs, Luftman said, would have to be passed on to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had the leverage to extort it from us,'' he
said. ``At the moment, they're doing it by threatening to pull
their programming from Houston cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's analogous to a terrorist situation. When terrorists take
hostages, what they often do is they'll pick one out at random and
shoot them, just to show they mean business. That's kind of what
they're doing in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Florsheim, KTRK general manager and president, called
Luftman's comments ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no deal,'' he said. ``There were a number of issues
that were not resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're disappointed that Time Warner wants to engage
in a war of words instead of sitting down at the table to talk
about substantive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a retransmission agreement, Channel 13 will go off the
cable system at 12:01 a.m. Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The day is uncertain because ABC requested a 24-hour extension
of the retransmission agreement, but no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner-Houston, meanwhile, plans to make antennas available
to customers who request them and will offer the premium service
HBO Family in Channel 13's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of damage to go around if this happens,'' said
Time Warner's Luftman. ``There's no doubt that we will be hurt, no
doubt that Disney/ABC will be hurt and no doubt the customers will
be hurt. It's a bad situation.''

THE AGONY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THE OFFICE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: MUST SUB. This is the corrected version of a story that
moved last night prematurely and must be killed.)   By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After her husband smashed the liquor bottle over her head, after
the blood dried and her two young sons stopped crying, Rosa
Schirripa realized the marriage was over. Although she got
emotional support from her friends, she was afraid to approach the
one person who might have given her the most practical help: her
boss.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared that he would view her as weak or stupid for
staying with her husband for so long and that he would try to get
rid of her. Eventually she did talk to him and, to her surprise, he
gave her a few days off, at his convenience. Before that talk,
however, she felt she had nowhere to turn for advice and
protection. Instead, she spent a lot of time sobbing in the office
bathroom and asked her colleagues to cover for her when the divorce
lawyers called. Anything so her boss would not know.
</P>
<P>
   Schirripa, a 38-year-old New Yorker whose ordeal ended in
divorce two years ago, said she knew of other people who stayed in
abusive relationships because they were afraid to go to their boss.
``They're afraid of the stigma,'' she said, ``afraid that they'll
be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude appears to be changing, though, as more companies
become aware of how domestic abuse affects workplace morale and
productivity, and as more cities and states consider legislation to
protect victims against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, only a handful of companies in the United States
had formal policies to help employees deal with domestic violence,
but today hundreds do, said Donna Norton, manager of the Workplace
Resource Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., with 57,000 employees, has been active in
the campaign for greater awareness of the problem, holding
workshops and conferences around the country. Last spring, it
joined with Liz Claiborne Inc., American Express Co. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. to sponsor Safe at Work, a coalition of companies,
labor unions and government agencies that seeks to spread the word
about domestic violence and its effect on the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   A number of state and local governments have also taken action.
Since 1998, Rhode Island and California have enacted laws
prohibiting employers from terminating employees who take time off
to get restraining orders against abusive partners. Similar
legislation is pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Dade County in Florida enacted legislation last year
to provide unpaid leave for domestic violence victims. Ten states,
including California, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey,
recently passed legislation making victims eligible for
unemployment insurance if they lose their jobs. Mark Green, New
York City's public advocate, says he plans to introduce a bill soon
to broaden the rights of city employees in the event of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   When it becomes known that employers cannot retaliate, ``more
women will come forward,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence is probably a greater drain on productivity
than most employers realize. Ten years ago, the Bureau of National
Affairs, a private company that monitors workplace trends,
estimated the cost of domestic violence in lost output at $3
billion to $5 billion a year. And a study commissioned by Liz
Claiborne in 1994 estimated that family disputes, including
domestic violence, kept a million Americans off the job every day.
Last year, Victim Services, a nonprofit assistance agency in New
York City, received 95,000 calls from women who needed help because
of abusive partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the callers talk about issues at work, because for
women that's a prime place where domestic violence happens,'' said
Bea Hanson, a director at Victim Services. ``We get calls from
women who are being stalked by their boyfriend or husband at their
job, or they've gotten repeat phone calls that prevent them from
focusing on their work. We get calls from women whose partners come
in unannounced and demand they leave. Most women don't feel safe to
talk about this issue at work, so it's important for women to know
they can disclose this information and not lose their job.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of uncertainty once haunted Brooke McMurray. Ms.
McMurray, a vice chairwoman of Victim Services, worked at Time Inc.
for more than 20 years before leaving in January. She was in an
abusive relationship for 12 of those years, she says, but never
sought help at work. ``You didn't talk about it then,'' said
McMurray, who is 50. ``The guy operating the freight elevators was
the only one I told,'' and that was because she used the freight
elevator for years when her husband used to wait in the lobby for
her. Time does not have a formal domestic-violence policy, a
spokesman said, but it does now have an employee-assistance program
that can help victims.
</P>
<P>
   Such a self-imposed wall of silence as McMurray's can come
tumbling down at a company that advertises its eagerness to help
people in her predicament. Janice Munson, a Philip Morris employee
in upstate New York, says the company's policy helped save her
sanity. Shortly after joining Philip Morris in 1990, she was
divorced. Abusive calls and letters kept coming in, she says, but
in the open atmosphere at Philip Morris she was able for the first
time to talk to her superiors about her plight and to get help. She
was encouraged to supply a description of her former husband to the
security desk. She even got the mailroom to throw out letters from
him so she wouldn't have to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Schirripa, the woman who was hit over the head with a liquor
bottle, is now a full-time administrative assistant at the College
of Staten Island and is taking courses in social work there. She
also makes speeches and works as needed for Green's office as an
advocate for more enlightened workplace policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the employer give the employee a chance, let her get on
her own two feet,'' Schirripa said. Unpaid leaves are a big help,
she said. Speaking for victims of violence, she added: ``I'm not
even asking for pay. I'll lose the money, but if I lose my job I
lose my lifeline.''

BUSH RECLAIMS FRONT-RUNNER STATUS OVER McCAIN WITH WINS 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush scored an easy victory Tuesday in Virginia's
presidential primary, a landslide in North Dakota caucuses, and
reclaimed his status as front-runner for the Republican nomination.
He was locked in a tight battle with John McCain in a closely
watched contest in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, hoping to deny his challenger even a
psychological victory, was favored over former Sen. Bill Bradley in
the Democrats' nonbinding presidential preference vote in
Washington state, their party's only electoral action of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after reviewing early tabulations in Virginia, exulted in
his return to the winner's column by telling supporters in
Cincinnati: ``We are one step closer to victory. We are one step
closer to having a united party, and we are one step closer to
getting rid of Clinton-Gore in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the Virginia result, according to exit polling,
was Bush's resounding draw among Christian conservatives, whose
leaders McCain attacked in a fiery speech Monday. The religious
right made up about 20 percent of the Virginia electorate, and Bush
won about 80 percent of their votes. The remainder of the voters
split about equally between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, after phoning congratulations to Bush, questioned
whether the Texan's candidacy had real national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if he has a Southern strategy here,'' McCain said,
referring to Bush's victories in Virginia and South Carolina.
McCain looked forward to better results next week ``when we have a
broad cross-section of America voting all on that same day.''
</P>
<P>
   For both parties and the four major contenders, the contests
were seen as a dress rehearsal for next Tuesday, which will be the
biggest day of primary balloting in the nation's history and
include face-offs in California and New York. The need for a
victory was especially urgent for Bradley, whose once vibrant
candidacy is struggling to stay afloat after defeats in Iowa and
New Hampshire and a resulting drop in public-opinion polls, both
nationally and in key states.
</P>
<P>
   With all but a few precincts in Virginia reporting, Bush had 54
percent; McCain had 43 percent, and former Reagan administration
official Alan Keyes 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, with all precincts reporting, Bush had 76
percent to McCain's 19 percent. Keyes trailed with 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's voting, McCain, the victor in New Hampshire,
Arizona and Michigan, led Bush 96-93 delegates, according to an
Associated Press count, with 1,034 needed to ensure the nomination
at this summer's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush picking up 56 delegates in Virginia's winner-take-all
contest, and apparently 14 in North Dakota, he moved back ahead of
the U.S. senator from Arizona. Bush has chalked up earlier wins in
Iowa, Alaska, Delaware, South Carolina and U.S. territories
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But the incremental nature of Bush's accumulation of delegates
and his state-by-state battle with McCain was yet another reminder
of how far the Texas governor has slipped from the triumphal
timetable his top aides outlined only months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By that scenario, Bush was supposed to be ready to wrap up the
nomination next week and begin a general-election-style campaign
against the likely Democratic standard-bearer, presumably Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush finds himself in a bitter and expensive fight that
seems to be as much about the ideological foundations of the party,
and especially the role of conservative Christians, as about who
will seek to lead Republicans into the post-Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, top strategists for McCain have long acknowledged
that if their insurgent effort had not effectively knocked Bush out
of the race by Tuesday's round of voting _ a possibility foreclosed
by the governor's victory in South Carolina _ that the senator's
chances of ultimate success dimmed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's dependence on independents and Democrats will avail him
little in contests such as California and New York, where only the
vote of registered Republicans will count in electing those state's
huge share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor's margin among
independent voters has grown, from a meager 19 percent in New
Hampshire to almost one-third in Virginia, according to exit polls
for news media.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Virginia came a day after McCain went to Virginia
Beach, home of the Christian Coalition, for the express purpose of
excoriating its leader, televangelist Pat Robertson, and the
group's impact on the Republican Party. McCain identified Bush as
``a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused McCain of having ``a spiteful agenda'' and
belittled the Arizonan's claim as the political heir of former
President Reagan. Bush said Reagan had ``an optimistic agenda, as
do I.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ploy may have backfired in conservative Virginia. Bush
said: ``The voters of Virginia rejected the politics of pitting one
religion against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia voters also had questions about whether McCain was
conservative enough. Six in 10 voters in the Old Dominion on
Tuesday said they were conservatives and they went heavily for
Bush, by a margin of about 3-1 over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, only 12 of the 37 Republican national
convention delegates will be selected on the basis of Tuesday's
voting, with the remainder subject to the action of GOP caucuses
next week.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic contenders, the Washington state vote,
although offering no delegates, was the first contest since the New
Hampshire primary Feb. 1. Bradley spent six days straight in the
state outlining why he believed he was a better candidate than Gore
on a number of issues, including abortion rights, environmental
protection and campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, backed by the state's Democratic establishment, dropped in
over the weekend to tout his record in support of the state's
economic interests, including trade that helps aircraft giant
Boeing, based in Seattle. A Gore television ad featured scenes of
his ascent of Mount Rainier last summer, an event that he had
earlier insisted was a private outing with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state Democrats will use caucuses next week to
apportion delegates to their party's national convention at Los
Angeles in August. National Democratic rules allow only Iowa and
New Hampshire to hold binding presidential nominating contests
before the first Tuesday in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley fought against the growing idea that his was a lost
cause without a victory in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race has just begun,'' the former U.S. senator from New
Jersey said. ``March 7 is the take off date for this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a different take on the short-term nature of his
party's contest and the potentially decisive nature of the voting
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``California will be the decisive vote in determining who the
Democratic nominee is,'' Gore told participants in a Hispanic
campaign event Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has bought time on CBS to air nationally a five-minute
commercial Thursday night that his spokesman, Eric Hauser, said
would be about Bradley's ``vision of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting came as a new Washington Post-ABC national poll
showed McCain with a far better chance at present than Bush of
beating Gore. The match-ups showed McCain beating Gore 56-39
percent and Bush leading the vice president more narrowly, 50-44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the day Tuesday, Bush continued to battle any impression
that, because of his visit to Bob Jones University during the South
Carolina campaign, he shared the school's anti-Roman Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a point of visiting Fatima Family Center in Cleveland,
where he visited with leaders of the city's Catholic Charities
Services. Bush also used the meeting to promote his promise to
create more faith-based social service programs if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had been set up last weekend after Bush wrote an
open letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York apologizing for
having missed a chance to speak out against anti-Catholic bias
while at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized McCain for making telephone calls to prospective
voters in Virginia and Washington state attacking Bush for speaking
at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't appreciate the politics that still go on out of
Senator McCain ... the politics of saying he's going to run a
campaign and tell the truth when in fact this is a man who
yesterday authorized calls into the commonwealth of Virginia
calling me an anti-Catholic bigot,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of politics that John F. Kennedy rejected in
the 1960s,'' Bush said, invoking the name of the nation's only
Roman Catholic president. ``It's the kind of politics we thought we
had put behind us in America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides denied so-called ``Catholic Voter Alert'' phone
messages were being made in Virginia but said they were being used
in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that George W. Bush is trying to run a
Jekyll and Hyde campaign where he is a Pat Robertson and Bob Jones
Republican in one state and a compassionate moderate in another,
and he's not going to get away with it,'' said McCain campaign
chief Rick Davis. ``George Bush should take responsibility for his
actions and campaign tactics.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SPARKY Anderson had no illusions about making the Hall of Fame
during his career as a big-league player, which consisted of one
season as a second baseman with the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, in 477 trips to the plate, Sparky delivered zero home
runs, sacrificing power for consistency and hitting a steady .218.
Which may explain why his playing days were short.
</P>
<P>
   But he thrived as a manager, one whose ego was unlikely to clash
with the superstar players who crossed his path.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame added a large helping of cheer and charm
Tuesday when the Veterans Committee elected George Lee ``Sparky''
Anderson the 16th manager to be enshrined. No one ever described
him as a genius, but his teams in Cincinnati and Detroit won over
2,100 games, ranking him third on the all-time list behind Connie
Mack and John McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   That is mighty exclusive company for the son of a house painter,
who paid his dues in the minor leagues riding buses and eating a
lot of cheap hamburgers at roadside palaces.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Anderson once worked in a Los Angeles
furniture factory, fastening legs on tables. Paid by the piece, he
once confided that he would put off going to the washroom in order
to crowd more table legs into his working day.
</P>
<P>
   Recollections of this kind tend to make a good man humble and a
bad man hostile. A good man, Sparky has never forgotten the hungry
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked down my nose at anyone,'' he says. ``Those in
our business who do tend to forget that their day will come. They
will be out on their ears, wondering where their friends went.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised the bar so high in Cincinnati, where he won five
division titles and reached the World Series four times, that it
happened to him. When the Reds finished second in 1978, 2{ games
out of first place, Anderson was fired after nine seasons. He had
taken a team of megastars _ Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and
Tony Perez _ and blended them into the Big Red Machine, the
greatest era Cincinnati had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   But Sparky's friends went with him, to Detroit, where he created
a powerhouse that won 104 games in 1984. The Tigers had no
permanent third baseman, first baseman, left fielder or fourth
starter, but they led the pennant race wire-to-wire.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers won the World Series that year the town, which
had been torn by racial strife, went slightly berserk. The
celebration lasted for days, and it took a heartfelt plea from
Sparky to get the fans to return home, promising not to torch any
more police cars. Joyfully, Detroit went back to recalling cars or
unloading them at book value.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame is going to be a merrier and more inviting
place simply because Anderson's friendly mug will be on display
there.
</P>
<P>
   He so loved his job that he once expressed a desire to continue
managing a baseball team until he was 80 years old. The remark
puzzled one of his rivals, Whitey Herzog, who noted that Anderson,
then in his 50s, ``already looks 80.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his history, it isn't surprising that almost no one ever
called him George, with the exception of an umpire named Al Clark,
who said, ``I refuse to call a grown man Sparky.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has finally caught up with his hair _ it turned
white when he was in his 20s _ his life isn't complicated by
vanity. He earned his immortality by recognizing that championship
teams enjoyed a quality called good chemistry. In his managerial
style he was an activist. He was quick to make moves and never shy
about explaining them.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first to create his team around the bullpen, changing
pitchers so abruptly that he became known as Captain Hook. In the
process, he developed an interesting policy. If only conversation
was required, he sent out his pitching coach. If he wanted to make
a change, he went to the mound himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often,'' he said, ``when you go to remove a pitcher, there is
a certain amount of guff involved. There is no reason for a coach
to take that. The manager gets more money and more credit if the
team wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will tell you frankly that when he began his career as
a manager, he wanted to be loved. With the years came wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the manager and his players stick together on a
team,'' he says, ``the more disenchanted they get with each other.
As time passes, your faults become more exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the element of luck enters into it. With a
break, you can develop a combination of players who will rise above
the fringe stuff and play well together. But you must find the
right combination. That's why you will sometimes see great talent
on teams that keep losing. They have never learned respect for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   That virtue, and more, the Tigers and Reds learned under Sparky.

THE AGONY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THE OFFICE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: MUST SUB. This is the corrected version of a story that
moved last night prematurely and must be killed.)   By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After her husband smashed the liquor bottle over her head, after
the blood dried and her two young sons stopped crying, Rosa
Schirripa realized the marriage was over. Although she got
emotional support from her friends, she was afraid to approach the
one person who might have given her the most practical help: her
boss.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared that he would view her as weak or stupid for
staying with her husband for so long and that he would try to get
rid of her. Eventually she did talk to him and, to her surprise, he
gave her a few days off, at his convenience. Before that talk,
however, she felt she had nowhere to turn for advice and
protection. Instead, she spent a lot of time sobbing in the office
bathroom and asked her colleagues to cover for her when the divorce
lawyers called. Anything so her boss would not know.
</P>
<P>
   Schirripa, a 38-year-old New Yorker whose ordeal ended in
divorce two years ago, said she knew of other people who stayed in
abusive relationships because they were afraid to go to their boss.
``They're afraid of the stigma,'' she said, ``afraid that they'll
be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude appears to be changing, though, as more companies
become aware of how domestic abuse affects workplace morale and
productivity, and as more cities and states consider legislation to
protect victims against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, only a handful of companies in the United States
had formal policies to help employees deal with domestic violence,
but today hundreds do, said Donna Norton, manager of the Workplace
Resource Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., with 57,000 employees, has been active in
the campaign for greater awareness of the problem, holding
workshops and conferences around the country. Last spring, it
joined with Liz Claiborne Inc., American Express Co. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. to sponsor Safe at Work, a coalition of companies,
labor unions and government agencies that seeks to spread the word
about domestic violence and its effect on the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   A number of state and local governments have also taken action.
Since 1998, Rhode Island and California have enacted laws
prohibiting employers from terminating employees who take time off
to get restraining orders against abusive partners. Similar
legislation is pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Dade County in Florida enacted legislation last year
to provide unpaid leave for domestic violence victims. Ten states,
including California, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey,
recently passed legislation making victims eligible for
unemployment insurance if they lose their jobs. Mark Green, New
York City's public advocate, says he plans to introduce a bill soon
to broaden the rights of city employees in the event of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   When it becomes known that employers cannot retaliate, ``more
women will come forward,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence is probably a greater drain on productivity
than most employers realize. Ten years ago, the Bureau of National
Affairs, a private company that monitors workplace trends,
estimated the cost of domestic violence in lost output at $3
billion to $5 billion a year. And a study commissioned by Liz
Claiborne in 1994 estimated that family disputes, including
domestic violence, kept a million Americans off the job every day.
Last year, Victim Services, a nonprofit assistance agency in New
York City, received 95,000 calls from women who needed help because
of abusive partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the callers talk about issues at work, because for
women that's a prime place where domestic violence happens,'' said
Bea Hanson, a director at Victim Services. ``We get calls from
women who are being stalked by their boyfriend or husband at their
job, or they've gotten repeat phone calls that prevent them from
focusing on their work. We get calls from women whose partners come
in unannounced and demand they leave. Most women don't feel safe to
talk about this issue at work, so it's important for women to know
they can disclose this information and not lose their job.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of uncertainty once haunted Brooke McMurray. Ms.
McMurray, a vice chairwoman of Victim Services, worked at Time Inc.
for more than 20 years before leaving in January. She was in an
abusive relationship for 12 of those years, she says, but never
sought help at work. ``You didn't talk about it then,'' said
McMurray, who is 50. ``The guy operating the freight elevators was
the only one I told,'' and that was because she used the freight
elevator for years when her husband used to wait in the lobby for
her. Time does not have a formal domestic-violence policy, a
spokesman said, but it does now have an employee-assistance program
that can help victims.
</P>
<P>
   Such a self-imposed wall of silence as McMurray's can come
tumbling down at a company that advertises its eagerness to help
people in her predicament. Janice Munson, a Philip Morris employee
in upstate New York, says the company's policy helped save her
sanity. Shortly after joining Philip Morris in 1990, she was
divorced. Abusive calls and letters kept coming in, she says, but
in the open atmosphere at Philip Morris she was able for the first
time to talk to her superiors about her plight and to get help. She
was encouraged to supply a description of her former husband to the
security desk. She even got the mailroom to throw out letters from
him so she wouldn't have to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Schirripa, the woman who was hit over the head with a liquor
bottle, is now a full-time administrative assistant at the College
of Staten Island and is taking courses in social work there. She
also makes speeches and works as needed for Green's office as an
advocate for more enlightened workplace policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the employer give the employee a chance, let her get on
her own two feet,'' Schirripa said. Unpaid leaves are a big help,
she said. Speaking for victims of violence, she added: ``I'm not
even asking for pay. I'll lose the money, but if I lose my job I
lose my lifeline.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ There's little doubt that if Craig Biggio
continues on the path he is on _ that is, the oft-beaten one with
headfirst dives into the dirt happening at the drop of a bunt _
he'll be a candidate for Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   There also is little doubt that if Biggio puts in a few more
years like the ones he has had of late, earning the career numbers
and accolades befitting a Hall of Famer, he will wear the Astros'
uniform into the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, Which Astros uniform? The rainbow sleeves? The
blue and gold shooting star? Or the spiffy new red-and-black
colors, with pinstripes and throwback script lettering?
</P>
<P>
   It is now the 13th spring of Biggio's big-league career. To say
he has seen a lot is an understatement along the lines of saying he
has a tendency to smudge his uniform a bit.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Biggio has worn three uniforms and gone through two
owners, four managers and a pair of home stadiums _ all without
ever departing from the team that drafted him or the style that has
defined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that have been here through all of it are me,
(assistant coach) Matt Galante and Denny (equipment manager Dennis
Liborio),'' Biggio said. ``Things change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Biggio stays the same. Confident. Focused. Undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   There was Biggio breaking in his new Astros duds the other day
as only he knows how. He slipped on his new batting helmet, looked
over the gloss and shine on it and scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   He began banging his head against a wall in the Astros'
Kissimmee clubhouse, pounding the helmet into it, back and forth,
side to side, putting nice little dents in all the right places. He
scraped his pine-tar-coated batting glove over the glistening star
on the front of the helmet, then tossed the helmet into his
baseball bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just warming it up a little bit,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if not for the determination in this man's way, the
double meaning of Biggio's banging his head against the wall might
have been clear.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's 13th spring easily could have been his most
frustrating. After three years of coming close to finally getting
over the playoff hump, the Astros weren't exactly gutted by
offseason moves that trimmed $10 million of payroll, but certainly
a few vital parts were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio could have ranted and raged over the frustration of
losing All-Star-caliber players such as Mike Hampton and Carl
Everett. He could have wielded his formidable stature within the
franchise to demand explanations and answers, or even played out
his free-agent season and then moved on to a team with better
postseason prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But he has done none of it, and he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'd still like to have a lefthanded starter,''
Biggio said. ``We had one of the best, but (Hampton) is not here
anymore. What happened was between Mike and the front office. There
was nothing we could do about it in this clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's no question Carl was one of the most important
parts of our offense. He was clutch. But you just go on and play
the same way you always have, no matter what. You have to care
about winning, and I still see that here.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the changes and uncertainties surrounding this club this
spring, there remains one sure thing and one reason to believe the
Astros yet again will throw themselves headfirst into the division
race. Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   While Hampton and Everett departed, and slugger Jeff Bagwell's
future with the team is likely next up on the negotiating table,
Biggio's services were secured with a recently signed three-year
contract extension worth $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is that Biggio will be an Astro at least through
the 2003 season, giving him enough time to adequately break in the
new helmet and work on numbers that are beginning to resemble Hall
of Fame totals.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this season, Biggio should surpass Jose Cruz for
the club's hits record (1,937) and also break the prestigious
2,000-hit barrier for his career. If his production stays close to
what it has been, Biggio should end his current contract with more
than 2,500 hits, 500 doubles, 500 stolen bases, 1,000 RBIs and 200
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing from his Hall of Fame resume might be a
championship ring. But he's not giving up on that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of the Yankees, there is no sure thing,'' Biggio said.
``Except for last year, we've never been picked to win the
division, but we've done it three years in a row. If I didn't think
we have a chance, yeah, I'd be real upset. But I'm not upset. We
have a chance.''

MORE SHAKE-UPS IN TRAVEL INDUSTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The business of Travel.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of those fortunate few who either have the big
bucks to fly the Concorde to Europe _ or enough clout to make the
company pony up the fare _ here's bad news. This year, you might be
back on the slow flight with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of yet another trade dispute between the United States
and Europe. This one is over hush kits. They are devices installed
on engines of older jets to quiet their noise. Newer jet planes are
much quieter.
</P>
<P>
   Some carriers have chosen to simply replace the old planes, or
their engines, with new ones. Others have installed the hush kits.
They can keep the older planes flying at a much lower cost than
buying new ones. That's especially true on many planes now used to
fly cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The hush kits were pioneered by U.S. companies, especially cargo
delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans say, however, that the hush kits aren't quiet enough.
They are contemplating banning airplanes using them _ or
replacement engines _ from their airports. Americans say that's
blatant protectionism. The European governments just want to expand
the market for airplanes sold by European manufacturer Airbus, they
say. They point out the European standards are stiffer than those
agreed to by the Civil Aviation Organization of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States and Europe don't come to an agreement by
May 8, look for the Clinton administration, under congressional
pressure, to ban the flights of the supersonic Concorde airplanes
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Concordes are operated only by Air France and British Air. They
carry a minuscule portion of traffic over the Atlantic Ocean, and
make little money for the airlines. They operate them more for
prestige than profit, since Concordes are the world's only airliner
capable of breaking the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INVESTORS GET SPECIAL FARES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The travel business, like others, is subject to that cynical
interpretation of the golden rule _ the one about how the person
with the gold makes the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations use their purchasing clout to cut special deals
with suppliers. Travel suppliers are no different.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, however, the buyers have gone a step beyond. Faced
with limited competition and high air fares, companies there are
doing what they can to keep alive a competing airline.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and DaimlerChrysler started the ball rolling when
they agreed to pay a monthly fee to start-up airline Pro Air. In
return, they get cut-rate ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United Auto Workers is investing directly in Pro Air.
In return, union members get a 50 percent discount on published air
fares and can fly standby for just $25.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air said the deal was part of a $36 million sale of stock in
the airline. As part of the deal, the airline also had to agree not
to fight any efforts by unions to organize the airline's employees.

CRUISE LINE COURTING AGENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a travel agent, a bypass isn't something that happens to
your heart, but your pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Bypass is when a travel supplier _ an airline, hotel, cruise
line or the like _ cuts out the travel agent and sells directly to
the customer. It happens when suppliers believe their direct
selling cost is less than paying a travel agent a commission to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are pushing bypass. For example, Southwest Airlines is
getting 25 percent of its revenues from tickets sold over the
Internet, which mostly bypasses travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines seldom bypass. While many of us have to fly
somewhere, few of us have to go on a cruise. Cruises compete with
other vacations _ from a week at a resort to going to Las Vegas.
They have to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is Renaissance Cruises, which competes in the
upper end of the cruise market. At times, it has advised potential
customers to skip agents and buy directly. Instead of the standard
10 percent commission on cruises, Renaissance generally pays a set
fee to travel agents _ usually much less than the agents would get
on a similar sale with other cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Renaissance is trying to kiss and make up with
travel agents. It is flooding travel agent trade journals with
advertising. The company declines to talk about its advertising
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Renaissance added a fifth ship to its fleet last December,
and has three more coming on this year. With a doubling of space,
perhaps it thinks it now needs the agents. The question is, will
the agents forgive and forget?

CANDIDATE FOR TEXAS OFFICE MADE SOFT-CORE ADULT FILM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Republican candidate for state representative wrote
and appeared in a soft-core adult film featuring women jogging
naked through a southwest Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Gunn, in a two-way primary race against incumbent
District 135 Rep. Gary Elkins, R-Houston, said his movie, ``The
Great Texas Showoff,'' is ``just no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blast, something I did 20 years ago,'' Gunn said.
``My God, I have been around forever. It's just no big deal; it
shows I am a communicator, and that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunn, who received writing and producing credit for the film,
appears in it as a sportscaster and a comedian in a topless club.
He also has an unbilled cameo as a masked jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins, who has served in the House since 1995, is not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the father of three daughters, I find it disgusting and
deplorable,'' Elkins said, ``and I feel his actions clearly speak
for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunn, who has been endorsed by several Republican elected
officials and organizations, said he is unconcerned about what
voters will think.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing questionable about my past, I am probably the
most open person in this city,'' Gunn said. ``They can do whatever
they want to me because I don't care. Get mad at me and get mad at
every actor who ever appeared in a turkey or anything more than
G-rated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Texas Showoff'' is not rated, Gunn said, because it
was produced for the cable market but never sold.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, most of which takes place inside a topless club,
features nude women dancing, jogging through neighborhood streets
and lathering themselves with motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said the movie is not pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sex and no dirty language,'' Gunn said. ``It's as
tasteful as it can get with naked women in it. But they are all
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently host of a syndicated outdoor radio show heard locally
on the conservative KPRC-Radio, Gunn is a longtime fixture in
Houston media and advertising markets.
</P>
<P>
   He is the former host of ``Captain Harold's Theater of the
Sky,'' which was canceled by KPRC-TV in 1991, and for 20 years
hosted the KUHT-TV auction.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said the fact that his adult film, made around 1983,
resurfaced during his first campaign for public office shows how
low politics has sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had seen it all in advertising and
entertainment,'' Gunn said. ``Never in my life have I walked
through such crap. No wonder honorable people don't run for office
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunn and Elkins, who is a businessman and consultant, are vying
for representation of the largely Republican northwest Houston
district. There is no Democrat in the race.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Needing to find something to be wrong, but not too wrong, Rockets
center Hakeem Olajuwon might be getting precisely the sort of news
today that he hoped would come from the battery of tests he has
undergone this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first test results Tuesday showed none of the problems he
might have feared. Chest X-rays and other cardiac tests uncovered
no problems. Blood tests proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockets sources said doctors suspect Olajuwon might have a
mild bronchial problem, potentially aggravated by exercise.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves the case, Olajuwon would have not only uncovered
the cause of his problems with rapid exhaustion during games, but
he could have a condition considered easily treated and reparable.
Many bronchial problems suffered by athletes are treated with
inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets team physician Jim Muntz would not comment about
Olajuwon's condition until the remaining test results are available
today. He did say, however, that the initial test results have been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood tests look perfect,'' Muntz said. ``The chest X-rays
were clear, perfect. Cardiac looked good. It doesn't look like he
has any rhythm problems. But the last cardiac exam results are not
back yet. He finished his tests, and most everything looks good so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has suffered from anemia and in 1997 was diagnosed with
atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did not practice Tuesday, and Olajuwon is unlikely
to practice today. Sources said if he is diagnosed with a bronchial
problem, improvement could come in several days. That, however,
might not be enough time to determine whether he would be ready to
play against the Kings on Thursday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has averaged 11.4 points and 6.6 rebounds this season.
He had 21 points and nine rebounds in a 113-111 overtime loss to
the Spurs on Feb. 20. But he struggled with exhaustion in the next
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had six points and six rebounds in 13 minutes against
the Lakers on Sunday. He asked to return to the game, but coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said he chose against it after observing
Olajuwon's difficulty with catching his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon played 23 minutes against the Nuggets last Thursday,
scoring 10 points and grabbing six rebounds. He played 28 minutes
in Charlotte two nights before that, netting six points and five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   If Olajuwon is unavailable Thursday, the timing would be right
for the Rockets to bring back center Kelvin Cato from the injured
list. Cato sprained his left ankle Feb. 18 in San Antonio and has
missed five games, making him eligible to come off the injured
list.
</P>
<P>
   Cato has been out of town and unavailable to be examined by team
physicians to determine if he would be ready to play against the
Kings. He is expected back in time for practice today, allowing the
Rockets to determine if he will be able to return to the rotation.

AOL SEEKS MORE WIRELESS DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Fresh off announcing a half-dozen new partnerships
to make America Online content and services available through
wireless connections, AOL chairman Steve Case said Wednesday the
company will aggressively continue to seek more deals to achieve
its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with as many companies as want to work with
us,'' Case told the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association's Wireless 2000 convention, which has drawn more than
25,000 industry executives. ``Our whole strategy is to partner,
partner, partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wireless officials, including Chris Gent of Vodafone
AirTouch PLC, have said they do not want to give away their
customers to content and e-commerce providers and become only a
wireless pipeline through which others reap profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Case said he thinks if companies try to ``lock people in or
out, I think inevitably you'll fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as obsessed (as others) about the customer ownership
thing,'' said Case. ``To me, it's how do you share customers, how
do you share revenues, how do we work together to build a bigger
market and share that in some equitable way.''
</P>
<P>
   At this week's convention, AOL announced six new alliances to
bring AOL content _ including e-mail and instant messages and
future offerings from Time Warner, which AOL is buying for $120
billion _ to subscribers through wireless phones and other devices.
Deals included pacts with paging giant Arch Communications Inc. of
Westborough, Mass., Motorola, Nokia, and BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Case noted that AOL's 21 million subscribers now spend an
average of an hour a day using the service, but noted: ``Guess
what? There's another 23 hours of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the need for systems that ``bridge these separate
worlds'' through which people get information, including wireless
units, personal computers, and televisions, Case said: ``If you
view this just through the prism of the wireless unit or the PC, I
think you are going to miss the bigger opportunity, which is to
integrate these things in a way that will change the lives of
hundreds of millions of people.''

   ``Poquito a poquito,'' Marlene Karas heard a man say as he
shoveled mud from his home. ``Little by little.''
</P>
<P>
   Karas, a staff photographer for the Journal-Constitution, had
traveled with a reporter to Venezuela in February to cover the
efforts of Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga to help victims
recover from powerful mudslides. When the benefit ended. the
reporter left. Karas stayed behind, watching the victims help
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The mudslides had hit a week before Christmas. Walls of mud
crushed buildings, buckled roads, swept away neighborhoods, and
killed more than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Karas toured Vargas state, a tourist area on the Caribbean
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at how much damage there was,'' she said. ``It
was like the nuclear bomb had dropped. There were no people around;
it was desolate. And this was eight weeks after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, too, there was damage. Homes in the poorest
neighborhoods, often little more than a few bricks topped by a tin
roof, had been reduced to nothing. Cars were destroyed. In various
places, Karas saw people guarding the few possessions they had
left.
</P>
<P>
   Things seemed hopeless. The country depends in large measure on
tourism and oil. Both had been badly hurt. Some hotels had
survived, but the roads to reach them had not. And the port from
which the oil was shipped had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost in disbelief,'' Karas said, ``in that I didn't
know how it was going to get started again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she started to see. Working with her eye and with her
heart, she documented not only the damage, but people's efforts to
recover. Her lens recorded not only the homes that had tumbled down
a hillside, but a man laboring to dig his Jeep from under the mud.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seemed pointless. Surely the Jeep would never run
again. But then it struck Karas that this Jeep might be all the man
had left. Maybe he could use the parts. When disaster hits, you
start with what remains.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked up a hillside in Vargas state, Karas heard the
sound of scraping. Her eye was caught by a small hole in the wall
of a building. From the hole emerged the hand of an old man,
holding a trowel.
</P>
<P>
   The old man was inside the building spooning out gallons upon
gallons of mud one trowelful at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in the end, seems to be how the people of Venezuela
will recover. It is the only way they can.
</P>
<P>
   Poquito a poquito. Little by little.

LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES TO SPIN OFF 3 UNITS

or 888-346-9867.)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc. said Wednesday that it would spin off
three units, creating a new company that would have about $8
billion in revenue and would sell business telephone systems, wire
cabling and office network systems.
</P>
<P>
   The news raised the price of shares in Lucent, one of the most
widely held stocks in the nation, by nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the new company, which has yet to be named, will focus on
the corporate networking market, Lucent will concentrate on
equipment and services for telecommunications providers. Analysts
said that market was growing at a rate of 20 percent a year as
telecommunications companies race to provide new data, voice and
video services, while the corporate market is growing only 4 to 8
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent shares closed at $68, up $8.50, on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares have been depressed since a disappointing
earnings report in January.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher T. Stix, an analyst with S.G. Cowen, upgraded Lucent
to a buy from neutral, saying the spinoff would help increase the
growth profile of the company and improve operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that by spinning out the slower-growing parts of
its business, shares of Lucent should trade at a multiple similar
to those of companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or Nortel Networks
Corp. Even after Wednesday's gains, Lucent shares trade at about 87
times earnings; Cisco's shares trade at 181 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lucent, itself spun off from AT&AMP;T in 1996, remains the
world's largest maker of telephone equipment, it has fallen behind
Nortel in the fast-growing optical networking market and has been a
less aggressive competitor than Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff ``breaks the company into two pieces that are easier
to understand for the Street and that really had no synergies at
all,'' said Paul Sagawa, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein.
``Lucent was getting labeled as an `old world' company.
Post-spin-out, Lucent will get 75 percent of its revenues from
new-world technologies, like optical networking, Internet
infrastructure and wireless communications. We see the
post-spin-out Lucent as a really clear growth story.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it would spin off the three businesses _ PBX's, or
telephone switchboard systems; Systimax structured cabling; and
local area networks _ to shareholders. Lucent expects to complete
the divestiture by the close of its fourth quarter, which ends
Sept. 30. The new company will employ 34,000, or about 23 percent,
of Lucent's 150,000 workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Donald K. Peterson, currently Lucent's executive vice president
and chief financial officer, will become president and chief
executive of the new company, which will be based in Basking Ridge,
N.J. Henry B. Schacht, a former Lucent chairman and a current
member of the board, will be the new company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this move, Lucent will focus on extending its leadership
in the highest-growth areas of communications networking,'' Richard
A. McGinn, Lucent's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``Lucent will concentrate greater resources on
fast-growing areas like optical networking, Internet
infrastructure, wireless, semiconductors, optoelectronics,
Web-based enterprise solutions linking private to public networks,
and professional design and consulting services for service
providers and enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinn said the new company would also have a strong position in
a growing market. ``The newly created enterprise company will rank
No. 1 or 2 in nearly every market in which it competes,'' he said.
``We are making the strategic choice to establish two financially
strong and independent companies that will deliver greater value to
our share owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent posted anemic revenue growth of less than 1 percent for
its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 31; revenue totaled
$9.905 billion, up from $9.842 billion during the period a year
earlier. Including one-time charges and profits _ like merger
expenses and gains from sales of investments _ Lucent had earnings
of $1.25 billion, or 38 cents a share. That was less than half the
$2.544 billion, or 80 cents a share, reported for the period a year
earlier, including one-time events.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn said in a conference call Wednesday that Lucent's sales
would rise about 17 percent this year. In Cisco's fiscal year ended
July 31, revenue rose 43 percent, to $12.2 billion. &QL;

FIEDLITY LAUNCHES WEB INSURANCE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Fidelity Investments bought the domain name
insurance.com in 1994, it wasn't clear how, or if, the mutual fund
giant would use the site. But it was a bargain at $70.
</P>
<P>
   The name sat on the shelf for two years, along with a host of
other sites Fidelity had snapped up. The idea was reviewed in
Fidelity's new-business group in 1996, then tabled again. Selling
insurance online was still a far-out concept, years behind the push
for stock and fund sales over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Lou Geremia, a former Fidelity executive who had written the
business plan for insurance.com, never forgot the opportunity he
felt the firm had tucked away in its pocket. He went back to
Fidelity last June, this time to the firm's venture arm, and
pitched the strategy anew.
</P>
<P>
   This time it worked, and the result could only make insurance
executives and bankers green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Wednesday launched the site, which is meant to be an
objective research tool and quote service for consumers.
Ultimately, insurance.com wants to be an online insurance agency,
where customers can buy life, auto, health, and other coverage for
the same fees agents get from insurance companies when they sell
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to become their insurance agent,'' Geremia said. He
thinks the service will appeal to Fidelity's customers, 15 million
strong, many of whom buy investment products without a broker or
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a threat to independent agents, it is.
Agents are facing pressure on all sides, as insurers such as John
Hancock Financial Services Inc. sell policies both on the Web and
through its sales agent force. Fidelity already sells term life
insurance and annuities directly on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the site will also team up with insurance companies that use
agents. Insurance.com can earn fees for referring business to
insurers; in such transactions, a consumer might be linked up with
an agent working for the insurer selling the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Eyler, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, said he
expects 10 percent of consumers to buy auto insurance online within
the next five years. As many as 50 percent will likely research
their insurance purchases online, he said, which could lead to
future sales. He estimated that in states where rates are
competitive, consumers could save an average $500 each by shopping
for car insurance on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity is hardly alone in the online insurance sales
business. In addition to the traditional insurers who are selling
on the Web, there are other third-party firms offering quote
services, such as Quotesmith.com and InsurQuote.
</P>
<P>
   Geremia said insurance.com aims to distinguish itself from the
competition by focusing on life events, such as buying a house,
getting married, or having a baby. The company has hired Forefield
Inc., a group of financial advisers and lawyers, to provide its
content and advice on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an electronic filing cabinet, where consumers can
keep track of all of their policies, whether purchased on the site
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Observed Forrester's Eyler: ``There are a lot of very smart
(companies) who know this is the way to go. Success is going to
depend on who has the best advertising and the best fulfillment of
service.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, you won't find the Fidelity name or logo prominently
shown on the insurance.com page. In small letters at the bottom, it
states that the company is a Fidelity affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no Fidelity products on the site currently. We really
do want to be perceived as an independent and unbiased
marketplace,'' Geremia said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity backing of the venture is significant, however.
Fidelity is financing it, just as it did with other ventures in its
Fidelity Capital group, including Boston Coach and Community
Newspapers. The board is made up entirely of Fidelity executives,
including Rod Rhoda, head of the investment firm's insurance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Geremia said the plan is to add outsiders before insurance.com
goes public. An initial public stock offering could come by the end
of this year or early 2001, he said.

 &HT;    Murderous mom Susan Smith still enthralls nation
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Smith's mother says her daughter is so mentally ill that
she has attempted suicide while serving a life sentence for murder
in South Carolina for the ghastly 1994 drownings of her two young
sons in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has mutilated herself, cutting her arms and wrists with
whatever object she could find,'' Linda Russell writes in ``Susan
Smith My Daughter,'' scheduled for publication April 1. ``Several
times she has been put on suicide watch for her own protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Department of Corrections would not comment
on Smith's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Brentwood, Tenn., author Shirley Stephens collaborated with
Russell in the latest of several books examining why Smith would
drive to the top of a boat ramp at night, release her car's
emergency brake and send her sons to their deaths strapped in their
safety seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still as simple as everybody still wants to know why,''
said Andrew Yex, a Los Angeles producer working on a Learning
Channel documentary, one of several media projects recently
produced or in the works about the crime that shocked America.
</P>
<P>
   Production crews for MSNBC, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Tampa television station WTSP recently interviewed people around
Union, S.C., who were involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than five years since Smith, now 28, confessed to
killing Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months, after lying to
investigators for nine days that a black man had carjacked her
children. A hometown jury found her guilty of murder in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Pope, the state solicitor who sought the death penalty
against Smith, said he believes ``the shocking nature of the crime
by the last individual you'd expect'' perpetuates the fascination
with the textile town tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like the girl next door; she was their mother,'' said
Pope, who during the trial tried to prove that Smith killed her
sons in hopes of winning back Tom Findlay, the son of a rich Union
textile manufacturer. In ending their relationship, Findlay wrote
Smith that he wasn't interested in a ready-made family.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Russell granted interviews to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution in 1998 has she talked publicly about the
tragedy. She has yet to appear in a television interview since her
daughter's conviction, explaining recently, ``I am not going to be
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who visits her daughter regularly in the Women's
Correctional Institution in Columbia, said prison officials haven't
placed Smith on suicide watch for about two years. On Jan. 8, 1997,
the state Corrections Department charged Smith with possession of
contraband, which Russell said stemmed from her possessing a razor
blade with which she had cut herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan is all over that, I think,'' said Russell, explaining
that she believes a combination of therapy and anti-depressant
drugs is helping her daughter, but with a painful side effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more well you become, the more sick you realize you
were,'' Russell said. ``She needed that before she came to the
point where she could forgive herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said collaborating on the book ``emotionally drained me,
but it helped me. I think Susan is reaching the point where she is
considering a book of her own. I think she has got to do something
to find peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, 65, said Russell contacted her in 1996 about writing a
book, at the suggestion of a member of her daughter's defense team.
After Stephens' literary agent was unable to sell the manuscript,
partly ``because it wasn't sensational enough,'' Stephens said she
decided that the publishing company she owns with her husband,
William, would publish Russell's story. The company, Authors Book
Nook, is selling the 304-page book on its Web page,
www.authorsbooknook.com. The book follows a predictable course,
relying on court transcripts to explain the boys' disappearance and
the nine-day national manhunt for them. Russell provides fresh
insights and details such as her daughter's request from jail that
her mother buy two red roses and place them on the coffin the boys
shared.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for the boys dragged on, Russell recalled how she
lost control. Grabbing her daughter by the shoulders, she pleaded,
``I want the children. Do you know where they are? Have you hurt
them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama,'' she said, ``You know I would never hurt Michael and
Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell believed her. She writes, ``I do know I simply couldn't
entertain the thought that the daughter I love dearly and the
mother who loved her children with all her heart could harm her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, waiting for a jury to decide whether Smith should
be electrocuted, Russell recalled how family members gathered in a
courthouse room and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, I didn't know what I would do if she were
sentenced to death,'' Russell writes. ``It was too horrible to
contemplate. It is one thing to execute a vicious criminal; it is
quite another to execute someone with a mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's defense lawyers argued that she was suffering from
severe depression the night in September 1994 that she drove to
John D. Long Lake outside Union. Her lawyers called witnesses who
related the devastation of Smith's father's suicide when she was a
child and her sexual abuse by her stepfather, Beverly Russell.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 book, ``Beyond All Reason _ My Life With Susan
Smith,'' David Smith admitted to cheating on his wife, while
accusing her of cheating on him. ``People all over the world sneak
around on each other, lie to each other. ... But no one kills their
children. No one murders their babies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Russell's book contends that David Smith, after his wife
filed for divorce on grounds of adultery, embarked on ``an unholy
quest for revenge that pushed her to the edge and cost him his
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell writes that she shares the blame for not recognizing the
seriousness of her daughter's mental illness, dating back to her
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   After her father's suicide, Smith showed suicidal tendencies,
once taking so many aspirin her stomach had to be pumped out. In
hindsight, Russell writes that she assumed incorrectly after each
incident that her daughter had gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   Russell relates how she and her first husband, Harry Vaughan,
argued in front of their two sons and daughter. Russell regrets not
ever explaining to them why she and her husband had separated. She
never provided her daughter with details of how Vaughan died from a
self-inflicted shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
   Smith apparently learned from her parents' reticence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept her fears and sadness to herself,'' Russell writes.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Smith showed a suicide note to a teacher, who showed it
to Russell. She writes, ``What concerned me tremendously was the
fact she was talking with other people about things that should
have been kept within our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when Smith was finishing high school, Russell
writes that she shared with her daughter a puzzling encounter with
a man she didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Once while swimming, the man said he felt as though he could
stay forever underwater where ``everything was so pretty and
peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell writes she told her daughter that drowning seemed ``an
easy death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered,'' Russell writes, ``if this was the reason she
chose water for her suicide attempt and the children's deaths.''

   DOBROSIN, Yugoslavia _ Just across the boundary line from
Kosovo, guarded more visibly now by U.S. troops in watchtowers,
armed Albanians wearing uniforms of a new branch of the Kosovo
Liberation Army are training in Serbia for a battle that the West
does not want them to have.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers and leadership are a mystery, but on Wednesday
fewer than 20 men, wearing a mixture of German and American
fatigues, did exercises in a muddy field with their weapons,
including a heavy machine gun on a tripod.
</P>
<P>
   On their arms they wear a cloth badge of red, black and yellow
that looks exactly like that of the supposedly disbanded and
disarmed Kosovo Liberation Army. The only difference is their name:
the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, all towns
in Serbia itself, although their populations are largely ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Their commander here would not give his name, but said he had
been wanted by the Serbs since the mid-1980s. The men said they
were all former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
guerrilla army of Kosovo Albanians that fought for independence
from Serbia, and villagers said they were local people.
</P>
<P>
   They are acting ``to defend their country, their village and
their land,'' said Zymer Zajidi, 30, a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials of the United Nations and the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, known as KFOR, say the men appear to
be members of the Albanian rebel group who refused to turn in their
weapons and now want to ``liberate'' what they call ``Eastern
Kosovo,'' where at least 70,000 Albanians live in the arc from
Medvedja in the north to Presevo in the south.
</P>
<P>
   By ordering the ambushing of Serbian police officers and
sometimes the intimidation of Serbian farmers, the leaders of this
new army ``are hoping that the Serbs will retaliate with excessive
force against civilian populations and create a wave of outrage and
pressure on KFOR to respond,'' said a U.N. official. ``It's
explosive and dangerous, and we hope KFOR uses restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German who commands the peacekeepers,
said in an interview that he had pushed the Americans hard to seal
the boundary between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia. And in fact,
less than two weeks ago, the Americans moved checkpoints and built
observation towers on the boundary line.
</P>
<P>
   One overlooks this village from a hill, while listening
equipment and U.S. tanks line the ridge above Dobrosin. The
Americans are now at the edge of a 3-mile demilitarized zone in
which the Serbian police can operate, but not Serbian troops with
heavy weapons, a zone in which Dobrosin sits.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt is adamant in saying his troops will not support any
new insurgency in Serbia. Still, the situation is not always so
clear on the ground. A U.S. sergeant first class, commanding this
checkpoint, said, ``We're just here to make sure the locals are
OK.'' But when asked what he could do if the Serbian police
returned and the locals were not OK, he shrugged and said, ``There
ain't much we can do, unless they shoot at us.''

   &UR; MORE KNOCKS FROM AN UNGRATEFUL VISITOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Abother in a series about visitors' reactions to us:  &UR; Dennis &LR; 
 &UR; Cavagnaro  &LR; forwards a report on Silicon Valley from the London
Evening Standard, in  &UR; Zoe Williams &LR; ' column, ``Slut's Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says she liked the sound of Silicon (high technology,
enormous riches) Valley (lush and verdant). However:
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is no single place, she writes. ``There are six
bits of it. They're all called things beginning with `San,' apart
from the ones beginning with `Sunny,' and actually they're not
places at all, they're splodges of nothingness along a big nothingy
motorway. If you want to find geeks, you have to really want to
find them, even before you factor in the cast-iron truth that they
never go out, and they get their social kicks in Internet chat
rooms with pretend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams describes visits to several South Bay bars, at which
she is ultimately approached by one ``geek'' (her term) or other.
``Sooner or later, they will start to address some information to
their feet _ it will be well-thought-out, knowledgeable and have
your best interests at heart. It will crucify you with boredom ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a Good Time Girl in the world who could have a
good time here,'' the columnist concludes. `` &UR; Mary Poppins  &LR; would
lose her marbles. It's no place for a slut.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KATHIE LEE: THE IN-DEPTH REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kathie Lee Gifford &LR; 's decision to drop out of ``Live With Regis
and Kathie Lee'' has been analyzed by gossipists all across the
country:
</P>
<P>
   - The announcement came ``at a time when it appeared tensions
were building on the air between Gifford, 46, and Philbin, 65, over
the sizzling success of his game show, `Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,' '' said the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Kathie Me, who is obviously feeling very upstaged by co-host
Reege ... is planning to park her butt in her summer manse (in
Nantucket) once her TV deal runs out in July. Oh, joy,'' said the
Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   - Gifford carefully announced her decision on Tuesday, opined
MSNBC, because of the printing schedules of the supermarket
tabloids, so they couldn't ``rehash all her problems with Frank.
... This way, they'll have to wait until the next week, and then it
might be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   - But what will she do in TV retirement? Gifford, who has
written books on child-rearing and a 1995 memoir, ``Listen to My
Heart'' (Hyperion; $13.95), may combine a literary career with
mothering. ``Kathie Lee seems to be a very involved mother,'' wrote
a customer reviewer who calls the book ``heartwarming'' on
Amazon.com. ``She is not afraid to discuss Cody's bowel functions
in detail. Everything about Cody is cute. Every detail. A must-have
book!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Reading of the Israelis' decision to make public the prison
diaries of war criminal  &UR; Adolf Eichmann &LR; , Personals turned to the
Web to see if a copy of the journals was already online. The Alta
Vista search engine found no copies of the diaries, but a notice
from CD Now invited the browser to ``own the music of the Eichmann
diary.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Miss USA contest this year _ and the next two _ will be
held in Gary, Ind., a city that ``is thriving,'' said  &UR; Maureen &LR; 
 &UR; Reidy &LR; , president of the Miss Universe Organization, which runs the
pageant. The event is owned by  &UR; Donald Trump &LR; , who owns a casino
and hotel in Gary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Donna Karan &LR; , a friend of  &UR; Jo Schuman Silver &LR; 's, attended
``Beach Blanket Babylon'' last weekend and didn't mind the
giant-sized knockoff of her DKNY beret, worn by the show's Monica.
Karan vowed to come back with her pal,  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; , who she
thought would love the ``BBB'' parody of the singer as egomaniac.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Andrew Demcak &LR;  saw a sign on a Berkeley construction site
that said ``No Parking Zone Until After Feb. 30th.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year I've lost 33 pounds. ... I am a fat person
and I accept my fat completely, so I feel strange jogging to lose
weight. It's almost as if it is something which is against my
values to want to be less fat. But I am a diabetic and I had to
reduce my blood sugar, which is connected to being fat. Most people
are proud when they lose weight. I find myself apologizing.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; David Crosby &LR;  to Personals &LR; ' &LR;  spy  &UR; Baird Jones &LR; , at an HBO
premiere party in New York for ``If These Walls Could Talk 2.''

 DOBROSIN ,  Yugoslavia: at us.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soldiers can return fire, he said. Wouldn't that encourage
the Albanians to fire on the Americans if the Serbs came, to make
it seem as if the Serbs were shooting? He shrugged again, saying he
could not provide his name.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans now have checkpoints and towers along the three
main roads into the area, officials said. But despite those, it was
a simple matter to drive over primitive country roads of mud, ice
and snow in a four-wheel-drive vehicle and avoid any checkpoint, in
a region that has for centuries been used by smugglers and drug
runners.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters were nervous Wednesday, even brusque, and would not
give their names or allow photographs of their faces. In fact, they
did not really want journalists around at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday they shot up a car belonging to the office of the
U.N. high commissioner for refugees, which had come from Belgrade
and apparently did not stop at one of their checkpoints. An
Irishman was wounded in the leg, and the fighters, embarrassed and
worried about a possible Serbian response, took the man and his
Serbian interpreter to the Americans near the watchtower for
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters say their organization was born on Jan. 26, when
two local farmers here, brothers named Isa and Shaip Saqipi, 36 and
32, were killed by the Serbian police as they were returning to the
village from cutting wood in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers say the Serbs of the militarized police were on an
operation, with full uniforms, flak jackets and heavy weapons,
including a tank. Some seven Serb policemen were in the village,
with 40 more in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time the Serbian police have shown up here,
but this village of about 1,500 now has fewer than 30 families
living in it, the rest having fled into Kosovo, staying with
friends and relatives in Gnjilane, Malisevo and Podgradje, where
the Americans have another checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here with one eye open,'' said Halim Hasani, a teacher
in the village. ``We're always ready to flee.'' He said people were
afraid now even to go shopping in Bujanovac, because the Serbian
police had checkpoints along the road and sometimes turned the
villagers back.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1945 until today, the municipality of Bujanovac has not
given a penny to the village of Dobrosin,'' Hasani said. And he
said that except for the police, no Serbian official, whether tax
collector or postman, had shown up in the village for two years.
``Really we're in Kosovo and we want to be in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of course they are not in Kosovo. Hasani asked, ``If the
Serbs attack in Dobrosin, can the Americans come to help?'' Told
that the answer seemed to be no, he seemed very thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the presence of the fighters might bring the
Serbian police back to Dobrosin, he went silent, then said,
``Possibly.'' He stopped, then added hopefully: ``But they attack
no one. They are only working to defend our land.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes these fighters do attack, and they are being
disingenuous when they say their group was born with the deaths of
the Saqipi brothers a month ago. The Serbian police have been
complaining of attacks on Serbian villagers around Medvedja since
the late summer, and U.N. officials in Pristina say the group has
been active in Dobrosin at least since November.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January three Serbs were killed in nearby Mucibaba,
closer to Presevo, and the Serbs moved at least four units of the
Interior Ministry's militarized police to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ambushes of policemen have intensified, with one killed and
three wounded last weekend. One Albanian fighter was also killed in
a shootout. And the Serbs say they found a bomb over the weekend in
a courthouse in Bujanovac, which they blamed on ``armed Albanian
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on moderate or loyal Albanian politicians in Serbia have
also increased, including the murder last month of Zemail Mustafi,
the Albanian vice president of the Bujanovac branch of President
Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   And more Albanian civilians _ nearly 300, according to the
United Nations _ have gone into Kosovo from Serbia proper since
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``KFOR is being played with by these guys,'' said a senior U.N.
official, who is assuming that their leadership is based in Kosovo
and tied to parts of the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the official says he believes that the leaders
are associated with Rexhep Selimi, who headed the rebel group's
ministry for public order and security. But no one seems to know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. James Shufelt, in an interview at the U.S. military
headquarters at Camp Bondsteel, said: ``The concern here isn't that
the Serbian police will come across, but that Albanian attacks on
the Serb police and army will inspire a response great enough to
cause public clamor for a KFOR response.''
</P>
<P>
   His commander, Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, said: ``The Presevo valley
is a significant concern for us. We are making a significant effort
to control the activity running across that boundary. I don't
believe we can ever fully seal the border between Serbia and
Kosovo. But we have sent a clear message that any cross-border
insurgency will not be tolerated or supported.''

   At the same time, he said, ``we've gotten some very good
feedback that the people of Dobrosin feel better because of our
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, but perhaps emboldened, too. The fighters are exercising
within sight of the U.S. watchtowers, and say that once, when the
Serbian police were near the village, U.S. helicopters flew
overhead and the Serbs withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Vahid Sylejman, 39, a villager, said he was sure the Americans
would come to their rescue if the Serbs came again. ``Why else are
they there?'' he asked, pointing to the tanks on the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Zajidi said: ``We have a kind of protection from the Americans.
If they were not on the hill, no one would be left in this village
at all.''

 &HT;    Bush looking more relaxed, confident
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ George W. Bush was a much different candidate when he
came to town this week than on his first campaign trip here last
year _ or for that matter, in the frenzied days before the South
Carolina primary a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was already asleep in a Gwinnett County hotel Tuesday night
when news arrived of his victory in Washington State, topping an
evening when he also won big in Virginia and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed with his front-runner status for the first time,
Bush beamed at a large and enthusiastic rally the next morning at
the Gwinnett Civic Center. This was billed as a ``One on One with
Gov. Bush,'' and the candidate took a dozen questions from the
floor, town-meeting style, on subjects ranging from OPEC to this
week's shooting of a six-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But this big, boisterous event could also be viewed as the
moment when the presidential campaign diverged from the intimate,
retail style of the early, spotlighted states and into a series of
mass-media, multi-state contests that begins with Titanic Tuesday
next week and culminates in the General Election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Retail politics, and John McCain, have left their mark. Bush's
organization is still buttoned-down, as it was before the jolting
competition with McCain forced changes in its approach, but the
candidate has become vastly more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   After taking questions at the rally Bush ducked into a side room
for a series of short one-on-ones with local television, strolled
into the media filing room for an availability with the traveling
press, sat around a table for another 20 minutes with some local
print reporters, then zipped downtown for an editorial board at the
Journal-Constitution before flying away, feet propped on the
bulwark of his charter jet, still answering questions from an
Austin reporter who sat at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates give a lot of interviews, but McCain's
continuous dialogue with the media has clearly had an effect on
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the media room, Bush carefully walked around a question about
whether he could be friends with McCain after the tough exchanges
they've had in the past few weeks. Later, asked jokingly about
McCain as a running mate, Bush answered in a way that showed the
grudging respect he has learned for his opponent - and the distance
that has grown between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game in politics, if I really wanted to play the game,
would be, 'Oh, John would make a great vice president.' But I mean,
he deseves better than that. This is a man who's still got a shot
to be the president,'' Bush said. ``The old-style politics is to
start talking about your opponent in terms of the vice-presidency,
and I'm not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he meant McCain still had a shot this year, Bush said,
``He's a viable candidate until he says, I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was in the spirit of not taking things for granted
that he came to this rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia's an important state, not only in the primary but in
the general election,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of this setting for a rally the week before Titanic
Tuesday probably had less to do with shoring up support in Georgia
than it did with its effectiveness as an image of a wider national
campaign, one less susceptible to the ravages of retail and the
tire burns of the Straight Talk Express.

 &HT;    Rocker's teammates seem willing to forgiveBy Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The teammate that John Rocker insulted will be
waiting for him. So will the core of influential veterans who make
the Braves clubhouse ``a doctor's office.'' And the manager he
accused of lying.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker has had 10 weeks to formulate his comments for this
morning's reunion with his old team, and the meeting could
determine his future with the Atlanta Braves. But his teammates
might never be in a more receptive mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the one to judge anybody,'' said first baseman Randall
Simon, whom Rocker disparaged as a ``fat monkey.'' ``We are all
sinners and we all make mistakes sometimes, and we are all forgiven
the sins we have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why not forgive the man and give him another chance and
hope that chance will be appreciated, so he can go about his
business and try to treat people better?''
</P>
<P>
   The team held a 40-minute players-only meeting Wednesday to
address that precise issue. Tom Glavine and a few other veteran
players stood up to assess Rocker's return and to make sure, as one
said, ``We're all on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, this is good,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``It's better
to get this over with. Go through hell now. Then when the season's
starts, it'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduction of Rocker's suspension did not come as a surprise
to the clubhouse. His confrontation with the team is an inevitable
part of the process; a shortened punishment just hastens it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for us,'' shortstop Ozzie Guillen said. ``I'm not
surprised. Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have him show up and explain everything,'' catcher
Eddie Perez said. ``I think he will. He needs to talk a little with
everybody and be the same guy that we know from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something John's going to have to deal with a lot more
than anybody else in here,'' reliever Terry Mulholland said. ``I
know it's a hot issue with a lot of people, but I don't see where
his actions would have any effect on me or any other people. We all
have choices in life to make, and you hope everybody makes the
right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there something specific that the Braves want to hear from
Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there have to be changes,'' Tom Glavine said. ``I'm
not sure what they are. But there are issues that go beyond what
was mentioned in that article.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see what he's going to do,'' Simon said. ``How he's
going to handle himself and all those things. Let's see what
happens. I hope everything goes fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Can John Rocker make it right with the team he maligned?
   ``Yeah, I think so,'' Perez said. ``We need him to be quiet
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker? Quiet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's going to be tough,'' Perez said. ``But we have a
lot of old tapes around here.''

   &UR; MORE KNOCKS FROM AN UNGRATEFUL VISITOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Abother in a series about visitors' reactions to us:  &UR; Dennis &LR; 
 &UR; Cavagnaro  &LR; forwards a report on Silicon Valley from the London
Evening Standard, in  &UR; Zoe Williams &LR; ' column, ``Slut's Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says she liked the sound of Silicon (high technology,
enormous riches) Valley (lush and verdant). However:
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is no single place, she writes. ``There are six
bits of it. They're all called things beginning with `San,' apart
from the ones beginning with `Sunny,' and actually they're not
places at all, they're splodges of nothingness along a big nothingy
motorway. If you want to find geeks, you have to really want to
find them, even before you factor in the cast-iron truth that they
never go out, and they get their social kicks in Internet chat
rooms with pretend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams describes visits to several South Bay bars, at which
she is ultimately approached by one ``geek'' (her term) or other.
``Sooner or later, they will start to address some information to
their feet _ it will be well-thought-out, knowledgeable and have
your best interests at heart. It will crucify you with boredom ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a Good Time Girl in the world who could have a
good time here,'' the columnist concludes. `` &UR; Mary Poppins  &LR; would
lose her marbles. It's no place for a slut.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KATHIE LEE: THE IN-DEPTH REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kathie Lee Gifford &LR; 's decision to drop out of ``Live With Regis
and Kathie Lee'' has been analyzed by gossipists all across the
country:
</P>
<P>
   - The announcement came ``at a time when it appeared tensions
were building on the air between Gifford, 46, and Philbin, 65, over
the sizzling success of his game show, `Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,' '' said the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Kathie Me, who is obviously feeling very upstaged by co-host
Reege ... is planning to park her butt in her summer manse (in
Nantucket) once her TV deal runs out in July. Oh, joy,'' said the
Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   - Gifford carefully announced her decision on Tuesday, opined
MSNBC, because of the printing schedules of the supermarket
tabloids, so they couldn't ``rehash all her problems with Frank.
... This way, they'll have to wait until the next week, and then it
might be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   - But what will she do in TV retirement? Gifford, who has
written books on child-rearing and a 1995 memoir, ``Listen to My
Heart'' (Hyperion; $13.95), may combine a literary career with
mothering. ``Kathie Lee seems to be a very involved mother,'' wrote
a customer reviewer who calls the book ``heartwarming'' on
Amazon.com. ``She is not afraid to discuss Cody's bowel functions
in detail. Everything about Cody is cute. Every detail. A must-have
book!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Reading of the Israelis' decision to make public the prison
diaries of war criminal  &UR; Adolf Eichmann &LR; , Personals turned to the
Web to see if a copy of the journals was already online. The Alta
Vista search engine found no copies of the diaries, but a notice
from CD Now invited the browser to ``own the music of the Eichmann
diary.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Miss USA contest this year _ and the next two _ will be
held in Gary, Ind., a city that ``is thriving,'' said  &UR; Maureen &LR; 
 &UR; Reidy &LR; , president of the Miss Universe Organization, which runs the
pageant. The event is owned by  &UR; Donald Trump &LR; , who owns a casino
and hotel in Gary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Donna Karan &LR; , a friend of  &UR; Jo Schuman Silver &LR; 's, attended
``Beach Blanket Babylon'' last weekend and didn't mind the
giant-sized knockoff of her DKNY beret, worn by the show's Monica.
Karan vowed to come back with her pal,  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; , who she
thought would love the ``BBB'' parody of the singer as egomaniac.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Andrew Demcak &LR;  saw a sign on a Berkeley construction site
that said ``No Parking Zone Until After Feb. 30th.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year I've lost 33 pounds. ... I am a fat person
and I accept my fat completely, so I feel strange jogging to lose
weight. It's almost as if it is something which is against my
values to want to be less fat. But I am a diabetic and I had to
reduce my blood sugar, which is connected to being fat. Most people
are proud when they lose weight. I find myself apologizing.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; David Crosby &LR;  to Personals &LR; ' &LR;  spy  &UR; Baird Jones &LR; , at an HBO
premiere party in New York for ``If These Walls Could Talk 2.''

 &HT;    Rocker in his own words
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's suspension of Atlanta Braves reliever
John Rocker was cut in half Wednesday, his fine was slashed from
$20,000 to $500, and he will be allowed to participate in spring
training workouts beginning today in Florida. Rocker will face his
teammates for the first time since his disparaging comments in a
December issue of Sports Illustrated outraged many. Rocker wrote
the following opinion column for The Atlanta Constitution prior to
Wednesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   By John Rocker
</P>
<P>
   In a December issue of Sports Illustrated, I made several
comments of which I am ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   In reading the article, I realized that in three major areas, I
have hurt people. It was unintentional, but nevertheless, there was
damage done.
</P>
<P>
   First, I used foul language, and I owe an apology to the
children and families who see baseball players as role models. I've
been a poor example. I was not raised that way, and that kind of
language is not used where I come from.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, my comments concerning several different groups have
left people wondering if I'm a racist. I'm not a racist, although I
can understand how someone who did not know me could think that.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-year period, at my invitation, my home in Macon has
been a home where players from different ethnic groups and
countries have lived for as long as five months and as short as two
weeks. The family of my best friend is first generation Lebanese.
His grandfather came through Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, my actions do not support the racist label, but
my thoughtless words do show that I sometimes lack the
understanding to see the problems that other people face. I
apologize to all of those my careless and unkind comments have
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my comments concerning my team were totally
unprofessional and out of line. To the Braves management, to Bobby
Cox and to the entire team, I am extremely sorry for the stress and
confusion I have brought on the entire Braves organization.
</P>
<P>
   An apology is no more than just words unless it is followed by
actions. I hope in this coming year I may somehow redeem myself. A
97-year-old widow of a Baptist minister sent me this piece of
advice, a motto she suggests I say daily: ``Thoughts unexpressed
sometimes fall back dead, but even God himself can't kill them when
they are said.''
</P>
<P>
   I think I need to take her advice.

 &HT;    Compton may have heart of a champion
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Erik Compton has a pulse pounding for two people today
at the Doral-Ryder Open. It's for him and for a girl who gave him
the heart that has been beating in his chest for 8 years.
</P>
<P>
   They will be on the first tee at Doral's Blue Monster today,
making history. Compton, a redshirt freshman at the University of
Georgia, becomes the first heart transplant recipient to play in a
PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   They have had other firsts: Compton is the first
heart-transplant recipient on a full scholarship in NCAA history
and the first to play in the U.S. Amateur. Some day, the way things
are progressing, Compton, 20, will become the first
heart-transplant recipient to earn a PGA Tour card.
</P>
<P>
   And that will be just one more reason to thank the girl for
allowing him to live. Eight years ago, when a virus attacked
Compton's heart and enlarged it to where it would not beat
normally, he needed the transplant before his 13th birthday. Now he
is changing shoes in the same locker room with Greg Norman, David
Duval and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down inside, when I go to bed every night, I'm not
thinking so much about the golf, that here I am with somebody
else's heart,'' Compton said. ``I think about that somebody is not
here, and I am here right now. It's something special that I keep
with me, and I think that keeps driving me to do better. . . . I'm
taking the person who is with me this week on a very nice journey,
I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   That the journey begins in Miami makes it magical. It's where
Compton watched the Doral tournament since he first picked up a
club as a youngster. He worked with Jim McLean, the resort's
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being out here with my friends, running around
getting autographs and trying to find balls in the lake,'' Compton
said. ``I am in awe, very much in awe, about these guys. Now, I'm
sitting here on the third hole (in a practice round), and Norman's
helicopter is flying over. . . . I'm sitting in the locker room,
and these guys are running around in their boxers. It's a lot
different. It's something I never thought I would see.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton's invitation to the event came because he is a Miami
native and a heart-transplant recipient. But if he can contain his
nerves, he might make the cut. Compton, 20, occasionally hits
300-yard drives; he averages around 280. He also knows Doral's
greens so well that he can strike putts without even checking the
break. He's a former American Junior Golf Association player of the
year. In November, he won the Golf World collegiate tournament at
Palmetto Dunes on Hilton Head Island, shooting 13-under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm putting and hitting, I feel really confident,''
Compton said. ``I think that I have a good chance of making the
cut. (But) I could go out there and be nervous and shank it all
around the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton has earned respect from other golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him last year and he's a great kid,'' said Curtis
Strange, who awarded a courageous athlete award to Compton in
Chicago. ``That's the kind of stories we need out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton has strived for normality at every opportunity. He faces
an annual biopsy and twice daily takes anti-rejection pills, which
can break down his immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just like any normal 20-year-old,'' Compton said. ``I go
out there and say the wrong things and jump around and be a punk,
but when I look at everything at the end of the day, I really
realize how far I've come with my game and my life. . . . It
doesn't make a huge amount of difference in my life if I miss a
small putt to lose a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Gilbert, of Rochester, N.Y., will be at Doral this week.
Gilbert, who also has a heart ailment, met Compton at the U.S.
Amateur at Oak Hill in 1998. Their families ate dinner together
that week, have communicated through e-mails and will be reunited.
Compton lost his first-round match that week, but gained a lot more
through Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had seen he in some articles right after his surgery,''
Compton said. ``He had lost hope, and he was ready to give up. He
lost a lot of weight, and he was very depressed about his body. But
just going through a lot of the things I went through, it helped
him to see me on the golf course making something happen and
starting a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The life this week isn't too shabby, Compton noted. After months
in a hospital, a 20-year-old college kid gets pretty wired about
somebody cooking up a free stir-fried lunch in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing,'' he said, ``was going in the locker room and
shaving with a Mach III razor.''

 &HT;    Ruling nearly as offensive as comments
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shyam Das doesn't have the final say, you know.
</P>
<P>
   If he did, John Rocker would be getting off very light: a 14-day
regular-season suspension and a $500 fine. Geez, the suspension is
only four days longer than a Yankees outfielder named Jake Powell
got in 1938 for racist comments, and you'd think that the
subsequent 62 years of enlightenment would have raised the
appropriate sanction more than that. And the $500 fine, well,
that's a joke, considering that baseball usually doesn't consider
any dollar figure with fewer than five, six, seven or eight zeroes
worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred dollars. That's almost as offensive as Rocker's
comments. I mean, he will make 10 times that much per inning.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, none of this is surprising. In recent decades,
baseball arbitrators almost always have overturned or reduced
suspensions and fines. If Das had done otherwise in his
baseball-arbitrating debut, it would have been the biggest upset
since the '69 Mets. And in fairness to Das, it's not necessarily
unreasonable to conclude that if Roberto Alomar was suspended only
five days for spitting in an umpire's face, maybe Rocker shouldn't
have been suspended for a month, as he was by Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Alomar should have been suspended for two months. So
Rocker benefits, I guess, from a system as crazy as his comments.
Which is not to say he's necessarily getting off as light as it
seems. Because, remember, Das doesn't have the final say. ...
</P>
<P>
   Oh, his word is final about the suspension and the fine. But
Rocker's future in baseball _and, more immediately, with the Braves
_ will be decided by his teammates, his manager, his general
manager. Now that Das has ruled, their deliberations begin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this probably is the venue where the case should have
been adjudicated from the start. The heart of the matter is not
whether Selig wants Rocker in the game in April. It is whether the
Braves want him in their uniform.
</P>
<P>
   And their decision, unlike Selig's, will not be subject to
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   There are real problems with Rocker remaining a Brave, from the
abstract issue of clubhouse chemistry to the concrete issue of
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His chances of sticking around are enhanced by his teammates'
calm, pragmatic professionalism _ one of the things, come to think
of it, that he ripped in that Sports Illustrated article. But no
one expects reassimilation to come easily or quickly.
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz says there is a market for the tarnished closer
if he chooses to trade him, a possibility the GM pointedly does not
minimize. But because Rocker is young, talented and, by baseball
standards, cheap, there has been no rush to unload him.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Braves argued against a reduction in Selig's
sanctions, Das' ruling that Rocker can report to spring training
probably benefits the team. Better, surely, to deal with the mess
when the games don't count than when they do.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rocker ruckus is far from over, the final Rocker verdict
far from reached. And there's nothing more Shyam Das can do for
him.

 &HT;    Atlanta groups want Rocker out
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A coalition of metro Atlanta community groups is
calling for the Braves to trade John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The group blasted an arbitrator's ruling on Wednesday that cut
Rocker's suspension in half and dramatically reduced his fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been insulted by this arbitrator. And I hope and I
pray that the Braves would do the right thing,'' said
</P>
<P>
   the Rev. Timothy McDonald, president of Concerned Black Clergy.
``John Rocker needs to be traded. Send him to Montreal or wherever,
make him a foreigner... Trade John Rocker and make all of us
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition represents about 30 local organizations, including
clergy, AIDS groups and various ethnic and cultural groups. It
formed after Sports Illustrated published a story in which Rocker
made comments offensive to gays, blacks, Asian-Americans and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference yesterday, the coalition said it has asked
the Braves for a face-to-face meeting with Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to look in the face of the coalition members who
represent the diversity which is Atlanta and say to them, 'I'm
sorry,''' Atlanta City Councilman Derrick Boazman said. ``We hope
that he would be contrite. Whether or not his heart is as dark as
his comments, we don't know that. Only John Rocker would be able to
answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb NAACP President John Evans said he is shocked Rocker is
getting off with such a light punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any of us ... were working for somebody and made all kinds
of raunchy comments, we would be fired immediately,'' Evans said.
``So what we are finding here is that profits still govern the
kinds of decisions that ought to be made on some moral and
character basis in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. McDonald said the arbitrator's ruling sends a dangerous
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a message that says hatred is okay. Racism is OK. Bigotry
is OK. Homophobia is OK,'' he said. ``You can call people what you
want to call them, you can say what you want to say, you can label
any way you want to label, and in our society, it's okay. We'll
give you a slap on the wrist.''

MCCAIN OPPOSES BREAST CANCER RESEARCH, BUSH SAYS IN AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, Mo. _ Unleashing perhaps his most withering attack
yet on Senator John S. McCain, Governor George W. Bush Wednesday
released a new radio advertisement accusing McCain of opposing
breast cancer research, using a female cancer survivor to
underscore his claim that McCain ``opposes many projects dedicated
to women's health issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second radio spot, being released in the critical March 7
primary state of New York, features Geri Barish, a woman who
introduces herself as having fought to find a cure for breast
cancer for 20 years. Barish starts out by saying she ``had thought
of supporting John McCain in next week's presidential primary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I looked into his record. What I discovered was shocking,''
she says. ``McCain opposes funding for vital breast cancer programs
right here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The language of the ad _ which accuses McCain of opposing
funding for the North Shore Long Island breast cancer project, the
New York University program in women's cancer and unspecified
breast cancer mapping programs _ is among the toughest used by the
Bush campaign thus far. Previous Bush ads have criticized McCain's
own negative advertisements and various parts of his campaign
platform, but never his Senate record in such a sensitive or direct
way.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the advertisement marked a new political
thrust by Bush: Pushing McCain to the right.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly six weeks, Bush has cast his opponent as a
pseudo-liberal, linking his name to President Clinton's and
dismissing his tax cut plan and campaign finance reform program as
friendly to Democrats. This ad, however _ released in moderate New
York six days before the primary and aimed at both women and
liberal New York City _ suggested Bush is now shifting to head off
support for McCain in the more independent-minded political climate
of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides immediately objected to the ad's claims. He has
voted for medical research funding increases, and supports
legislation that would double the budget of the National Institutes
of Health, spokeswoman Nancy Ives said. And she said McCain has
``supported increased funding and the treatment of life-threatening
diseases, including breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's opposition is not to the projects themselves but to the
``pork barrel'' methods in which they were inserted into unrelated
federal funding bills, she said. The NYU funding was slipped into
an Energy Department bill; the Long Island North Shore funding was
part of a Labor Department bill. ``In these two instances, McCain
is not objecting to these programs based on the merits,'' Ives
said, but was ``objecting to the process by which unauthorized
programs are inserted, in the dark of night, into these spending
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the information in the ad was
taken directly from McCain's Web site. He said that Bush, in
contrast to McCain, ``would support funding for those programs.''
And Fleischer scolded McCain for trying to claim the title of
crusader against pork-barrel spending without taking responsibility
for the programs that would be cut as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the woman in the ad calls McCain's opposition to breast
cancer research ``shocking.'' And in the end, she concludes: ``Next
Tuesday, John McCain won't have my vote. We deserve a candidate
with a record on women's issues we can trust.'' The only mention of
Bush is at the very end, when a voiceover says the ad was paid for
by his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ives said the ad was ``the Bush campaign trying to distort John
McCain's record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign is well aware of John McCain's 18-year
record of trying to cut down on wasteful spending, and they know he
has a solid record of support for increased funding for NIH,'' she
said. ``They've seen the latest polls in New York where John McCain
is ahead of Bush. This is a desperate tactic that the voters of New
York simply won't stand for.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    This week's column is not devoted to a menu, though it would
take very little to turn it into one. It is, instead, a wonderful
technique that one of the country's best chefs, Patrick O'Connell
of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va., has devised for
making risotto in two stages so that when you truly want a virtual
no-work dinner, you can have something as satisfying as risotto and
have it ready in 15 minutes.
 &HT;    My quick version, that has often appeared in this column, takes
25 minutes and you really have to hustle to get it done. Using
Patrick O'Connell's technique you can make risotto on the weekend
for two workday nights and leave very little work for the last
minute.
 &HT;    Add a salad and you've got dinner.
 &HT;    You can use this recipe to make any kind of risotto you like.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make-Ahead Risotto with Fennel and Mushrooms or with Asparagus
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Time: 30 to 40 minutes (15 to 20 minutes for the make-ahead
risotto; 15 minutes to finish the dish)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For the make-ahead risotto:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    8 cups no-salt added chicken stock
 &HT;    1-1/2 tablespoons olive oil
 &HT;    Small onion to yield 1 cup chopped
 &HT;    2 cups arborio rice
 &HT;    
 &HT;    1. In a small saucepan, bring 4 cups of chicken stock to a boil.
Reduce heat, and keep stock at a simmer.
 &HT;    2. Heat medium nonstick saucepan until it is very hot; reduce
heat to medium and add oil. Add onion, and saute until onion is
translucent. Add rice, and stir until it is evenly coated.
 &HT;    3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Slowly add simmering stock, about
1 cup at a time, stirring until rice absorbs liquid. When all stock
has been absorbed, remove risotto from heat. Immediately spread
onto a baking sheet to stop the cooking, and cool as quickly as
possible; rice grains will still be a bit raw at center.
Refrigerate uncovered until chilled, then transfer to a covered
container. Partly cooked risotto may be refrigerated for up to 2
days.
 &HT;    To finish half the risotto with fennel and mushrooms:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    About 1-1/2 to 2 cups no-salt added chicken stock
 &HT;    1 large bulb fennel or 2 small
 &HT;    2 teaspoons olive oil
 &HT;    4 ounces whole mushrooms, any kind
 &HT;    Few shakes salt
 &HT;    Freshly ground black pepper
 &HT;    
 &HT;    1. Trim bottom of fennel and remove tough outer portions and
top. Slice remaining bulb thinly.
 &HT;    2. Heat a nonstick pan large enough to hold the fennel and
mushrooms until it is very hot. Add 2 teaspoons oil and saute the
fennel until it is almost tender, a few minutes.
 &HT;    3. Heat 3 cups stock to a simmer.
 &HT;    4 Wash trim and slice the mushrooms and add to the fennel as it
cooks.
 &HT;    5. Spoon half of the partially cooked risotto into a saucepan
large enough to hold all the ingredients.
 &HT;    6. Add 1 cup stock and cook over medium-low heat, stirring until
stock is absorbed. Repeat until stock has been absorbed and the
risotto is tender. Stir in the fennel and mushrooms; season with
salt and pepper and serve.
 &HT;    You may not need all the stock. The risotto should be creamy,
the rice tender but firm.
 &HT;    Yield: 2 servings.

minutes; remove asparagus when they are tender but still firm.

&HT;     BUSH SAYS MCCAIN SHOULD BE `ASHAMED' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By Dan Freedman

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Fresh from his clean sweep in three states'
Republican primaries, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday he
plans to win ``every state I compete in'' and that his opponent,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., should be ``ashamed'' for portraying
Bush as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hop-scotched across the country, appearing at rallies in
suburban Atlanta, and St. Louis and Springfield in Missouri before
flying off to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Los Angeles, Bush, McCain and former ambassador
Alan Keyes will hold their final debate before ``Super Tuesday,''
the major round of 13 Republican contests including the big prizes
of New York, with 101 delegates, California with 162, and Ohio with
69.
</P>
<P>
   McCain backed out of the debate last weekend citing scheduling
conflicts but jumped back in after his defeats Tuesday in
Washington, North Dakota and Virginia. McCain will take part in the
debate via satellite. Bush too had thought of joining the debate
through satellite but decided Wednesday to attend in person.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly in an upbeat mood, Bush greeted supporters in Duluth,
Ga., northwest of Atlanta, saying, ``You might notice I walked in
with a little spring in my step.'' He added that this week's
primary victories ``helped us take a step closer to ending the
Clinton era in Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign staff hailed the Tuesday primary results,
particularly in the state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its progressive tradition and concentration of
independent-minded voters, Washington ``was a state supposedly made
to order for McCain,'' Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes said.
``Obviously, that did not occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has 178 Republican convention delegate votes, according
to his staff's calculations, and McCain has 103. Needed to win the
nomination: 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   In California a Los Angeles Times poll Wednesday showed Bush
ahead of McCain among Republicans 47 percent to 26 percent. In the
state's so-called ``blanket'' primary all candidates, regardless of
party, appear on a single ballot, and the top vote-getter will win
the ``beauty contest.'' But delegates to the national nominating
conventions will be selected on the basis of party-member votes
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Bush-McCain race is a seesaw. A Zogby
International poll Wednesday showed McCain leading Bush by 44.1
percent to 38.4 percent. Last week, the same poll showed Bush
leading McCain 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on winning New York,'' Bush told reporters. ``I plan on
winning every state I compete in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush trails McCain in Connecticut, Vermont and Massachusetts
polls, but he leads the Arizona Republican in Georgia, Ohio and
Missouri. All hold primaries next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush showed throughout the day that he was still sensitive to
the fact that McCain surrogates have called Catholic voters and
criticized Bush for speaking at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina and failing to reject the school's anti-Catholic
statements.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday McCain went further by labeling two strong Bush
supporters, Christian conservatives Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell, as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the McCain tactics, Bush told reporters after the
Duluth rally, ``I don't like to be called an anti-Catholic bigot.''
As governor of Texas, Bush said, he has ``a record of being
inclusive. The people of Texas know my record. People know my
heart. And John ought to be ashamed of running that kind of
campaign. It's going to backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush cited Catholics quoted in the Boston Globe as backing him
in his dispute with McCain. Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said
that Bob Jones University is a regular stop on the Republican
campaign circuit and that no previous candidate who spoke there has
been accused of anti-Catholic bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that place (the university) has some strange views,
but that doesn't mean one shouldn't go there and speak,'' Law told
the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush has sought over the last few days to refute
any perception that by appearing at the school and not mentioning
its anti-Catholic sentiments as well as its ban on interracial
dating, he was condoning those practices.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend he apologized for failing to bring them up during
his Bob Jones appearance. On Tuesday he spoke at a hastily arranged
rally in Cleveland at the Fatima Family Center, a Catholic charity.
And on Wednesday, Bush addressed supporters at a rally at St. Louis
University, a Jesuit institution.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after the Duluth rally, Bush mocked
McCain's strategy of aiming first to attract independents and
Democrats and then branching out to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a Republican primary,'' he noted. ``I intend to
consolidate the party, consolidate the base and reach out to
independents and Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the fatal shooting of a 6-year-old girl by a
6-year-old boy at a Michigan school on Tuesday, Bush said the
parents or guardians of the boy who did the shooting ``need to be
held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor asked, ``How did this boy get a gun?'' He called
for technology that would ensure that only a gun's owner could fire
it, and said owners should use trigger locks. But he added that he
didn't want ``the trigger-lock police knocking on people's doors''
and therefore opposed making the locks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed making such locks mandatory. The
issue is a sensitive one for Bush because his victory strategy
involves carrying his home state of Texas and other states in the
South and West where gun enthusiasts vote in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Wednesday that technology is on its way to perfecting
a mechanism that unlocks a trigger only when matched, for instance,
to the fingerprints of its owner.

&HT;     COUSIN TELLS SENATE THAT ELIAN'S FATHER WANTS BOY TO STAY IN
U.S.

   WASHINGTON _ The Miami woman who has been caring for 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez said Wednesday the boy's father has indicated that
he wants his son to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Marisleyis
Gonzalez said Juan Gonzalez has suggested in several phone
conversations that he does not want the boy sent back to Cuba. She
said the father told her during one call: ``I appreciate everything
you're doing for my son. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell
you? Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleyis Gonzalez, who is Elian's cousin, said she believes
the father was trying to tell her that he wants her to fight to
keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, Juan Gonzalez has publicly said that he wants his son
returned to his homeland. He has appeared with Cuban leader Fidel
Castro appealing for the repatriation of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who was 5 years old at the time, was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat
carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that the
boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, has sued the
INS in federal court in Miami, challenging the agency's decision.
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore plans to hear arguments in
that case next week.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carol Florman said Attorney
General Janet Reno ``continues to believe that this child belongs
with his father who continues to have sole legal authority over the
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the attorney general also ``hopes the case can be
resolved quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress is considering legislation sponsored by Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., that would confer citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Judiciary Committee, the estranged daughter
of Fidel Castro urged the United States not to deport the boy to a
``land dominated by fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot allow this unilateral victory on behalf of a
dictator,'' said Alina Fernandez, an out-of-wedlock daughter who
fled Cuba in 1993 and is one of her father's fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the rights of parents and family ``do not exist''
under Castro's Communist government and that Elian Gonzalez's
family in Cuba is being ``used'' and ``manipulated'' to generate
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
favors Mack's bill, said the dispute over Elian is not just a
``custody matter, but a case where one of the options considered is
returning this child to one of the last prison nations in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the panel's senior Democrat,
said the committee was making a mistake trying to intervene in an
immigration case that is before a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole matter has been politicized from the beginning, and
it's time we let the courts do their job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez did not make the trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to school and trying to lead a normal life,''
Roger Bernstein, the lawyer for the boy's Miami relatives, said in
a statement. ``We want a resolution to this.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the boy's grandmothers came to the United States to
appeal to Congress to allow Gonzalez to be returned to Cuba.

 &HT;    No arrest of minister so far in Holyfield case
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Creflo Dollar, leader of the 20,000-member
World Changers Ministries, is a wanted man.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County sheriff's deputies have been instructed to put
Dollar in the county jail until Dollar agrees to give a deposition
in the Evander Holyfield divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Wednesday afternoon, no arrest had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County Superior Court Judge Ben Miller had found Dollar
in contempt in December after Dollar refused to provide information
about how much money ex-heavyweight champion Holyfield gave to
World Changers church in College Park.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar appealed, but the Georgia Supreme Court dismissed the
appeal Friday on a technicality. Miller told deputies to find
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Lecora Bowen, Dollar's lawyer, could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She previously said Dollar should not be deposed because of the
separation of church and state, pastor-parishioner privilege,
several state and biblical laws. Dollar has given sermons in which
he vowed not to release the information because he doesn't want to
facilitate a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Miller sent a letter saying Dollar would not be jailed if he
called Janice Holyfield's lawyer and promised to appear at a
deposition. John Mayoue, Janice Holyfield's lawyer, said Wednesday
he had not heard from Dollar's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   State law says a person can be jailed up to 20 days and fined
$500 for civil contempt. According to the Georgia attorney
general's office, a judge can renew the contempt citation.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar ruffled feathers last year when he gave $1,000 checks to
100 Fulton County police officers. The officers were ordered to
return the money but about half the officers have not done so,
police said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello lobbied Congress
Wednesday to join a White House-led effort that could clear the way
for the former Spanish colony to become the nation's 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello urged members of the House and Senate to approve a
White House request for $2.5 million to underwrite a landmark
federal effort to end Puerto Rico's ambiguous political status as a
U.S. commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said the support of leading Republican and Democratic
presidential candidates for Puerto Rico's self-determination offers
an ``opportunity'' to resolve the nagging political status
``problem'' that dates back to the U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico
after the Spanish-American War in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a willingness and a sensitivity that maybe this is a
time to finally resolve this century old problem,'' Rossello told a
news conference following meetings on Capitol Hill. ``I think the
elements are there for a significant movement this year and a
conclusion during the next term to this conundrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, a pro-statehood Democratic ally of President Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, made
no direct reference to the growing Hispanic political influence
that is being courted in key electoral states such as New York,
Texas, California and Florida by the Democratic and Republican
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossello noted that during his meetings with seven members
of Congress on Wednesday, ``certainly we've impressed upon them the
fact that this is a year where significant advancement can made.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said he hopes that a White House conference with
members of Congress and political leaders from Puerto Rico could
begin deliberations shortly that ``would result this year in a
definite recommendation'' on a binding plebiscite in Puerto Rico
giving voters a clear choice between statehood, independence and
continuation of commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-statehood advocates contend that three prior referendums on
Puerto Rico's political status were torpedoed because the ballot
was either too confusing or it included the option of ``none of the
above.''
</P>
<P>
   As a commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth and
subject to conscription into the armed forces but they do not vote
in presidential elections or pay federal income taxes. Puerto Rico
receives more than $11 billion annually in federal payments. The
island's 3.8 million residents are represented in Congress by a
popularly elected non-voting delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico, with a population about the size of South Carolina,
would qualify for two U.S. senators and seven members of Congress.
Puerto Rico's population is larger than 25 states that have voting
representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House-backed effort to update Puerto Rico's
commonwealth status was a little noticed sweetener in a deal that
Rossello struck with Clinton on Jan. 31 to permit the Navy and
Marine Corps to resume modified combat training on the small Puerto
Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello is working with the Clinton administration to rally
public support in Puerto Rico behind the hard-won compromise _ a
deal that ignited the largest protest march in a generation in San
Juan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on Vieques calls for Washington to provide $40
million in economic development assistance to the island's 9,300
residents, reduce noisy military training and hold a binding
referendum on future Navy use of the island by February 2002. The
Navy owns two-thirds of the Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   If residents vote for the Navy to leave, the Navy will withdraw
by 2003. If residents vote to permit resumption of live-fire combat
training, the plan calls for the White House and Congress to
provide another $50 million in assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello is banking that winning a binding referendum to settle
Puerto Rico's political status with the United States will quell
opposition to the deal he struck on Vieques. The two-term governor
steps down next January.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico gained its commonwealth status in 1952 after half a
century as a colony.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to revamp Puerto Rico's political status have a
checkered history. In the last referendum, on Dec. 13, 1998, voters
confronted five options, including statehood, independence, ``free
association,'' commonwealth status and ``none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 50.3 percent of the voters opted for ``none of the above,''
defeating the 46.5 percent of the voters who favored statehood.
Independence won 2.5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the referendum was not binding. Legislation to
hold a binding referendum had stalled in the Senate after winning
approval in the House in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier referendum on Nov. 14, 1993, voters rejected
statehood and voted to retain the island's existing political
status. Commonwealth status won 48.4 percent of the vote; statehood
won 46.2 percent of the vote.

   The breadth of Rossello's meetings on Capitol Hill underscored
the bipartisan appeal of an issue that is of keen interest to many
Hispanic voters, including the Puerto Rican voters in New York who
can cast ballots in the Senate race that pits Hillary Clinton
against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello consulted on Wednesday with Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, and House
Resources Committee Chairman Rep. Don Young, R-Ark. _ two key
Republicans with jurisdiction over U.S. territories. Rossello also
met with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a prominent
Cuban-American with influential ties in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And he met with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.;
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., the chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee; and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., chairman of
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said last week that the Navy is
hoping that public support will rally behind the compromise so that
the federal government can avoid rounding up and arresting the
several hundred protestors camped on the 899-acre bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the Navy and Puerto Rico began last April
19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly dropped two bombs on a target
range observation post, killing civilian security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, and wounding four other civilian workers on the
range. The outcry in Puerto Rico forced the Navy to suspend
training Atlantic-based forces on the target and maneuver range
that had prepared U.S. combat forces for every overseas operation
since the outset of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate forced the Navy in December to prepare the
aircraft carrier battle group led by USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for
operations in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf without combat
rehearsals on Vieques. The Navy plans to use many of the same
alternatives in April to prepare the aircraft carrier battle group
led by USS George Washington for deployment overseas.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola plaintiffs appeal ruling on severance benefits
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The plaintiffs in a racial discrimination lawsuit
against Coca-Cola appealed Wednesday a court decision affecting
severance benefits for laid-off employees.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys are contesting a ruling by U.S. District
Judge Richard Story that allowed Coca-Cola to require laid-off
employees to give up their right to sue the company if they want to
receive enhanced severance benefits. As a result, black employees
who want more lucrative benefits must sign a release form waiving
their rights to participate as a plaintiff in the discrimination
suit, or as a member of a class, if the judge certifies the case as
a class action down the road.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, current and former African-American employees are
scheduled to meet at St. Philip A.M.E. Church in Decatur to discuss
this issue with plaintiffs' attorneys. Some employees believe it is
unfair for the company to include this case in the release form.
Instead, they believe it should be specifically excluded.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola said it is merely following standard operating
procedure of giving increased severance benefits to limit its
future exposure in litigation. Laid-off employees would still be
entitled to regular severance benefits if they don't sign the
release form.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the plaintiffs started the clock ticking on
when they will have to file a motion supporting their attempt to
make the suit a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys said they will file before May 30 their
legal brief to represent about 2,000 black salaried employees in
the United States. Eight current and former employees filed the
suit, alleging that Coke has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   After plaintiffs' attorneys file their brief, the company has up
to 75 days to file its response. Then the plaintiffs have up to
another 75 days to file a reply to the company's brief.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, if both sides use all of their allotted time, it
would take months of legal briefs before a hearing could be held on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, has ordered both sides to try to resolve the
suit in settlement talks.

BUSH SAYS HE SUPPORTS TRIGGER LOCKS FOR GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after one first-grader fatally shot another at a
Michigan elementary school, gun control re-emerged as an issue in
the 2000 presidential campaign and forced Texas Gov. George W. Bush
to strike a delicate balance on the politically sensitive issue of
childproof trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people use trigger locks,'' Bush told reporters in
Atlanta Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican front-runner has often said he supports urging
gun makers and buyers to voluntarily add trigger locks. But
Wednesday a spokesman said he ``would have no problem'' signing
legislation mandating the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped short, however, of actively calling for such a
measure, a version of which has been stalled in Congress for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's muddy position reflects the difficult political pressures
he faces as he tries to appease core Republican conservatives and
respond to a growing public call for gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and his main rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, were
pressed on the issue Wednesday as new details emerged about a
six-year-old boy near Flint, Mich. who found a loaded gun in his
home and brought it to school Monday, where he shot and killed a
six-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a horrific succession of school shootings
nationwide -- and the shooting of five more people at two
Pittsburgh restaurants Wednesday -- is bringing new scrutiny to the
candidates' positions on how to control gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even before this week, events like last year's massacre at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., have had voters and
candidates unusually focused on the issue, said Robert Spitzer, a
political science professor at the State University of New York and
author of ``The Politics of Gun Control.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the presidential campaign has reflected the fact
that voters have become ``more pro-gun control'' over the past 10
years, as the country becomes less rural and a smaller percentage
of households own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Democratic and Republican candidates still differ
sharply in their approaches to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, both Vice President Al Gore and former
Senator Bill Bradley have talked frequently about measures to
toughen background checks, require trigger locks on new guns, and
create new licensing and registration systems to better track
firearms used in crimes and require that owners learn gun safety
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports the registration of all new guns and licensing for
new gun buyers, who would be required to pass safety tests. Bradley
would ``go much farther,'' in his words, by requiring that every
one of an estimated 65 million handguns in the country be licensed,
and that even current owners pass safety courses and be registered.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also criticized Gore for casting votes against gun
control measures while he was in Congress, going so far as to say
Gore was ``pro-gun'' during the 1970s and 1980s. But Joe Sudbay,
political director for Handgun Control in Washington, D.C., said
the two Democrats ``are very similar'' in their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The real distinctions, Sudbay said, are between the Democrats
and the Republicans, whom he described as ``both very pro-gun and
both strong supporters of the gun lobby, especially the National
Rifle Association.'' Neither Bush nor McCain, for instance, has
proposed new licensing and registration measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sudbay said that Bush has shown no record of supporting gun
control measures in Texas, and encouraged the passage of two major
bills supported by the gun lobby. One measure allowed Texans to
carry concealed handguns with a permit. Another barred Texas cities
and counties from filing civil lawsuits against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Wednesday the Texas governor
prefers to enforce existing gun laws rather than pass new ones, and
believes strong leadership can quell gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor recognizes that solving this problem is more than
about laws, it's about condemning these acts of terror and changing
our culture,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan added that Bush supported a measure passed by the
House of Representatives last year to close the so-called ``gun
show loophole'' allowing convicted felons to purchase firearms from
unlicensed dealers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Sudbay said that provision, supported by the NRA, would
require only cursory checks and would allow dangerous felons to
slip through undetected.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Bush was praised in an NRA fund-raising
letter last October which read, in part: ``Al Gore never met a gun
control proposal he didn't like -- while George Bush has staked out
just the opposite position.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudbay described McCain's record as almost indiscernable from
Bush's. While McCain has slightly moderated his positions on guns
in recent months -- dropping his one-time opposition to mandatory
trigger locks, for instance -- he has rarely supported gun control
measures during his 18 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, voted against a gun-show background check
last spring. The senator also opposed the gun-control lobby's two
most prized achievements: a 1994 federal ban on assault weapons
ban, and the 1993 Brady Bill, which required a five-day waiting
period and background check for handgun purchases from licensed gun
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how we tell a law-abiding citizen who wants to
purchase a firearm for the purpose of protecting his or her family
that they must wait to exercise that right,'' McCain says on his
campaign web site.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday both Bush and McCain say they support developing new
technology to create ``smart guns'' that can only be fired by their
owner, possibly through the use of computer chips or fingerprint
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Bush questioned whether trigger-lock laws could be enforced,
however, fretting about ``trigger lock police knocking on peoples'
doors, saying, `Show me your trigger locks, please?' .''
</P>
<P>
   But Sudbury said the criticism misses the point, because trigger
locks would be added in gun factories, not private homes.

   BOSTON _ Seeking to shore up the damaged credibility of Big Dig
manager James K. Kerasiotes, Governor Paul Cellucci Wednesday
announced he would hire a major national accounting firm to oversee
the massive Central Artery contruction project and report directly
to one of Kerasiotes' political foes in the administraiton.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, having just returned from Washington where he lobbied
federal officials on behalf of the project, said he has directed
Secretary of Administration and Finance Andrew S. Natsios to hire
the firm in order to address a ``credibility problem'' created last
month by Kerasiotes' surprise announcement of a $1.4 billion cost
overrun on the $12.2 billion Big Dig project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure we have double-checked and triple-checked
the numbers,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios, who has clashed with Kerasiotes and advised Cellucci to
fire him, said the administration decided it was necessary to hire
an outside firm to guarantee ``full disclosure'' of the Central
Artery's financing.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is looking for recommendations on how to save
money and for more accurate projections of future costs, including
change orders that he said are responsible for much of the current
cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look at the process they use to make our own
determinations about what costs are, what the change orders are,
and how you price them and keep track of them,'' Natsios said.
</P>
<P>
   Jermey Crockford, Kerasiotes' chief of staff at the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, said Kerasiotes has put aside
past differences with Natsios and plans to cooperate with the firm
Natsios hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's absolutely a good idea,'' Crockford said. ``We
have a lot of eyes on us now, but it's obviously complicated so the
more people who come in and see if they have a different take on
what we're doing and ideas about what steps might be taken, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockford said Kerasiotes met Wednesday with Cellucci to discuss
plans to enhance Natsios' oversight of the project, and later met
with members of the Legislature now considering a Cellucci proposal
to close the $1.4 billion funding gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking to legislators to reassure them that things are
going forward, that work is continuing, and that we think we have
our hands around the problem,'' Crockford said, ``and he cited this
as something he thought was a very good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerasiotes' assurances were delivered the same day
legislators learned that all of the bids submitted for one of the
project's final contracts came in at least $21.8 million over
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money,'' Cellucci said, adding that
administration officials will try to make up for it by having the
new accounting firm identity areas where costs can be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's move to hire his own accounting firm comes as a team
of federal auditors has descended on Boston to audit the project's
past accounting practices, a move spurred by Kerasiotes' failure to
deliver on repeated guarantees that the Central Artery/Ted Williams
Tunnel project would be completed ``on time and on budget.''

 &HT;    Canadian men win major tournament
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How 'bout them Canucks, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Many of their countrymen have been fretting about the national
malaise in ice hockey _ the loss of NHL teams to U.S. cities and
the increasing prominence of European players. Meanwhile, the
Canadian men's soccer team on Sunday won its first major tournament
in a sport as unfamiliar in the Great White North as it is to many
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Canada claimed the CONCACAF Gold Cup by stunning Colombia 1-0 in
Los Angeles. A qualifier for the World Cup only once, in 1986,
Canada rounded up most of its roster from the lower divisions of
English and Scottish soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Canada qualified for the quarterfinals on a coin flip, then
shocked Mexico in overtime and pulled off a milder upset of
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago in the semifinals. Goalkeeper Craig Forrest, who
plays for West Ham in the English Premier League, was named MVP
after producing three shutout victories and stopping a penalty
kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a complete outsider,'' said Holger Osieck, Canada's
German coach.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico and the U.S. -- both eliminated in the
quarterfinals -- are favored to get two of the region's three World
Cup spots, Canada's performance should make the CONCACAF qualifying
more competitive. One of the interesting sporting stats in that
country is that it has more registered soccer players than hockey
players.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad kicks off global 2002 World Cup qualifying Saturday
against the Netherlands Antilles by searching for a new coach.
Bertille St. Clair was fired Tuesday, and three starters have been
dropped from the team, as well, in light of their Gold Cup showing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., eliminated in the quarterfinals, plays Tunisia next
Sunday in a friendly at Birmingham's Legion Field.
</P>
<P>
   Feyenoord ends Lazio bid
</P>
<P>
   Dutch teams have been taking a beating in the European Champions
League this season, but Feyenoord's late rally to defeat Lazio 2-1
in Rome on Tuesday was one of several upsets as second round group
play resumed this week. Jon Dahl Tomasson came off the bench to
score in the 78th and 84th minute as the Rotterdam club ended
Lazio's attempt to tie Ajax Amsterdam -- ironically Feyenoord's
most bitter rival -- with a record 19 straight undefeated matches
in Europe....Real Madrid had been feeling good following last
week's 3-0 Spanish league win over Barcelona, but visiting Bayern
Munich came away with a 4-2 victory on Tuesday....Marseille has
been in miserable form in the French first division, but got a
terrific goal from Robert Pires from a sharp angle on the goal line
to defeat Chelsea 1-0....On Wednesday, Barcelona's Rivaldo and
Mario Jardel of Porto each scored twice, but the Spanish club won
comfortably 4-2....Defending champion Manchester United beat
Bordeaux by a 2-0 count, with Ryan Giggs and Teddy Sheringham doing
the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Vieri injury blow
</P>
<P>
   Inter Milan striker Christian Vieri will miss at least the next
two weeks because of a pulled thigh muscle, putting him out of the
club's critical Sunday match against AC Milan, as well as next
week's contest with Lazio. Inter, in fourth place in Serie A and
seven games behind Juventus, is still missing Ronaldo to a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   England: Shearer to quit
</P>
<P>
   England captain Alan Shearer, citing family reasons along with a
clear decline in his play, will retire from international play
following this summer's European Championships. The Newcastle
striker, 29, has scored 28 times in 57 caps for England but has had
a frustrating run the last two years.... Tranmere Rovers coach John
Aldridge has been charged with misconduct by the Football
Association for allegedly striking Leicester City player Theo
Zagorakis during the Worthington League Cup final on Sunday.
Zagorakis, who was sitting on the bench, applauded a red card
issued to Tranmere's Clint Hill, and Aldridge charged the opposing
sideline in anger. Leicester won 2-1, with both goals coming from
Matt Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Ribbeck feels the heat
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified national-team player has caused a stir this week
for alleging in an interview that coach Erich Ribbeck is losing his
authority with players. The player told Kicker magazine that
several team stars, specifically striker Oliver Bierhoff and
midfielder Jens Jeremies, made ``some very loud comments'' at
halftime of Germany's 2-1 friendly loss to The Netherlands last
week while Ribbeck stayed mainly in the background.

INJURY RASH LEAVES FLYERS SEEING STARS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 FIXES SPELLING OF SAMUELSSON, GOALS FOR THORNTON, (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The Philadelphia Flyers come to town with an injury
list close to, if not, as formidable as any the Stars have
fashioned this season.
</P>
<P>
   Key players who weren't on the ice for the Flyers last night:
captain Eric Lindros (back), center Keith Primeau (rib), 18-year
veteran defenseman Ulf Samuelsson (left rotator cuff) and
defensemen Dan McGillis (groin) and Luke Richardson (right
collarbone).
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' point of view: tsk, tsk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there's no sympathy from this camp for teams that
come in and have a few injuries,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams deadlocked, 1-1, in their other meeting of the
season, in Philadelphia. The injuries definitely soften the
anticipation of on-ice matchups. Stars defensemen Derian Hatcher
(6-foot-5, 230 pounds) and Richard Matvichuk (6-2, 215) trading
paint with Lindros (6-4, 236) and company is as anticipated a
matchup as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know if I look too forward to it to be honest,''
Hatcher said. ``When you know you're playing against him 25
minutes, you have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars get the Flyers on the tail-end of back-to-back road
games. The Flyers lost to the Blues in St. Louis Tuesday night.
\Nsubheds:Thornton fitting in In the past five games, Stars forward
Scott Thornton has two goals and an assist. Putting pucks in the
net had seemed like a lost art to Thornton in Montreal. Two goals
in five games might not seem like many, but consider the 11-year
veteran has only four this season and his career high is 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get your hands above your head for a change,''
Thornton said. \Nsubheds:Langenbrunner plays with pain Each game,
Jamie Langenbrunner plays with a sore neck stemming from a nagging
pinched nerve. The forward has missed 14 games because of it. Last
night was to be his third game back after missing three consecutive
games with soreness.
</P>
<P>
   He endured a crosscheck to the back late in Friday's game
against Chicago that sent him to the ice face-first and kept him
there a few minutes, sending team trainer Dave Surprenant to his
aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult; it wasn't that hard of a hit that got me, so
that was frustrating,'' Langenbrunner said. ``It's more the
irritation in it right now that's causing the problems. It's there
pretty much all the time. You just deal with it.''
\Nsubheds:Lukowich swaps stick Rookie defenseman-turned-forward
Brad Lukowich traded in his thicker hockey stick for a
slimmed-down, graphite model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using \RMike\S Modano's pattern now. It's the exact same
stick; it's unbelievable,'' said Lukowich, who is taking a crash
course in learning how to play forward. He only chuckled when it
was suggested that now he'll score as Mike does, too.
\Nsubheds:Briefly For the third consecutive day, a hip flexor kept
Brett Hull from skating. The injury isn't serious but won't go
away, Ken Hitchcock said. Hull, who is not expected to miss any
games, has earned points in six consecutive games (two goals, six
assists) going back to Feb. 18 at Phoenix. The Stars are scheduled
to visit the White House on March 16 in honor of their Stanley Cup
victory. Hitchcock said center Joe Nieuwendyk, out since Jan. 19
with a separated right shoulder, could return in 10 to 14 days.

 &HT;    Experts urge investors to tread carefully
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Raise some cash, keep an eye on the Federal Reserve
and don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sampling of advice investors are getting these days as
they try to make sense of a stock market torn between technology
bulls and blue chip bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed gets some of the blame for this turn of events by having
raised short-term interest rates in an effort to restrain what it
sees as a potentially inflationary economy.
</P>
<P>
   This has put a dent in financial, cyclical and other
interest-sensitive stocks of the so-called ``old economy,'' which
sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 12 percent in the
first two months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors have flocked to the stocks of chip makers,
telecom companies and Internet service providers that are being
touted as pillars of the ``new economy.'' Those stocks have boosted
the Nasdaq composite more than 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of the Nasdaq outperforming the Dow continued
Wednesday. The Dow rose a mere 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq
advanced 1.9 percent to close at another record, 4,784.08.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of market that confirms the importance of asset
allocation, according to investment advisers and money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, buy technology, but also raise some cash in anticipation of
buying bargain-priced blue chips down the road. And don't ignore
the Treasury market, where yields are attractive now but may not be
in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for investors to have exposure to a wide
variety of asset classes,'' said Jack J. Calhoun Jr., senior vice
president of Capital Directions in Atlanta, which manages $150
million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers also say every investor needs a personal allocation
formula based on factors such as income, age and objective.
</P>
<P>
   Investment advisers see no early end to the dominance of
technology stocks. But they caution investors to approach them with
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to argue that we're in a new economy, but it's not a
given that all the stocks floated by this rising tide will
ultimately prove their worth,'' said Calhoun. ``A few of these
stocks will prove to be worth their lofty valuations, but what
about the other 50-to-60-to-70 percent that don't?''
</P>
<P>
   Another complication in today's market is that market indexes
give investors a misleading picture of what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average stock in the broad market has been in a bear
market for quite some time, despite the fact that the indexes are
making new highs,'' said Robert M. Balentine, chairman of Balentine
&AMP; Co., which provides advice on some $3.5 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that a majority of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stocks are trading as much as 25 percent below their highs. A drop
of 20 percent is generally regarded as a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Balentine thinks investors should hold 5 percent to 10 percent
of their assets in cash to be ready for bargain hunting. He also
said his firm has increased portfolio weightings in small- and
mid-cap stocks and in international stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors typically increase their cash allocation by selling
shares of their least attractive stocks, or by adding new money to
the portfolio, Balentine said.
</P>
<P>
   At Kays Financial Advisory Corp., Scott Kays, president and
founder, recommends investors look seriously at Treasury bonds,
because their attractive yields are likely to disappear soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply of long-term bonds is going to dwindle (due to the
federal budget surplus) and as a result, the Treasury is not only
cutting back on new issues but buying back existing bonds,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   He also contends that the Fed's attack on inflation will be
successful, putting additional downward pressure on bond yields.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury yield has already dropped from a high 6.75
percent in January to 6.15 percent as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be surprised if this window of opportunity lasts six
months,'' Kays said. ``By then, the Fed will have raised short-term
rates at least one more time, and the long rates will be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   But as good as the window of opportunity in the bond market may
be, most advisers say common stocks are still the best long-term
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with a time horizon over five years probably should
have the vast majority of money in stocks. They have outperformed
any other asset class,'' said Greg Paulette, president of Global
Capital Management, which manages $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our suggestion is to be fully invested.''

&HT;     SUIT SEEKS TO END SOME LOGGING PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Environmental and fishing industry groups filed
a lawsuit Wednesday asking a federal court to prohibit certain
logging practices that they allege kill threatened coho salmon in
privately owned forests.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit could affect commercial logging operations from
Santa Cruz County to the Oregon border.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Information Center in Garberville,
the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations and other
groups filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that the California Department of Forestry
does not have strict enough rules and practices to protect the
coho's streams under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant lawsuit of its kind in the nation
regarding private logging,'' said Peter Galvin, conservation
biologist with the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, the federal agency
responsible for protecting the coho, has said repeatedly that ``the
state forest practice rules are inadequate to prevent the continued
decline of coho salmon,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an emperor-wears-no-clothes kind of thing. It's a
public secret that logging on private land is killing coho salmon.
But the state Department of Forestry refuses to take action,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says the state agency has taken no enforcement
action nor rejected a logging plan to protect the silvery coho.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the state approves logging on about 285,000 acres,
the suit says. The largest logging companies are Sierra Pacific,
Pacific Lumber Co., Simpson Timber Co., and the Mendocino Redwoods
Co., which was started in 1998 by the Fisher family, owners of
retail giant the Gap, when they bought land from Louisiana Pacific
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Lucke, the Department of Forestry's assistant deputy
director for forest practice, said for the past two years the state
has been vigilantly looking out for the coho when considering
logging plans. About 1,000 plans are approved every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at each plan individually. In the coho areas, we look
for the habitat requirements of the fish species and mitigate the
plan to protect that habitat,'' Lucke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the National Marine Fisheries Service. They don't
go out on every plan. But when they come up with recommendations,
we include those in the plan,'' Lucke said.
</P>
<P>
   Tharon O'Dell, resources manager of Simpson, said landowners and
forest land managers have added protections since the coho on the
North Coast was listed as threatened in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the suit alleges that coho salmon are injured when the state
agency approves logging plans for timber companies that aren't
strict enough to safeguard the fish's habitat.
</P>
<P>
   When the state doesn't require that loggers leave wide enough
buffer zones of trees along the banks, up to 300 feet, it is
allowing degradation of streams through silting from erosion, the
suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the agency doesn't prevent timber cutting on unstable
soils, which also adds to the erosion, nor stops the logging during
wet winter months when heavy equipment can pack down or create
gullies on the land, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Other activities that harm salmon are gravel mining, dredging
and road building, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Forestry sent out a mass mailing to foresters
about the protections, O'Dell said. ``We've been focusing on
increasing shade and woody debris and decreasing sediment and
stream temperatures.''

 &HT;    Democratic fund-raiser Trie admits
 &HT;    illegal gifts
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Democratic fund-raiser Yah Lin ``Charlie''
Trie testified for the first time Wednesday that he funneled
hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal foreign donations into
the Democratic National Committee's coffers four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Arkansas restaurateur and friend of President
Clinton denied that he was part of a conspiracy by the Chinese
government to influence American politics and that he had acquired
sensitive technology from American businesses as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest joke,'' said Trie during the daylong
hearing before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee.
``If China wants to influence United States government policy, it
hires Henry Kissinger, not Charlie Trie.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the committee, said Trie's
role as a conduit for foreign funds will come back to haunt the
Democratic Party in 2000, particularly Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an election year issue, because Al Gore is right
in the thick of things,'' Barr said. ``This shows that the DNC was
willing to sell its soul to the Chinese military and other foreign
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Trie told the congressional panel that he parlayed his
friendship with President Clinton into lucrative overseas business
contacts in Asia. He admitted that he took money from those
contacts, sending about $1.2 million to the Democratic Party and to
Clinton's Legal Defense Fund. All of that money has since been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the donations, Trie offered donors access to
Clinton and top Cabinet officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barr peppered Trie about his involvement in soliciting a
high-ranking military official in the People's Liberation Army to
join a group of top Democratic donors known then as the Business
Leadership Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 invitation to Lin Ruo Qing was facilitated by Trie,
documents show. Trie said he had no recollection of the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Trie used the hearing to apologize for causing so much trouble
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that I made many mistakes,'' Trie said. ``I got
caught up in the whirlpool of politics and fund-raising and was in
over my head.''

<P>
   Rocker is expected to join the Braves here today when they open
their exhibition season against the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   His work will start in the clubhouse, where he will continue to
try to repair the damage he did in a Sports Illustrated story in
December with his insulting comments against minorities,
foreigners, homosexuals and some of his own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   No meeting is scheduled for Rocker to address his teammates, but
he will have plenty of opportunity to do so in a more casual
setting if he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'm going to react when I see him,'' said
Brian Jordan, one of the more outspoken Braves when the story came
out. Jordan has not talked to Rocker since last season, although he
said he has forgiven Rocker. ``We're just happy to get it over
with,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Rocker said Wednesday he expected that his son would meet
with teammates individually, especially the ones he tried to reach
in the offseason but never talked to. They include Jordan and
Randall Simon, the player Rocker referred to in the article as a
``fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel certain John and Randall will meet just as soon as
possible,'' Jake Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Rocker said she spoke to her son John before he left
Atlanta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very business-like, very serious, very
matter-of-fact,'' she said. ``He's focused on doing what he needs
to do to get everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz said Rocker plans to
address the media in a news conference this morning. The Braves
clubhouse is closed to the media until the Braves begin batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves met for 40 minutes regarding Rocker after their
workout on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've said all along, and it seems to be the case
with other guys, which is I forgive him for what he said,'' Tom
Glavine said before the meeting. ``We'll have to see how things go
from here on out. He still has a lot of bridges to mend. We said
we're willing to give him the opportunity, so we'll see what
happens. We'll see what he does with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves enjoyed a quiet first two weeks of camp, which will
end today, at least for a couple of days. About 50 members of the
media gathered at the Disney complex on Wednesday as word spread of
the Das decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be better off to get him in here and deal with the
initial onslaught now and be done with it, rather than four weeks
from now,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who saved 38 games last season, might not be in the
clear yet. Schuerholz hinted Wednesday that he Rocker still might
be traded. When asked if Rocker would return to his role as closer
April 18, Schuerholz said, ``If John regains his effectiveness and
remains with us, he'll have a very good chance to be our closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz acknowledged that other teams had expressed interest
in Rocker. Among those is believed to be Montreal, who would send
the Braves closer Ugueth Urbina and a pitcher for Rocker and
starter Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who agreed to terms with the Braves on Tuesday for a
one-year deal believed to be worth $350,000, had his fine reduced
from $20,000 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was angry about both reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the decision of Arbitrator Das,'' Selig said
in a statement. ``It does not reflect any understanding of or
sensitivity to the important social responsibility that baseball,
an institution that has endured for more than 100 years, has to the
public. It completely ignores the sensibilities of those groups
maligned by Mr. Rocker and disregards the player's position as a
role model for children.''

G.E. JOINS EFFORT TO ADVANCE FINANCIAL LITERACY 
 A HOME-GROWN ANSWER ON CELLULAR CHARGES 
 `SEINFELD' ACTRESS IN NEW ROLE GIVING ADVICE ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unsure if your financial plan will put your children through
college? Don't really know how a mutual fund works?
</P>
<P>
   General Electric feels your pain. On Tuesday, GE will introduce
the GE Center for Financial Learning, a Web site
(www.financiallearning.com) to battle what GE calls a ``financial
literacy crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will offer advice from an advisory board of outside
experts on subjects like retirement planning and tax management. It
will feature questionnaires that measure consumers' financial
acumen, as well as self-paced courses on investments, mutual funds
and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans are in a real state of denial about their own
financial preparedness,'' said Kathleen S. Gurney, one of the 10
unpaid advisers and the president of Financial Psychology in
Sonoma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The site will have links to GE Web sites, but GE will not sell
or advertise on the site, nor will it market directly to the site's
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So why do it? ``GE is a household name in appliances, but not
when it comes to financial services,'' said J. David Mahder, chief
marketing officer of GE Financial Assurance, the GE insurance and
investment arm running the site. ``Launching this center will help
us leverage the GE brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisers, whose names will appear on the site, are doing
some personal brand tweaking, too. ``GE is a trusted name, and it's
going to help me reach a lot more people,'' Gurney said.

   A Home-Grown Answer On Cellular Charges
</P>
<P>
   As the Federal Communications Commission continues to debate
whether users of wireless telephones should have to pay to receive
as well as make calls, IDT Corp. has taken matters into its own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Hackensack, N.J., IDT is the communications carrier
that pioneered new services including phone calls over the Internet
and call-back _ a service that allows people overseas to slash the
rates they pay for international calls by routing them through the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Without building a wireless network, IDT is now set to introduce
a service that would offer nationwide wireless service while
eliminating the fees cellular customers typically pay for incoming
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all cellular phone subscribers, unlike users of
traditional phones, have to pay when they receive calls. As the
wireless industry trys to become a pervasive competitor to
entrenched local telephone monopolies, it is pressing the FCC to
establish rules that would extend the traditional ``calling party
pays'' billing model into the wireless arena. That would enable
wireless users who sign up for a caller-pays plan to receive calls
free.
</P>
<P>
   But IDT is not waiting. Instead, it has put together a system
that includes a feature that even the major carriers may not have
thought of.
</P>
<P>
   IDT's approach is to buy large lots of cellular subscriptions
from big carriers like AT&AMP;T. But before selling them to consumers,
IDT links the phones to a system of its own making that allows each
phone to have two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One number has a standard area code, and when a call comes in on
that number, the wireless subscriber is billed as usual for the
incoming call. But each IDT phone also has a toll-free number. When
someone using a normal phone calls the toll-free number, they hear
a message that informs them that they will be charged _ typically
10 cents a minute _ to reach the wireless subscriber, who would
then receive the call without fees.
</P>
<P>
   The two-number system could allow a wireless subscriber to give
the toll-free number to most people while giving the receiver-pays
wireless number to close family members, for instance.

   `Seinfeld' Actress in New Role Giving Advice Online
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there life after `Seinfeld?''' That is the question being
asked on Oracle's e-business network, a new online service
announced earlier this month. The answer can also be found there:
Estelle Harris, the actress who played the character George
Constanza's cranky mother on ``Seinfeld,'' is starting a weekly
computer-advice program on the Oracle network.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``Get With It'' and scheduled to begin next
month on Oracle.com, will be a live online talk show, featuring
streaming video of interviews with celebrities and ordinary types.
One program, for example, will include segments filmed on Wall
Street, featuring Harris interviewing technology stock traders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oracle show is just one part of Harris' new career as a
``forward-looking Internet-savvy senior geek,'' as the Oracle site
describes her.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has also started Estelle Harris Productions, a company
focused on the technology needs of people over 50. And she plans in
April to begin operating an independent Web site, to be called Ask
Estelle (www.stelstar.com). In addition to carrying her own advice
column, the site will be a portal and shopping site with
information and products for older people.
</P>
<P>
   Howard E. Wall, chairman of Estelle Harris Productions in Palm
Springs, Calif., said Harris bought her first home computer just a
year ago and was immediately fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harris' producers at Oracle, her online program _
unlike ``Seinfeld'' _ will ``not be a show about nothing.''

WARM JADE STONES BETWEEN YOUR TOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., March 5) 
(jt) 
 By JAN BENZEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone's tired of hearing how tired working mothers are all
the time, so I won't say how tired I was when I set out for a
three-day respite at two resorts on the California coast in
November. Let's just say I was not at all sorry to abandon
fourth-grade homework, a second-grade class dinner, the subway, my
office, two weekend soccer games and the cat box. I was sorry only
to leave the other working parent in our household behind. But not
as sorry as he was.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I needed a psychic tuneup, and a change of scenery. I needed to
see the cliffs of Big Sur. Preferably from a spa.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My sights were set on the Post Ranch Inn, about which I had
heard accolades. Its least expensive room, at $395, was available
for one night. For the other two days, I planned to head north
toward San Francisco and a bit inland, to a brand-new place in
Carmel Valley wine country called the Bernardus Lodge. Its spa
building wasn't finished yet, but it promised full service with
in-room treatments, and a discount on lodging. I booked two nights
at $245, and invited my West Coast friend Tish to desert her
three-child household and join me for as much of my lark as she
could.
</P>
<P>
   People love to cast aspersions on Big Sur, with its touchy-feely
Esalen-tinged aura. Those sniffy about anything new age will not
like it. Those spooked by winding two-lane roads precipitously
carved out of rock above crashing waves will not enjoy getting
there. Big Sur is not for everyone, but to me, it's Shangri-la. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To attempt to describe the rugged drama of that particular
stretch of coast would be futile, especially as I saw it on this
trip, tootling along in my turquoise subcompact rental car, with
the sun a blazing fireball dropping into the Pacific from a sky
streaked with orange, magenta and purple. My only wish was to be
seeing it instead from Sierra Mar, the Post Ranch Inn's gorgeous
restaurant of glass, steel and wood that seems suspended in air
over the Pacific. By the time I got to Sierra Mar, the stars were
out.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been swiftly checked in to my room in the Butterfly House,
where a fire was laid and the refrigerator stocked with gourmet
root beer, Hawaiian flatbread crackers, macadamia nut cookies and
other imaginative treats, all free. The duvet on the big, high bed
was covered in blue denim, and a day-bed-window-seat looked perfect
for an afternoon of reading under a charming half-moon window. On
the bed was a gift: a package of California wildflower seeds.
Binoculars for bird-watching were in a drawer. There was no TV. The
bathtub _ more like a grotto _ was what really won me over. Tiled
with slate (imported from Rajasthan, India), the tub was deep and
plenty big enough for two, with jets. A long window opened out from
the tub onto my small wooden deck. Handmade lavender soap and bath
salts awaited. I lit the fire, tuned into some campy musicals on
the elegant sound system and splashed happily in my pool of steamy
lavender till dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   I was beginning to regret that I hadn't sent the kids to their
grandparents and brought their father along. Post Ranch Inn, like
the slightly more democratic (and also earthily beautiful) Ventana
just across Route 1, is not really a place to go alone. The few
times I saw other guests _ at the restaurant, sitting on a bench
cliffside or in the spectacular infinity pool that offers the
illusion of still water edged by air _ those guests were in pairs,
mostly men and women, some gay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, my solitary state didn't faze the young, proficient Post
Ranch staff. I had a lovely table by a window at Sierra Mar, and an
attentive pony-tailed waiter who was delighted when I chose a glass
of Edna Valley chardonnay from the extensive, award-winning cellar.
I also ordered borscht made from local organically grown beets and
a delicious tuna steak. When I passed up dessert and coffee he
brought me a Chinese takeout carton with four or five perfectly
made little truffles and tarts. The telescope was set up for
stargazing on the deck but I didn't want anything technological to
come between me and the sky.
</P>
<P>
   I woke up in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The inn is on a cliff 1,100 feet above the Pacific. On my way to
the yoga yurt for the 8 a.m. class, I detoured to look out over the
ocean. There was no water to be seen, only the tops of fluffy white
clouds. We were floating in sunshine, above them. There was
absolute quiet. The air smelled of lavender, rosemary and pine.
</P>
<P>
   With daylight I could see what makes Post Ranch so special.
Opened in 1992, it is situated on land claimed in the mid-19th
century by William Brainard Post, a sailor from Connecticut who
became one of the first homesteaders in Big Sur. The founders of
the 30-room inn have maintained ties to the Post family and built
unobtrusively with wood and steel in tones that blend in with the
redwoods and dusky brown hillsides. The most magnificent _ and most
expensive _ units are right at the edge of the cliff, each rounded,
with grass and wildflowers growing over the back and roof, a deck
on the Pacific side and a two-sided fireplace, so the occupants can
splash in their grottos by firelight. The midrange rooms are called
Treehouses _ they're triangular and on stilts. Everywhere the
feeling is of being at camp. Camp with goosedown comforters and
room service.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, room service spurred my only quibble. Since the
breakfast buffet didn't begin until 8:30 and I'm not one for yoga
on an empty stomach, I ordered breakfast, included in the room
price, delivered to my room. It arrived on time. The cut fruit and
fancy granola were perfect, but everything was cold, including the
breads. And of course it was breakfast for two. An unfortunate
trend among hotels these days is do-it-yourself coffee, which I
made with the classy little Krups setup, but wished it had arrived
on a tray in a pot, accompanied by a warm croissant.

JOURNALIST RETURNS; 12 OTHERS MISSING IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky has
returned home safely after a six-week ordeal in Chechnya, but 12
other journalists are still missing in the war-ravaged republic.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, Vladimir Yatsina, a photographer for the official
Russian news agency Itar-Tass, was presumed to have been killed
after witnesses said this week he had been shot by Chechen fighters
fleeing Russian forces in the mountains south of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chechen conflict's environment of ``if you're not with us
you're against us,'' both the separatist rebels and the Russian
forces have been more concerned with propaganda advantage than with
press freedoms or the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, whose blistering reports of Russian military excesses
from the war-zone infuriated the Kremlin, was missing for six weeks
before resurfacing last Friday. He said was detained by Russian
forces on Jan. 16 and repeatedly beaten before being freed early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yatsina's death at the hands of Chechen rebels followed a much
longer ordeal. He was kidnapped last July, held for ransom for
seven months and forced into hard labor, before reportedly being
shot last week, apparently for being unable to keep up with his
fleeing captors.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Babitsky denied Kremlin
assertions that he had been handed over to Chechen rebels in
exchange for Russian POWs. Instead, he said, his captors were
pro-Moscow Chechens, who were tied to the Federal Security Service,
successor to the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
   He described the exchange as ``a poorly planned operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that our security services are unable to
professionally neutralize one journalist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky said his new captors, who later identified themselves
as loyalists of a pro-Moscow warlord named Adam Demiev, took him to
an unidentified home in Chechnya. There, they tried to force him to
make one videotape demanding $2 million ransom from Radio Liberty
and another where he pledged to take up arms against Russia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But while Babitsky's case sparked an international outcry,
Yatsina's plight _ as well as that of the 23 journalists who have
been killed in Chechnya since 1995 and 11 others who are still
missing _ received scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Yatsina, 51, disappeared after traveling to Chechnya on July 19,
1999 to photograph rebel bases for a Canadian newspaper. According
to press reports, he was taken captive by the rebels, who demanded
$2 million for his release. The ransom was later lowered to
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Alisher Orazaliyev, a businessman from the Central
Asian republic of Kazakhstan who had been taken hostage by Chechen
militants and later freed, said Yatsina was shot by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Orazaliyev said Yatsina was gunned down by the rebels, who were
escaping with their captives in the face of Russia's military
onslaught. According to Orazailiyev, Yatsina, who was weak from
forced labor and suffering from a bad heart and weak legs, was shot
for being too ill to walk in the mountains.

yurt with a straight face), a humble round latticework structure
covered, except for a hole at the top open to the sky, with heavy
canvas against the early morning chill. Amber, a young curly-headed
instructor with pretty silver toe rings, was leading three men
(some silver-haired), and four women (some Hollywood blonde), all
looking fit and prosperous even in their sweats, through a good,
fairly strenuous class of slow sun salutations, caterpillars,
downward dogs and child's poses. She ended by laying small, cool
silken pillows filled with fragrant flaxseed over our closed eyes.
``Yoga is like the headlights on your car,'' Amber intoned. ``It
lets you know where to go next.''
</P>
<P>
   Next? I wanted to stay here forever. I wandered serenely past
the 50-foot lap pool and up along one of the several gentle trails
through fields and woods on the 98-acre property back toward camp,
and stopped in at the breakfast buffet to pick up a newspaper. The
bountiful spread included warm vegetable frittata and breads, and
coffee, all made.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs coffee when you're booked for a Big Sur Jade Hot
Stone Massage? Most treatments at Post Ranch can be had in your
room (including couples' tandem massages), but there are also a few
treatment rooms in the lower level of one of the Butterfly Houses
near the small library. Here I met Lauren for 90 minutes of the
most deeply soothing experiences imaginable. She arranged two rows
of smooth black basalt stones, heated in a roasting pan, on her
massage table and had me lie back with my spine between them, which
was far more comfortable than it sounds. Then she began placing
more of them down my chest. ``This one will really feel good,'' she
said, laying a big oval rock on my stomach. ``That's the belly
stone.'' It did. She tucked hot rounded rocks into my hands, then
came the jade in the middle of my forehead for my third eye. (You
have a third eye when you're in Big Sur.) There were even small
jade stones tucked between my toes. Next, Lauren took a hot stone
and used it to massage me, smoothing out my warmed muscles until
they felt unrecognizably relaxed and long. When she had me lie on
the stones on my stomach, I could see through the face cradle that
she was barefoot, and she too had silver toe rings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernardus Lodge brochure depicts a wildly fertile landscape
of lush vineyards against a green mountainside. So imagine my
surprise when, rounding a corner on Carmel Valley Road, I came upon
large plots of caked brown dirt with hopeful baby grapevines poking
up at widely spaced intervals flanking the entrance to the Lodge.
The inn was getting its finishing touches when I was there, but
those vines have a long way to go to live up to their advance
press.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really fair to compare the Bernardus Lodge to the Post
Ranch Inn. The Bernardus is closer to civilization, busier, more
boisterous, less about nature, more about creature comforts.
Bernardus, best known for its Bordeaux-style reds, does have
vineyards, but they're 17 miles away, and the vintner's tasting
room is two miles down the road in the funky hamlet of Carmel
Valley. The new 57-room lodge is appealing, with mustard and rose
adobe-style buildings, a big, welcoming lobby with open beamed
ceiling and flower and fruit arrangements, where new arrivals are
handed a glass of good wine. Outdoors, there is a large fireplace
where people gather to eat and drink, a croquet lawn and a
good-sized pool with fresh towels arranged expectantly on lounge
chairs. The valet carpark station is heated from above.
</P>
<P>
   My spacious room was pretty, too, with a vaulted white ceiling
and a two-story clerestory window. The bathroom was huge, probably
three times the size of my kitchen at home, with a separate,
oversized shower, a closet for the toilet, an oversized tub and a
double sink. But the overall effect was more suburban dream house
than get-away-from-it-all luxury. There was a TV. The fireplace was
gas-burning. The contents of the refrigerator, under an odd
copper-topped counter billed as a wine bar, were not free. The bed,
though, was great: king-sized with feather bedding, lots of
pillows, a puffy coverlet in cream and butter-yellow striped fine
Italian cotton. But I could hear traffic, and the view was of the
valet parking. Tish was coming the next day; I resolved to see if I
could get us a better room.
</P>
<P>
   I had one in a twinkling. Dylan, a young concierge, took me
immediately over to see a room farther back toward the hillside. It
was on the first floor and so didn't have a vaulted ceiling, but
the bed was just as nice, and the tranquil view from the patio was
of the Santa Lucia Mountains, the pool and an olive tree.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, who had grown up in Carmel Valley, also recommended
hiking in Garland Ranch Regional Park, a mile away, pointing out
his favorite trails and some low-key restaurants for lunch. Service
at Bernardus was exceptional; perhaps they were still in dress
rehearsal mode, because staff members frequently checked with me to
make sure everything was all right. Turn-down brought more wine, a
complimentary half-bottle with crackers and cheese. All this
flowing wine was more than I could drink; I packed the bottles in
my suitcase, along with the lavender soap from Post Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Tish and I hiked in the park. We spotted a few people on horses,
and others with dogs, on the hillside dotted with cottonwood, oak
and laurel, their leaves gold and silver. We swam in the heated
pool and lounged around in our fluffy robes, feeling incredibly
lucky to have uninterrupted hours to catch up on years of each
other's lives.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had an uninspired room service breakfast of French toast the
first morning, so we went to the Bernardus restaurant with some
trepidation that night. We were pleasantly surprised by top-flight
food _ the mesquite-grilled beef was especially good with a glass
of Bernardus' 1995 Marinus, a cabernet-merlot blend.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the increasingly testy tones when I phoned home, I
figured this indulgence was going to have to last me well into the
next millennium, so I went all out and signed up for the spa's
special: a Hawaiian Lomi Lomi massage, followed by a lavender
facial. The therapist had been taught the basics of massage by her
Samoan grandmother, she told me, as the gas firelight flickered and
strains of Hawaiian music wafted from the CD player. She said a
silent prayer over me, and used combinations of friction, pressure
and smoothing strokes with her forearm, basting me in flaxseed and
sunflower oil. I didn't have to move for the facial, which was the
best in my admittedly limited experience. I hadn't caught her name
on the way in, but as I left, my eye fell on her name tag. In
California, your masseuse can be named Zenith.

E-COMMERCE: COMING SOON TO A COFFEE SHOP NEAR YOU: PARCEL PICKUP

<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery
specialist Kozmo.com _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside
space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of
an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to
an e-commerce company. But it is unlikely to be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements
will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers
struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities _
customer acquisition costs and returns _while continuing to close
the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements will take many forms. The convenience-store chain
7-Eleven, for instance, plans to install Internet-ready ATMs, which
might eventually let customers order goods from Web retailers and
have them delivered to the store.
</P>
<P>
   And in such arrangements, customers might also be able to return
Internet goods to the stores. Package handling companies like Mail
Boxes Etc. are already starting to handle returns and exchanges on
behalf of Internet retailers. Other national chains, like
drugstores and gas station convenience marts, might also add such
services as a side business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, any retailer with a national presence and a strong
distribution and warehousing system is a prime candidate to join
with e-commerce sites, analysts predict. Customers who enjoy the
convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything
goes wrong with a purchase, they can find a real person at a real
store to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for this is huge,'' said Tim Washer, director of
interactive research with NFO Interactive, a market research
company. ``What it's about is reducing the risk of shopping online.
Offering a retail presence will really facilitate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo executives stressed those points in announcing the deal
this month. ``We'll be able to ride on Starbucks' coattails, and
give our customers an incredible sense of confidence,'' said Joseph
Park, chief executive of Kozmo, which offers free one-hour delivery
of goods purchased on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo, which operates only in Boston, New York, Washington,
Seattle and San Francisco so far, specializes in delivering videos,
books, food and convenience goods.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Kozmo will pay Starbucks $150 million over five
years for the right to place return boxes in Starbucks stores. The
boxes will initially be used for rental videos, games and DVDs, but
will eventually be available for other products, as well, like
disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being
returned for a refund. In addition, Starbucks will promote Kozmo
and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet
company. Kozmo, in turn, will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by
the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages, too.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, which is to include joint marketing, will
immediately raise Kozmo's credibility with consumers, predicted
Chris Vroom, e-commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
And it will also give Kozmo an efficient way to reach new
customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $100 to
acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount, because the average
customer will spend only about $200 at a given site in a lifetime.
A $30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo's
customer acquisition costs in the short term, he said, but in the
long term it could pay off, given Starbucks' huge clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million
customers a week will buy,'' Vroom said. ``That's a powerful
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to
provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not
simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed
unsatisfactory by the customers. Internet merchants have been
widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly
as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly
higher than in the catalog industry.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and
Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their
customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought
online or off. And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up
stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for
help from companies that can help streamline returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce
companies in this building talking to us about it,'' said James
Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc., speaking from his office
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Amos estimated that 300 other companies had asked Mail Boxes
``for access to our 4,000 stores'' in the last several months.
``We're in discussions with just about everyone that'd come to the
top of your mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company
agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in
inspecting and returning items bought online. Since then, Mail
Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores, in
hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single
network.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access,
the company said, but will link the stores' cash registers directly
to the corporate office and to the company's e-commerce partners.
</P>
<P>
   That setup, in turn, will allow the company to plug into the
back-office systems of Internet retailers _ so that if a customer
of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail
Boxes store, the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes
location. The customer could then simply drop off the old item,
pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging, postage or
coordinating delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced
after the satellite system is completed next month, Amos said,
``We're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that
regard. United Parcel Service, which recently announced plans to
expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront
locations in suburban areas, might use those stores to support
e-commerce companies. ``We're definitely going to contemplate it,''
said Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures, the business UPS set
up to help e-commerce companies fill orders.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Kurtzman, chief executive of Ashford.com, an online
jewelry and luxury goods retailer, would welcome a partnership with
an offline company ``if that would help give customers an easier
way to return products,'' he said. ``We'd look to partner with
someone like FedEx or UPS to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In exploring its own partnerships with e-commerce companies,
7-Eleven has not been approached by online jewelers, ``but we have
had some bizarre offers,'' said James Keyes, chief operating
officer. ``I don't think someone will pick up their living room
furniture at our store.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said that by this summer, 7-Eleven would test ATMs with
Internet access. Besides getting cash, customers would be able to
cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web
sites, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the ATMs would not include Internet retailers, he
said, but that might change eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted a new videogame, you could preview it and order
it at the store, then have it delivered to the store on the day of
the release,'' Keyes said. Just such a service is already available
in Japan, he said, as the result of an agreement between 7-Eleven
and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   The company would also welcome the chance to take returned
merchandise for Web retailers, ``as long as the goods make sense in
our environment,'' Keyes said.

MARKET PLACE: SUPPLIES EBB AS PRICES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OIL-U.S.) 
(jt) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of crude oil jumped 4 percent Wednesday to more than
$31 a barrel, and gasoline prices leaped 6 percent. What is more,
inventories of both are so low that a moderate increase in output
from major crude oil producers would provide only a little price
relief.
</P>
<P>
   If crude oil prices stay over $30 a barrel, the Clinton
administration might finally pump some out of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, as members of Congress are urging. Though that
would not bring immediate relief for drivers, who are paying 53
percent more at the gasoline pump than they were last year, it
might send an unmistakable signal to major oil producers that they
have strained the patience of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson opposed such a move Wednesday,
saying at a congressional hearing that it would be unwise to tap
the petroleum reserve while major oil producers were still
discussing production increases ahead of a March 27 meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Still, he warned
that the world is consuming about two million barrels more a day
than it is producing. ``We cannot sustain this imbalance between
supply and demand without risking serious repercussions for the
world economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two wisps of bad news about petroleum supplies helped push up
prices Wednesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil
for April delivery rose $1.34, to $31.77 a barrel, while the April
gasoline futures contract jumped 5.80 cents, to $99.38 a gallon. It
was the highest price for crude oil since January 1991, at the time
of the Persian Gulf War, and the highest for gasoline futures since
October 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem came in the form of fresh reports from the
American Petroleum Institute and the government's Energy
Information Administration that showed declines in gasoline
inventories, which are now down 15 percent in the last year by the
petroleum institute's estimate. The institute also reported that
crude inventories had fallen, while the energy administration's
report showed a slight increase. But both reports show crude
inventories down 12 percent to 13 percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece of bad news was a denial of reports that
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, two leading producers in OPEC, had
agreed with Mexico, a major producer not in OPEC, to raise daily
crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, several news services reported that the three
countries had agreed to propose a production increase effective
April 1. The amount of the increase ranged from 1 million to 1.4
million barrels a day in the reports. But later in the day, a
Venezuelan oil official said there was no such agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk of increases in crude oil production has come and gone
for weeks. The Mexican energy minister issued a statement Wednesday
saying that Mexico and Norway, another non-OPEC producer, thought
that a production increase should be discussed. He gave no
indication of the size of any increase.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and government officials say they expect major
producers to start pumping more oil soon. Richardson, who has just
returned from lobbying for more oil in Kuwait, Mexico, Saudi Arabia
and Venezuela, said, ``I believe the odds are good for production
increases to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, the senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch,
said that he also expected an increase but that OPEC ministers
``will keep their cards close to their vests to the last moment''
before their meeting on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these expectations of increased production, crude oil
and gasoline prices are moving higher. That is because a million or
so more barrels a day will not be enough to rebuild global
inventories to a comfortable level. At the end of last year,
Rothman said, inventories of crude oil and products for the 29
countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development had fallen to 2.53 billion barrels, a level that he
said was 99 million barrels below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production would have to increase more than 10 percent to
ease the price pressure, he said. That would mean an increase in
daily production of crude oil of 1.7 million barrels, effective in
April, followed by an increase of 1.5 million barrels after OPEC
oil ministers meet again in September.
</P>
<P>
   Oil traders, Rothman said, ``see the impending squeeze that is
already there.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro did something unusual Wednesday. It rallied against the
dollar, rising to 97.48 cents from 96.55 cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear if the euro has reached the bottom of a
14-month month slide that has erased 16.4 percent of its value. And
it is getting harder and harder to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas P. Sargen, the global market strategist for private
clients of J.P. Morgan, says one would have expected the euro to
rally this year. After all, European economies are finally turning
around, and their stock markets are outperforming the Dow Jones
industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that one reason for the decline is that the 11
nations behind the euro, which was introduced in January 1999, have
no one person to speak for the currency. Usually, a country's
finance minister does the job. But 11 finance ministers cannot
speak together, and they often contradict each other.
</P>
<P>
   So, traders have been looking to Wim Duisenberg, the president
of the European Central Bank, as the substitute. Duisenberg, who
has also sent some mixed signals, could show that someone cared
about the beleaguered euro, Sargen says. How? The central bank
could raise its interest rate target at its meeting Thursday.

SERIOUS ABOUT RESEARCH, MICROSOFT HAS TIME FOR A GAME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ When Rick Rashid, Microsoft's vice president
for research, utters, ``Set your phasers to stun,'' he isn't
preparing to launch one of his company's famous take-no-prisoners
assaults on some hapless competitor.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken expert in operating systems design, Rashid joined
the company nine years ago when Microsoft's chief technology
officer, Nathan Myhrvold, set about to create a world-class
advanced research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But like many computer hackers, Rashid also happens to be a
passionate ``Star Trek'' devotee and hard-core computer gamer. So
in what little spare time is left to a Microsoft Corp. vice
president, Rashid began more than three years ago to satisfy his
hacker urges by programming an ambitious prototype for a computer
game.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at its Gamestock event to be held here, Microsoft is
preparing to unveil the fruits of Rashid's hobby, a new ``massively
multiplayer'' Internet game called ``Allegiance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a pure, unadulterated space-war game with impressive 3-D
graphics and a plot sure to seduce any Trekkie. The game, which
requires a powerful desktop computer, a fast graphics accelerator
card and an Internet connection, can be played simultaneously by
thousands of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegiance'' also reveals something about the character of the
research laboratory. The lab was conceived by Microsoft's chairman
and co-founder, Bill Gates, in 1991 as a way to give the company a
competitive edge and to counter the widespread industry view of
Microsoft as an imitator rather than an innovator.
</P>
<P>
   More than just another product, ``Allegiance'' reveals the
freewheeling, uninhibited nature of a research center peopled by a
world-class collection of scientists, engineers and hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of the world's computer laboratories are cutting
budgets and narrowing their focus to research that promises more
immediate product applications and financial payoffs. But Microsoft
Research will grow by as much as 20 percent in the next year, and
part of its work deals with technologies that are not expected to
result in products or profits for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, under Rashid's direction, Microsoft Research embraces
almost the full breadth of computing and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge amount of flexibility about what we do,'' he
said. Indeed, the lab's projects frequently cross the line between
traditional categories like basic and applied research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to create a small team to do a start-up development
project, then spin them off into the product organization, we can
do that,'' Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this freedom, the group has managed to hold
on to its talent. While Microsoft as a whole has a 7.4 percent
worker turnover rate and the rate in Silicon Valley has risen to 15
percent annually, at Microsoft Research, turnover has stayed below
1 percent, an almost unheard-of number for a high technology
research laboratory during the peak of the Internet start-up boom.
</P>
<P>
   The research investment _ in part evident in two new four-story
office buildings full of researchers here on the sprawling
Microsoft campus _ appears to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Among computer science researchers, the company is beginning to
win respect for making serious investments in basic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft Research is very strong in fields such as computer
graphics, databases and operating systems,'' said David Patterson,
a computer science professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``It is also clear that they are a formidable competitor
for researchers on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The direction of Microsoft Research has changed little in the
year since Myhrvold, an extroverted physicist, abruptly left
Microsoft on a sabbatical from which people both inside and outside
Microsoft expect he will not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we miss is Nathan's laughter in the hallways,''
said Rashid, who was at Carnegie Mellon University and already one
of the nation's leading computer scientists when Myhrvold recruited
him in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although some research here in fields like algorithms and
quantum computing is likely to have no commercial payoff any time
soon, most of the researchers are pursuing projects designed to
nurture Microsoft's increasingly diverse businesses over the next
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge opportunity to make an impact here,'' said
Daniel Ling, an electrical engineer and former IBM computer
designer who is director of research at Microsoft and Rashid's
second in command.
</P>
<P>
   Ling and Rashid became friends back in the early 1970s, while
freshmen at Stanford University. Now, three decades later, the two
have created a research culture in which experiments can be
transformed into commercial products that will end up in millions
of offices or under Christmas trees. That potential clearly
motivates many of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Bahl, an expert in wireless networking who came to
Microsoft from Digital Equipment Corp. several years ago, is
working on a product for expanding wireless data networks into
public places like airports and shopping malls. ``I do see it as
more than a research project,'' he said. ``I have to make people
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegiance,'' which will soon be running on hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions of computers, is another example of
that urge to transform projects into products. It also illustrates
the intertwined history of software games and computer research.
</P>
<P>
   While a graduate student at the University of Rochester in the
mid-1970s, Rashid and a fellow student, Gene Ball, wrote one of the
first networked computer games. Known as ``Alto Trek,'' it was
among the first programs written for the Xerox Alto, a
then-revolutionary computer designed at Xerox's legendary Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC).
</P>
<P>
   The University of Rochester, which is near the Xerox campus in
Rochester, was one of the first sites at which the Altos were
installed. In an interview in his cramped Microsoft office, which
is littered with ``Star Trek'' memorabilia, Rashid recalled that
there was just one catch: The machines arrived with no software _
not even an operating system. But they did come with an
experimental version of an early local area network known as
Ethernet, and ``Alto Trek'' was written to take advantage of that
technology to enable players to compete without being in the same
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alto Trek'' quickly became so popular that it would overload
the fledgling network at PARC during lunch time and after work.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Rashid dug up an old copy of the program and
decided that he would rewrite it using Microsoft's most advanced
graphics technology, known as DirectX. With Ball, who now works in
Microsoft's user interface group, he added modern PC graphics to
the original program. The results were so impressive that Rashid
was able to persuade Microsoft's game division to finance
development of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Allegiance'' is ready for the Internet, Rashid is
turning his full attention once again to other research. But that
doesn't mean an end to science-fiction-inspired passions to take
computer research where no hacker has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a framed poster that sits unobtrusively on the floor in
a corner of his office sums it up best: ``Everything I need to know
in life I learned in `Star Trek.'''

A STRANGE HOUSE AND ITS STRANGE STORY

 By NANCY HASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many people who meander through the storybook
streets of the West Village, Tom Fontana had always wondered about
the strange house on 13th Street near Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Set at the end of a row of brownstones, with its elegant
Venetian window arches and stepped gable, the three-story brick
house looked like a reproduction of a 17th-century Dutch guild
hall. But the formal front doors and a chunk of the ground floor
had been hacked away in a renovation of shocking proportions. In
their place was a rubble-strewn gated courtyard that dropped off
sharply in the center, where a metal stairway led to an exposed
basement. The house seemed to cantilever precariously above the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century building bore the unmistakable signs of a
radical renovation, circa 1969. A plaque commemorated this event as
``The Great Building Crack-Up.'' Day-Glo doodles on basement window
panes were peeling. By the time that Fontana _ the television
writer and mastermind of ``Homicide'' and ``Oz'' _ first stumbled
upon the house, in the 1980s, it looked as though it had been
through a bummer of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wrote the place off as one of those fantastic artifacts
that make New York great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, four years ago, Fontana, in search of some outside space,
decided to move from his two floors of a brownstone on 23rd Street.
One day, going to the ``Oz'' set above Chelsea Market, he saw in a
broker's window a photo of the strange building on 13th Street.
</P>
<P>
   For Fontana, 48, who has a passion for New York history and
knows better than most the value of a remarkable, twisted
backstory, 251 West 13th Street proved irresistible. The plot lines
were shadowy; the personalities as quirky and complex as those of
his ``Homicide'' cops.
</P>
<P>
   He dove into the history of the period, and the building's
checkered past, like a sleuth, discovering that it was built in
1887 as the Jackson Square library by Richard Morris Hunt, a
legendary figure of the Beaux-Arts period and the architect of the
main entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It had been a gift
to the Free Circulating Library, predecessor of the public library
system, from George W. Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   A striking renovation, commissioned by Robert Delford Brown, an
artist who bought the building in 1967 for $125,000 (after the
library moved into the Jefferson Market), was also one for the
books, but in a different way. The building was redone _ some say
undone _ by Paul Rudolph, the giant of '60s modernism. ``Underneath
the mess was pretty much the story of the city,'' Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   It would take him two years to painstakingly recast the
9,000-square-foot structure as a harmonious blend of 19th-century
grandeur and airy modern simplicity. The cost of the work was $1.7
million _ about the same as the building's price.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept the top two floors as his living space, accessible
by a private entrance, and has put offices for his writing staff on
the main floor and editing suites in the basement. ``It's like
living in an Escher painting,'' he said as he stood on the top
floor looking down the central staircase.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Fontana knew what he hoped to achieve. He
also knew the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Hunt archivist in Washington could not unearth the
architect's original blueprints and too much of the original
building had been destroyed in Rudolph's renovation so there was no
chance to do a purist's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana is a pro at bringing back the dead (witness his recent
``Homicide'' reunion movie, with every character who was ever a
regular). But he did not want to live with ghosts, either the
19th-century kind or those who frequented the zany pad that Rudolph
had made three decades ago for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown used his residence as a performance space to stage his
frequent happenings.
</P>
<P>
   (In an early one, he displayed 3,500 pounds of meat in a
cooler.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown hung around with Claes Oldenberg and Jim Dine but was not
known to take himself very seriously. He concocted the conceptual
First National Church of the Exquisite Panic on his premises, with
two central commandments: Live, and Do Not Eat Cars. (He instructed
the faithful how to reach the state of Nevada because nirvana was
too hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, who had been dean of the Yale University School of
Architecture, had used many of his characteristic flourishes on the
space. The building had largely been gutted to create multiple
levels. There was lots of Mylar and plenty of smoked glass and
glass bricks that let in some light but not the view. The myriad
staircases were made from planks connected only by the skimpiest
metal tubing. ``When we would poke around the place, Tom was
terrified every time he had to walk up a flight,'' said Ron
Bentley, Fontana's architect, a partner in the B Five Studio.
</P>
<P>
   While the underlying design ideas may have made sense in the
infamous town house Rudolph designed for Halston and his own
still-intact home on Beekman Place, here the budget seems to have
been too small. ``To put it plainly, the construction was shoddy,''
Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's work started in controversy. A year before he
irreparably altered the facade, the three-year-old Landmarks
Commission had decided to make Greenwich Village a historic
district. Its lawyers asked Rudolph in writing to modify his plans,
though they could not yet insist on it legally. Rudolph let the
sledgehammers swing days before the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 69, who now lives in a two-room apartment in Zeckendorf
Towers, dismissed the controversy as ``another example of how
people resist change.'' He called his relationship with Rudolph
``full of conflict,'' which was just what he wanted. He said,
``Someone asked me why I didn't choose Robert Venturi, and I said,
`To see the sparks fly.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fontana decided to keep Rudolph's open layout. Fontana, who is
divorced, lives alone and, like Brown, enjoys partying and
appreciates flowing spaces that afford little privacy. He wanted a
bachelor pad that would mix informality with Hunt's solidity and
urbanity. It was a tricky feat, but one that Fontana (who counts
Lucille Ball and Tolstoy as influences) has largely managed in his
own life.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent much of the early 1980s working in Los Angeles
(``pure hell,'' he said simply), he eschewed the Hollywood Hills
for an apartment in one of the city's few prewar high rises. He
does not own a car or use a computer (he writes scripts in longhand
on legal pads). Although he generally wears jeans and a baseball
cap and peppers his speech with exuberant profanity, his scripts
have been lauded by critics for their Chekovian nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana decided right off not to recreate the building's
19th-century ornamentation and detailing. He even left exposed the
mismatched brick on the 30-foot renovation-scarred side walls that
Rudolph had stripped bare. But he replaced the floating steps with
an imposing yet unadorned central staircase. ``The place was
ridiculous,'' Fontana said. ``I wanted it to have dignity, but not
be too elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   With 18 years of experience supervising television set
construction (he is also a co-owner of three restaurants), Fontana
knew where to spend and where to scrimp. He didn't splurge on
redoing the work spaces on the two bottom levels.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the ground floor, however, there are hints of the
history and of the grandeur of the floors above. Fontana's own
office, the back room, which Hunt designed to protrude into the
yard, has a vaulted roof inlaid with round glass insets that are
dimpled like the bottom of old-fashioned Coke bottles. During World
War II, it had been tarred over for the blackouts and most of the
insets had cracked or shattered. Fontana spent $60,000 to have them
recast. On a sunny day, the light throws dancing shadows on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Fontana's energy and cash went into reimagining the huge
space on the second floor that was once the library's main reading
room. Brown used it as a painting studio that he called his Temple
of Hilarity. Halfway up to the 15-foot ceiling was a crude balcony
with some cheap tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Now floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookcases are filled with
Fontana's 6,600 volumes (the original library opened with 6,601).
The top rows are accessible by a new narrow black metal catwalk
that Bentley designed to suggest the room's historic underpinnings.
The ceilings are custom-milled mahogany, copied from the only room
in the building, now a guest room, that survives from the Hunt era.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-foot refectory table is the only piece that he has
purchased thus far. Bentley created herringbone oak floors and
replaced Rudolph's 12-foot single-pane smoked glass front windows
with clear double-pane glass framed in mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains yet, so at night passersby stop to stare
up at the stunning room.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Public Library's archives, users of
the Jackson Square Branch ``largely comprised writers, artists and
other professional people.'' James Baldwin, Ring Lardner, W.H.
Auden and Gregory Corso all used it, the archives say. But they
certainly never went there for a Wild Turkey-soaked dance party
like the one Fontana gave on New Year's Eve for 400 people,
including the rap impresario Russell Simmons, who stayed until
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   He covered floors with cardboard, a move he quietly
congratulated himself for later.
</P>
<P>
   Above the main floor, the setup is less grand, by design. A
mezzanine, which Rudolph had enclosed to create another bedroom,
now overlooks the library. Above are the living quarters, including
a master bedroom and a den with a built-in wet bar and humidor, a
fireplace and a huge plasma-screen, high-definition television.
Fontana plans to spend much of his time there with friends like the
actor Dean Winters (``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit''); his
producing partner, Barry Levinson; and Bruce Paltrow, the
television auteur who gave him his big break, back in the early
1980s, writing ``St. Elsewhere.'' Paltrow's wife, the actress
Blythe Danner, has agreed to help decorate.
</P>
<P>
   A small top mezzanine, added on by Rudolph as a
body-painting-studio-cum-deck and crowned by a soaring plaster
vault, now has been enclosed as Fontana's writing loft. (His new
show for UPN, ``The Beat,'' due on March 21, will focus on two cops
on the Lower East Side.) On a shelf sits a gift from a pal who
obviously knows him well: it is a Tom Fontana action figure that
comes packaged with a tiny bottle of Wild Turkey, a miniature box
of Cohibas cigars and a thumb-size yellow legal pad.
</P>
<P>
   But the favored outdoor space _ Fontana's holy grail _ is on the
roof, behind the gable at the front of the building, accessible
from the writing loft by a walkway. The sun-splashed south-facing
roof had not been used by either Hunt or Rudolph. It now holds
Fontana's contribution to the building's evolution: a luxurious
deck with a suburban-size grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I have a summer house, and I tell them I
can't imagine why I would,'' he said, gazing out over the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when people pass, they won't say, `Wow, look at that
strange building,''' he continued. ``They'll say, `Wow look at that
guy up there in that strange building with that huge smile on his
face and a cigar in his mouth, cooking up some big steaks.'''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: THE CONSUMER INTERNET MARKET AND ITS B2B COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest entrant in the Internet economy's continuing game of
buzzword bingo is ``business to business,'' predictably shortened
to ``B2B.''
</P>
<P>
   B2B is just what the name implies: businesses selling to other
businesses, using the Internet to cut transaction costs and
increase efficiencies. It is a $1.76 billion market that, according
to Forrester Research, will reach more than $1 trillion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have been around the industry since before
Internet Time welcome this new fixation _ actually, we welcome
anything remotely resembling focus in this wacky business
environment _ but we also find it amusing, in that Yogi Berra,
``deja vu all over again'' kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   And we are a little wistful that it did not happen sooner.
Because a good case can be made from even the most recent past that
any successful consumer technology must first be forged in the hot
fire of the business environment. That has not been the strategy
employed by many consumer e-commerce and media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, the PC industry pioneer David E. Liddle opened the
inaugural Digital World conference _ an event based on the radical
notion that media, communications and digital technology were on
the verge of converging _ with a caveat: to leapfrog the stolid
business market for the glittering horizon of a consumer market was
not a wise strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That is because all technology-based consumer goods, he said,
must go through three phases.
</P>
<P>
   The first is an appeal to enthusiasts who love the technology
for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, which would be today's B2B, someone figures
out how to use the technology in his or her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, controls start to become standard _ it is
important that it works in the way you expect it to,'' he said.
``There's kind of a social covenant between the producer and buyer
where your investment is repaid in terms of productivity or some
other valued metric.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras and cars and PCs, for example, all started their life
cycles with as many variations as there were manufacturers. As
people started using them for work, manufacturers began migrating
shutters and gas pedals and menu bars to predictable, if not
standardized, locations where they behaved in mostly predictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   A product only moves to the third, or consumer, phase, Liddle
said, when it becomes cheap and widely available, no longer just a
tool of someone's trade, but a discretionary purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle was recently nominated to the board of The New York Times
Co.
</P>
<P>
   B2B products that succeeded in the consumer market were able to
do so because manufacturers took seriously the social covenant with
their business customers, working to provide them with tangible
value. The resulting standards made the products both easier to use
and cheaper to build, thus more attractive to a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the technology standards embraced by the largely
consumer-focused Internet industry have long been in place. Today's
Windows-based operating systems, along with TCP/IP, the Internet
protocol, and HTML, the lingua franca of the Web, are ubiquitous.
And yet, the consumer Internet market is something of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers are waging war on consumer Web sites, stealing credit
card numbers, planting destructive software on the computers of
unwilling accomplices. Why? Because they can; there was no
financial incentive for anyone to invest early in the technologies
and common-sense customer care that would have kept them out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, successful Internet companies like Amazon.com,
eBay, RealNetworks and Microsoft are electronically spying on
people's browsing habits, sometimes installing software on
consumers' computers without permission. Some companies even track
their customers' movements through the network, collecting and
selling personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they can, and because consumers have not yet
realized the need or exercised sufficient market influence to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, financial institutions are lobbying Congress for
``digital signature'' legislation that would release them from
traditional requirements to provide consumers with legal documents
on paper. Instead, the companies want to deliver documents like
mortgage lending agreements online. Why? Because it would cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that absent their possession of such documents _ for
whatever reason _ consumers relinquish their claim to legal
recourse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. While consumers are thus besieged, it seems that
the only social covenant held truly sacred by many consumer Net
companies is with their investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how things change in the business-to-business Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, B2B companies are ``certainly going to make money
off information'' in much the same way that today's consumer
companies hope to by siphoning personal data, says Larry Downes, an
expert in business-to-business practices on the Internet and the
co-author of the book ``Unleashing the Killer App,'' published by
the Harvard Business School Press, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've captured 40 percent of a virtual commodities
market,'' Downes points out, ``you can collect some very
interesting data about your customers to create future products.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he says, is that the B2B strategy is based on
enhancing, not demolishing, customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't stealing information from your customers; you
aren't violating their rights,'' he says. ``You're doing it to
serve them. These B2B communities are relatively small, so they are
very sensitive about doing things that would be against the
interest of their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he says, America Online or Yahoo ``have millions of
transient customers who turn over very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes says B2B companies' smaller scales means their
reputations are much more valuable than the number of transactions
they do.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently not so for consumer Internet companies. In
the hopes of eking out another book or CD purchase or two by
sacrificing their customers' privacy, or saving a little money by
not having to mail out legal notices or adequately secure their
systems, they seem more than willing to risk the wrath of _ and
eventual abandonment by _ their customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Downes is convinced it will not be long before people find a
way to create a kind of ``consumer proxy'' on the Internet _ their
own little B2B application, as it were. Then watch how quickly the
consumer Internet moves to mend its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business-to-consumer would be business-to business if
consumers were speaking with one voice,'' says Downes. ``Right now
it doesn't operate that way, but when people can band together as
consumers and act on their collective will, then these companies
won't be able to afford the risk.''

A BUSINESS STUNT MISSES THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems' chairman, Scott McNealy, is
well known for his merciless teasing of Bill Gates and Microsoft.
(McNealy likes to point out, for instance, that while both he and
Gates attended Harvard, only McNealy graduated.)
</P>
<P>
   But one recent attempted prank against Microsoft appears to have
fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   For the Feb. 17 public event to roll out Microsoft's ambitious
Windows 2000 operating system, Sun marketing executives had hired a
fleet of 20 bright yellow trucks used by the pest-control company
Western Exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to pay the drivers to circle the San Francisco
Moscone Convention Center during the Microsoft event inside. The
idea was to draw attention to a news report that there were still
63,000 ``bugs'' in the Microsoft program when it was shipped to
customers _ even though the Microsoft executive in charge of
Windows 2000, James Allchin, had sent an open letter to customers
earlier in the week denying the report.
</P>
<P>
   Near the appointed hour, the trucks were lined up a few blocks
away from the Convention Center. But the mission was aborted after
the Western Exterminator manager learned that it was McNealy's
company, rather than Gates' Microsoft, that had hired the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about Gates' reaction, the manager called in his
fleet. ``He could buy the company and close it,'' he was reported
as saying of Gates.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the moribund marketing stunt, a Sun
Microsystems spokeswoman, Susanne Vagadori, said ``If you want an
on-the-record response it would be along the lines of, `Yeah,
wouldn't that be an appropriate and amusing joke on Microsoft?'
That's sort of why we looked into it.''

EUROPE PLANS TO COLLECT TAX ON SOME INTERNET TRANSACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Testing the ability to enforce national tax
laws in cyberspace, the European Commission is planning to collect
sales taxes on music and software delivered over the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Though not yet complete, the proposals would eliminate what
European officials view as a big loophole that benefits U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those U.S. companies have already begun to complain that
they would be saddled with onerous responsibilities that could
stifle electronic commerce in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate has also exposed practical difficulties in
adapting national taxes to a world in which music and art fly
across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Under proposals developed by the European Commission in
Brussels, companies would have to collect what is known as a
value-added tax, a type of sales tax, on products they sell and
distribute over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are products like computer software, music and videos
that can be turned into digital code and downloaded by customers
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Value-added taxes are a major source of revenue for most
European governments, and tax rates vary by country from about 12
percent to more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to physical goods, like books or clothes, the
taxes have been collected by stores and mail-order companies or by
customs officials if the products were to be shipped across
national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In those transactions, the tax rate is based on the rate of the
country where the product originated.
</P>
<P>
   But ``virtual'' products defy that system, because they can be
sent just as easily from the United States or an offshore tax haven
like the Cayman Islands as they can from a local store in France.
</P>
<P>
   European officials say that this gives U.S. software companies
an unfair advantage over European competitors. They are also
worried that online vendors of all types will shift growing volumes
of sales from sources outside the European system for tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Under proposals that officials are debating in Brussels,
products sold in digital form would be taxed based on the rate in
the customer's country, meaning that companies operating in the
United States would have to collect the taxes on all sales to
European customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any changes, American companies would unquestionably
have an unfair advantage,'' said Oliver Sueme, a director of the
Electronic Commerce Forum, an industry association in Cologne,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a step in the right direction, toward a global
framework for electronic commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. companies say efforts to extend the existing tax system
will prove extremely complicated and prove unenforceable anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that is still developing, and Europeans should
not rush in to develop a solution right away,'' said Howard
Liebman, a lawyer who heads up a working group on tax issues at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Liebman said, companies would have to
determine where a customer actually lives, distinguish between 15
tax regimes and differentiate between private individuals and
companies, because the two types of customers are treated
differently for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To make things easier for businesses, some European officials
have suggested requiring companies to register for business in one
European country and turn their tax receipts over to that country.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea is opposed by many European financial ministers,
because it raises difficulties of distributing the tax money back
to the correct countries.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on both sides of the Atlantic warn that an overly
demanding system could backfire, because many companies will simply
ignore the tax rules altogether and run their Internet sales
operations from offshore tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be requirements, but this is still a system based on
voluntary compliance,'' said Voelker Kebish, a senior researcher on
tax law at the University of Muenster in Germany, who is part of an
advisory group to the European Commission. ``Increasing the
complexity could discourage businesses outside the European Union
from complying.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM is lobbying against the tough new proposals. Smaller dot-com
companies are worried as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says that to grow e-commerce they need to increase
market access, but I fear that this would be an impediment to
market access,'' said Peter Harter, a vice president at EMusic.com
Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., which sells music over the Internet
and owns 20 percent of Crunch.com, a British music distributor.
``It would be very invasive for us to track down where all our
customers are.''

 &HT;    CROSS-CURRENTS OF INTEREST ROIL THE INTERNET TAX DEBATE
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more Americans begin using the Internet each
day, they are discovering that online shopping can be convenient,
fast and _ perhaps best of all _ free of sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now some political leaders want Congress to guarantee that the
Internet will remain a tax-free zone. They say the lost sales tax
revenues are a small price to pay for today's robust ``new
economy,'' which is generating other revenues as incomes and
property values rise.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of governors, mayors and Main Street
merchants are asking: is this fair? Why should one group of
retailers escape the burden of collecting taxes, while others must
gather the revenues needed for schools, roads, police and more?
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the gap between rich and poor is so wide,
many question whether it's good public policy to allow
Internet-savvy consumers to avoid sales taxes while poorer people
without computers bear a hefty tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy may get more attention this week as the nation's
governors gather for the annual winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, who will meet Monday with President Clinton and
Tuesday with senators, are promoting a plan to make online
retailers begin collecting more taxes. At the same time, they want
to push state legislatures to simplify local tax rules and rates to
better fit the borderless Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' proposal is just one of many different plans
being floated in Washington, but virtually everyone agrees that old
laws, drawn to fit the business environment of the 1900s, must be
updated for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who think this is a great time to
overhaul the tax system,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin,
Texas, high-tech entrepreneur and member of the executive council
of Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group. ``We now
have a significant lag between old legislation (and) the reality of
today's digital economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other taxes are less in sync with the global Internet
than local sales taxes, imposed by roughly 7,500 taxing
jurisdictions. When ``special purpose'' taxes for certain
districts, such as downtowns, are counted, the country may have
more than 30,000 different sets of sales tax rules, creating a
potential nightmare for online merchants who ship goods everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when sales taxes were first imposed in the 1930s,
they were seen as a simple way to tax the rich, who were the only
people who could afford to shop in those depressed times.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor families, many states provided exemptions for food.
But today, tax officials find themselves struggling to define what
is a food.
</P>
<P>
   In California, ``a bottle of still water like Evian is not
taxed, but a bottle of Perrier is taxed because it has bubbles,''
and that makes it a snack, said Richard Prem, a partner with
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, an accounting firm. Such exemptions ``make it
very tough to comply with the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though complicated, sales taxes are popular because they take
pressure off of income and property taxes. Today, 45 states impose
sales taxes, which collectively raise more than $150 billion
annually, or about a third of state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the drawbacks of sales taxes are becoming more apparent as
commerce shifts to cyberspace, where merchants sell to people in
all states.
</P>
<P>
   For now, online retailers operate like mail-order companies that
send packages around the country. Supreme Court rulings have
determined that a company can be forced to collect sales taxes only
from customers who live in a state where the company has a
``physical presence,'' such as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   While mail-order companies never significantly threatened state
coffers, the frenzied growth of online sales is raising concerns.
Internet sales are expected to total roughly $20 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such commerce is still so new that projecting sales growth over
several decades is impossible, but ``the trend is definitely
upward,'' said Donald Bruce, an economist at the University of
Tennessee. He recently completed a study that estimates states will
be losing $10.8 billion annually because of Internet sales by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has been willing to ignore the fears of
governors and mayors. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, imposing a moratorium on any new Internet taxes until
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a blueprint for online commerce after 2001, Congress
also created the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, a
group of 19 people drawn from businesses, statehouses and federal
agencies. That group, which will hold its final meeting in Dallas
next month, is supposed to make recommendations to Congress by
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Many tax experts fear that commission members' opinions vary so
widely, no consensus will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what the commission suggests, it's far from clear
what Congress will do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume Republicans object more than Democrats to
Internet taxes. But many Republicans hate state income taxes even
more than sales taxes, and fear that if the Internet erodes the
sales tax base, then income taxes might have to make up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet debate does not split neatly into
``conservative'' and ``liberal'' sides, corporate lobbying efforts
have been somewhat muddled. Many retailers themselves are divided
on the tax issue because they operate both traditional stores and
online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially powerful lobbying group, affluent
homeowners, may also have conflicting interests: they wouldn't want
to see property taxes rise, but they like buying electronics, books
and other goods from online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Given how tangled the issue is, congressional action seems
unlikely in 2000, said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow and sales
tax expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
center. ``It's an election year, so I don't think much will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Congress may want to push the issue to the back
burner, the National Governors' Association plans to turn up the
heat. The organization wants states to take the initiative by
streamlining and standardizing tax definitions, forms, rules and
audit requirements. Once taxes have been simplified, the
association would have online merchants collect taxes with the help
of state-certified software and ``trusted third parties'' to
compute and remit taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But not every governor agrees. For example, Virginia's Gov.
James Gilmore, a Republican and the chairman of the advisory
commission, says Internet companies ought to continue operating
under the rules for mail-order companies because that arrangement
has allowed Internet companies to create millions of jobs.
Internet-generated prosperity is boosting state revenues from
income, corporate and property taxes, making online sales taxes
unnecessary, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And while lawmakers and governors bicker among themselves over
sales taxes, Internet entrepreneurs also are split. Some say
cyberspace should be a tax-free zone, while others believe states
do need sales tax revenues to provide the services and
infrastructure needed in a fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even those online retailers who would be willing to collect
taxes say Congress or the states must vastly simplify taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to collect taxes for thousands of jurisdictions ``would
be a nightmare,'' said Andrew Busey, founder of living.com, an
Austin-based online retailer. ``You could get software to do
anything, but it's a matter of how long it takes to build and how
long it would take to integrate it with your existing systems and
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   All that effort would slow the growth of the Internet, Busey
said. But a simple, uniform tax system would raise revenues while
taking minimal time away from building the new economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly make it a lot easier on us,'' he said.

 &HT;    EarthLink president vows to remain close to workers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink President Michael McQuary sees himself as a
behind the scenes executive making sure the company runs smoothly
and employees are happy.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary, or ``McQ'' as he's known to his friends and associates,
was happy to keep the company on track as president and chief
operating officer of MindSpring, while Charles Brewer, the
company's charismatic founder, hit the media circuit. Now McQuary
is EarthLink's standard bearer for core values and beliefs that
were MindSpring's foundation. It's a role he is passionate about
and takes very seriously. At the company's Atlanta headquarters, he
talked about his ideals and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you fall in the new organizational structure of the
new company?
</P>
<P>
   A: I report to Garry Betty, EarthLink's chief executive officer.
I have the business units and operations of the company reporting
to me. Garry used to have to be back in Pasadena (Calif., where
EarthLink was based before the merger) minding the store. Now he's
able to go out looking for the next big deal to take us to the next
level. This allows us to split some responsibilities and not worry
that things are a shambles back home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it bother you that you don't have the same job you had
prior to the merger?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once you get over the ego impact of not running everything,
it takes a lot of pressure off. I can focus on things. In the past,
I reported to Charles and everyone else reported to me and that was
pretty stressful. What I can do now is focus and make sure the
company's energy and Garry's energy is communicated to everyone in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've got big responsibilities, but you also place a big
emphasis on your employees.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have to make sure I have a calming effect. I've had this
adage that the higher up you are the more of an impact you have on
the people down below. If the CEO sneezes, the top executives get a
cold. If the top executives get a cold, the middle managers get
pneumonia and if the middle managers get pneumonia, some of the
people on the front line are going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you keep the folks on the front line from dying?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's important for me to be accessible. I'm a lot more
accessible than Charles or Garry.
</P>
<P>
   I spend a lot of time walking around the company just seeing
what's going on. People feel they can approach me, and that's the
most important thing. People all around the company just look at
me, and they say ``There goes McQ.'' There was an employee I helped
find a new job at our Seattle offices and before he left, he
brought his replacement by to my cubicle _ I don't have an office _
and he said, ``Here's McQ _ I don't really know what he does but if
you need anything, he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's a very personal approach.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's business, but it's personal, too. You can't keep
your personal life out of the office. There is still a mystique
about working here. The tactics of fear and intimidation have no
place here. The people who work here know they are valued and their
ideas are valued. Your work environment does make a big difference.
Way before Charles started MindSpring, he had this job he just
hated. He'd come home every day just grinding his teeth. Grinding
your teeth about your job is no way to live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people, particularly investors and Wall Street
analysts, were disturbed by MindSpring's and EarthLink's decision
to give up being profitable in order to grow the company. Was that
a tough decision to make?
</P>
<P>
   A: We know how to be profitable and we can get there again in a
quarter if we needed to. But I never wanted us to be a nice little
profitable Internet company. We wanted to be a large company that
can make a difference in the way the world does business. There are
an awful lot of people rooting for us to win, but there are a lot
of cynics looking for us to lose the way. But I'm still president
of the company and we still know what's important.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you really think a list of core values and beliefs can
make that big a difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. People say you can't be as big as AT&AMP;T or IBM and
still cling to those value systems. People think there is a
tradeoff, you can't have huge profits and a great work environment.
</P>
<P>
   Our ultimate goal is to change the way the world does business.
It would be so easy to turn our back on the value system or lower
our service standards, but we can only accomplish our goals of
being wildly profitable, having lots of customers and happy
employees if we cling to those beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There have been rumors that you are considering leaving
EarthLink, but it sounds like you plan to be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   A: I've still got several things I need to accomplish.
Eventually the company will be more valuable than it has ever been
before. I'm in an important role where I can contribute to the good
of the company. I won't leave until I've accomplished my personal
goals. And I probably won't do anything after I leave here. There's
a lot to be said for going out on top and that's what I'd like to
do. Another five years feels about right. This type of work can be
all-consuming.

   PATERSON, N.J. _ There wasn't a whole lot of sympathy in Jane
Silverstein's third-floor office at Kennedy High School the other
day for Erick Barkley of St. John's and other celebrated
student-athletes who have recently run afoul of those confounding
college basketball rules.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors in Silverstein's Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math program (STEM) have their own college-related financial
headaches, and they aren't holding their breath waiting for a
philanthropic phenomenon to cure them. Darryl Jackson, for
instance, recently learned that one of the New Jersey state schools
he applied to had agreed to pick up his first-year tuition, a
promising start, but it still left him with a long haul to go on
the expensive road to a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, a lanky young man with handsome braids and an
engaging smile, the routine of applying for scholarship aid and
loans, in bits and pieces, will be a course load of its own. As he
has already set on a double major (computer science and math), he
makes time between the demanding classes he takes at Kennedy and
the prodigious amounts of homework and the pocket-money jobs he has
held at places like Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   He knows this financial puzzle would all fit together so much
better if he could dissect a defense the way he can disassemble a
computer, if he could score like his cousin, James Lattimore, the
school's reigning basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard UMass is interested in him,'' Jackson said of
Lattimore, a 5-foot-9 guard who averages 24 points and nine
assists.
</P>
<P>
   By his own recent admission in The North Jersey Herald News,
Lattimore has never been much of a student, and said that major
college programs have backed away from recruiting him because he
doesn't have the grades to play ball next year. Yet one Atlantic 10
coach reportedly told Lattimore a single successful semester at one
of those welcome-wagon prep schools would guarantee him a full
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his vertical leap and a system that hardly requires
academic heights, we may assume, given minimum classroom effort,
that Lattimore will go to some college, somehow, some way, and free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger Green, a senior and another of the ``STEMers,'' as
Silverstein calls the 250 students in her (pardon the word)
program, should be so lucky. Currently carrying a 4.3 grade point
index (the .3 is for extra advanced placement honors credit) and
hoping to become a pediatrician, Green was recently accepted by a
private school that happens to play basketball in the Big East. He
was offered $22,000 in academic scholarship aid over four years.
But it still costs $25,000 a year to attend this particular school.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nondribbling student population, we should understand
that Green and Jackson are the lucky ones. ``There's a lot of kids
who don't have grades as high as me but they have a lot higher
grades than someone like my cousin,'' Jackson said. ``It's
discouraging for them because it's so competitive to get into a
good school, and even if they do, how much money is going to be
available for them?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not enough, and then which educator or famous college
basketball coach is going to command space in the newspaper to rage
at the higher authorities on their behalf? Who is going to appeal
to the bureaucrats' sense of compassion, in the eloquent way Duke's
Mike Krzyzewski pleaded for Erick Barkley during an interview last
week on a New York City sports radio show?
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski called Ernie Lorch, the Riverside Church benefactor,
a ``saint'' and called upon the National Collegiate Athletic
Association to stop harassing Barkley and the other inner-city kids
whom society has an obligation to educate _ provided, of course,
they can rebound and spot up for 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Silverstein, 39 years on the job at Kennedy High, said she
is not ``offended'' when she hears this talk and when kids who are
at best marginal students are begged by universities to come. She
just wishes her telephone would ring the way it does in the
basketball and football offices, and someone would ask, ``Who are
your six best students in math?''
</P>
<P>
   She understands that sports raise visibility, make money. She
admits she can't compete with the stars on television so many of
the boys believe they can be. And she never makes the false
assumption that the star athletes are also, uniformly, academic
flops. But by and large, ``the colleges hire them to a job,''
Silverstein said. ``They're on the college payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   From the math and science office and the academic trenches of
the inner city, it is that plain and simple. ``Coach's'' sanctimony
does not add up, or compute.

purchase offer from ING America Insurance Holdings, a

Networks, a California-based national managed care company.
Securities analysts said the offer opened the possibility of a
bidding war for Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurance
company, which replaced its chief executive last week under
pressure from investors who were dismayed by a 50 percent decline
in Aetna stock prices amid disappointing business reports by the

HIGH COURT VOIDS RULING THAT FAVORED EX-CONVICTS ON SUPERVISED
RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ark., Fla., Ala., Ga.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a federal
prisoner's term of ``supervised release'' begins when the inmate
gets out of prison, even if it is clear that the person should have
been released months or years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision means that an inmate receives no credit
for a prison term that has turned out to have been unduly prolonged
_ due to a retroactive change in the law, for example, as happened
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a 1998 ruling in an inmate's favor by
the federal appeals court in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Roy L. Johnson, was convicted in U.S. District Court
in Detroit of federal drug offenses and using a gun in connection
with those offenses. Under federal sentencing law, a drug
conviction automatically requires a period of supervised release,
which is essentially the equivalent of parole, to follow any prison
term. Johnson was sentenced in 1991 to 51 months in prison and
three years of supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the firearms portion of his conviction was vacated
under a Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of what
it means to use a gun in connection with a drug deal. By that time,
Johnson had served more than two years beyond his sentence for the
drug offense alone. He was immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   He then argued that his supervised release should have started
running from the date, two and one-half years earlier, on which he
should have been released.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, ruling in
Johnson's favor in the sentencing dispute that had split the lower
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Wednesday overturning the appeals court, Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy adhered to the text of the federal law governing
supervised release. That law provides that ``the term of supervised
release commences on the day the person is released from
imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be little question about the meaning of the word
`release' in the context of imprisonment,'' Kennedy said, adding
that the law's reference to ``the day the person is released''
suggested a ``strict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious
or constructive earlier time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute does not say `on the day the person is released or
on the earlier day when he should have been released,''' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   As well, he said, the purpose of keeping a former inmate under
monitoring for a defined period is rehabilitation. ``The objectives
of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time
were to offset and reduce terms of supervised release.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the
Federal Defender Association had jointly filed a brief in the case,
United States vs. Johnson, No. 98-1696, supporting Johnson. They
said that ``principles of due process and fundamental fairness''
entitled him to credit for his erroneously lengthened prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In other action Wednesday, the court dismissed a case it had
planned to use to decide whether states are constitutionally immune
from suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The parties in
the case, Alsbrook vs. Arkansas, No. 99-423, had reached a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of two that the justices had scheduled for an
April 26 argument on this significant federalism issue.
</P>
<P>
   The other case, Florida vs. Dickson, No. 98-829, also had been
settled. It was dismissed last week. Each case concerned a separate
provision of the disability law.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals mean the court will not be able to resolve the
issue this term, although it is highly likely the justices will
grant review in one of several pending cases that present variants
of the state immunity question, on which the lower federal courts
are sharply divided.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidate for review is an appeal filed in late
January by the state of Alabama, challenging a ruling by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, that states are not
immune from suit under the act.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, University of Alabama vs. Garrett, No. 99-1240,
all parties filed a motion with the Supreme Court this week seeking
an expedited review and telling the justices that they were willing
to get ready for an April argument. The court denied the motion
Wednesday, meaning that the justices will defer a decision on
whether to grant review. The court generally holds no arguments
after April, so the case would be argued after the new term begins
in October.

ISRAELI BILL MAY UNDERCUT BARAK'S DEALINGS WITH SYRIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Reworks lede to unite ideas of breakdown of coalition unity
and the potential of the draft legislation to undermine Barak's
future negotiations with Syria) 
(jt) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak suffered a political blow
Wednesday when three of the six parties in his coalition government
joined forces with the opposition to approve a bill that would
require an absolute majority of all eligible voters, and not just
those who report to the polls, on any future referendum on peace
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would make any such future referendum extremely
difficult to pass, revealed the instability of his broad-based
coalition and complicates his peacemaking efforts at a time when he
is trying to entice Syria back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   The draft bill, which defied Barak's appeals for coalition
unity, could well get tied up in committee deliberations and be
prevented from returning to the floor for months. Many doubt it
will ever become law.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's approval Wednesday, by a 60-53 vote, sends a
signal to Syria, which is already skittish, that even if Barak is
willing to concede the full Golan Heights in negotiations, he may
not be able to win public backing for what he promises.
</P>
<P>
   It also reveals a collapse of discipline within Barak's
coalition, points at the possibility of defections, and bodes ill
for the array of key decisions ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments, Barak characterized the vote as a
``parliamentary trick'' and said it would not deter him from his
goals. ``I don't take lightly what happened today in the parliament
but we can't read too much into it,'' he said. ``Some 1.8 million
citizens have given me a mandate to bring a new future to the state
of Israel and no parliamentary trick will stop the majority from
deciding its stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition did not elect me,'' Barak said. ``The people
did. And what is connected to the coalition, believe me, I will
deal with the coalition at the proper time.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition parties that chose to challenge Barak were Yisrael
Baaliya, the Russian immigrant party, the National Religious Party,
which represents the Jewish settlers; and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party that has been Barak's most difficult political
partner.
</P>
<P>
   They rallied behind a young Likud leader, Silvan Shalom, who
sensed the possibility to thwart Barak and limit prospects for
peace with Syria at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom, rather than Ariel Sharon, the aging Likud leader,
succeeded in galvanizing the opposition by luring the Likud's
natural allies within the government back to conservative
ideological ground.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom criticized Barak for neglecting domestic concerns and
abandoning his entire original agenda to concentrate on one goal:
``leaving the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about all the things you promised, Mr. Prime Minister?''
Shalom said, speaking in the Parliament. ``What happened to the
social issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the students that were promised free tuition? What
about the parents of three- and four-year-olds that were promised
free education? What about the taxi drivers and the handicapped and
all the rest? The only thing that concerns you is the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   Any withdrawal from the Golan Heights will have to be approved
by an absolute majority _ 61 members _ of the Parliament. Shalom
said he believed that an absolute majority of the people was
needed, too. Since voter turnout is about 80 percent here, that
would require the government to win 65 percent of those votes, by
the estimates of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many saw this as a thinly disguised attempt to nullify the
pro-peace Israeli-Arab votes and insist on a ``Jewish majority.''
Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, said the bill was not only
``anti-democratic and racist,'' but ``empowered the abstainers,
those who left the country, those who don't care whether there is
peace or not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli-Arab lawmaker, said the effort was as
discriminatory as anything discussed by the right-wing Austrian
party that Joerg Haider just quit as leader, a party that Israel
has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who attacks Haider should have clean hands himself,''
Tibi said. ``This proposal is Israeli Haiderism in its most clear
form and a mark of Cain on a democratic society that wants to tell
others what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning the broadness of Barak's coalition was a
risky proposition. He intended to marry left and right, secular and
religious, dove and hawk inside the government to obtain maximum
backing for his diplomatic efforts. But he ended up with a balky,
riven government that cannot be counted on to support him. He was
forced to ask three Cabinet ministers to return from trips abroad
to cast their ballots in Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, which with 17 seats is the third-largest party, has
threatened to quit the coalition several times, but has not. While
Shas leaders said that they were voting Wednesday on their
ideological opposition to a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, many
suspected a more parochial concern.
</P>
<P>
   In their ongoing battle with the leftist education minister,
Yossi Sarid, they have been frustrated recently at Sarid's
reluctance to grant more authority to a deputy education minister
from their party. On Wednesday, even if they were voting their
hearts, they also wanted to encourage Barak to push Sarid to give
in to their demands by flexing their political muscles, party
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers in Barak's party criticized him for failing to
take the time to win over Shas and its leader, Eli Yishai, before
such a critical vote. ``He should have sat with them for four
hours, eight hours,'' said Uzi Baram. ``He should have listened to
them. To what Eli Yishai has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as many of Barak's critics were forecasting the demise
of the coalition, some centrist and leftist lawmakers called on him
Wednesday to reshape his government. ``The prime minister has two
choices: change his coalition or call early elections,'' said Amnon
Rubenstein of the leftist Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russian immigrant party, said he
was not defying Barak or backing Shalom but acting on principle.
``When you are making painful decisions with the potential to split
the people of Israel,'' he said, referring to the withdrawal from
the Golan, ``you cannot do it with a majority of one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barak takes this as a suggestion to include the views of his
coalition partners in his decision-making, it will have served a
purpose, Sharansky said. For now, he said, his party, which
consists of only four members, will remain in the government and
try ``to bring broader consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian immigrant lawmaker, Yuli Edelstein, said the
vote should send a message to Hafez Assad, the Syrian president.
``Under no situation will there be a majority in the Parliament or
in the public for a withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for
obscure guarantees from a dictatorial regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a different perspective, Shimon Peres, the former prime
minister and an ardent dove, agreed that Assad should learn from
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could create a problematic situation,'' he said. ``I
believe the Syrians must understand that they cannot go on
attacking the peace process and keeping away from the table and
doing whatever they can to make a negative impact on the Israeli
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have been disappointed that Barak's recent
overtures to Assad _ hinting that he would back a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights _ have gone unanswered.

COMMENTARY: THE WRONG MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A little before 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 30, 1997, a masked
gunman walked into a bodega on Strauss Street in the Brownsville
section of Brooklyn. There were four other people in the store: the
owner, Jesus Martinez, known affectionately in the neighborhood as
``Poppy,'' a teen-age employee named Frankie Rodriguez, and two
young customers, Candace Daniel, 13, and Steven Green, 15.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman raised his .38-caliber revolver and shot Martinez in
the chest, killing him. Frankie Rodriguez turned and ran. The
gunman chased him down an aisle, shooting at him. When Rodriguez
stumbled and fell, the gunman stood over him and fired a fatal shot
into his back.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Daniel ran out of the store and was not hurt. Steven
Green, who had been playing a video game near the rear of the
store, hid in a back room until the gunman left. He was not injured
either.
</P>
<P>
   The police described the crime as a botched holdup.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a week later, on Jan. 8, 1998, cops arrested a
27-year-old rapper and songwriter named Antowine Butts. The office
of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, then went to work
putting together a first-degree murder case against Butts. This was
not easy because Butts was innocent. But Hynes' office has shown on
several occasions that innocence is no impediment to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Salpeter, a private investigator and former New York City
detective who did investigative work for the defense, told me,
``This was a really bad one. The guy was totally innocent. He was
home with his three kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The police and the district attorney's office used smoke,
mirrors and two of the world's worst witnesses to try to convict
Butts. Both witnesses picked him out of a lineup. One of the
witnesses was a self-confessed crackhead who all but implicated
 &UR; himself &LR;  in the crime. The other was a terminally confused young
woman who said she had just happened to be passing by when the
murders occurred, saw Butts and decided, on the spot, to accompany
one or two other men who she said were involved.
</P>
<P>
   To read the transcript of the trial of Butts (who once was
caught jumping a turnstile, his only previous brush with the law)
is to immerse oneself in the frightening reality of a criminal
justice system gone haywire _ a system that simply closed its eyes
to the most elementary aspects of truth and falsity, guilt and
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The key witness against Butts was a criminal with a long record
named Martin Mitchell. Mitchell told investigators that he _ Martin
Mitchell _ had been at a meeting at which the murder of Martinez
was planned. And Mitchell was outside the bodega the next day when
Martinez and Rodriguez were killed. Did it occur to the police and
the prosecutors  &UR; that maybe Mitchell was involved in the crime?  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. He wasn't charged with anything.
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to Hynes told me: ``You can be at a meeting where an
event is planned and not be a member of the conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   So the police and the DA's office took Mitchell at his word when
he said he was not involved in the crime, and they believed him
when he said that Butts was. If you want a sense of how worthless
Mitchell's testimony was, just consider that he admitted on the
witness stand that in the 12 to 24 hours leading up to the crime he
had been smashed out of his mind on crack cocaine, marijuana and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind wasn't there,'' he said when he was asked why he never
notified the police or warned anybody in the store that a murder
was planned. He said, ``My mind was just about getting high.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked what time the shooting took place, he replied:
``I can't remember people. How am I going to remember time?''
</P>
<P>
   Butts should never have been tried, but he was. Two weeks ago a
jury, after only a brief deliberation, acquitted him. But by then
he had already spent two years in jail. That's two years lost from
a young man's life because of the incompetence _ or worse _ of the
police who investigated this case, and Hynes' office, which
prosecuted it.
</P>
<P>
   And the real killer is still at large.

TREASURIES RISE SLIGHTLY DESPITE STUDY ON PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the exception of the 30-year bond, Treasury securities were
mostly higher in choppy trading Wednesday after initially trimming
gains in reaction to a stronger-than-expected manufacturing report.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 101 10/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose
to 6.15 percent from 6.14 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said its manufacturing business index rose to 56.9 in February from
56.3 in January, above economists' expectations of a reading of
56.5.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities,
said: ``Aside from a marked drop in inventories, every component
flashed strength. The lofty level of the NAPM index suggests that
GDP growth will yet again be north of 4 percent in the first
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, meanwhile, were surprised that Treasuries did not
react more negatively to the manufacturing report, which clearly
showed increasing price pressures. The February price index rose to
74.1 from an already lofty 72.6 in January, as price pressures were
recorded for all but one of the commodities covered in the index. A
separate government report Wednesday showed construction spending
rose more than expected in January, posting its largest gain in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices, however, may now be at the high end of their recent
range, and market participants are reportedly hesitant to take a
strong position in any direction before the release of unemployment
data Friday, which often brings much volatility to bond trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer spending continues to propel the expansion forward at
a pace clearly in excess of the economy's maximum inflationary
trend rate of growth, currently thought to be approximately 3.5
percent,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset
Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has already lifted the rate on overnight
loans between banks a full percentage point over the last eight
months, to 5.75 percent, and is expected to raise it by another
quarter-point at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the Fed will remain in a tightening mode until there
are definitive signs that the economy is moderating to an
noninflationary pace,'' Fine said. ``A sharp correction in the
stock market would be one of these signs. But while a steep and
sustained drop in equity prices would undoubtedly modify future Fed
tightening, it would not necessarily eliminate the need for a less
accommodative monetary policy unless it was coupled with clear-cut
signs of economic slackening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond market participants are not losing sight of reports on
leading indicators, which will be released Thursday, but their
attention is focused on Friday's labor market data.

JAPANESE SECT MAY HAVE ACCESS TO SENSITIVE COMPUTERS, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Computer companies affiliated with the Aum Shinrikyo
doomsday sect developed software programs for at least 10
government agencies, including the Defense Ministry, and more than
80 major Japanese companies in recent years, police officials said
Wednesday after a surprise raid on the group's affiliates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery has raised widespread fears in Japan that Aum,
which killed 12 people five years ago in a nerve gas attack on the
Tokyo subways, now has access to sensitive government and corporate
computer systems and could engage in acts of ``cyberterrorism,''
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the immense fear that the sect provokes in Japan,
the Defense Ministry and Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp., the
country's main provider of telephone and Internet service,
immediately suspended the use of all computer software developed by
companies linked to Aum. The government said it was considering
doing the same at all its agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the government agencies affected are those for
construction, education and post and telecommunications, according
to documents and commuter disks discovered in the raid, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said customer ledgers showed that the Japanese
companies affected were major players in the electronics, food,
banking, transportation and metal manufacturing fields. The most
prominent corporate customer was Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone, or
NTT.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies and agencies said they did not know they
were ordering software from Aum-related firms because their main
suppliers had subcontracted work to businesses affiliated to the
sect.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some of the orders had been placed under the current
government, officials did not come under immediate criticism, in
part because the many of the computer companies had also concealed
their relationship to Aum.
</P>
<P>
   But government agencies and companies that had purchased the
systems were scrambling Wednesday to determine whether the programs
were secure.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that Aum-related companies developed about 100
different types of software, including systems for customer
management, airline route management and mainframe computer
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Government security officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they were extremely concerned that Aum could use
information gained in developing the programs to cripple vital
computer and communications networks at public agencies and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they suspect that during the development
process, the Aum-related companies could have written features into
the software that would allow them to breach so-called firewalls,
which serve to prevent invasion of a computer system by outsiders.
They said they also feared that the sect could have planted rogue
viruses that could shut down these government or corporate computer
systems or send recruitment messages.
</P>
<P>
   The security officials provided no proof that the Aum sect,
which recently changed its name to Aleph and denounced its violent
past, has the ability or the ambition to interfere with the
computer systems of former customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Aum members said the officials were trying to vilify the
sect at a time when it is seeking to live in peace with Japanese
society and to use funds from its computer operations to compensate
victims of its past crimes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are surprised,'' Mikio Aoki, the government's chief
spokesman, said at a regular news conference. ``We believe that the
ministries should check who their suppliers are and that the
suppliers should check where the products are made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Agency said that it had suspended plans to begin
using a new communications system Wednesday for its Ground
Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of the army, after police
informed the agency that the software was developed by an Aum
company.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency said the software system had been
installed at 20 ground bases across Japan to provide rapid access
to the Internet but that the system was separate from one that
handles classified defense information.
</P>
<P>
   ``These computers are not connected to a separate internal
network that handles more sensitive material so there is no worry
that if somebody breaks into it that there will be a danger or
threat to national security,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   NTT Communications said that it was immediately suspending an
electronic greeting card service that police said was developed by
an Aum firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a subsidiary of NTT, said that was checking the
program's source code to make sure it did not pose any problems. In
addition, NTT Communications said that it would delay the spring
introduction of service used to create home pages because of a
possible cult link. The company is reviewing the content of home
page software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked to learn that Aum might have been involved in
the development of this software,'' said Fuyuki Natsumeda, a
company spokesman. ``It was like what we call pouring water into
the ear while you are sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsumeda said the telephone company did not contract directly
with Aum for either of the two software programs and that there
were four or five levels of subcontracting between the main
contractor it hired and the Aum companies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Principally, it's a matter of whether the product is good or
bad, but since we are in such a social environment, I don't think
that we can just say the product is good and that's all we're
concerned about,'' Natsumeda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew an Aum company was developing the software, we
would not want to be involved with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Security officials said that while it is not illegal or a
violation of government policy to do business with the cult, they
are conducting an investigation to find out how the software
companies obtained the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The software companies had a reputation for producing high
systems at low prices, and customers were said to be generally
pleased with the work. The companies were able to win business by
bidding 30 percent to 40 percent below market prices, the officials
said, mainly because their employees, who were all Aum members,
worked virtually for free.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said there were more than 40 employees working at
the Aum related software companies and that many of them were
graduates of prestigious national universities like Tokyo
University and Kyoto University, where they studied computer
science. Some of the employees worked as systems engineers at major
software companies before joining the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and corporate executives said they would
take pains in the future to avoid using Aum companies as
subcontractors, but doing so would likely increase the costs of
procuring some software.
</P>
<P>
   Aum officials declined to comment on the development, which
could severely hurt its computer operations, which are a major
source of revenue for the sect, and the cornerstone of what its
leaders say are plans for the sect to reform itself. The sect has
set as a major priority providing compensation for victims of
crimes committed by former members.
</P>
<P>
   An Aum member, who is familiar with the group's internal
workings and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the sect was
still trying to confirm the information provided by police. Even if
the information proves to be true, the member said, no harm was
done by the sect providing good products at cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerns about cyberterrorism and access to government agency
data are being raised by media reports without confirmation,'' he
said. ``They are raising the specter of these things just because
Aum members are running the shops.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, police and tax authorities have said that Aum earns
about $65 million a year through the sale of computers at seven
affiliated retail shops in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
   Public anxiety over the Aum cult has increased in recent years
as it increased its commercial and recruitment activities. But last
year, the Government passed a new law that allows police to enter
cult facilities at will to conduct inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual human rights report, the State Department noted in
February that while religious freedom is a guaranteed right in
Japan, only the Aum sect has been placed under government
surveillance and is subject to public pressure.

   WASHINGTON _ Standing in a light rain under the watchful eye of
police, the protesters waved signs and shouted at the top of their
lungs: ``Aliyev is a murderer! Aliyev is a dictator! Aliyev, go
home!''
</P>
<P>
   But inside a lecture hall here last month, Heydar Aliyev, the
president of Azerbaijan, could not hear a word of it. Showing
multicolored maps on an overhead projector to demonstrate what he
called Armenia's aggressive ways, Aliyev, a former Soviet deputy
premier and leader of the local KGB, held court over an assembly of
influential foreign policy experts. Without a doubt, he seemed to
have the upper hand over his opponents outside.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, however, it was the band of protesters who had the
political muscle behind them, frustrating Aliyev's recent attempts
to end a congressional ban on U.S. government aid to Azerbaijan
that was passed to punish the country for its blockade of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Armenian activists have kept Azerbaijan on a government
blacklist since 1992 _ the only former Soviet republic to be
punished in this way _ thanks to a well-coordinated lobbying effort
by Armenian-Americans and a strong coalition of Armenia supporters
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Azerbaijanis are pushing back. Aliyev himself has
engaged in face-to-face lobbying, and some high-powered hired
professionals are doing the same behind the scenes. Adding to the
effort, some of the most powerful U.S. oil companies have been
acting quietly on Azerbaijan's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this country's big oil companies have an interest in the
energy-rich region. Three U.S. companies, Exxon Mobil, Unocal and
Pennzoil-Quaker State, are part of the Azeri International
Operating Co. Other companies, such as Chevron and Texaco, are
active in other parts of the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. oil company executive, who spoke only on the condition
that he not be identified, said the restrictions on government
assistance to Azerbaijan were interfering with the efforts of U.S.
companies to develop oil there. At the same time, the oil companies
have sought to avoid becoming involved in the Azerbaijan-Armenia
conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Azerbaijan Business Council, a group that promotes
business ties between the two countries, has worked to overturn the
restrictions. Jayhun Mollazade, president of the council, said that
the restrictions were a ``political irritant between Azerbaijan and
the United States'' and that they also interfered with business.
Mollazade said his group received some financing from oil companies
but has much broader support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these efforts on Azerbaijan's behalf, the restrictions
on aid remain in place. The Armenian-American community, which
numbers about 1 million people, is well organized in its support
for the restrictions. Bound together by remembrances of the 1915
massacre of 1 million Armenians by the Turks, Armenian-Americans
are wise to the ways of grass-roots activism: letters to lawmakers,
campaign contributions and even protests in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev made his case directly to President Clinton last month
during a 45-minute meeting at the White House that included both
Aliyev's entourage and Clinton's top foreign policy advisers.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's view had been the only one that mattered, Aliyev
would have accomplished his mission. The White House contends that
the ban on U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan is counterproductive and
ought to be lifted. But despite entreaties from administration
officials, the majority of Congress has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the conflict so important to Washington policy-makers
is the strategic importance of Azerbaijan, which shares borders
with Iran on the south and Russia on the north. To the U.S.
business community, the geography that matters most is Azerbaijan's
claim over vast oil reserves in the adjacent Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview during his visit, Aliyev showed the volatile
nature of the country he rules. He accused the Russian intelligence
service of masterminding a string of assassination attempts against
him, including failed attacks on his presidential aircraft and a
bridge he was crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev also expressed interest in someday shipping oil through
Iran, an alarming idea for U.S. officials backing a route that
passes through nations friendly to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Flanking Aliyev at a long conference table during the interview
was Hafiz Pashayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to the United States,
and the president's son, Ilham Aliyev, who is first vice president
of the state-run oil company. There is open speculation in Baku,
Azerbaijan's capital, that Aliyev, who is 77 and underwent
quadruple bypass surgery last year, is grooming his son to succeed
him. The president's trip to the United States mixed official
business with cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev reassured Clinton during his meeting, according to aides
to both men, that he continues to stand behind the development of a
pipeline that would ship oil from Baku through Georgia and Turkey
to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Clinton aides see the ban on
aid to Azerbaijan as a hindrance to their efforts to ensure an oil
pipeline route that will not give Iran or Russia a chokehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have major concerns about Azerbaijan looking south''
to Tehran, an administration official said, stressing that such a
notion never came up in his discussion with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ban on U.S. assistance stems from the bitter conflict
between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of
ethnic Armenians located in southern Azerbaijan that has been
seized by the Armenians. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1994
and despite flare-ups continue to engage in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's serious about coming to a peaceful settlement to
the conflict,'' said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat from New
York and co-chairman of the 89-member congressional caucus on
Armenian issues.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Pallone's view of Aliyev's good intentions, the
congressman contends that the restrictions ought to remain in place
until Azerbaijan lifts the blockade on its rival.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian officials agree. Armen Kharazian, deputy chief of
mission at the Armenian Embassy, argued that lifting the aid
restrictions would send the wrong message to Azerbaijan. The two
neighboring countries have no trade or diplomatic relations,
Kharazian said, noting that the border is closed and most railroads
and pipelines between the two states are shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev demonstrated clearly that hard feelings remain. After the
White House meeting, he told reporters that he was working to reach
a settlement with the Armenians but vehemently argued that the
aggressors were the Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 1 million citizens of Azerbaijan have been ousted
forcibly from the occupied lands, and they have been living in hard
circumstances in tents,'' Aliyev said, a contention that Kharazian
of Armenia dismissed as ``propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House meeting, Clinton repeated his opposition to
the restrictions on aid, known as Section 907 of the Freedom
Support Act. But Clinton also let his counterpart know that his
hands were tied.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could waive the restrictions if he made a finding that
Azerbaijan had made progress toward ending the blockade. But
mindful of the strong opposition among Armenian-Americans, he has
left it to Congress to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't wanted to take the heat,'' said Charles H.
Fairbanks Jr., an expert on the region who heads the Central
Asia-Caucasus Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff leaves Aliyev _ who came to power in 1993 after a
military coup and won election in 1998 in a contest the State
Department says was ``marred by irregularities'' _ with an up-close
look at democracy in action. In the interview, Aliyev expressed
both an understanding of, and an annoyance with, Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After his White House visit, Aliyev stood in the driveway
outside and railed against what he regarded as an ``unfair, unjust
law passed by the Congress.'' But showing an understanding of how
lawmaking operates here, Azerbaijan also has hired two lobbying
firms to press its case on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Edwin C. Graves, who calls Aliyev ``a real source of stability
in the region,'' is a sole practitioner who receives $36,000 every
six months to push for the repeal of Section 907. Baker, Donelson
is a law firm that represents the Azerbaijani government on legal
and political matters. George Cranwell Montgomery, the firm's
managing partner, arranged a dinner last April for Aliyev to meet
key senators, according to his filing with the Justice Department
as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner came just before a key Senate vote that nearly
toppled the restrictions. Sen. Sam Brownbeck, a Kansas Republican
who has been a strong backer of the Azerbaijanis' cause, attached
the measure ending the ban on Azerbaijani aid to a spending bill
for foreign operations. But advocates of Armenia rounded up the
votes to defeat the effort, and legislative aides expect no
follow-up measure in either chamber any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Azerbaijanis are mulling their next move. They intend to
continue pressing for a lifting of the ban but they have as their
fallback position more relaxed restrictions. Already, humanitarian
assistance has been exempted and oil companies have successfully
pushed through provisions to allow for some government aid _
through the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade
Development Agency _ aimed at helping U.S. companies doing business
in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   During his Washington visit, Aliyev made a point of condemning
what he called the outsized clout of the Armenian lobby. But
Aliyev's vehemence did not sit well with a member of that lobby,
Ross Vartian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're impassioned and focused, clearly,'' agreed Vartian, who
is executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America, a
Washington-based nonprofit group that pushed for the ban on aid to
Azerbaijan. ``But I wouldn't call us formidable. Yeah, we have a
large grass roots operation. But we also have the facts on our
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the David in this. We aren't the Goliath.'' &QL;

DIGNITARIES WON'T DANCE IN HAIDER'S AUSTRIA . EVEN AT VIENNA'S
OPERA BALL . 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Elisabeth Guertler, the heiress to the
Sachertorte fortune, is a discreet woman who keeps the original
recipe for that gorgeous chocolate cake in a safe and her deepest
feelings about the fiasco surrounding this year's Vienna Opera Ball
to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not happy,'' is all she will say.
</P>
<P>
   Why should she be happy? True, Nursultan Nazarbayev, the
president of Kazakhstan, is coming. So, too, is Ludmilla Kuchma,
the wife of the Ukrainian president. But that is the short,
complete list of international dignitaries expected at Thursday's
ball, the social event of the year in perhaps the world's most
socially conscious city.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking, really. And painful to Guertler, who runs Vienna's
Sacher Hotel, and has spent much of the last year organizing the
ball, which traditionally caps this city's extremely intense
ballgoing season.
</P>
<P>
   Her idea, and it seemed good at the time, had been to restore
all the cachet of the Opera Ball _ a little vulgarized in recent
years _ by bringing back what she called ``some of the old
etiquette and protocol'' and extending a formal invitation to the
Portuguese president, Joerge Sampaio, to be the guest of honor at
the famous Opera House on the Ringstrasse.
</P>
<P>
   This appealed to Thomas Klestil, the Austrian head of state and,
as such, honorary president of the Opera Ball. An invitation to
Sampaio, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, to make a state visit to Austria between March
1 and 3 was extended and accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Orchids for the ball were ordered from Madeira, port from
Oporto, hors d'oeuvres from a Lisbon caterer. ``And then,'' said
Guertler, wringing delicate hands adorned with two tremendous
diamonds, ``this thing with the government happened, this terrible,
terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``thing'' in question, of course, was the formation last
month of a governing coalition including the anti-immigrant Freedom
Party of Joerg Haider. European Union governments reacted testily
by freezing relations with Austria. Into that deep freeze, at the
pace of a fox trot, vanished Sampaio's long-planned visit.
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   The Opera Ball, Austria's answer to Ascot, has known some
disturbances in the past. Demonstrations against the waltzes of
``capitalist pigs'' wasting wealth that would be better spent on
the poor began in the 1970s; they culminated in 1989 in clashes
that left more than 50 people injured. But never had the ball been
snubbed by its guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late, of course, to cancel the order for 18,000
Madeira orchids that will adorn the Opera House commissioned in
1854 by Emperor Franz Joseph with a decree saying it should be used
``for the performance of operas and ballets as well as for the
celebration of opera balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, also, to cancel the shipments of red and white
Portuguese wines, the contract with Portuguese musicians, the
snacks and other accouterments from Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity that circumstances did not permit what we
planned,'' said Manuel Alexandre, the Portuguese commercial attache
here, a lonely figure who will now be his country's sole diplomatic
representative at the ball. ``But we did not invent the world. We
follow what the world says.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria and Portugal ruled a fair bit of the world at one time
and have seen enough ups and downs over the centuries to be
philosophical about this contretemps. Still, the past few weeks
have been singularly rough.
</P>
<P>
   Swarowski, the prominent Austrian glassmaker, canceled its box
(the Opera's 10 boxes go for just over $14,000 each). The chief
executive of the Bayer Chemical Corp. also canceled. Richard
Lugner, a construction magnate who is Austria's answer to Donald
Trump, ran into some undreamed-of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Lugner, who is very rich, has made it a habit in recent years of
paying famous women to accompany him to the ball. On his arm, at a
price, he has had Sarah Ferguson, Sophia Loren and others.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he first tried to pay Catherine Deneuve to accompany
him, but she said she did not want to bump into Haider. His next
port of call was Claudia Cardinale; no luck, for similar reasons.
Third came Jacqueline Bisset, who also declined after receiving
advice from Austria's most famous export to Hollywood, Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   Lugner, in the end, had to be satisfied with Nadja Abdel Farrag.
Who? She is the hostess of a German show called ``Peep'' that earns
its ratings by taking peeps at people's sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   This was not what Guertler, 49, had in mind when she took on the
job of organizing the ball for the first time this year. She wanted
to raise the tone. ``A ball where you have to pay a woman to come,
this cannot be very noble,'' she observed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been some successes. Even Haider has not been
able to dampen the Viennese passion for balls. This is a place
where Austrians from police officers to psychotherapists organize
their own nights of waltzing. All 4,100 tickets for the Opera Ball
have been sold at over $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 320 debutantes, including 50 young ladies from
abroad, are ``coming out'' despite what Guertler called ``these
terrible images on television channels throughout the world that
suggest this country is going through a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers, including Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel
and the new leader of the Freedom Party, Susanne Reiss-Passer, are
showing up in force to do their quadrilles despite warnings from
opponents that a large demonstration will be held outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ball under the state's patronage, and I'm not going
to be cowed into missing it,'' said Karl-Heinz Grasser, the
31-year-old finance minister and a member of the Freedom Party. ``I
used to think the ball was too upper class. Now I think it's a
political challenge to show our opponents we will not be scared
away.''
</P>
<P>
   One person not attending is Haider, who quit this week as leader
of the Freedom Party. ``He did not buy a ticket,'' Guertler said.
She does not like Haider's party, but has been outraged by the
European Union's response to Austrian democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, he will be in the government
box with Klestil admiring the fruits of Portuguese culture _ an
eclectic gathering worthy of the mingling of nations that once
distinguished the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Metternich, a statesman of that empire, once said that
``Asia begins'' on a street leading out of Vienna called the
Rennweg _ a reflection of the view that the city was a last bastion
of European values perched on the perilous edge of the East. But on
Thursday, at least, Asia will begin at the Opera Ball.

COMMENTARY: TOWARD `TITANIC TUESDAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his powerful Virginia speech declaring war on
the religio-pols who long dominated the selection of Republican
losers, John McCain turned his campaign into a crusade reminiscent
of Dwight Eisenhower's 1952 upset of Robert Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Will McCain's blast at intolerance resonate in the major states
that will largely determine the nominee? We've learned to discount
wild guesses of pollsters; we'll find that out next week in New
York, Ohio and California.
</P>
<P>
   It makes more sense to speculate about the possibilities after
those outcomes. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that Republican
voters in New York and other Eastern states rebel against the party
bosses. That is where McCain's attack on the capture of Bush by the
self-righteous right has hit home.
</P>
<P>
   Further assume that the races in the South go mainly to George
W. Bush and that McCain and Bush split the Midwest. That would mean
the eyes of the nation would be on California: who wins the biggest
delegation in this winner-take-all state probably will win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity is that California offers voters two contests. One is
derogated by politicians as a ``beauty contest'' in which all
voters choose among candidates of both parties; it's a kind of
super-poll to indicate who will carry this overwhelmingly
Democratic state in November.
</P>
<P>
   The other California contest, which Bush backers insist is the
only important one, counts registered Republicans only to choose
delegates to the convention in Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In that GOP-only count, Bush is said to be leading 2-to-1. But
California conservatives are not Southerners; only one registered
Republican in five self-identifies as a member of the religious
right. Despite Bush's significant victory among Republicans in the
state of Washington this week, momentum is with McCain here.
Anything can happen in Thursday night's debate; expect that
internal GOP race to tighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Now take the big jump, as few observers dare. What if, in the
wide-open super-poll, McCain and Al Gore run neck-and-neck in
Democratic California, with Bush trailing and Bradley last? And
what if, as McCain demonstrates that winnability, Bush takes the
Republicans-only count?
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that McCain would win the overall election but
lose the whole delegation. Bush forces would say that those are the
party rules and that's tough.
</P>
<P>
   What would McCain forces in California say? They ain't sayin',
and I don't consult with them. But Republicans are speculating that
if California voters demonstrate that McCain would win and Bush
would lose that biggest state _ then the Republican convention
would have to take a hard look at any California ``delegation of
losers.''
</P>
<P>
   What heresy! And yet, and yet _ as we saw in the 1952 convention
(to cries of ``Thou Shalt Not Steal!''), the party that wants to
clean up the mess in Washington cannot ignore the will of the
majority to win.
</P>
<P>
   If huge numbers of voters in the nation's largest state say that
McCain would hotly compete for the state in November and Bush would
write it off, as his father did in 1992, then practical pols here
and elsewhere would suddenly rethink all previous conceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The credentials of any delegation of guaranteed losers, rejected
by the state's swing independents, would be subject to challenge.
Delegates in convention assembled would look November defeat in the
face and try to figure out a way to let March winners be winners.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush has the huge Republicans-only California delegation
in his pocket, won't he have a majority if the decision gets to the
convention floor? No; delegates cannot vote on their own challenged
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   At Philadelphia's convention hall as in California's voting
booths, the majority of delegates rule. Whoever wins the ``beauty
contest'' here may just prevail. But McCain would have to show
clear-cut winnability in California on March 7 to stampede the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   It may embarrass the McCain people and infuriate my Bush friends
to raise this open-convention possibility now, but what are seers
for, if not to foresee? It could be a crazy notion, but this is one
crazy year.

RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE ON THE PLANET SHANDLING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (af) 
 Bruce Newman's most recent article for the Arts &AMP; Leisure section
was about the director Oliver Stone.  
 By BRUCE NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ He has made remorseless fun of his own lips, his
teeth, his rear end and, of course, his hair. Don't get him started
on his hair. During Garry Shandling's years as a standup comic, he
even joked that there was a mirror over his bed reassuring guests
that ``Objects in Mirror Are Larger Than They Appear.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shandling's world, it is all about him, all the time: punch
lines to the gut, the roundhouse, rim-shot comedy of
self-annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Shandling at the ultimate remove from his own id.
Playing an alien in the movie ``What Planet Are You From?'' _ his
character has been sent to impregnate an Earth woman and bring back
the child as part of a plot to take over the universe _ he has been
shorn of the outward appurtenances of manhood and reduced to
wearing a Freudian clip-on.
</P>
<P>
   (On his planet the men are all eunuchs and there are no women,
which doesn't quite explain the need for this interplanetary Club
Med expedition, but if the screenwriters didn't worry about that,
why should you?) This mechanical apparatus produces hydraulic
whining noises during lovemaking, though most of the whining in the
picture still comes from Shandling. It is all about him, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Mike Nichols, also stars Annette Bening
and John Goodman as a sort of jumbo Javert who is onto the scheme.
It opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' exists in a kind of parallel
universe, where men are from Mars, women are from Venus and
relationships are from hunger. The film creates its own emotionally
stunted interior logic for the relationship between the alien,
named Harold, and Bening's character _ a promiscuous, romantically
needy alcoholic _ by first running Harold through a dating gauntlet
that consists, in its charmless entirety, of a topless cocktail
waitress, a sexually frigid stewardess and a nymphomaniacal
adulteress.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with this parade of harridans, what is a righteously
randy alien to do but exploit, lie to and impregnate an emotionally
fragile woman?
</P>
<P>
   That Shandling, as principal author of the script, plays this
all for laughs seems to invite an obvious question: Does he like
women?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair question,'' he says. ``I think that as I've gotten
older I like women more. But relationships are certainly my
nemesis. I think that, not unlike some other Jewish men I know, I
have mother issues that lead to me having difficulty in
relationships. And yet I sometimes think, Buddha wasn't married,
Jesus wasn't married, and the pope wasn't married. And no one
looked at them and said: `What? You have commitment issues?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Shandling is equating himself with any of the major
above-the-title divinities, but he does not resist the image of
himself as a slightly lesser celestial being, navigating from one
star date to the next. ``Relationships may be the final frontier
for me,'' he says. ``I'm very comfortable with myself, and with
being alone, so I'm not driven to be in a relationship. I'm far
more content now than I've ever been in my life. But, you know, if
there's something I'm missing, I'm the first to want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Contentment, after all, has its limits on Shandling's planet.
```I wouldn't want to be me' is one of my favorite sayings,''
Shandling adds, wincing brightly. If you ask whether he means it,
however, this approximate smile collapses into a puddle of abject
uncertainty. ``I'm not sure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bening has said that Shandling wrote the script ``from his
heart,'' and surely any heart that beats in syncopation with an
alien from another planet is one worth having. Shandling has placed
himself inside the glowing breast of E.T., and buffed up his little
man's dialogue with what sound like excerpts from the Penthouse
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know comedians who have a dark side, a lot of
unhappiness,'' Bening says. ``Garry doesn't. You never feel like,
`Oh god, he's making jokes again!' or that it comes from some sort
of insecurity. He's a very strong person, and his humor seems to
come from his ebullience, the way he sees the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Tucson, Shandling saw the world as a place blasted
by sunshine. He blasted back. ``I was one of those kids who didn't
quite fit in in high school, as I think you would expect,'' he
says. ``You don't end up like me if you fit in. Humor did work in
high school and I was funny, but I was not that popular. In other
words, things were sort of like they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been launched into his low, observational orbit around
the Earth when he was 10, after his older brother Barry died of
cystic fibrosis. ``It made me think about the issue of life and
death very early,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He studied electrical engineering at the University of Arizona
in the mid-'70s until he walked out of a lab one day to get a drink
of water and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of dislocation gave him permanent outsider status no
matter where he went, eventually allowing him to write from the
point of view of an extraterrestrial. ``I don't feel like I fit in
in Hollywood,'' Shandling says, ``so it's not difficult to
extrapolate not fitting in on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' takes the assimilationist view
that sex in America is a matter of life or death, which is only one
of the ways in which it is obvious that this is a film made by men.
Nichols has taken the ``Men Are From Mars'' view that women want a
friend who will hug them, while men care about little other than
sex. It is precisely the sort of reductive thinking that accounts
for the movie's glazed slickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most young men think about sex, and think that women are
sexual objects,'' Shandling says. ``And as we get older, we realize
there are elements that are far more important.'' He is awash in
sincerity. ``Or almost as important,'' he says. Then he winces
again. (Shandling winces a lot.)
</P>
<P>
   The sincerity of Shandling's acting and his commitment to
carrying the film came into heated dispute when Nichols accused him
early in the production of showing up for work unprepared, then
demanding excessive retakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garry and I took some time to find each other,'' Nichols says.
``He never knew the lines. He came in knowing apparently much, much
less than me about it. And at first I was sort of startled, and I'd
think: `Well, what do you (italics)mean(end italics) you don't know
the lines? You wrote it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Nichols realized that this was his star's way of staying
in the moment _ where his style of humor is most alive _ rather
than becoming ossified by lines that he had written (with the help
of the co-writers Michael Leeson, Ed Solomon and Peter Tolan) years
earlier. But that came with all the nervous tics and twitches that
are Shandling's comic stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After smaller roles in films, including ``Love Affair'' with
Warren Beatty and Bening and ``Hurlyburly,'' ``What Planet'' is
Shandling's debut as a leading man. ``I'm sure he was nervous,''
Nichols says. ``I think he is professionally insecure. But it's a
two-edged sword, that kind of constant insecurity, because it's a
burden on you also.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who had John Travolta impersonating Bill Clinton in
``Primary Colors'' and now has Shandling doing an impersonation of
a human being, seems intent himself on impersonating Ivan Reitman
or possibly even John Landis. In this picture he has a baby that
urinates like a casino fountain, and a running penis joke. It is
difficult to watch these refinements on Nichols' previous work _
which includes ``Carnal Knowledge'' and ``The Graduate'' _ without
wanting to mutter the word ``plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   The arc of Shandling's career has taken him from writing sitcoms
like ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' to standup comedy and then the
1986-90 Showtime series ``This Is Garry Shandling's Show.'' After
that came a stint as the regular guest host for Johnny Carson on
``The Tonight Show,'' an experience that helped inspire his HBO
talk-show auto-da-fe, ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1998, during the last of the ``Sanders'' show's seven
seasons, that Shandling's 20-year business relationship and close
friendship with his manager, Brad Grey, suddenly ruptured.
Shandling filed a lawsuit charging Grey with using their
relationship to build his management and production businesses, and
asked for $100 million in damages. Grey countersued alleging breach
of contract, and the suit was settled last year with an exchange of
some television rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pleasant, but it was something that had to happen,''
Shandling says of the feud. ``It's certainly a relief to have it
behind me, but I was in the middle of that when we did the last
season of the show, and I was able to compartmentalize it.''
Shandling was not necessarily known for compartmentalizing his
insecurities or restraining his disappointments when he was
writing, producing and starring in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now find that I can throw the neurotic switch when I need it
to get some comic material,'' he says, ``and throw it off when I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``What Planet Are You From?,'' what he throws off most often
are his clothes for frequent love scenes, not least of all with
Bening. For someone who has frequently used insecurities about his
own body to get laughs, Shandling holds back precious little. ``I
think I look pretty good in the movie,'' he says. ``I worked out a
little bit. I mean, I don't think I look like a gentile, but I
think I'm handsome from both the front and the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Any awkwardness he felt was only exacerbated by working naked
with Bening, who is the wife of Shandling's close friend Beatty.
``She was kind enough not to make fun of me at any point during the
nude scene,'' Shandling says, ``which of course would have really
emasculated me. I got enough of that from the craft services
people. During several takes, I was making love to her but I was
actually thinking about Warren. I felt he would want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Shandling must decide what (italics)he(end italics) wants.
Should he reinvent himself as a film star? Or go back to the grind
of television, where he is undeniably most at home? He has what he
calls ``a fantastic idea for a television series that I wouldn't
want to be in,'' as well as plans for two movies (he might also
direct next time).
</P>
<P>
   Soon he will begin work on an episode of ``The X-Files,''
written and directed by his friend David Duchovny, in which Fox
Mulder discovers that a movie is being made about his life.
Shandling stars as the movie Mulder and has a love scene with
Duchovny's real wife, Tea Leoni. ``These men,'' Shandling notes
dejectedly, ``seem to have faith in me that I will be a worse lover
than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   At 51, he seems determined for the first time in his career not
to let his ambition define him, to surprise anyone who
underestimates his capacity for love. ``I'm at an interesting place
in my life where I feel oddly content,'' Shandling says. ``I'm a
late bloomer, and I may just show up Beatty and get married well
after the age he did. I'm curious myself to see how it all unfolds.
I'm sort of willing to be whatever I am.''

NEW U.N. ARMS CHIEF CALLS FOR IRAQ TO ACCEPT WEAPONS MONITORING
PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations' new chief arms inspector
for Iraq left the government of Saddam Hussein no hope of getting a
better deal on the monitoring of its weapons programs Wednesday,
and said it would have to accept inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The arms chief, Hans Blix, said at a news conference a few hours
after taking office that he would expect Iraq to give inspectors
unimpeded access. He also pledged that standards for the
inspections would not be lowered. But he did point out that he was
not leading a commando force and would not seek to humiliate the
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, 71, a former foreign minister of Sweden and the director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1981 to
1997, said he had no plans to go to Iraq to smooth the way for his
new commission or to make any other overtures, as some of Iraq's
supporters have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should have to tempt them to cooperate,'' he
said. ``The first step would be for Iraq to accept the
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Iraqis, who have publicly dismissed the new
inspection system, should instead see the benefits in cooperating,
including an improvement in Iraqi living standards. In theory, at
least, the system could lead within a year to the suspension of
sanctions that were imposed after the invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Blix spoke on the same day that Hans von Sponeck, the relief
coordinator in Iraq who has resigned as of March 31, held a news
conference to lament how badly the Iraqi population is suffering
under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck, who said the Iraqis were living in unacceptable
physical and intellectual deprivation, acknowledged that what he
called ``internal and external factors'' contributed to the
situation. But he declined to discuss how much responsibility for
the situation, if any, fell on the Hussein government.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Security Council sanctions committee dealing
with Iraq began to approve a list of educational, agricultural,
food and medical goods that Iraq will be allowed to import almost
automatically _ or at least without extensive scrutiny _ on the
advice of U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Blix sought to allay fears that he would make the search for
illegal biological, chemical and missile systems easier for Iraq.
He continues to be criticized by some independent arms control
experts who said he failed to detect a nascent Iraqi nuclear
program when he was director of the atomic energy agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said he planned to allow experts from Unscom, the
now-disbanding first arms inspection body, to compete for jobs on
the new commission. But he said they would have to agree to work
for the United Nations and not operate on loan from governments, as
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some Security Council members, in particular Russia, wanted to
start with an all-new inspection team. But disarmament experts said
that would handicap inexperienced inspectors and give Iraq an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Blix said he was optimistic that Iraq would ultimately agree to
inspections, and he added that his door is open to the Iraqi
government if and when they want to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis may tend to look upon inspections as a penalty
which they like to minimize,'' he said. ``I think the way they
should look at it is as an opportunity they should maximize.''

FOR THOSE WHO DANCE AND THOSE WHO DREAM ABOUT IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mich.)  (af) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boyd Gaines emerged from his dressing room after a
matinee of ``Contact,'' famished and drained. He apologized for the
time he had taken in collecting himself, and when it was suggested
that post-performance recovery is the entitlement of every dancer,
he shot his visitor a withering look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got that absolutely right,'' a member of the ensemble
chimed in as he passed in the hallway beneath the Vivian Beaumont
Theater, where the hit dance-play is now ensconced. ``Boyd (begin
italics)is(end italics) a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a hint of ribbing, along with comradely encouragement,
in his colleague's voice, which changed the color of Gaines'
disposition to one of outright embarrassment. This is clearly not a
performer who gazes into a mirror and thinks: Hey there, Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called me about doing the part, I kept trying to
talk them out of it,'' Gaines said a short time later over a plate
of roast chicken and steamed vegetables in the cafeteria of his
alma mater, the Juilliard School, across West 65th Street from
Lincoln Center. ``I literally thought Susan Stroman had mixed me up
with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Stroman, the director-choreographer of ``Contact,'' did not
have the wrong number. Though Gaines did not know an extension from
an under-arm side by side, he was the performer Stroman wanted as
the central figure in the final, swing-dance-inspired entry in her
trio of dance plays.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, set to recorded music ranging from Bizet to the
Beach Boys, has proved so popular it has moved from Lincoln
Center's smaller Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater to the larger,
Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont, where it is in previews before
officially reopening on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that Gaines did not make a persuasive enough
case against himself, for his moving performance as Michael Wiley,
the successful if suicidally lonely New Yorker of the show's title
piece, is one of the most emotionally rewarding facets of
``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   That his face is familiar to regular theatergoers _ he won Tony
Awards in 1989 and 1994 for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and ``She
Loves Me'' _ deepens the audience's own contact with the
production. It's a distinction he shares with one other actor in
the 22-member ensemble, Karen Ziemba, the star of the second
offering, ``Did You Move?,'' who turns in an equally affecting
portrayal as a Queens homemaker browbeaten into submission by her
bullying husband.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these stage veterans serve as the show's touchstones,
reminding us that what we are watching here is more than dance
theater _ it's dramatic art.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Contact'' a second time, you are struck afresh by the
cleverness of Stroman's casting choices. In ``Did You Move?,''
Ziemba's 1950s housewife breaks into a comic dream ballet in an
Italian restaurant, but it's the actress' infectious Imogene
Coca-ish exuberance, rather than the dancing alone, that gives the
piece its buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gaines seeks out the girl of his dreams during a
hallucinatory hour set in a dance club, and contrary to the cliche,
he is not transformed by love into a latter-day Gene Kelly; he is
just a guy trying to take a few steps in a new direction. (The
curtain-raiser, ``Swinging,'' is a playful takeoff on an
18th-century Fragonard painting, ``The Swing.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was creating the pieces, I wanted people to be able to
relate to Boyd and to Karen, to be able to empathize with them,''
Stroman said. ``That is indeed what anchors the second and third
pieces. Karen, in addition to being an accomplished dancer, never
changes from being that middle-class housewife. Boyd has a very
vulnerable quality, and the character of Michael Wiley is about
somebody taking chances in unfamiliar territory. And, the fact is,
Boyd himself is taking chances in unfamiliar territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their paths never cross in the show _ Ziemba appears
only in the second piece, while Gaines' performance comes after the
intermission _ you can feel how much of the evening is molded to
the contours of their personalities, how much depth of character
and feeling their presence adds. The stories Stroman and the author
John Weidman have created are linked in all kinds of nuanced ways;
one of them is in the idea of identity, of accepting yourself for
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Another is in the tension between holding back and letting go,
of the damage done to the psyche in bottling up one's emotions, and
the surprising payoffs in opening the heart to all of life's
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   To dance or not to dance: that is the question in ``Contact''
for the troubled and, as the evening progresses, increasingly
complex characters. Ziemba's housewife is shriveling inside because
she is not allowed to express herself. Gaines' adman is
self-destructing because he does not know how to express himself.
One is desperate to dance; the other desperately needs to learn
how.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The characters' attitudes, it turns out, are mirrors for those
of the actors. The Georgia-born Gaines says that as a Juilliard
acting student he was a complete washout in dance classes. ``They
hated me,'' he recalled with a laugh. ``They said, `If you don't
learn a pirouette, we don't know what we're going to do with
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba, on the other hand, did little but pirouette as a little
girl growing up outside Detroit, and imagined herself with a
classical career. ``I danced with the Ohio Ballet,'' she said one
afternoon, while sitting in the lobby of the Beaumont. ``I wanted
to be a concert dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines and Ziemba, both Manhattanites and both married, also
have both been subjected to the proverbial ups and downs of careers
on the stage. After years of well-thought-of work, both had highly
visible disappointments a few years back, Gaines in a Roundabout
Theater Company revival of Stephen Sondheim's ``Co.'' that failed
to transfer for an anticipated commercial run on Broadway; Ziemba
in the slender Kander and Ebb musical ``Steel Pier.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant a great deal to both actors that Stroman asked them to
create original musical characters with such identifiably human
foibles.
</P>
<P>
   I have had a lot of people, especially men, come up to me and
say, `I'm that guy who can't dance,''' Gaines said. One of his
character's most endearing moments in ``Contact'' comes when,
nursing a drink at a bar, he finally summons the courage to join
the Girl in the Yellow Dress (Deborah Yates) on the dance floor,
but his body refuses to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This character's journey is about bravery _ you can't be truly
brave unless you are truly afraid,'' Gaines said. ``We've all known
this person: socially adept, but unable to make personal
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some marshaling of courage for Gaines to overcome his
inhibitions about dancing, especially because it was with a
Broadway-caliber corps. The first weeks of the initial workshop
production, in a rehearsal room, felt like a foreign-language
tutorial to him: ``They were teaching us to do the steps. I equated
it with learning Russian: `OK, here are 40 new words.'''
</P>
<P>
   His dancing partner, Yates, was a huge help _ ``she was
incredibly patient, and later she forced me to lead her'' _ but at
some point, he became so conscious of his body that he stopped
thinking like an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stro kept saying, `You're not acting,''' Gaines said, invoking
Stroman's nickname. `` `You're just doing the steps.'''
</P>
<P>
   He and Yates practiced until Gaines felt confident he would not
look foolish. ``Now, it's like juggling,'' he said. ``It's getting
a certain number of balls in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba, unlike Gaines, had worked with Stroman on several other
shows, from the Kander and Ebb Off Broadway revue ``And the World
Goes 'Round'' to ``Crazy for You'' on Broadway, and her knowledge
of dance proved as essential to ``Contact'' as was Gaines'
peripheral experience of it. The wife in ``Did You Move?'' is an
archetype, a woman frozen in a servile role in a loveless marriage;
an actress of warmth and some comic skill was required to make her
more than merely pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a change for Ziemba to discover a character through
snippets of classical music, rather than the traditional
musical-comedy accouterments of abundant dialogue and song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I did had to do with the music it was connected
to,'' she said. In ``Did You Move?'' the wife passes into a trance
each time her husband, played by Jason Antoon, leaves the table for
the buffet. ``At first, the music has a lot of plucks of the
violin: she's discovering her feet, it's prickly, it's not total
abandon yet,'' Ziemba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how movement and body language and the right kind
of music underneath creates total understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, the variations Ziemba and Gaines have discovered
in the harmony between music and movement that give ``Contact'' the
quality of a complete piece of musical theater, even if it is not a
traditional one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this physical show going on and this emotional show
going on,'' Gaines said. ``The most fun is when I feel I have them
in balance.''

FORMER PLAYBOY PLAYMATE INHERITANCE FIGHT DELAYED 

</HEADLINE>

   HOUSTON _ Former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith must wait
until at least September to get her day in court over claims she is
entitled to half of her deceased billionaire husband J. Howard
Marshall II's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in which Smith and Marshall's two sons are fighting
over the oilman's estate was to begin next week in Harris County
Probate Judge Mike Wood's court. But a Texas 1st Court of Appeals
ruling Wednesday has postponed it.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is the result of a motion by Marshall's elder son, J.
Howard Marshall III, 63, who was allegedly disinherited over a 1980
family business dispute. The younger son, E. Pierce Marshall, 60,
of Dallas, took over the business and says his father's 1992 will
left him the entire estate.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall III, co-owner of a Los Angeles electronics company,
claims his father resolved their differences and promised to will
him half of the estate. But, he alleges, his brother conspired with
Charles Koch, president of Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries, and
Don Cordes, the company's lawyer, to deprive him of his rightful
half.
</P>
<P>
   When Marshall II died at 90 in 1995, almost all his wealth was
tied up in the stock of Koch Industries, a pipeline and mineral
conglomerate he helped found and which is the nation's
second-largest privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall III also sued Koch and Cordes.
</P>
<P>
   Wood ruled in December that Koch and Cordes, who live in Kansas,
would not have to appear for the Texas trial because their alleged
involvement did not occur here.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall III appealed, hoping to avoid a separate trial in
Kansas against Koch and Cordes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, trials are automatically delayed while such
jurisdictional appeals are pending.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid delaying the probate trial, Wood severed Marshall III's
claims against Koch and Cordes into a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall III appealed this decision as well, saying it violated
the spirit of the Texas law to delay trials with unresolved
jurisdictional issues.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge appellate panel unanimously agreed, saying the
probate trial cannot start until the court rules on whether Koch
and Cordes can be tried in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will be made on an expedited basis. Wood rescheduled
the trial for Sept. 1, hoping for a decision by then. He also wants
to avoid a summer trial because so many lawyers are involved and
vacations might cause scheduling conflicts, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 31, also claims E. Pierce Marshall defrauded her out of
half of the estate by coercing his father to sign documents giving
him control of the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall says his father knowingly signed all the
documents and gave Smith all he intended, about $8 million to $10
million in cash and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who met her future husband in 1994 while she was a
topless dancer in Houston, is also involved in a Los Angeles
bankruptcy proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall intervened in the proceeding to protect his
interest in his libel lawsuit against Smith. Last year, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Samuel L. Bufford said Smith was entitled to all
she was seeking against E. Pierce Marshall, an estimated $820
million. The judge issued the order to punish Marshall for
allegedly destroying evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford rescinded the order in January, saying he would file an
amended order. E. Pierce Marshall's attorneys have said Bufford had
no jurisdiction to award Smith damages related to the estate.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall denied destroying evidence, saying he was not
in control of the materials in question and that Smith's California
attorneys were simply attempting to harass him through duplicative
court proceedings.

POLICE PAINT PORTRAIT OF A TROUBLED CHILD WHO TOOK LIFE OF
CLASSMATE

<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ His father was in and out of
prison. His mother, evicted from her own home, sent him and his
brother to live with an uncle in a dilapidated house here, just
north of Flint.
</P>
<P>
   There, he did not even have his own bed and fell asleep in a
place that neighbors say was filled with noise, drugs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, the 6-year-old got his hands on one of those
guns, stuffed it into his pants pocket and went off to first grade,
where he killed a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, cars paused outside the white clapboard residence,
as passersby tried to get a look at the home of a troubled child, a
boy who police say did not fully comprehend what he did when he
used a .32-caliber handgun on the 6-year-old girl, Kayla Renee
Rolland. She was shot once in the neck just before 10 a.m. Tuesday
in front of a group of about 22 first graders as they made their
way into the hall of the Theo J. Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The boy put the gun in a desk after the shooting and simply
walked away. &QL; 
Questioned by detectives, the boy did not cry, police said, and
afterward sat and drew pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young boy appears not to have many advantages in life,''
said Arthur A. Busch, the Genessee County prosecutor, who said the
boy probably would not be charged and was released on Wednesday to
an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities appeared to take a sympathetic attitude
toward a young child who took another child's life, many residents
said the real sympathy belonged with Kayla's family and questioned
whether it was safe to send their children back to school.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say the boy's own father, serving time in jail
for a parole violation involving a burglary, said the boy was
living in a ``crack house.'' The neighbors say they suspected it
all along.
</P>
<P>
   In a raid Tuesday night, the authorities found a stolen handgun
and some narcotics in the home and jailed the boy's uncle,
Sirmarcus Winfrey, on an outstanding warrant for theft. Another
man, age 19, who lived in the home, who the authorities said
brought the stolen gun used in the killing into the home, turned
himself into the police on Wednesday afternoon. The authorities
said they were considering bringing charges of involuntary
manslaughter against whoever brought the gun into the house.
</P>
<P>
   They are also considering pressing charges of child neglect
against the family or guardians of the child, whose name was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my position that we have, at this point, enough evidence
to establish child neglect,'' the prosecutor said. ``My attorneys
will go to court even today to argue that the court should take
jurisdiction of this little boy. I am very concerned about the
placement of this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, the boy's parents appeared in court for
a hearing about custody of the boy and his brother. A judge moved
to have the state gain custody of the children, saying the boy's
mother was a drug addict who had admitted that she had exposed the
children to marijuana on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said there were also reports that the mother had
physically abused one of her children. The boy's father, who was
brought from the local jail, spoke to the court, saying he was
sorry for what had happened and acknowledging that he had not
always been a good father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had never happened,'' he said. ``I just feel sorry
for the other child.'' The mother sobbed nearby, wiping her eyes
with tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Robert Pickell said that he went to the jail Tuesday
night to ask the boy's father if he knew anything about the gun.
The sheriff said the boy's father said the child was frequently in
trouble and had been in fights at school.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the boy did not seem to comprehend what had
happened and appeared nonchalant when interviewed by detectives on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their impression the boy didn't understand what he had
done, did not appreciate the consequences of his actions and
appeared to take this as some sort of, well, that this just kind of
happens like on television,'' Busch said at a crowded news
conference on Wednesday morning. ``This is a young boy, 6 years
old, who cannot obviously form criminal intent. He does not seem to
understand the gravity of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shooting, the schools in this working-class town
remained closed. Flags flew at half staff. Grieving residents left
flowers and notes and toys at the doors of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The horror at Buell Elementary School, authorities say, was born
of the anger of a little boy who found a deadly weapon under a
blanket on the bed at home and used it on a young girl he had
quarreled with the day before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chad Bullard, who lived next door to the boy's family for three
years before the family was evicted, said the house had been raided
by the police several times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a home where cars were always stopping, late into the
night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the best of neighbors,'' he said. ``I tried to
avoid them because there was always conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he often quarreled with the family. The boy and his
8-year-old brother often teased his dog, and when Bullard tried to
stop it, the boys' parents often intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `Stop yelling at my kids,' and I would say,
`You need to take care of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard said the mother worked during the day and into the
evening and that the boy's father was not around very often.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the boy's mother was evicted from the home.
She moved elsewhere and often sent the two boys to stay with her
brother and at least one family friend, in a house on Juliah
Street, about a half mile from the school.
</P>
<P>
   The two-bedroom home is a kind of makeshift auto shop. A
Corvette sits on the front lawn, propped up by cement blocks.
Another car, its hood ajar, sits to the back of the house next to a
weathered John Deere snowmobile, which appears to be undergoing
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are auto parts and mangled hub caps scattered outside the
house, candy wrappers, soda bottles and wires and equipment out
front. The windows are shaded with old blankets and broken windows
are patched up with blue tarp. A deep and muddy hole sits to the
left of the house. And a dull light burns inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't associate with them,'' said Will Oscar, a 31-year-old
neighbor who said he is planning to move soon. ``There was always a
lot of traffic there; I heard gun shots. I didn't feel safe. My car
was stolen out of my driveway twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar said he did not know the boy and his older brother were
living next door. He said the mother often dropped them off there.
They sometimes teased his dog, but otherwise the boys were ``just
normal kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In school, the boy was often in trouble, the authorities said on
Wednesday. He had a social worker and had been in several fights.
The authorities said they had heard that the boy had recently been
in a quarrel or scuffle with six-year-old Kayla Rolland.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, who were walking by Buell Elementary School on
Wednesday, said they witnessed the fight on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fighting with that little girl a few days ago,'' said
13-year-old John Owens, who was walking by the school yard after
school let out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked by and said `Chill out,' said Julius Irving, 10.
Wayne Morris, 14, said: ``Then this guy tried to get him to stop it
and he picks up this stick and starts hitting him. And the kid was
a lot bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne says there are lots of drugs in the area. ``We walk down
the street and we hear guys say, `Weed? Weed?''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda Ide, an 8-year-old third grader, said she heard the gun
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in my class, writing from the dictionary,'' she said.
``I heard something go 'bang,' and I immediately started crying,
because I knew it was a gun shot, because we hear gun shots all the
time around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda said she didn't sleep on Tuesday night, but she is not
too afraid to go back to school. ``I think tomorrow will probably
be the same as it was before the gun was fired. But I think I'll
probably cry for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for reopening the school. The front door is
jammed with flowers, bunnies, teddy bears and candles. Cards read,
``Kayla, we won't forget you.'' There are baskets of M&AMP;M's and
sunglasses, drawings of broken hearts, splashed with crayon.
</P>
<P>
   Rasu King, a 31-year-old woman from the neighborhood, said she
was dropping off a candle and a teddy bear. ``I hope people realize
how serious this is,'' she said. ``If you can't go to elementary
school, you can't go anywhere.''

BOOK - OF - THE - MONTH CLUB AND LITERARY GUILD AGREE TO FORM
PARTNERSHIP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two book club titans that battled for decades to guide popular
literary tastes completed a partnership deal Wednesday that
executives say will ultimately transform the institutions into a
digital hybrid catering to dozens of narrow markets.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by fierce pressures from price-cutting online
booksellers, the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Literary Guild
agreed to form an alliance arranged by the companies that control
them _ Time Inc., a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. and Bertelsmann
AG, respectively. The deal involved no exchange of money or shares.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had announced plans to forge an alliance in
December, but they offered few details at the time because terms of
the deal were still under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   With the pairing, the traditional book clubs will evolve into
interactive digital clubs with some of the same features of an
online bookseller _ live chats with authors, electronic polls,
member bulletin boards, reviews and book excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the competitive pressure we might not have made the
deal,'' said Markus Wilhelm, the president and chief executive of
Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct, which operates the Literary Guild
along with some 35 other clubs. ``We will expand on the Internet to
which we are losing market share in the general-interest area. We
felt that we had hit the ceiling for our traditional book clubs,
and therefore, we have to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct would manage the new company, which would have
combined annual revenue of about $900 million, a membership of more
than 8 million book club customers and more than 3,000 employees,
according to executives close to the negotiations. The partnership
would have a share of more than 70 percent of the $1.25 billion
book club market.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann and Time would each retain a 50 percent stake in the
partnership, which brings together a collection of about 50
existing book clubs ranging from the general interest
Book-of-the-Month-Club and the Literary Guild to the Crossings Club
for Christian families and the Quality Paperback Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   The partners have picked Wilhelm to be the chief executive of
the combined book clubs. The new company, however, still lacks a
name, a board and a chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have to make significant investments into the
development of their interactive businesses and their
infrastructure,'' said Wilhelm, who could not estimate the total
cost for such a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's hope is a combined book club that would operate
more efficiently in what has become an increasingly competitive
bookselling market, Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the online booksellers started offering 50
percent price discounts for books on the New York Times best-seller
list last year, the general-interest book clubs like the Literary
Guild and Book-of-the-Month-Club immediately watched their market
share dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that erosion, Doubleday Direct created an interactive
division that developed plans to create 12 online book clubs this
year and 20 next year. Instead of appealing to a broad range of
members _ as the Literary Guild does _ the aim was to reach narrow
interest groups seeking a depth of titles on particular themes that
are vetted by experts in those fields. The logic was that online
booksellers had been ignoring these groups to appeal to a broader
following.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year Doubleday Direct started a club called
Black Expressions featuring African-American literature; it grew to
have 40,000 members within three months. It also started a virtual
book club called Venus that offers titles exploring sexual themes
and is promoted with brochures that vow: ``Venus is a very personal
club. All of our packaging is discreet, so no one will have the
slightest clue. We promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to come later this year is another club called Mango that
will aim at young women in their 20s, and Rhapsody, a club
featuring mass-market romance novels.
</P>
<P>
   These digital book clubs still rely on some basic time-tested
rituals that have endured for decades. For instance, buyers can get
several books for a low price, and in return, agree to future
monthly purchases that are made automatically unless a customer
checks off a ``negative option.''
</P>
<P>
   With the alliance, Bertelsmann and Time Warner are combining two
old literary institutions with distinctly different cultures. The
Book-of-the-Month Club, which is based in New York, was started in
1926 by Harry Scherman, who invented the first American book club
with a gimmick that featured august literary judges who would
gather around an oak table and a tray of sherry to anoint the
monthly selections by a Quaker-style consensus process.
</P>
<P>
   The Book-of-the-Month Club was considered more literary and less
commercial than the Literary Guild, which was started a year later.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book-of-the-Month-Club offered more nonfiction to a
more heavily male audience, the Literary Guild featured more
fiction choices for a membership dominated by women.

 &HT;    Judge sets arraignment for teen who shot classmates for April
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ T.J. Solomon, the teen-ager who shot and wounded six
classmates at Heritage High School last May, could enter a plea
April 6 in Rockdale County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sidney Nation set the arraignment date this week. Solomon
could plead guilty or not guilty or make one of a handful of other
pleas. They include pleading guilty but mentally ill or not guilty
by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never disputed that the shots were fired by Mr.
Solomon,'' said defense attorney Jana Harris. ``The depths of his
illness, the circumstances surrounding the case _ these are the
things that will be looked at at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing ethical boundaries, neither Harris nor District Attorney
Richard Read would discuss whether the case is likely to reach a
jury. If Solomon, 16, pleads guilty or mentally ill, he will be
sentenced without a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Solomon hid a rifle in his pants leg and also
concealed a handgun before opening fire in a crowded hall area at
Heritage, exactly one month after the rampage in Littleton, Colo.,
that left 12 students and a teacher dead.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Heritage students suffered critical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all counts, Solomon would face prison sentences
totaling up to 350 years.

TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES SUBMIT A COMBINED OFFER TO BUY AETNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Netherlands, Calif., Mass., Ill., Texas, Ga., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. said Wednesday that it had received a $9.9 billion
purchase offer last week from ING America Insurance Holdings, a
Netherlands-owned financial services company, and WellPoint Health
Networks, a California-based national managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, which said that it board would review the offer, said in
a statement that the bid was about $44 a share in cash and $26 a
share in WellPoint stock, subject to due diligence and other
unspecified conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said the offer opened the possibility of a
bidding war for Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurance
company, which replaced its chief executive last week under
pressure from investors who were dismayed by a 50 percent drop in
the stock price and disappointing financial results from the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Aetna stock was halted on the New York Stock Exchange
Wednesday after Aetna soared 29 percent, to $53.0625, on news of
the offer, which was reported by CNBC. Shares of Aetna hit a high
of $99.25 on May 10, and had declined to a low of $38.50 on Feb.
18.
</P>
<P>
   The offer arrived in a letter last Thursday from ING, a unit of
the ING Groep, based in Amsterdam, and WellPoint, based in Thousand
Oaks, Calif. The next day, at a previously scheduled meeting, the
Aetna board named William H. Donaldson, a veteran investment banker
and co-founder of the Wall Street firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, to replace Richard L. Huber as chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint, which provides health coverage for about 7 million
people, is much smaller than Aetna, which covers 21 million. But
Todd Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, said
WellPoint had ``an extremely deep and solid management team that
could go a long way in solving many of Aetna's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna recently reported that the underlying costs of providing
health care were rising faster than profits, as well as
disappointing results in its overseas business. Investors have also
wondered whether Aetna would be able to wipe out losses at the
Prudential Health Care unit that it bought from the Prudential
Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and a number of other health insurance companies face
dozens of lawsuits challenging fundamental managed care policies at
a time when costs are generally rising as many patients insist on
expensive drugs and procedures. Measures that would lower barriers
to medical malpractice lawsuits against the companies have been
enacted in a number of states. Similar proposals are under
consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there might be higher offers for Aetna,
reflecting the potential values if it was divided into separate
health insurance, pension and overseas insurance companies _ moves
that Wall Street investors have been urging for months.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Kumar, an analyst at Chase Securities, said that Aetna's
``fundamental financial position is not that bad.'' But he said the
offer ``clearly puts them in play,'' open to other offers ``whether
they like it or not. It puts a sense of urgency into what they
would like to do with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said
he expected Aetna to rebuff the WellPoint and ING offer as
premature. Donaldson said Friday that he planned to review all
aspects of Aetna's management and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do not accept the bid, they will have to restructure
or find somebody else to buy them,'' said Joseph D. France, an
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint includes California Blue Cross and other health
insurance units in Massachusetts, Chicago and Texas. It also agreed
last year to buy Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia for $500
million. Wednesday, WellPoint completed the purchase of
Rush-Prudential Health Care in Chicago for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint's chairman, Leonard Schaeffer, ``saw a bargain he
couldn't resist,'' Abramowitz said, referring to the low price of
Aetna stock. Analysts said ING would probably want Aetna's
international and financial units, while WellPoint would want the
health care business.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating firm, said Wednesday it was
reviewing WellPoint's debt ``with negative implications'' and would
also review Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the health insurance industry said the combination of
Aetna and WellPoint could narrow choices for consumers. Consumers
for Quality Care, based in California, planned to ask the Justice
Department to examine the deal, said Jamie Court, a spokesman for
the group.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the government forced Aetna to sell several big
Texas health plans after it merged with the Nylcare unit of the New
York Life Insurance Co. WellPoint and ING said in the letter that
they intended to keep the proposal confidential, Aetna said. A
spokesman for WellPoint and a spokeswoman for Aetna declined to
comment Wednesday.

   Home Secretary Jack Straw will decide Thursday whether Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, 84, is free to return home to Chile for health
reasons after 17 months under house arrest in England or must face
extradition to Spain to stand trial on torture charges. Though a
decision to release him is subject to legal challenge, it was not
clear whether any group would bring an appeal.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: PEACE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, have set a three-week timetable to try to end the stalemate
over resumption of home rule for Northern Ireland. Talks will be
held in Belfast for two weeks and in Washington with President
Clinton at St. Patrick's Day celebrations. The two prime ministers
will ``take stock'' of any progress at a European Union meeting in
Lisbon on March 23 and 24, according to Blair's office.

<P>
   The release of secret archives failed to shed new light on the
1936 abdication of King Edward VIII, his suspected sympathies for
the Third Reich and the antagonism the mother of Queen Elizabeth
II, the 99-year-old Queen Mother, felt for Wallis Simpson, Edward's
wife. The government withheld key documents, and Vernon Bogdanor, a
professor of politics at Oxford, said, ``My hunch would be the
papers held back are matters affecting the royal family and the
Queen Mother.''

   Facing a trial on corruption charges, former Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas has quit as head of the highest judicial body, the
Constitutional Council. Dumas had been on leave because of an
investigation into his reported involvement in kickbacks from the
Elf oil company. But after magistrates concluded there was enough
evidence to go to trial, Dumas' colleagues put pressure on him to
resign. Dumas, who denies any guilt, is accused of getting his

SOME RUSSIAN LIBERALS START TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With less than one month to go before Russians vote in
an election that is almost certain to be won by Acting President
Vladimir Putin, some of the liberals who hailed his rise are
voicing fears that there may be authoritarian instincts lurking
beneath Putin's well-turned democratic phrases.
</P>
<P>
   With a war raging in Chechnya on Russia's southern border, tight
restrictions imposed on information and a propaganda campaign
glorifying the military and security services, members of Russia's
small liberal elite say that Putin's pledges to observe human
rights and to respect legal and democratic norms are still promises
waiting to be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he says about rights corresponds to my understanding
about rights,'' said Yelena Mizulina, a lawyer and member of
Parliament for the liberal opposition party Yabloko. ``But what he
does does not correspond to what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as skepticism about Putin drifts to the surface, few expect
it to have any effect on the elections. Not only is Putin's
popularity still high, but the war in Chechnya is still backed by
an overwhelming majority of Russians, many of whom either do not
know or do not want to know about growing reports of atrocities
committed by the Russian military and documented by human rights
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Russia's liberal politicians _ the same ones who
backed President Boris Yeltsin in 1991, many of whom rode with him
to power _ are proving unable to summon up any kind of broad-based
opposition either to Putin, or to the war with which he is so
closely identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of politics are now restricted by Putin's ratings,'' said
Oleg Orlov, director of Memorial, the human rights organization
founded by Andrei Sakharov, the late nuclear physicist and
Soviet-era dissident. ``People are afraid to speak against public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the campaign for the March 26 election formally gets
off the ground, some people have begun to raise their voices in
protest. Yuri Lyubimov, the world-renowned theater director who was
shown on television just a month ago endorsing Putin at a
star-studded gathering at Moscow's President Hotel, recently
criticized him in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   For Lyubimov and others, the spark was the case of Andrei
Babitsky, a reporter for Radio Liberty, who was detained in
Chechnya and later exchanged by Russian authorities in a
mysterious, dubious prisoner swap with Chechen rebels. Babitsky
resurfaced in Moscow on Feb. 29, saying he had been held in a
Russian detention camp outside Chechnya. He traveled to the Russian
capital after Putin said he should be released by authorities who
had arrested him in the Russian republic of Dagestan after he got
out of Chechnya.)
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in an open letter to voters published Feb. 25, did state
that the state should be the first to obey the law. ``It must set
equal rules and comply with them,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note however that Putin has also tolerated an
increasingly aggressive information policy, articulated by his
chief spokesman on the north Caucasus, Sergei Yastrzhembsky who
belligerently turns aside questions about Babitsky while attacking
reports of atrocities in Chechnya as ``propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Babitsky affair has had a big effect,'' Orlov said.
``Among the intelligentsia, it was a turning point, after which it
has become no longer possible to close one's eyes to the nasty
things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Voinovich, an author who was forced out of the Soviet
Union in the 1970s because of his mockery of the Communist system,
had been dubious about Putin from the start, given the acting
president's background as a KGB agent. But, writing recently in the
Moscow News, Voinovich said he had very much wanted to give the new
president the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to what he was saying about market economy,
democracy, human rights and distancing from the past,'' wrote
Voinovich. ``Let God be my witness, I tried hard to believe him.
But the Babitsky case turned out to be an exam at which he
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person with supreme power, or his representatives,
begin to lie, they obviously want people who say the truth to shut
up,'' Voinovich noted. ``As they say, we have been there and done
that. Lies coming from the state are dangerous above all to the
state itself.''
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the American financier and philanthropist who has
followed Russian affairs closely, has already concluded that a
Putin presidency will be ``authoritarian and nationalistic.'' In a
book excerpt published here this week, Soros said that ``the state
built by Putin is unlikely to be based on the principles of an open
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Grigori Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko and now
the main liberal opposition candidate, contend that Putin's
emphasis on a strong central state is a legacy of his years as a
KGB agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, the state is his whole life, it represents his
values,'' Mizulina said. ``I want a president who puts the value of
human life first.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first skeptical portraits of Putin was presented as
comedy on the popular television program ``Kukly,'' a puppet show
that has been skillfully skewering public figures for the past six
years. On one show, Putin was portrayed as a surgeon in a hospital
where the patients have been clamoring for a doctor. The Putin
character appears at last, and reaches for his instruments _ a
hatchet and a blowtorch.
</P>
<P>
   The show drew a public rebuke from former colleagues of Putin at
the state university in St. Petersburg, a reaction that has been
seized upon by many as an ominous sign of the times. ``Such letters
never appeared during the Yeltsin era,'' said Viktor Shenderovich,
author of the Kukly program. ``Nobody would have allowed
themselves, in his name, to write anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shenderovich insists that he is not one to demonize Putin, but
like others, he does not expect to see Putin's true political
character until after the elections. ``His declarations are fine,''
he said. ``Now we are waiting for him to emerge. So far, what we
have seen in practice is Chechnya, where by all accounts, the
cruelty of this war has exceeded that of the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elements in Putin's sketchy program have caused concern
among Russia's hypersensitive intelligentsia _ for instance, his
decree reviving military training in the schools, another decree
that would call up reserve soldiers and officers for training, and
his unstinting praise for the military leadership on Army Day in
February, celebrated this year with more pomp than usual.
</P>
<P>
   He also signed a decree that would expand the powers of the
internal security agency he headed until last summer to monitor the
military, a move apparently intended to bring the generals back
under tight political control.
</P>
<P>
   Gleb Pavlovsky, the director of the Foundation for Effective
Policies and one of the Kremlin's media advisers, said Putin is no
less a liberal than Yeltsin: the difference is one of style. ``The
old politicians don't believe in Putin, and he is distancing
himself from them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlovsky believes the liberals' failure to engage Putin and his
government in a dialogue about the Chechen war and other issues is
the result of their own ``intellectual collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moscow intelligentsia is searching for alibis,'' he said.
``They have a lot of negative things to say, but what they are
really doing is avoiding real politics.''

 &HT;    Bush enjoys interplay with Georgia crowd
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
was in Georgia on Wednesday for a town hall meeting to rally
suburban voters before the state's Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might notice I walked in with a little spring in my
step,'' said an invigorated Bush, fresh off victories in Virginia,
North Dakota and Washington state. ``They all helped us take a step
closer to ending the Clinton era in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   That set off the loudest applause of the morning from the 2,200
people in attendance at the Gwinnett Civic and Cultural Center in
Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett County was a natural selection for Bush's only stop in
Georgia before the Tuesday presidential primary. Gwinnett, Cobb and
north Fulton counties represent about 25 percent of the state's GOP
vote. Campaign strategists said they want to be sure they motivate
Republicans to get to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has
no plans to visit Georgia before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Cathy Cox predicted Wednesday that 38 percent
of Georgia's 3.4 million registered voters will turn out for next
week's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``one-on-one'' with voters in Gwinnett on Wednesday
included questions and answers from audience members.
</P>
<P>
   One man asked the Texas governor in Spanish what Bush would do
to help Latino children. Bush translated for himself, slipping in a
joke first. ``What he said was, `You're doing a fabulous job,' ''
said Bush, laughing with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then told the man that his message has been the same for
everyone _ personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman mentioned Georgia's new education bill, now before
the General Assembly, pointing out that it did not address safety
in schools. Bush referred to an incident in Michigan this week in
which a 6-year-old boy allegedly killed a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does a boy get a gun?'' Bush asked. A woman in the back of
the room shouted, ``Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said parents must take control of their children and be
responsible about guns.
</P>
<P>

MADONNA, SCRIPT FALTER IN `NEXT BEST THING'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For release Friday, March 3. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In looking for someone to blame for the truly abysmal soap opera
of a movie called ``The Next Best Thing,'' it's natural to first
turn to pop singer Madonna. After all, in her moonlighting career
as an ``actress,'' Madonna has made some of the worst films of the
past 15 years, including ``Shanghai Surprise,'' ``Who's That
Girl,'' ``Body of Evidence'' and ``Four Rooms.'' She may have a
magnetic presence in music videos, but ask her to open her mouth
and emote and you've got the makings of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Madonna is pretty bad in ``The Next Best Thing.''
But it's not entirely her fault. She still can't act, but the
screenplay by Thomas Ropelewski is such a ridiculous hodgepodge of
cliches with stale political correctness that Meryl Streep would
have a difficult time making it work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Streep would never choose to be involved in a project
this stupid in the first place. ``The Next Best Thing'' starts out
a romantic comedy, wanders into fantasy and winds up a bitter
melodrama, reducing its main characters to hateful ogres.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, in its slavish desire to teach moviegoers a thing or
two about gay issues and makeshift families, the film takes on a
pedantic tone more suited to an educational movie. Remarkably,
though, there's not one real scene or character to be found here.
Everything is as artificial as Madonna's quasi-British accent.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna plays a yoga teacher, Abbie, who has a hard time holding
on to her men. This, despite the fact that she's smart and
beautiful, not to mention a good cook and great in bed. When we
first meet Abbie, her shallow boyfriend (Michael Vartan) is packing
his belongings. Abbie goes into the bedroom and strips down to her
thong underwear, producing this groan-inducing bit of
Madonna-worshipping, vanity dialogue:
</P>
<P>
   Kevin: It's not going to work this time.
</P>
<P>
   Abbie: What?
</P>
<P>
   Kevin: Your fantastic body.
</P>
<P>
   He does leave and Abbie gets dressed and runs to her gay best
friend, Robert (Rupert Everett), for consolation. After spending
the better part of a day getting smashed, they wake up in each
other's arms, having done the unthinkable. Abbie soon learns she's
pregnant and she and Robert decide to move in together and raise
their child as a family.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward six years and their son, Sam (Malcolm Stumpf),
seems to be doing OK. (You would be too, living in a kind of
opulent wealth that's most unusual for the offspring of a gardener
and a yoga teacher.) Abbie has been celibate, while Robert conducts
his affairs discreetly away from the family home. The family's
tenuous cohesion is shattered, however, when Abbie meets a handsome
investment banker, Ben (Benjamin Bratt), visiting Los Angeles from
New York. Ben and Abbie fall hard for each other, and Robert,
easy-going until this point, suddenly turns into a resentful,
green-eyed monster. That's just the beginning, though, and ``The
Next Best Thing'' soon devolves into a ludicrous courtroom movie
with plot twists so ridiculously absurd that Perry Mason would have
been thrown for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Ropelewski and director John Schlesinger manage the
neat trick of making the audience hate every one of its characters
(except for maybe Bratt's Ben, who's pretty much a cipher). That
makes the fairy-tale ending seem even more of a cheat. Still, it is
an ending. Which, apart from skipping this stinker altogether, is
the next best thing for the dispirited moviegoer. &QL;

UNDER BRADLEY'S RULES REPORTERS AT ARM'S LENGTH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley had just finished a talk
on gun control at a San Francisco hospital when he looked into his
audience and said, ``If you'd like to ask any questions, I'd be
pleased to answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Pamela Tam, a reporter for KPIX, the San Francisco
affiliate for CBS, piped up from the rear of the crowd: What was
his reaction to the shooting of a first-grade girl by a classmate
in Michigan that morning? But Bradley quickly cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he said, ``We were going to do the people.'' But
midsentence, he caught himself and relented. ``Go ahead,'' he
continued. ``You didn't know the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules,'' as Bradley's campaign has unofficially sought to
define them, go something like this: Voters get to ask lots of
questions at almost every event, almost every day. Reporters must
wait for news conferences. In a busy week, there will be four of
them. Sometimes fewer. And all tend to be short. (Fifteen minutes
or less.)
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, for instance, Bradley answered Tam's
questions, and took a follow-up. But then he fielded several
questions from his audience on issues like health policy and police
brutality, giving long, detailed answers. Then he left, without
taking any more questions from the 20 or so reporters in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Again Wednesday, Bradley spent nearly half an hour answering
questions from voters at a health clinic in a Latino section of Los
Angeles. Afterward, his news conference with reporters lasted less
than 10 minutes, time enough to answer four questions.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bradley is avoiding reporters. Indeed,
he has spent a large chunk of each day recently doing interviews
with local news organizations as he tries to spread his message to
the 16 states that hold Democratic primaries and caucuses on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he devotes relatively little time to schmoozing with the
press crew assigned to trail him every day. Though he can be
playful with certain reporters and photographers _ knocking their
pads out of their hands, tossing basketballs at them, nodding to
them in crowds _ he rarely strikes up conversations with them
between events.
</P>
<P>
   And on his charter airplanes, Bradley sits in the front, where
he can be seen poring through files and briefing books, while the
reporters stay in the rear. On occasion, Bradley will stroll back
to chat, off-the-record. But that happens almost exclusively when
the restroom is in the tail section.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reporters sometimes shout questions at him as he
enters events or shakes hands with voters afterward. But he will
not always answer, and he can be terse or testy when he does.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the New Hampshire primary in February, for
instance, Bradley was visibly annoyed with a throng of reporters
who clung around him as he tried to greet voters. He muttered
one-word answers to their questions and then canceled a visit to
another polling station out of concerns that the cameras and
reporters were angering voters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Los Angeles last month, Bradley was shaking hands and
signing autographs in a crowd of middle school students when a
television reporter tossed him the kind of feather-pillow question
most politicians practically beg to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   What did the endorsement of Michael Jordan, just announced that
morning, mean for Bradley's campaign, the reporter shouted through
a crowd of teen-agers. Another politician might have delivered a
breathlessly exuberant sound bite ready-made for the 5 o'clock
news. But Bradley could barely hide his irritation with the
reporter's intrusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a big help,'' he said, then moved on.

 ON THE AIR, McCAIN AND REAGAN'S SON CLASH OVER THE RELIGIOUS (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. John McCain refers to himself as a Reagan
Republican, but he is not afraid to get into a squabble with one.
Not even one whose last name is Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Michael Reagan's radio talk show,
McCain and the elder son of the former president got into an
argument Tuesday afternoon over accusations made against the
senator's campaign by the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter became so intense that it abruptly ended when
McCain's cellular phone began to break up and Reagan said, ``I
don't want to talk to him if he calls back.''
</P>
<P>
   In listening to the interview and reviewing a transcript, which
was circulated by the George W. Bush's campaign, it appeared that
it was Reagan who might have lost his cool because of McCain's
refusal to change subjects and answer his questions.
</P>
<P>
   What gave the exchange some drama was that it occurred at a time
when both McCain and Bush are staking claims to Ronald Reagan's
conservative legacy. Their efforts to co-opt the Reagan political
magic have thrust the younger Reagan, whose conservative talk show
is picked up by about 220 stations nationwide, into the role of
prominent namesake; last week he was a guest on the ABC program
``Nightline'' to discuss the invoking of his father in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan said in an interview Wednesday that he had remained
neutral in the race, which had been perceived by some as tacit
support of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But Reagan's neutrality dissolved after he asked McCain about
former Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., his national campaign
co-chairman, who has been attacked by conservative groups allied
with Bush. The question Reagan posed, about Supreme Court justices
who might be appointed if Rudman is attorney general in a McCain
administration, was the same as one presented by right-to-life
groups in a South Carolina radio commercial attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in their talk, McCain said Rudman was ``a fine
man'' who had been attacked mercilessly by Pat Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition. He challenged Reagan to reach
the same conclusion. ``It doesn't disturb you that Pat Robertson
would call up people and say that Warren Rudman is a vicious
bigot?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed, Reagan lost patience and declared after the call ended,
``He wants to talk about hate, and then he uses my father's name!''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Reagan was still steaming. ``For him to come on and
go off on me,'' he said. ``Of any conservative talk show in
America, I've been the most down the middle on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain took pains to point out that Michael Reagan was
not regarded as a Reagan family spokesman. ``Mike doesn't like us,
he's a Falwell Republican, way out there,'' said Howard Opinsky,
McCain campaign press secretary, in a reference to the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, the founder of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   This further hurt Reagan's feelings. ``Is that a dirty word?''
he asked. ``You know about how many times I've talked to Jerry
Falwell in my life? I think twice.''

 &HT;    A taxi driver serves up sci-fi fare
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read. And to help you see your books while reading by the
fire, might we suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite
Junior ($10, www. BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book
light you can take just about anywhere. The light clips onto the
back of the book and works well with hardbacks and paperbacks.
You'll also look up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes
in a fashionable salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the
light.

 &HT;    GUN GROUPS USE INTERNET SITES TO PROMOTE THEIR CAUSES
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO  c.2000 Cox News Service  WASHINGTON _ The
<TEXT>
National Rifle Association, long known for its formidable lobbying
in Congress, has developed an equally impressive Internet site.
<P>
   Hunters, collectors and gun enthusiasts of all kinds can browse
through dozens of links at www.nra.org _ to learn about gun safety
courses, gun-related legislation in Congress, NRA history and the
National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site has several shopping options for
``everything the Second Amendment enthusiast needs to show their
support,'' such as clothing, decals, bags and books. It even sells
bumper stickers that say ``My President is Charlton Heston'' _ a
reference to the acclaimed actor who currently heads the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers a ``Bill of Rights pewter belt buckle,'' a
``ladies collegiate style ring with synthetic gemstones'' to
reflect a members' status, and an infant bib with a picture on it
of toy wooden blocks spelling ``NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes information about gun safety education
for adults and children, including several programs featuring
cartoon mascot Eddie Eagle, who is never shown touching a firearm,
the site says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NRA points out that Eddie Eagle does not
promote firearm ownership or use and is not affiliated with any
firearm or ammunition manufacturers. On the site, law enforcement
agencies can order a costume of the brown and white bald eagle
mascot for $2,650.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA Website also offers details on making contributions
online, donating firearms, donating land or leaving a gift for the
NRA in a will. And it allows people to sign up for membership and
to send the group gun-related stories such as instances when ``a
child heeded Eddie Eagle's message and avoided potential danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the other end of the gun-related political spectrum are
also taking to the Internet to further their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control, Inc., the leading gun control advocate group,
has a site at www.handguncontrol.org _ with information on
legislation, lawsuits involving the gun industry and statistics on
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While far less polished and elaborate than the NRA site, the
Handgun Control page does have links to state and national gun
control groups and detailed information on federal and state gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also sports several gun-related essays with titles such as
``the NRA's Second Amendment myth'' and ``Who needs an AK-47 to go
duck hunting?''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one common theme between the NRA Website and
that of Handgun Control, Inc. _ they are both decorated in
patriotic red, white and blue.

AID AGENCIES LEAVE SUDAN OVER DISPUTE WITH REBEL GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Eleven of the biggest aid agencies working in
the continual crisis of war and hunger in southern Sudan have left
the region because of a dispute with the main rebel group over
their operations.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on a document that outlines an
``understanding'' between the agencies and the rebel group, the
Sudan People's Liberation Movement. The rebels had set a Wednesday
deadline for the forced removal of any aid group that did not sign
the paper. Over several days, more than 100 workers have left
programs intended to contribute $30 million this year to more than
1 million Sudanese. The agencies and other experts say ordinary
Sudanese will suffer _ in the long term, perhaps, die _ if they do
not return.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, one of the poorest countries, has been locked in a
17-year north-south civil war. Famine killed 60,000 people in
southern Sudan in 1998, and the aid agencies provide health and
veterinary care, clean water, seeds and farming tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried because we clearly see a gap there,'' said
Sharad Sapra, the southern-sector coordinator for Operation
Lifeline Sudan, an umbrella organization of aid groups organized by
the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel officials minimized the effects, saying that the agencies
accomplished less than advertised and that the Sudanese had any
rate become too dependent on aid after 10 years of Operation
Lifeline Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having it might help us in terms of self-reliance,'' said
Cmdr. Nhial Deng Nhial, the rebels' chairman for external
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies are increasingly worried about neutrality and
independence, as groups like the Sudanese rebels contend that aid
organizations arrogantly do whatever they please, being richly paid
for ministering to the poor. In this case, 11 of the 35 agencies
that refused to sign the document included some of the biggest and
most influential, including CARE, Oxfam, Save the Children and
World Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations say they did not sign because the pact could
give the rebels too much control over their operations. The
sticking point seemed to be a provision that would elevate the
``objectives'' of the rebels' ``humanitarian'' wing to the same
level as the principles that the aid agencies observe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important to us is humanitarian principles,'' said
Philippe Guiton, director for the Sudan program for World Vision,
based in Los Angeles. ``If we think signing this document our
neutrality is at stake, we cannot sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the aid officials said, they worried about
procedures for emergency evacuations, that the rebels would charge
high fees or taxes or that soldiers might compromise their
neutrality in ways such as demanding rides in relief vehicles. The
officials also said the rebels, accused of diverting aid food to
feed soldiers, would not include a clause to guarantee that aid
would help only civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel officials dismissed the objections, saying the real
problem is that big foreign aid groups do not want to be bound by
any rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else in the world, where on earth, do you move as you
wish, when you like and how you like?'' asked Elijah Malok Aleng,
executive director of the rebels' humanitarian wing, the Sudan
Relief and Rehabilitation Association.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also noted that 24 of the 35 aid agencies had signed
the document, saying the 11 represented, perhaps, 30 percent of the
aid. The groups say the percentage is closer to 75.

 &HT;    A splice of life
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 4:30 in the afternoon, on the back patio of
Christopher Greta's house, and he's talking about the block parties
that Steiner Ranch residents sometimes have on the weekends. ``All
I have to do is tell my neighbors when,'' he says. A few phone
calls later, and dozens of families are participating. Margarita
machines are rented, hundreds of briquets are sacrificed in the
name of steak, and inflatable jump castles are brought in for the
42 children under the age of 11 who live in this far west Austin
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Greta house that holds Christopher, his wife Loree, daughter
Marlo, 8, and son Maxx, 7, bumps up against a small creek. While
Christopher sits on the patio furniture and drinks a glass of
water, the sounds of the creek mingle with the sounds of children
playing in the front yard. Basketball, tag and soccer are picked up
during a magical, summery time where winter should be carrying in a
discouraging cold wind, but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Greta is talking about another game now, one called
The Sims, and the prospect that a reporter will rebuild his house
by computer, turn his family into digitally animated characters,
and roam them around a house to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Greta, who as owner of Austin's Ad Ranch spends a lot of time
thinking about how ordinary people react to extraordinary images,
thinks it will be fun. ``What a great therapy,'' he says. ``Way too
often people get stuck in a routine and don't think about their own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sims allows a player to create a family, put family members
into a self-designed or pre-built house and then run through the
minutiae of everyday life. There are dishes to be done, TV to be
watched, jobs to go to for money and virtual barbecues to organize.
While the concept sounds mind-bogglingly boring (who wants to take
out the trash, even just pretending?), the game is addictive,
thought-provoking and not just a little fun. It is to computer
games what ``Ulysses'' is to books. The mundane is elevated to art,
the question of what we do in a day is brought forth, and,
ultimately, we are left asking (as our mouse button twitches) what
is family, what is happiness and why does my Sim burn up the
kitchen when he tries to cook a souffle?
</P>
<P>
   The Sims is the cute brainchild of Will Wright, the creator of
SimCity, where instead of managing a family, you take control of an
entire city. Wright, who with SimCity took on the Herculean task of
making city management sexy, told the Austin American-Statesman
last year that he wanted to create an architectural simulation in
which you built a house and let virtual people run around in your
creation.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the game, however, Wright began to see that the
people inhabiting the homes were more interesting than their
surroundings. ``I was designing human behavior at an abstract
level,'' he said. ``That became so compelling, it became the game
play. ``
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who is chatty and friendly like Christopher Greta, said
he wanted to open our eyes to how we live our own lives through the
game, which incorporates lessons from psychology, sociology and
Feng Shui books in its mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play (The Sims) a lot, I look at my house, my family,
my friends. People might play this and ask themselves if they're
really maximizing their happiness,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   A HOUSE FIT FOR A SIM
</P>
<P>
   Using photos of the Gretas taken at their home, the first step
in simulating their lives was creating likenesses for them. Using
their clothes as models, choosing somewhat similar faces from the
game's built-in choices and using their astrological signs to
create similar personalities, the family is created and thrust into
a neighborhood that is equal parts mansions and starter homes (This
is not quite reflective of the Steiner Ranch reality, but in The
Sims, there are homes for almost every budget).
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozing an existing house and building a new one from
scratch, we try to replicate as closely as possible the real Greta
home, from the red-brick exterior to the rear deck. Everything can
be chosen and applied manually, from the wallpaper to the kitchen
tile. Windows are put in place (should we use the frilly French
windows, the picture windows or the high privacy panes?) and a
second story is added to the house.
</P>
<P>
   A fireplace, staircase and hardwood patio later, and it's time
to go shopping. We cheat a little, using a code from the Internet
to bump up the measly $20,000 the game starts you off with to
surround the Gretas with the things to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dishwasher and large dining room table in the kitchen,
lots of bookshelves and toys in the kids' rooms and the best
toilets, bathtubs and beds that virtual money can buy. The house is
beginning to look like the Gretas' spacious, nicely furnished home.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, a large console stereo sits next to a large
color TV. Couches tastefully complement wall patterns. A fountain
and a barbecue grill are on the deck, overlooking a creek that
babbles digital water. Upstairs, a dollhouse sits ironically in
Marlo's room, waiting to be played with.
</P>
<P>
   After all the work to build, all the shopping for just the right
light fixture for the guest bedroom, the adult Sim Gretas
ungratefully pull books off the bedroom shelves and sit reading,
ignoring all the riches we've surrounded them with. The kids are
impressed by the hedges, and then run off to meet the school bus,
which takes them away promptly at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   TRAGEDY AT SIM STEINER RANCH
</P>
<P>
   When you start playing The Sims, your characters are
undeveloped. They've got few, if any, skills. They are unemployed,
have only tenuous relationships with other members of the household
and their bladders always seem to be full, prompting constant
visits to the bathrooms, which you, as the player, must remember to
facilitate. Little by little, The Sim Gretas are expected to learn
to live and love. Soon after the game begins, Christopher and Loree
share a few cuddly moments, dancing in a hallway and flirting.
Loree cooks burgers for the family on the patio grill, and soon the
Sim Gretas are greeting an endless parade of curious neighbors who
want to greet the new Steiner Ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   The kids arrive home from school soon after. Maxx shoots hoops
on the family's basketball goal while Marlo goes upstairs to try
out her dollhouse for the first time. Using the upstairs computer
for a job search, Christopher secures an entry-level position as a
mailroom clerk, a far cry from his flesh-and-blood counterpart's
executive-level position. But in the Sim world, it's the best he
can do, starting out. Loree _ who helps run Ad Ranch in real life _
looks in the newspaper for a job, but can only find listings for
``petty criminal'' and ``sports mascot,'' also a far cry from the
somewhat better job market in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After their first night in their new home, Loree and Christopher
are woken up at 2 a.m. by a phone call. Christopher rouses himself,
runs to the phone and answers. Nobody's there and the family has no
answering machine to field the call.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a neighbor named Mortimer visits just as
Christopher arrives home from his first day at work. The visit is
short-lived, however. While cooking, Christopher starts a kitchen
fire that spreads, and eventually kills poor Mortimer, who bravely
stands by and screams ``Fire!'' before dying. The fire department
arrives, but not before the kitchen is gutted. The family learns a
valuable lesson: Soon after, a smoke alarm is installed in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   (A check on the real Gretas assures us that the kitchen, and
neighbors, are intact.)
</P>
<P>
   LIFE SETTLES INTO ROUTINE
</P>
<P>
   The excitement for the Sim Greta family isn't over. A burglar
finds his way into the home, but is promptly arrested when their
burglar alarm alerts police to the thief's presence, just like it
would happen in the real Greta's home. The kids come home with
their first report cards. Marlo scores A's while Maxx has to settle
for B+. This doesn't jive with reality: The real Maxx regularly
gets report cards with a teacher's effusive ``Wow!'' written on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher gets promoted out of the mailroom after improving
his mechanical and speaking skills. He's on track for a successful
business career. Loree continues to look for work online, but none
of the jobs seem to appeal. In the meantime, she manages the
household and socializes with new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them aren't too desirable: Chip Snooty Patootie, a stock
character from the game, for instance, is a trust-fund brat who
teases the children, insults Loree and Christopher and doesn't seem
to get the hint when he's asked to leave. The real Gretas are glad
to report they don't have any such Snooty Patootie neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes relationships deteriorate: Christopher and Marlo argue
over a front-yard basketball game. But there is also a deepening of
commitments as the game moves forward: the possibilities stretching
out before the Sim Gretas include more children, house upgrades,
pool parties, career advancement and some quirky additions to the
game such as polygamy, floods and freak accidents like the one that
did in Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   As in real life, life in the virtual Greta household is a mix of
free will and chance. Balancing hunger with energy with comfort and
a host of other variables, they fluctuate between fulfillment and
unhappiness. By steering them in the right direction _ cleaning up
life's little messes while sneaking in enough time for shooting
hoops and going to bed early _ time management becomes joy
management.
</P>
<P>
   When we leave the Sim Greta family, they all seem happy, if a
little hungry. That's quickly remedied by sending Christopher to
the kitchen to start preparing a family meal.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a happy life is hard work, and being unable to do it in
the game may be a bit of an indication that you may need to work on
your real life, Christopher says. ``If your little electronic
character is miserable _ hell, that's your life.''

HOUSE LIFTS LIMITS ON EXTRA INCOME FOR MOST SOCIAL SECURITY
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Expands on the earlier story, adds figures, adds 15th and 16th
grafs expanding rationale behind eliminating work restrictions and
adds quotes casting doubt on validity of the argument for
passage.) 
(jt) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted 422-0 Wednesday to allow most
Social Security recipients for the first time to earn as much money
as they want without sacrificing any of their retirement benefits,
repealing a Depression-era policy intended to discourage older
people from holding jobs so younger workers would have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote was a rare display of bipartisanship, and
reflected a consensus that the earnings limits placed on Social
Security recipients had long since become counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, where there is broad support for the change, plans
to take up a similar measure soon. President Clinton has said he
would sign the legislation, which would not have any long-term
effect on the financial health of the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people 65 through 69 years old lose $1 of
their Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn above
$17,000. A 67-year-old man who earned $20,000 last year, for
example, would have lost $1,000 of his Social Security retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings limit, which does not apply to people 70 and above,
is already scheduled to rise to $30,000 in 2002, but the
legislation passed Wednesday by the House would eliminate the limit
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted under the terms of the House bill, the change would
apply retroactively to earnings since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people 65 or above lost some or all of their
benefits last year because they earned more than the limit,
according to the Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Those people would benefit immediately from the change, and
other people might decide to remain in or re-enter the work force
because of the opportunity to hold a job without sacrificing any of
their benefits. But the real significance of the shift might emerge
only over the next few decades as the 76 million baby boomers grow
older, creating a vast new pool of retirement-age people more
willing and able than previous generations to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long sought repeal of the earnings limit,
saying it amounts to a tax. They were blocked for decades by
Democrats, who at various times have cited objections from labor
unions, the costs and the fact that relatively well-off people
would be the biggest winners.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition from Democrats has melted away over the years as
the population has aged and the economy has grown healthier. The
two parties agreed in 1996 to raise the earnings limit, and Clinton
called last year for the limit to be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors said repealing the earnings limit would
benefit the entire economy right away by removing a disincentive to
work at a time when the unemployment rate, at 4 percent, is so low
that employers are having trouble filling all the jobs they are
creating.
</P>
<P>
   They said the change also reflected increases in life expectancy
and the fact that more and more people 65 and older continue to
work at least part time by choice or necessity. But they said the
main justification for the change was simple fairness, calling it
unconscionable for the government to deny workers benefits they had
earned over their careers simply because they chose to remain
employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would we want to discourage any American _
whether they're 17 or 67 _ from working?'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living longer now,'' Archer said. ``Older
Americans can work, they want to work and they shouldn't be
punished by an outdated law if they choose to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found evidence that raising or eliminating the
earnings limit will bring more people into the work force and lead
older people who already have jobs to work more. But there is
disagreement over how much of an effect any change has, with some
economists saying repeal could create a huge new pool of available
labor and others saying the effects would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only a limited amount of evidence on the overall
effect'' on the labor supply from repealing the limit, Kenneth S.
Apfel, the Social Security commissioner, told Congress last month.
But, Apfel said, it was plausible that eliminating the limit would
``lead to a modest increase in work activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the provisions that the bill would repeal are more complex
than Wednesday's debate on the House floor would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security recipients lose some of their benefits in
years in which they earn more than the limit, they get some or all
of the reduction back after age 70, when their benefits are
readjusted to reflect their decision to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the change would not apply to people who take early
retirement benefits from Social Security, which they can do at 62
at a reduced rate. These people, 62 through 64, would continue to
be subject to a strict earnings limit, losing $1 in benefits for
every $2 in earnings above $10,080 a year. About 230,000 people in
that age category lost all or part of their benefits last year
because their earnings exceeded the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agreed to leave the earnings limit in place for
early retirees _ effectively encouraging people not to take Social
Security before 65 _ because research has shown that people who
take a reduced Social Security benefits at age 62 are more likely
to end up in poverty than those who work to full retirement age.
The problem strikes particularly hard at widows of men who retired
early and who rely on their late husbands' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties acknowledged that they found it
uncomfortable to be enacting what amounted to an election-year
benefits increase in Social Security for some people at the same
time that Congress and the Clinton administration are deadlocked
over how to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency.
Without any changes, Social Security is projected to run short of
money to pay benefits starting in 2033.
</P>
<P>
   Under an earlier set of changes made in the 1980s to help
bolster Social Security's financial condition, the age at which
workers can claim full retirement benefits is already increasing
gradually over the next few decades to 67. Many of the proposals to
put Social Security on sounder footing call for further increases
in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the earnings limit would cost Social Security $22.7
billion in additional benefit payments over the next decade,
according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it would not have
an effect on the retirement system's financial condition over the
long run, the Social Security Administration said. That is because
the benefits increases would eventually be offset by a reduction in
the deferred benefits that would have been paid to workers starting
at age 70 to make up for the reductions in benefits paid from age
65 through 69.

 &HT;    AOL aims to provide service via wireless phones, pagers
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online announced a series of deals Monday
aimed at making the service available across the country to users
of wireless phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the arrangements, including a pact with BellSouth, AOL
hopes to gives subscribers a way to read e-mail, exchange instant
messages, check stock prices, get driving directions or check movie
listings _ the kind of features available via the Internet from
desktop computers using AOL and other online services. No financial
arrangements were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy, the Virginia-based
company made several sweeping moves to extend its service, which,
with 22 million subscribers, is already by far the largest Internet
membership. AOL has joined with paging services, a national phone
company and several of the companies that make the wireless devices
used by those services.
</P>
<P>
   With BellSouth, AOL has forged a deal to let subscribers get
instant messages and e-mail via the company's national wireless
data network.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth believes the deal will give a dramatic boost to its
wireless service, which has mostly appealed thus far to mobile
professionals. ``It puts us, for the very first time, in the
consumer marketplace,'' said Janet Boudris, senior vice president
for BellSouth Wireless Data. ``This also will raise awareness.
Frankly, our biggest challenge has been that people don't know
about the service.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has a similar deal with another national paging company,
Arch Communications. AOL declined to say when users would be able
to get the service via pager or what it would cost. AOL also
announced a deal with Sprint to deliver a version of AOL content
via at least some wireless phones by autumn. The company also
joined with manufacturers Nokia, Motorola and Research In Motion,
the company that makes the interactive pagers used by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, which recently announced plans to buy Time Warner,
Monday's announcements laid further claim to the future of
communications since technology has clearly been rushing in the
direction of wireless. In Europe, especially, wireless users have
been on the Net for months.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Patrick, newly named president of AOL wireless, cited
projections of 1.3 billion wireless users by 2005. Moreover, that
research predicts that within three years, one-third of Internet
users will be reaching the Net via a wireless device, he said. AOL
members send more than 110 million e-mails and 1 billion instant
messages every day. AOL also says that 70 percent of its member
households own a wireless phone, pager or both.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is by no means the only one to notice the trend.
EarthLink _ the nation's second-largest Internet provider _ also
announced a deal Monday to put its Internet service on phones from
Sprint. The arrangement extends the relationship of Atlanta-based
EarthLink to Sprint, its largest shareholder. ``With Sprint PCS, we
will be able to extend the EarthLink Internet experience to the
wireless world by providing a mobile version of the content and
services that we deliver daily to our members on their home or
office PCs,'' said Garry Betty, EarthLink chief executive officer.

3 MASSACRES IN CHECHNYA ARE DESCRIBED TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An investigator for Human Rights Watch told
Congress Wednesday that his group had documented three ``large
scale massacres'' by Russian forces in Chechnya. That prompted
Democratic and Republican senators to criticize the Clinton
administration for playing down Russia's conduct in the war to keep
its relationship with Moscow intact for other issues like arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D.-Dela., the ranking minority member of
the Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had
``tiptoed'' around human rights abuses in the war, because it was
``so worried about affecting other aspects of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms of South Carolina,
said, ``I am ashamed of our government and its comments made in
defense of Russia.'' Helms condemned what he called the portrayal
of the Chechen war as a ``legitimate battle against `terrorists.'''
</P>
<P>
   Biden described as wrong the manner in which the State
Department dealt with the capture and disappearance of a Russian
war reporter, Andrei Babitsky, who works for the U.S.-financed
Radio Liberty. Biden suggested that the department had not worked
hard enough to ensure his release.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter spoke Wednesday at a news conference in Moscow. He
surfaced on Friday in Dagestan and was flown to Moscow by Russian
authorities on Monday. Babitsky described his detention for more
than a month as apparently the work of a domestic Russian agency,
the Federal Security Service. A spokesman for the agency denied
that.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Foreign Relations Committee, Peter
Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said Russian forces had gone on a
``killing spree'' in the Aldi district of Grozny, the Chechen
capital, and had killed at least 62, and possibly more, civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was on Feb. 5, three days after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had met in Moscow with Acting President Vladimir
Putin. After that encounter, Albright praised Putin as a pragmatic
leader who appeared, she said, receptive to her request that
international workers be allowed into Chechnya to assess the needs
of those whose houses and livelihoods had been ruined by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckaert said the civilians in Aldi had been shot while waiting
in the street and in their yards for soldiers to check their
documents. Details of the killings in Aldi and two other sites were
obtained from interviews with survivors who fled to refugee camps
in Ingushetia, a neighboring republic to Chechnya where Bouckaert
has been based.

 &HT;    In this town, you make the sprawl
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The most popular electronic games these days
sharpen reflexes, promote computer skills and release the inner
barbarian in millions of (mostly) boys from ages five to 50.
</P>
<P>
   One exception among the gaming victors _ SimCity from Maxis
Systems, now in its third upgrade _ requires exacting patience,
promotes understanding of complex forces and releases the inner
mayor in thousands of aspiring architects, activists, planners and
urban empire builders.
</P>
<P>
   SimCity 3000, less than a year old and the most sophisticated
version, has captured the fancy of real Austin designers and
planners. And it is even saving lives in an impoverished border
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison between 3000 and 2000,'' said Jason
Andrus, an intern architect at O'Connell Robertson &AMP; Ass. and
admitted SimCity junkie. ``Everything from the graphics to the
increase in options for all aspects of city design to the budget
control are better. It has enough realism to suck me in and keep me
entertained for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   All three versions of the game _ classic, 2000 and 3000 _ are
based on the same principles. The player starts with a grid, then
adds zoning, utility lines, streets, schools, fire stations, police
stations, ports, airports and other municipal amenities, while
balancing a budget and overseeing the commercial climate of each
new city. Just as in any real metropolis, however, the player
cannot actually control the growth of population, industry and
trade, which respond to the combined forces of space, time,
material and human energy.
</P>
<P>
   The only informal rules: Make the right decisions and do no
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The second edition, which arrived in 1994, added color to
topographical maps that could be altered with seemingly infinite
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The player could now operate underground systems and better mass
transit, create ordinances, track budgets and put certain functions
on auto-drive. It also duplicated real trends, by allowing the
player to add technologies only when the game's date matched
historical availability.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, said SimCity 2000 favored single-use zoning
over mixed-use development, the Holy Grail of new urbanism, and
emphasized gimmicks, like natural disasters and futuristic bubble
communities.
</P>
<P>
   It was advanced enough that City of Austin architect Nathan
Schneider and colleagues played the game when rethinking Austin's
land development a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson: If you don't plan for development and its related
impacts, you will be faced with consequences that you cannot
address adequately,'' Schneider said. ``Then you will have limited
options, no time and always be acting in a crisis mode.''
</P>
<P>
   REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   SimCity 3000 is already taking hold in architecture schools and
offices, as well as in everyday game rooms, though the redesign has
attracted its share of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newest version has some amazing improvements and some
things I don't like,'' said Paul Thompson, an intern architect at
Graeber, Simmons and Cowan Architects. ``It allows you to get down
to a very close level and watch people walking on the streets and
cars driving by, which adds to the realism. But they have also made
the interface simpler and more nontechnical than it used to be,
which makes it easier for most players, but also makes it feel kind
of more like a cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the basic stuff that cities deal with is there,''
Andrus said. ``But whenever I experiment with radical changes, the
results defy realism. It seems to be based around the most
efficient and simple ways to lay a city out and manage it. I
usually do very well with 'donuts' and other dull layouts that
represent blunderous planning, similar to Plano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am currently experimenting with laying out a city based on
Austin's layout and Austin's history of development and I am
interested to see how the game responds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   COOL SCHOOL TOOL
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, SimCity has entertained and educated many, but makes
no demonstrable changes on the real world. Not so in El Cenizo, a
colonia in the Rio Grande Valley, where schoolchildren used the
related game, SimTown, to change to their environments for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took notebooks and pencils and walked up and down the two
streets, counting the number of residential, commercial and public
structures and noting other physical characteristics such as trash,
vegetation, paving,'' said Austin's Mary Burns, a technical program
associate with the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.
``They then 'recreated' these two main streets as a prototype of
their community using SimTown.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children played the game, their virtual El Cenizo kept
burning down because players had not created water bodies in their
communities. This emulated reality, since El Cenizo, like many
colonias, has little water, no public infrastructure or fire
station. So the children wrote up their findings and presented the
information to the city council and las promotoras (a group of
mostly female local leaders).
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was stunned and immediately began talking about
a campaign to increase awareness about the risk of fire,'' Burns
said. ``In my years of teaching (nine) and planning (five), it was
one of the most galvanizing experiences I've ever witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as entertaining as it is, when was the last time that Wing
Commander saved lives of border children?

SKYCYCLE RIDES INDUSTRY ROLLER COASTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, March 5 or later.) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, things seemed like they were moving forward for
Skycycle, a North Hollywood rock quartet with a loyal following in
the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The group was recording its debut album, ``Ones and Zeros,'' for
industry giant MCA. The album, produced by the band, was full of
well-crafted pop songs by singer-guitarist Steve Isaacs, a former
MTV video jockey who also spent 16 months starring in the road
company of the Who's ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc was initially scheduled for release last August. The
label issued a single, ``Last Girl on Earth,'' which received some
airplay before Isaacs got the news that the album had first been
delayed, then pulled from the schedule and would likely come out
sometime in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas season was full of big label acts like Fiona
Apple and the Foo Fighters, so we went with the logic,'' Isaacs
said. ``There wasn't a lot we could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The album languished on the shelf while Skycycle waited to hear
when it would finally hit stores. A little more than a month ago,
Isaacs got the call: Skycycle was dropped from MCA, but happily
free to take ``Ones and Zeros'' elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rehearsal scheduled that day and everyone showed
up,'' Isaacs recalled. ``I thought everyone would quit then and
there. And I expected it to hit me in the pit of my stomach, but
the feeling never came. Instead, we all felt relief. A few years
ago, before the Internet, it would have been scary and extremely
disappointing. But this actually felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Skycycle _ named for the steam-powered rocket
Evel Knievel used in 1974 to attempt to jump the Snake River in
Idaho _ has a well-designed Web site (www.skycycleonline.com)
that's been attracting fans and newcomers for several years. During
the making of the album, in fact, the band posted a detailed
recording diary and kept fans apprised of developments concerning
MCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ones and Zeros'' will soon be available for $13 through
Skycycle's site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more exciting to be captain of our own ship,''
Isaacs, 30, said Wednesday from his home near Universal City. ``I'd
much rather be captain of our own ship on the Internet than
swabbing MCA's decks. I have a fair amount of friends in the same
position.''
</P>
<P>
   With the many mergers and takeovers to hit the music industry in
recent years, Skycycle's story has a familiar ring. High profile
artists such as Aimee Mann and Michelle Shocked have sold their
albums through their Web sites, and it will probably be even more
common in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Web sites will be much more than merely promotional
tools,'' Isaacs predicted. ``I think they'll be the center of all
things. Look at it this way _ back in the old days, the Beatles and
Led Zeppelin would put out two records a year. A band not governed
by a marketing timetable is free to do as many as three records a
year if their fan base supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs, a professional Web designer, believes the music industry
is being hurt by its own apparent resistance to the burgeoning new
medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very real threat to the industry,'' he said. ``I'm
not pretending to be a sage, but my instincts tell me the old
marketing model is going under. These giant entertainment monoliths
are way too top heavy to get anything done in a timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Skycycle has several local gigs coming up, including the Joint
in West Los Angeles on March 18, the Gig/Hollywood on March 23rd
and Dragonfly in Hollywood on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs, a native of the San Jose suburb Cupertino, was hosting
the open mic at the Highland Grounds in Hollywood in 1991 when an
MTV talent scout asked him to audition. He landed the job, moved to
New York and appeared on the music video channel from 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nirvana hit, I was the only guy there who was also a
musician,'' Isaacs said. ``I had really long hair and got to talk
about all the bands I liked. But they axed me. I just wasn't much
of a team player and the honeymoon was over. See, the most
important thing for a VJ is to act like they really like the music.
When I'd introduce a Whitney Houston video, it was hard to fake
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After he lost the MTV gig, Isaacs remained in New York and
started a band. Soon, though, he was on the road as Tommy for 500
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got sick of it once,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
powerful music in that musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs formed Skycycle in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A.'s got a healthy music scene,'' he said. ``The town
suffered a slump after `95, and there's a big turnover of musicians
who come here to try and make it. And there's no real hometown feel
like there is in some smaller places. But it's still a great place
for bands.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: PEPSI PICKS J. WALTER THOMPSON TO PITCH ITS BOTTLED
WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With bottled water _ no color, no flavor, no image to speak of _
turning out to be one of PepsiCo's star performers, growing far
faster than colas and other carbonated soft drinks, the company
plans to spend millions of dollars to promote its Aquafina brand in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the next stage of the bottled water wars, Pepsi chose
the J. Walter Thompson agency, a part of the WPP Group, to develop
a campaign, expected to include television and print ads and a new
tag line, for Aquafina, which Pepsi began selling nationwide a
little more than two years ago. The size of the campaign, estimated
at $10 million and announced in December, shows how rapidly bottled
water has gained the respect of Pepsi executives and how big the
expectations are for Aquafina's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in the lucky position of being the No. 1 water, we
are trying to lead the movement back toward branding and fewer,
bigger brands dominating the business,'' said Dawn Hudson, Pepsi's
senior vice president for strategy and marketing, noting that
marketing budgets for most water brands have been $2 million or
less, until now. ``It will go from being a commodity business to a
branded business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of last year, sales of Aquafina rose 75
percent, compared with declining sales of Pepsi-Cola and a lower
double-digit growth rate for Mountain Dew. That was accomplished
with next to no marketing, compared with the millions spent on
advertising the soft-drink brands. In a conference call with
analysts last month, Roger A. Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman, said the
company wanted to increase supermarket sales, adding to its success
in vending machines and convenience stores, where people tend to
buy just a bottle at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just now in the process of getting the creative concepts
together,'' a Pepsi spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky, said of the ads,
which are expected to be on the air by summer _ prime water-selling
season. ``They will focus on Aquafina's purity and its
approachability, with a humorous edge.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These won't be the first ads for Aquafina. Pepsi briefly
broadcast a television spot last year that showed a well-sculptured
runner, implicitly an imported-water drinker, who comes to an
untimely end against the side of a truck. Meanwhile, two ``regular
guys'' are shown drinking Aquafina. It was supposed to underscore
the generic appeal of the brand. The Aquafina tag line, ``Take me
to the water,'' is also likely to be replaced with something else,
Jabbonsky added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, which only recently embraced bottled
water as an alternative to soda, sales of the nonsparkling variety
have grown explosively, from 750 million gallons in 1997 to more
than 1.2 billion gallons last year. The annual growth rate over the
last five years has been about 30 percent. ``Even the very strong
1990s U.S. stock market performance pales in comparison,'' said
Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting
firm that tracks beverage sales. He called bottled water in
containers of 1.5 liters or less ``the star category of not only
the bottled water industry, but also the entire beverage
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Water has been good for Pepsi. Aquafina is now the top-selling
brand in the small-bottle category, although it accounts for only
about 80 million cases a year, compared with about 1.4 billion for
Pepsi-Cola. The company makes money from each sale through
royalties paid by its bottlers. Using its existing distribution
network, Pepsi shipped Aquafina to the thousands of convenience
stores and gas stations where it already delivered other Pepsi
products, and its sales spiraled upward.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coca-Cola noticed the trend, too, and put its own bottled water,
Dasani, on the market last spring. The structure is different,
however; Coke sells packets of mineral additives, which are added
to the water, to its bottlers. But like Pepsi, Coke gets most of
its raw material from municipal water sources, not any
fancy-sounding natural spring. Between their distribution systems
and their choice of sources, both Coke and Pepsi are likely to have
the biggest-selling national water brands within the next year or
so, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, consolidation and other changes are shaking up
the bottled water market. In January, Groupe Danone, which owns the
Evian and Dannon brands, announced it was buying the San
Francisco-based McKesson Water Products Co., makers of Sparkletts,
Alhambra and other brands, for $1.1 billion. Naya Inc., which has a
popular water that was distributed for years by Coca-Cola
Enterprises, the chief Coke bottler in the United States, declared
bankruptcy in December, although it continues to sell its product.
The company's problems were largely caused by a drop in sales that
came when it lost its Coca-Cola Enterprises distribution a few
months before Coke rolled out Dasani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the top four or five companies are going to control
80 percent of the market,'' Bellas of Beverage Marketing said.
``It's changing now to the marketing wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said Pepsi's efforts would go beyond the ad campaign.
``It's not just about advertising,'' she said. ``It's presence
marketing, getting into more locations, having more types of
packages available, being part of more sports events.'' She called
water ``the ultimate thirst quencher'' and said Pepsi's goal was
``to sustain the momentum of the brand as the No. 1 brand.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, when Pepsi put an initial toe into the market by
testing Aquafina in Wichita, Kan., it was considered a risky move.
After all, what's the point of offering consumers water if you can
get them to drink higher-margin Pepsi or Mountain Dew? And to make
matters worse, Pepsi practically bragged about the fact that
Aquafina came not from an exotic-sounding mountain spring but was
simply tap water, cleaned up in a bottling plant. Where was the
appeal?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, American consumers by and large don't really care
about the source. And if bottlers don't have a Coke or Pepsi brand
to sell, they will find some other brand to meet the demand for
water. ``What Pepsi taught the industry was that coming from a
spring was not a requirement,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. ``It was a big gamble, and it
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether bottled water is capturing market share
that once belonged to sodas or whether it is displacing tap water
that people used to drink. Either way, ``Coke and Pepsi's entry
into this business is going to have a profound impact,'' said John
D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ``In
the years to come, a lot of the smaller regional spring waters will
have a more difficult time competing, even regionally, with the big
brands. The big ones will be marketed more heavily, and consumers
will demand them, and they will take up more and more shelf
space.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be one niche market that the biggest players are
overlooking, said Scott Wilkins, a beverage analyst for Deutsche
Bank. ``If you buy into this health-conscious movement, which is
pretty well documented, there will be a market for nonpurified,
spring-based water that neither Coke nor Pepsi is addressing,'' he
said. ``Maybe the economics don't work for them to buy a source,
but Perrier and Danone are doing it all over the world.''

 &HT;    What factors limit my speed on Internet?
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Could you please tell me the different aspects of speed involved
in an Internet connection, beginning with my computer/modem,
requesting a Web page and downloading something? Between port
speed, Internet speed and download speed, is there a way to
determine how good my connection is compared to a standard? Is my
connection faster than my friends'? I'm using a 56k bps modem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gordon Franklin
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do your friends' computers seem faster? Maybe you should
be using their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, that's one option. Let's get real. There are tons of
variables. Speed can depend on your location, phone line quality
and how many people are hitting the same site and downloading
items. Even the day of the week and time of day can affect speeds.
No matter how good your connection, if the page is full of graphics
and colors, it will take longer to view. It's like driving a
Ferrari down I-75 at rush hour; you can't go full speed because of
the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here's a way to check connection speeds. Most dial-up
programs will display how fast you are connecting to the modem of
your Internet service provider (ISP). You may have a 56k bps modem,
but it will make a difference if your ISP's modem only connects at
36k bps. Check your ISP's Web site for a list of modem numbers and
speeds. We checked EarthLink and AOL, and they have helpful
listings.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to turn off the computer after each use? When I
turn it on each day, I just leave it on all day. My husband says it
wastes electricity. Does booting it up a lot wear it out? _ Dorothy
Ringsrud
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So ask your hubby how much energy the average football
game consumes. Don't tell me he never falls asleep in front of the
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you turn off your computer after each use, and you use
it several times a day, the repair bill for a new power supply
could be hubby's wake-up call. Basically, you are right. It's OK to
leave your computer on all day. The power supply takes a hit when
you're constantly turning the computer off and on.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   How do I get graphics and photos from the Web into my Microsoft
PowerPoint presentation?
</P>
<P>
   _ W. Steven Allen
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's a no-brainer _ as easy as copying and pasting. Any
graphic, photo or link on the Web can be captured by ``mashing''
the mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Are you going to explain what ``mash'' means? Steven, if
you're on a Mac, hold down your mouse button over the item you want
to copy. Right-click if you're on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You will get a pop-up window with several options. Select
the copy option, go to your PowerPoint presentation and paste in
the item.

ALABAMA, FLORIDA AND GEORGIA FIGHT CRUCIAL WATER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the Southeast, where rivers, swamps and marshes
abound and high humidity and heavy thunderstorms are not uncommon,
few ever thought that a lack of water would become a major problem.
But urban growth, particularly in Atlanta, and droughts in the last
two decades have precipitated a battle among three states that
experts call one of the biggest water wars in the United States in
the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But many see this week as the beginning of the end to the war as
the states either resolve the conflicts themselves or wind up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves six rivers that have headwaters in Georgia
and then flow into Alabama or Florida. In 1997, the federal
government helped the three states form two commissions to work out
agreements on the management of the rivers. But those commissions
have not been able to agree, and now they face a deadline to do so
</P>
<P>
   David Feldman, a senior research scientist at the Energy,
Environment and Resources Center at the University of Tennessee,
described the problem, saying: ``In the Southeast, because of rapid
population growth and urbanization, especially in Atlanta, a lot of
these rivers are experiencing diverse and divergent demands. So the
same water that Atlanta has to use for its municipal water supply
is the water that upstream users need to support recreation and
flood control, and downstream users need to support agriculture,
urban growth and a very lucrative fishing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The disputes center on two river basins. One is the ACF basin,
named for the first letters of the rivers it includes, the
Appalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, which begins in
Georgia, runs along the Alabama border and ends up in the
Appalachicola Bay of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico. The other is
the ACT basin and includes the Alabama, Coosa and Tallapoosa
rivers, which begins in Georgia, runs through Alabama and ends up
in Mobile Bay in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's main concern is to make sure it has enough water from
the two basins to sustain the growth it expects for Atlanta in the
next 30 to 50 years. The city has experienced explosive growth
since the 1950s. Georgia is also concerned with the effects of
limiting water consumption on its agricultural areas in the
southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is trying to ensure that it, too, will have adequate
water for growth in Birmingham and other areas, and it is trying to
protect its industrial and navigation water needs throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is mainly concerned with protecting the northwestern
part of the state, the Appalachicola Bay area, which is an
important estuary, producing 90 percent of the state's oysters.
Water from the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers in Georgia merges to
form the Appalachicola River in Florida, which in turn supplies
important freshwater flow for oyster production in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The compact under which the three states are negotiating says
they must agree on a long-term water management plan, or allocation
formula, for the region. That formula must be signed by all three
governors. Then it will go before a federal commissioner. If that
official vetoes the formula, the states can renegotiate it or
decide to give up. In the latter case, or if the states do not come
up with an agreement at all, the disputes will probably go to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive for the states to forge their own agreement is
high, because they generally agree that their interests are at
greater risk if they have to abide by a court-ordered deal. But
their differences are stark enough that the negotiators on all
sides, who are in Atlanta for meetings of both commissions this
week, have expressed pessimism at their ability to resolve the
complex issues of these battles on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is somehow, through one of the most complex
situations I've ever seen,'' said Lindsay Thomas, the federal
commissioner who was appointed by President Clinton to oversee the
process, ``to provide for the needs of the three states without
destroying the ecology and environment of these river systems.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the two commissions held public meetings, with each
of the states' negotiators talking about their needs and proposals.
The day was supposed to be a preliminary deadline for the
commissions to come up with formulas the governors could sign. But
it was evident from the start that they were too far apart on the
issues to do that.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Tuesday's meetings, the commissions had scheduled
another series of meetings for this month. They have not yet
decided whether to extend once again their final May 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the sticking points center on Florida and Alabama
trying to get assurances from Georgia that it will not siphon off
too much water from the headwaters, thereby leaving the two
downstream states wanting.
</P>
<P>
   representatives of Georgia, which has been cast as a bully of
sorts by the other states and some environmental groups because of
its advantageous geographical position and the influence Atlanta
provides politically, maintain that their state is assuming the
most risk and so has to be the most careful.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kerr, Georgia's chief negotiator, said his state had to
make sure not to give away too much. ``If you're downstream,'' he
said, ``you can demand anything you want. But if you're upstream
and you're the one making the commitments to provide a certain
amount of water downstream, you have to be conservative. For us to
overcommit, just to make them feel good, would be foolish on our
part.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, the Tennessee scientist, said of the talks: ``Somebody
is going to have to blink, and make a compromise. Based on the
outcome of previous water wars, they will have to come to some
agreement, eventually, on the actual volumes of water that can be
withdrawn from the rivers. And then they will probably create some
sort of system to verify that. And it will most likely fall to an
independent tri-state authority to monitor the system.''

 &HT;    Staying in touch doesn't have to hurt your travel budget
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question these days _ thanks to the way technology
has changed our lives _ isn't whether a person can go home again.
Instead it is whether a person can really leave home now.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week away from work, out in the Pacific Northwest
where _ thankfully _ bears and steelhead trout outnumber computers.
Ten years ago, I really would have been out of touch. But (and I'm
not claiming this is a wonderful thing) it was very much like I
hadn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I traveled routinely, so I learned a lot
along the way about staying in touch. I'll leave the discussion of
the good and bad of that electronic tether for others, since there
isn't much we can do about that. The genie isn't just out of the
bottle, the bottle is shattered.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, we'll talk about practical ways of making it easier
and more affordable to stay connected. If you are a veteran
traveler, you probably know all this. But if you seldom venture far
from home, I may be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The first item on the list is e-mail. While there are ways with
a national Internet service provider to set up a laptop or a
desktop computer to dial in to the local access number or a
toll-free number to get your mail, normally that isn't the easiest
solution, especially for someone who isn't an experienced computer
user.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't often travel, a free Web-based e-mail account
makes good sense for this purpose. You won't have to reconfigure a
computer to use it. Instead, you can use any computer, including
those you'd find at someone's home or a library or one of the many
retail establishments that charge an hourly fee to let you use the
computer. All you need to do is fire up that computer's Web
browser, go to the start page of the free service you use, and
enter your user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of these services, so I'll just name a few.
Check out free e-mail at Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Microsoft
(www.msn.com) or AltaVista (www.altavista.com). If, like me and
several million others, you are an EarthLink customer, you can
check your mail from the Web (using your EarthLink user name and
password) at Www.springmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones are another way we keep in touch. Almost
everyone _ including a panhandler who stopped me on the street
recently asking for a quarter _ has one. You already know that your
cell phone almost certainly will work in another city. But you may
have a vague awareness that cellular companies tack on a roaming
charge for using your phone outside the home territory.
</P>
<P>
   I am a BellSouth Mobility customer. BellSouth no longer charges
a daily roaming fee (in the old days, the fee was about $1 a day).
But air-time charges are more expensive. I paid 59 cents a minute
for calls I placed in Portland, Ore. If I used the phone for
long-distance, that tacked on another 30 cents a minute. Frankly, I
didn't use the phone enough for the high charges to be a factor.
What did bother me, though, was that, because the cell phone has an
Atlanta number, people in Portland calling me had to pay
long-distance charges (and I was still liable for any per-minute
air-time charges). By the way, almost every cellular company _
including BellSouth Mobility, which offers the All-In-One Rate Plan
_ also has cellular agreements that charge the same rate for
long-distance and local calls.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't there long, so I didn't try to solve the problem. Had I
planned to stay, I might have looked into one of the cellular
telephone rental plans aimed at travelers.You can find out more
about them from In Touch USA at www.intouchusa.com or Cellhire at
www.cellhire.com. That way, I could have used a local number. On
the other hand, air-time charges (on top of a daily rental fee)
were actually higher than my roaming charges.
</P>
<P>
   Well, good luck on your trip. If you're like me, you'll be glad
to get home, where it's still possible to stay peacefully out of
touch.

 &HT;    Babies will have a ball with new program
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's no doubt where Knowledge Adventure
stands in the ongoing debate about the merits of computing for
infants. The company has recently released JumpStart Baby with Baby
Ball ($30; www.knowledgeadventure.com.) The Baby Ball is an
oversized blue push pad/roller ball. We connected this computer
peripheral, which comes with no installation instructions, to a
serial port and then installed the software. Ten-month-old Brooke
went to work. She turned to the monitor after seeing the bright
images and hearing the animated talking bear from the ``JumpStart
Baby'' learning software. Brooke's initial reaction was to beat on
the keyboard and play with the mouse, but when we placed the big
blue ball in front of her, she was intrigued and discovered quickly
that banging on the ball produced a noise or on-screen reaction.
She broke into a big smile, for instance, after pressing the ball
caused an animated toy chest to open. Weaker hands than Brooke's
might not be able to press down hard enough to activate the
software. But with practice and help, maybe this challenge can be
overcome. JumpStart Baby, meanwhile, reinforces the concepts of
cause and effect, color and sound _ and upholds Knowledge
Adventure's excellent reputation for educational software.
JumpStart Baby with Baby Ball is intended for ages 9 months to 24
months.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS, AMUSE YOURSELVES WITH AMELIA
</P>
<P>
   Good software for girls is so rare it's impossible not to find
lots to love with the lastest title from American Girl, Your
Interactive Notebook With Help From Amelia ($30 for Windows and
Mac; www.mattelmedia.com), which turns the popular children's books
by Marissa Moss into a fun and funky virtual diary. With sound
effects, stamps, tons of patterns and pens, password protection
and, most fun, an ``Ameliarizer'' that turns key words into wacky
illustrated type, this is a great introduction to what is
essentially desktop publishing. In a tutorial of sorts, the
9-year-old narrator walks the user through all the available tools.
On the downside the interface is not intuitive enough, requiring
adult help that undercuts the whole point of the program _ doing it
yourself. And finally, in what might be the best argument for using
the program, our third-grade critic, after initially spending an
hour or two on it, lost interest in the computer version and
devoted her time to her print journal with real stickers and real
crayon drawings. What parent can complain about that?

U.S. CERTIFIES COLOMBIA, MEXICO AS COOPERATIVE PARTNERS IN FIGHT
AGAINST DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration decided Wednesday not to
seek economic sanctions against Colombia and Mexico despite finding
that the flow of illegal drugs continues to grow from the two
countries into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both countries won praise from administration officials
who said that Colombia, the world's leading cocaine producer, and
Mexico, the main conduit of narcotics into the United States,
remained proven allies in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we will succeed only if consuming countries, producing
countries and transit countries work together, not pointing
fingers, but linking arms,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said. ``We're not demanding any more of (other countries) than we
would of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton certified Colombia and Mexico _ as well as 18
other countries identified as significant drug producers or
traffickers _ as cooperative partners in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, the administration denied
certification to Afghanistan and Burma for their failure to take
adequate measures against illicit cultivation, drug trafficking and
public corruption, which impedes prosecution of drug-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Four other countries _ Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay _
did not pass the administration's inspection, but were given
waivers to encourage the development of those democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the president to assess the drug-fighting
performance of 26 problem countries. Countries that are not
certified face substantial restrictions on most types of U.S.
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the annual certification process said that it is
ineffective and is more about politics than the fight against
drugs. In a letter to Albright, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. , and Rep.
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., called the administration's report
inaccurate and not objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no major progress in uprooting the drug cartels
that do business with virtual impunity in Mexico,'' wrote the
congressmen, who each chair subcommittees overseeing international
drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey dismissed congressional concerns
that Mexico's commitment to fighting drugs was just talk. ``If this
is a charade,'' he said, referring to Mexico's counterdrug efforts,
``it's the most expensive one I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that Mexico is spending more per capita on the
drug war than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's report said that Mexico saw a ``significant
increase in cocaine seizures, largely as a result of improved
maritime cooperation with the U.S.'' and record-low marijuana
cultivation due to aggressive eradication.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report said that Mexico's overall anti-drug
performance did not improve on 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though President Ernesto Zedillo has declared illicit production
and trafficking to be Mexico's main national security threat, the
government still lacks adequate resources to patrol the vast
trafficking routes in the Pacific, according to the report. It said
that up to 60 percent of the South American cocaine sold in the
United States arrives through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, which supplies over three-quarters of the world's
cocaine, coca production rose 20 percent last year, the report
said. However, the administration praised the country for capturing
30 ``significant Colombian drug traffickers'' last year and for
extraditing a Colombian citizen to the United States on narcotics
charges for the first time in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Ambassador Luis Alberto Moreno said that the four
years of decertification, which ended last year, hurt the country
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We`re moving in a totally different direction now,'' Moreno
said. ``What`s important is that we fight this problem together.
The aid package recognizes that this is a shared burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is reviewing an aid proposal from the Clinton
administration that would pump $1.6 billion into Colombia's effort
to eradicate coca and poppy production.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would provide U.S. training, intelligence and
equipment to the Colombian military as well as money to support
alternative crops for peasants currently growing coca.

<P>
   Tell a New Yorker that the symphony orchestra in Dallas is 100
years old, and the reaction will probably be surprise. The Dallas
Symphony Orchestra would like to change that.
</P>
<P>
   True, being 100 in Dallas is a little different from being 100
in, say, Philadelphia (where the orchestra is celebrating its
centennial this year as well). The Dallas Symphony's history has
followed a roller-coaster track of highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   The group that started in May 1900 as the Dallas Symphony Club
rose to see Antal Dorati and, briefly, Georg Solti as music
directors in the years after World War II. But it also had to
suspend operations during both world wars. It almost folded in the
1938-39 season, and in 1974-75, when Eugene Ormandy and the
Philadelphians were celebrating that orchestra's 75th anniversary,
the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was shut down for most of the season
because of a bankruptcy that nearly snuffed it out.
</P>
<P>
   But you get to reinvent yourself in America, and the Dallas
Symphony has forged a new identity as a healthy American orchestra.
In 1989, it opened the striking Meyerson Symphony Center, designed
by I.M. Pei. In 1994, it hired a young American music director,
Andrew Litton. In recent seasons the orchestra has visited Carnegie
Hall regularly, and this year it will make its second European
tour.
</P>
<P>
   It releases two to three CDs a year. Its composer's chair,
established in 1999, is filled by one of America's most successful
young composers, Lowell Liebermann. And the orchestra is aiming
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has a mandate to get Dallas within America's
top-tier orchestras,'' Litton said. ``It's a long-term project. I
think it will take 10 years. And another five before the world
notices.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million question (that being the size of the endowment
the orchestra's president, Eugene Bonelli, hopes to raise in his
quest for international renown) is whether it is possible to buy a
tradition as something more than a good, solid, middle-of-the-road
American orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, Dallas has devoted considerable
resources to putting its cultural life on the national, even
international, map. The downtown Arts District, where the Meyerson
Center is located, did not exist 20 years ago. The symphony and the
Dallas Museum of Art had been housed in outdated buildings in a
complex known as Fair Park, a 15-minute drive from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The vision and backing of a few community leaders helped create
the culture district out of whole cloth. The Dallas Museum of Art
opened its new Arts District premises in 1984; the Meyerson
followed in 1989. The Nasher Sculpture Park is to open in 2001, a
gift of the Dallas real estate magnate and sculpture collector Ray
Nasher.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Nasher and others dream of a new performing arts center
for the opera company, the last Fair Park holdout. All of this,
they hope, will gain the city a new cultural standing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the $82.5 million Meyerson Center _ which, if it had
been named for its lead backer, would be known as the Ross Perot
Center _ proves that with enough vision and money, you can indeed
elevate your status. Justly famous for its architecture, the hall
is also known for its sound. Its acoustical designer, Russell
Johnson, equipped the wood-lined auditorium with huge resonance
chambers, curtains that retract at the touch of a button and a
42-ton acoustic and lighting panel that looks like something out of
a science fiction fantasy as it rises and falls on wire cables over
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   From the audience's standpoint, the sound is impressive. But not
all the musicians agree. ``It can be a tricky hall to play in,''
the principal clarinetist, Gregory Raden, said. ``Onstage, you can
have trouble hearing each other.'' Orchestra players were quoted as
saying the same thing to Donal Henahan of The New York Times when
the hall opened.
</P>
<P>
   An important figure on the Meyerson's building committee was
Bonelli, a symphony board member for 15 years. In 1993 he switched
over to take charge of the orchestra's administration. As president
of the Dallas Symphony Association, Bonelli has gone out of his way
to stress his commitment to making the orchestra one of the best in
the country. Formerly a dean of the School of the Arts at Southern
Methodist University, Bonelli brings plenty of musical knowledge,
if not practical experience, to his task.
</P>
<P>
   But what will be most crucial to the endowment campaign is his
ability to raise money. Still profiting from the groundswell that
the Meyerson's opening created in the community, the Dallas
Symphony has a lot more backing than it did in, say, 1974, when it
went bankrupt during a period of local economic prosperity. Then,
businesses chipped in a mere $28,000, a pittance even in 1974
dollars. Now Texas Instruments alone has pledged to help underwrite
the orchestra's regular classical series for the next three years,
to the tune of $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Local businesses have also contributed to the recent redesign of
the Web site dallassymphony.-com. Four of them have worked with the
orchestra to create a technologically up-to-date site equipped with
such bells and whistles as live 32-bit Webcasts of concerts,
e-commerce and, come June, fully automated ticketing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag over three years: more than $10 million. Even
taking into account that this figure includes in-kind services from
the companies involved, it's a whopping sum that occasions envious
glances from other American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another place the Dallas Symphony spends money is on recording.
Its label, Delos, stresses the importance of a two-way
relationship. What this means in practice is that the orchestra
itself covers the musicians' fees for recordings. Delos pays the
costs of preproduction, bringing in equipment, and marketing and
distribution. In these tight times for classical recording, there
is a feeling in the industry that orchestras will, more and more,
be going Dallas' route and assuming part of their own recording
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Symphony will also need to spend money to attract the
top-flight players necessary to achieve its high-flown goals, and
to add at least 10 to its current roster of 92. But however much it
spends, it may not be able to compete with all the cultural
advantages of the Northeast or the tradition of an orchestra like
Philadelphia's, which has lured away both the concertmaster, David
Kim (who spent the 1998-99 season in Dallas), and the principal
trumpeter, David Bilger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have an impact on the history of music,'' Kim said.
``I don't think I can do that in a Dallas or a Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   It is going to take a lot more money to change that. It also
means that an improvement in musical standards that began in 1977
under the previous music director, Eduardo Mata, and that has
continued since 1994 under Litton will have to be pushed further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra's level of technical expertise wouldn't need
apology in any city in the world,'' said Scott Cantrell, the new
music critic of The Dallas Morning News, which sponsors the
orchestra's main concert series. ``Whether Litton is one of the
profound and compelling interpreters of today is another
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton said he felt a ``closed'' quality about the orchestra
under his predecessor. Opening it up and helping it move toward a
more individual, freer playing style is a big part of his
self-assigned task. The repertory Litton favors tends toward big,
splashy works like Walton's ``Belshazzar's Feast'' or the Mahler
symphonies. Not much Haydn or Mozart appears on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players, there is a consensus that Litton's energy and
drive have led to more touring, more recordings, more exposure. But
he has proved an uneven interpreter. His energy, expressed in
Bernsteinian flourishes onstage, can be compelling, but it can also
spill over into coarseness. His tempos are audibly idiosyncratic.
He also has a predilection for the loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brass pushed to the very edge of vulgarity, and then,
just, drew back,'' a critic from The Times of London wrote of a
1997 performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony at the Royal
Albert Hall. ``It seemed an emblem of the entire performance.
Litton would dare extremes of tempo and dynamics which, in other
hands, could well curdle into sentiment or flash into mere
histrionics. Yet he pulled it off.''
</P>
<P>
   This description of a kind of tightrope act, of snatching a
decent performance from the jaws of something far less classy,
could apply to a number of Litton's live and recorded performances.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from reviews, the orchestra can make a good first
impression, which it may not sustain on longer acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistically, we're in a holding pattern,'' said Gregory
Hustis, the principal horn player. Audiences may feel the same way.
The last five or six seasons under Mata, and the first seasons
under Litton, were completely sold out. But attendance has declined
slightly over the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Litton seems unconcerned. His contract runs until 2003, and he
is clearly content with his position. ``You can tell when things
are right,'' he said. ``Why leave when we're on the up curve?''
</P>
<P>
   However harrowing the history, there can be little question from
the present perspective that the Dallas Symphony is a success
story. ``When I first came, we played background music while people
stood in line to get swine-flu shots at the North Park Mall,'' said
Hustis, a 24-year veteran. ``The musician's lot in the Dallas
Symphony is incomparable, it's so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   And some players see nothing wrong with embracing this new
status as an eminently respectable second-tier American orchestra
and leaving it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For who we are and what we are, we do a pretty good job,''
said the flutist Harvey Boatright, who has played with the Dallas
Symphony for 40 years. ``If it makes some people happy to think
that we're shooting for the top, well, fine.''

 &HT;    If a program won't open, try the logical approach
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It occurred to me, while trying to help a gentleman
whose program wouldn't run, that the logician's art _ or is it
science? _ can often be used to solve a software-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that one day your favorite program refuses to run,
returning instead an error message that reports it cannot find
wumpus.dll. Immediately we must determine whether this is the first
time you've run the program since installing it or if it has been
running properly up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, then we can assume that wumpus.dll previously
could be found but now cannot. For the sake of abbreviating this
enterprise, we will instead operate on the former premise, that you
have just installed the program.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to determine if wumpus.dll in fact exists on
the computer. To help us with this, we could go to the Start menu
and use Find. Instead, we'll call up Windows Explorer, pull down
the Tools menu, and select Find and then Files or Folders. Enter
wumpus.dll and make certain the dialog box is set to search the
entire hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If the search comes up with wumpus.dll, then obviously it is
misplaced. If the search does not find it, then it must exist
elsewhere, the only other logical place being, of course, the
CD-ROM from which you installed the program. Oh yes, it can happen.
An installation program can, for whatever reason, fail to install a
necessary file.
</P>
<P>
   If the file is not found on the hard drive, you have two
options. You can reinstall the program, or you can look for
wumpus.dll and try to install it manually. We'll examine the second
option, since the first needs no further explanation and, having
failed once, may fail again.
</P>
<P>
   Insert the CD-ROM in the drive and, once again using the Find
tool in Windows Explorer, search the entire disk for wumpus.dll. If
this fails, search one more time, but this time just for wumpus.
Sometimes programs on an installation disk have a letter clipped
off, and it might be something like wumpus.dl.
</P>
<P>
   If the search still comes up empty, and if reinstallation did no
good, then in the words of a great logician of the past, you are
out of luck and had better look up the number for tech support.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you find wumpus.dll, then it remains for you to
determine where, on the hard drive, your program expects to find
it. Occasionally the error message itself will provide a complete
path name. Otherwise, there are two main options _ somewhere in the
program's own directory or in the Windows directory. Try Find once
again, this time searching the entire hard drive for just the
suffix, using a wild card, like this: .dll.
</P>
<P>
   This will turn up every dll file on your system, and you'll find
a huge nest of them in C:(backslash)windows(backslash)system. Try
copying wumpus.dll there and see what happens. If it's a
proprietary extension, you'll probably find others in the program
directory or a subdirectory thereof. Try putting it there.
</P>
<P>
   More often that not, in my experience, this sort of logic will
get you up and running.

WHAT PLANET IS HE FROM?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, March 5 or later.) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garry Shandling has enjoyed a pretty good run making light of
his so-called inadequacies _ his hair, his lips, his bad luck with
women. It's an act that's so finely honed that it's difficult to
know where the persona ends and Shandling begins.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, before this interview began, Shandling asks what
his current co-star John Goodman had to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   REPORTER: He said all he had to do was look at you and he'd
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   SHANDLING: I'm insulted by that.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling maintains that he never intends to be funny. So when
people laugh at him, his feelings are hurt. Having said that, he
spends the next hour attempting to be as funny as possible, reeling
off self-deprecating one-liners and unprintable jokes with gleeful
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling clearly has never lost his love for stand-up comedy;
in fact, he says he's anxious to return to the stage and ``see
where I'm at.'' How he'll find the time isn't exactly clear. He
finished the celebrated ``The Larry Sanders Show'' for HBO last
year, but he's looking to return to television with a series he's
developing. (He would not star.) He also has a movie that he'd
write and direct, and likewise expresses an interest to continue
acting in films.
</P>
<P>
   His current movie _ ``What Planet Are Your From?'' _ marks
Shandling's first attempt at carrying a feature film. He plays an
alien sent to earth to impregnate a woman, thus giving his people a
foothold on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The film's alien motif affords it plenty of opportunity to
comment on the Mars-Venus differences between men and women. But at
its core, Shandling (who co-wrote the movie) is still playing an
extension of his bemused persona, albeit one without genitalia.
(More on that later.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, Shandling discusses why he finds women so baffling, how
his love scenes with co-star (and friend) Annette Bening helped
Warren Beatty, and the possibility of a Garry Shandling self-help
video series coming to stores in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``What Planet Are You From?'' suggests that men and women
will never understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, that starts almost from the moment we're born. Whatever
training I received as a boy was very limited. I saw sex education
films, but there was no talk from the parents, no sisters in the
house. So I just figured you had to be cool, like the guys in the
movies, guys who always had some great come-on line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever come up with a line?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not one that worked. One time, I approached a woman at a bar
and she said, ``Don't even bother.'' And I said, ``Is that an
Indian name?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And things have never improved?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's always been a struggle, just like in the movie. As a
kid, you see your parents and you think, ``Is this what it's
supposed to be like? Am I supposed to stare at the TV all the time
Mom is talking?'' Because that's what my Dad did. So when I did and
the girl got mad, I was confused.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This movie, then, is somewhat an educational film.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's my gift to men and women everywhere. It's what I do. I
help others emotionally. Now I just need to come out with a Garry
Shandling self-help videotape series to really spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The film gets a lot of mileage from the alien's implanted
genitalia, which gives off a rather distinct humming noise when
aroused.
</P>
<P>
   A: I can no longer have a protein shake without getting turned
on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think that's an important fact for people to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs) Well, in these alien movies, there's always one
discerning factor that allows us to tell that someone is the alien.
And I thought, ``What's never been done?'' The humming penis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Judging from all the humming in the movie, you must have
liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A: At first I thought it was too broad a concept, but it just
kind of hung in there, so to speak. After every draft, I'd say,
``Do we want to take out the humming penis?'' Sometimes I'd be
asking this question on the telephone, and I'd get a lot of strange
looks from people in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The movie also has a surprise _ a Garry Shandling nude scene.
Were you anxious about disrobing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anxious is not the word! ... . I had never done a nude scene
before, and I had received many requests from the ``Larry Sanders''
fans to see more. So I said, ``OK, I'll be naked from the back just
to please people.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You are a giver.
</P>
<P>
   A: My (butt) is a giver. But getting back to the humming penis
... .
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought we had pretty much covered that subject ... .
</P>
<P>
   A: What I wanted to say was, wouldn't it be great if women had
something where we could tell if they were interested? A little
beeping sound, maybe. I wish they would have those flashers like
those airport guys on the runway that say, ``Go ahead. You're
clear!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've never read any of those body language books?
</P>
<P>
   A: What do they know? I've never known if a woman is interested.
I've even had the experience where after I've made love to them,
I've thought, ``Oh, I made a mistake. They weren't interested.''
And that's way too late to realize that. You've already embarrassed
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you're good friends with your co-star Annette Bening
and her husband, Warren Beatty, were you a little uncomfortable
filming a love scene with Annette?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just the opposite. I told her we should start practicing the
love scenes years before we shot the movie. She said, ``OK,'' but
Warren wasn't too happy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But then she actually became pregnant while you were shooting
the film.
</P>
<P>
   A: Warren thanked me for that. He said Annette would return from
those scenes she did with me very turned on and ready to go. It
made it easier for him. The energy generated by the movie's sexual
encounter was enough to put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and Annette had sexual tension?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have sexual tension with myself, with all women friends and
with all people who interview me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Switching gears then to another kind of tension, was it a
relief to finally make this movie after being embroiled in lawsuits
with your former manager, Brad Grey?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a relief. But I have a great ability to
compartmentalize my life. The lawsuit started during the last
season of ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' which was the best season of
``The Larry Sanders Show,'' ironically. So it didn't affect the
work. I dropped the lawsuits the moment I showed up on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you miss the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: I miss the show when I bump into someone who was never on the
show and I think, ``Gee, they would have been great.'' Or I have
some ``Hollywood'' experience that would have fit right into the
show. I miss the cast. But I don't miss the grind at all. This is
as relaxed as I've been in 12 years and I like that. But things
will start humming again pretty soon, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Humming?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bustling, thriving ... things will be in full swing. (Pause)
Can we just stop now? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   'Tis must be the season for driving games because another one
has hit the shelves and will keep you blazing for weeks. Sony's
Colin McRae Rally ($50; www.playstation.com) is a hyper-realistic
rally game. If nothing else, this shows how much of a pain it must
be to be a rally racer. Besides choosing a car, you can also adjust
tires, gears, engines ... just about anything and everything that
will affect your racing. With Colin McRae Rally, you also have the
opportunity to race in all types of settings and on all types of
surfaces and you must adjust the car for each terrain. This serves
the serious gamer well, but sets a fairly steep learning curve for
the non-pro. While we'd like to recommend this to everyone, this
game better suits the gearhead.
</P>
<P>
   Say Soul Fighter in your best Sean Connery accent. Say it again
like you mean it, like you're angry. There you go. That's the
coolest part of this Red Orb ($40; Dreamcast; www.redorb.com) game
for the Dreamcast, a free-range, 3-D fantasy adventure/fighter with
befuddling swooping/panning camera work that ruins otherwise solid
game play. Splendid graphics show off the power of the Sega's new
superconsole and brilliant animation shows the depth and variety
gleaned from Red Orb's epic warrior arsenal. Alas, it's not so cool
when the cinematography lurches about in an effort to afford you a
better view of the fireballs being hurled you way or the sword
that's poised to prick your buff behind; it only manages to stymie
the fluid grace of an otherwise grand-scope 3-D fighter.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Who wants Regis Philbin sitting in their computer monitor?
Apparently, a lot of people, judging from the brisk sales of Disney
Interactive's Who Wants to be a Millionaire ($20; Windows PCs;
www.disneyinteractive.com). When we installed the game here, half
the Technopolis staffers stopped what they were doing to wait in
line for a chance to play the game. With work from the developers
of You Don't Know Jack, the game has a similar feel to that quiz
show, but its clear intent is to replicate the TV show as closely
as possible. You've got lifelines, all the music from the show, and
most importantly, Regis. He mercilessly taunts you when you do
badly and pounces on you with ``Is that your final answer?'' when
you hesitate. The game plays well, but has a bad habit of asking
the same questions you've answered in previous games. It also would
have been nice to have Regis read the questions out loud. An online
component to the show's popular Web site will soon allow users to
play along live on the Internet with the same questions that appear
on the show. Until that goes live, however, this CD-ROM should
satisfy any would-be millionaire's trivia craving.

 FOR THOSE WHO DANCE AND THOSE WHO DREAM ABOUT IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)  
(af) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boyd Gaines emerged from his dressing room after a
matinee of ``Contact,'' famished and drained. He apologized for the
time he had taken in collecting himself, and when it was suggested
that post-performance recovery is the entitlement of every dancer,
he shot his visitor a withering look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got that absolutely right,'' a member of the ensemble
chimed in as he passed in the hallway beneath the Vivian Beaumont
Theater, where the hit dance-play is now ensconced. ``Boyd (begin
italics)is(end italics) a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a hint of ribbing, along with comradely encouragement,
in his colleague's voice, which changed the color of Gaines'
disposition to one of outright embarrassment. This is clearly not a
performer who gazes into a mirror and thinks: Hey there, Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called me about doing the part, I kept trying to
talk them out of it,'' Gaines said a short time later over a plate
of roast chicken and steamed vegetables in the cafeteria of his
alma mater, the Juilliard School, across West 65th Street from
Lincoln Center. ``I literally thought Susan Stroman had mixed me up
with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Stroman, the director-choreographer of ``Contact,'' did not
have the wrong number. Though Gaines did not know an extension from
an under-arm side by side, he was the performer Stroman wanted as
the central figure in the final, swing-dance-inspired entry in her
trio of dance plays.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, set to recorded music ranging from Bizet to the
Beach Boys, has proved so popular it has moved from Lincoln
Center's smaller Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater to the larger,
Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont, where it is in previews before
officially reopening on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that Gaines did not make a persuasive enough
case against himself, for his moving performance as Michael Wiley,
the successful if suicidally lonely New Yorker of the show's title
piece, is one of the most emotionally rewarding facets of
``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   That his face is familiar to regular theatergoers _ he won Tony
Awards in 1989 and 1994 for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and ``She
Loves Me'' _ deepens the audience's own contact with the
production. It's a distinction he shares with one other actor in
the 22-member ensemble, Karen Ziemba, the star of the second
offering, ``Did You Move?,'' who turns in an equally affecting
portrayal as a Queens homemaker browbeaten into submission by her
bullying husband.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these stage veterans serve as the show's touchstones,
reminding us that what we are watching here is more than dance
theater _ it's dramatic art.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Contact'' a second time, you are struck afresh by the
cleverness of Stroman's casting choices. In ``Did You Move?,''
Ziemba's 1950s housewife breaks into a comic dream ballet in an
Italian restaurant, but it's the actress' infectious Imogene
Coca-ish exuberance, rather than the dancing alone, that gives the
piece its buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gaines seeks out the girl of his dreams during a
hallucinatory hour set in a dance club, and contrary to the cliche,
he is not transformed by love into a latter-day Gene Kelly; he is
just a guy trying to take a few steps in a new direction. (The
curtain-raiser, ``Swinging,'' is a playful takeoff on an
18th-century Fragonard painting, ``The Swing.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was creating the pieces, I wanted people to be able to
relate to Boyd and to Karen, to be able to empathize with them,''
Stroman said. ``That is indeed what anchors the second and third
pieces. Karen, in addition to being an accomplished dancer, never
changes from being that middle-class housewife. Boyd has a very
vulnerable quality, and the character of Michael Wiley is about
somebody taking chances in unfamiliar territory. And, the fact is,
Boyd himself is taking chances in unfamiliar territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their paths never cross in the show _ Ziemba appears
only in the second piece, while Gaines' performance comes after the
intermission _ you can feel how much of the evening is molded to
the contours of their personalities, how much depth of character
and feeling their presence adds. The stories Stroman and the author
John Weidman have created are linked in all kinds of nuanced ways;
one of them is in the idea of identity, of accepting yourself for
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Another is in the tension between holding back and letting go,
of the damage done to the psyche in bottling up one's emotions, and
the surprising payoffs in opening the heart to all of life's
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   To dance or not to dance: that is the question in ``Contact''
for the troubled and, as the evening progresses, increasingly
complex characters. Ziemba's housewife is shriveling inside because
she is not allowed to express herself. Gaines' adman is
self-destructing because he does not know how to express himself.
One is desperate to dance; the other desperately needs to learn
how.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The characters' attitudes, it turns out, are mirrors for those
of the actors. The Georgia-born Gaines says that as a Juilliard
acting student he was a complete washout in dance classes. ``They
hated me,'' he recalled with a laugh. ``They said, `If you don't
learn a pirouette, we don't know what we're going to do with
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba, on the other hand, did little but pirouette as a little
girl growing up outside Detroit, and imagined herself with a
classical career. ``I danced with the Ohio Ballet,'' she said one
afternoon, while sitting in the lobby of the Beaumont. ``I wanted
to be a concert dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines and Ziemba, both Manhattanites and both married, also
have both been subjected to the proverbial ups and downs of careers
on the stage. After years of well-thought-of work, both had highly
visible disappointments a few years back, Gaines in a Roundabout
Theater Company revival of Stephen Sondheim's ``Co.'' that failed
to transfer for an anticipated commercial run on Broadway; Ziemba
in the slender Kander and Ebb musical ``Steel Pier.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant a great deal to both actors that Stroman asked them to
create original musical characters with such identifiably human
foibles.
</P>
<P>
   I have had a lot of people, especially men, come up to me and
say, `I'm that guy who can't dance,''' Gaines said. One of his
character's most endearing moments in ``Contact'' comes when,
nursing a drink at a bar, he finally summons the courage to join
the Girl in the Yellow Dress (Deborah Yates) on the dance floor,
but his body refuses to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This character's journey is about bravery _ you can't be truly
brave unless you are truly afraid,'' Gaines said. ``We've all known
this person: socially adept, but unable to make personal
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some marshaling of courage for Gaines to overcome his
inhibitions about dancing, especially because it was with a
Broadway-caliber corps. The first weeks of the initial workshop
production, in a rehearsal room, felt like a foreign-language
tutorial to him: ``They were teaching us to do the steps. I equated
it with learning Russian: `OK, here are 40 new words.'''
</P>
<P>
   His dancing partner, Yates, was a huge help _ ``she was
incredibly patient, and later she forced me to lead her'' _ but at
some point, he became so conscious of his body that he stopped
thinking like an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stro kept saying, `You're not acting,''' Gaines said, invoking
Stroman's nickname. `` `You're just doing the steps.'''
</P>
<P>
   He and Yates practiced until Gaines felt confident he would not
look foolish. ``Now, it's like juggling,'' he said. ``It's getting
a certain number of balls in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba, unlike Gaines, had worked with Stroman on several other
shows, from the Kander and Ebb Off Broadway revue ``And the World
Goes 'Round'' to ``Crazy for You'' on Broadway, and her knowledge
of dance proved as essential to ``Contact'' as was Gaines'
peripheral experience of it. The wife in ``Did You Move?'' is an
archetype, a woman frozen in a servile role in a loveless marriage;
an actress of warmth and some comic skill was required to make her
more than merely pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a change for Ziemba to discover a character through
snippets of classical music, rather than the traditional
musical-comedy accouterments of abundant dialogue and song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I did had to do with the music it was connected
to,'' she said. In ``Did You Move?'' the wife passes into a trance
each time her husband, played by Jason Antoon, leaves the table for
the buffet. ``At first, the music has a lot of plucks of the
violin: she's discovering her feet, it's prickly, it's not total
abandon yet,'' Ziemba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how movement and body language and the right kind
of music underneath creates total understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, the variations Ziemba and Gaines have discovered
in the harmony between music and movement that give ``Contact'' the
quality of a complete piece of musical theater, even if it is not a
traditional one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this physical show going on and this emotional show
going on,'' Gaines said. ``The most fun is when I feel I have them
in balance.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Plenty of sites devoted to all things Macintosh
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you own a Macintosh, it sometimes feels that the
world is stacked against you. Although things are better than they
once were, many programs only come in versions for Windows and PCs,
and the lion's share of computer magazines are oriented toward the
PC.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same on the Web. While most of the computer information
there addresses the problems of the majority of American users who
run Windows, some excellent sites specialize in Macintosh
information.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious starting point on our Big Mac hunt is Apple
Computer's own site at www.apple.com. Because most Macintosh users
are passionate about the brand, you probably won't mind the
promotional nature of much of the information on the site. But
there's much more here than hype.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find tabs at the top of the opening page that can take
you to areas for customer support, the company store and _ among
other things _ a way to download the latest version of QuickTime
(used by both Macs and PCs to view video and images). Also, take
some time to click on the tab called iReview to get some excellent
recommendations on Web sites for news, travel, music, sports and _
of course _ the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Mac addict, then a no-brainer choice is to drop in
over at MacAddict.com (macaddict.com). You'll find all the news and
reviews that the most dedicated Apple-ite could want. Also, you'll
get general industry news. For instance, last week there were
stories about computer hackers, Y2K and the Microsoft antitrust
settlement hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tabs also will take you to the top Macintosh sites on the Net,
as well as to an area that will attempt to help you with any
problems you're having with the Mac or software for it. Make sure
you try out the tab labeled Fun, because that's where you'll hear
about the latest games for the Mac as well as find some freeware
and shareware games and fun programs for downloading. Also, if
you're into music files on MP3, you'll find some here, as well as
software for playing them.
</P>
<P>
   Another site worth visiting is called the Mac Observer at
www.macobserver.com/. This is a serious site for people who really
are obsessive about everything Apple. The Observer is fun to read.
For instance, a recent article talked about Apple's fiscal
first-quarter earnings failing to meet analysts' estimates. Then,
beneath that article, there was something labeled ``The Mac
Observer Spin'' discussing the wisdom of the Gulfstream V jet used
by Steve Jobs, taking a mild jab at Jobs and pointing out that
``this sort of thing is actually important to Wall Street types.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features for news junkies is the listing of
clickable links to various news stories about Apple and the
Macintosh. Because newspapers and even computer magazines
ordinarily don't offer great depth of Macintosh coverage, you'll be
able to supplement that diet with richer fare here.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you will want to take a look at Inside Mac Games. Most
computer users, including Mac fanatics, like games, and this site
offers advance views of some of the most popular ones. While you
can find dozens of Web sites that offer game reviews, this site
does an excellent job of providing the Macintosh perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You can do more than just read game reviews, too. Inside Mac
Games offers you the chance to download demo versions of some of
the popular games. While these demos won't be enough for a serious
game player, they do provide a way to check out how a game works so
that _ before you drop $50 to $70 on a new game _ you can find out
if you'll enjoy playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Hints also aid the game-impaired by helping solve some of the
problems that stop beginning gamers and may be informative enough
to let a grown-up compete successfully with a child.

PROSECUTORS WIN POINT IN LOUIMA CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal judge in the trial of three police
officers accused of a cover-up in the assault on Abner Louima
instructed the jurors Wednesday that they could convict the
defendants even if they were unconvinced that the officer they
supposedly tried to protect took part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The jury charge, by Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, was a victory for
federal prosecutors because it allows the jury to find the three
officers _ Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese _ guilty
of conspiring to cover up Schwarz's role in the attack even if they
think that Schware innocent, as he asserts. Schwarz was
convicted of assaulting Louima last June.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the trial in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
the government has argued that Schwarz restrained Louima as he was
tortured and then, in a blizzard of telephone calls, forged a pact
with Bruder and Wiese to craft a false story to get himself off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``In determining whether one or more of the defendants are
guilty of conspiring to obstruct justice,'' Nickerson told the
jury, ``you need not determine the extent of any role the defendant
Schwarz may have played in the sexual assault.'' The judge also
counseled the jury that any evidence suggesting that Schwarz was
inside the bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush
as Louima was attacked was not, in itself, enough to convict the
three men of hatching a cover-up plot.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schwarz was found guilty last year of pinning Louima to
the floor while another officer, Justin Volpe, thrust a broken
broomstick into Louima's rectum, the question of Schwarz's role in
the attack was one of the focal points of the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution presented several witnesses, including Louima,
who suggested that Schwarz was in the bathroom on the night of the
assault, Aug. 9, 1997. The defense put on a case _ based on the
testimony of both Schwarz and Volpe _ that rested on the
supposition that the defendants were telling the truth when they
said Schwarz was not in the bathroom, and that therefore there
could not have been a conspiracy to lie on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three defendants have said that the jury charge
was unfair and that, by supporting it, the government had changed
its trial strategy midstream.
</P>
<P>
   Permitting the jury to convict ``despite the absence of proof of
at least Schwarz's presence in the bathroom,'' Schwarz's lawyer,
Ronald Fischetti, wrote to the judge, ``would not only permit the
government to constructively amend its theory of the case but would
cause undue confusion among the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having seen and heard the battle lines drawn over whether or
not Schwarz was in the bathroom _ through the testimony of Abner
Louima, Eric Turetzky, Mark Schofield, Justin Volpe and Charles
Schwarz,'' the letter continued, ``being told that Schwarz need not
have played any role in the assault would be difficult to
comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor in the case, said at a
conference with the judge last week that a conspiracy to obstruct
justice could exist even if the underlying crime _ namely Schwarz's
part in the attack _ never happened. He added that the wording of
the judge's instruction was ``simply the law.''
</P>
<P>
   After being charged, the jury was sent out at about 10:30 a.m.
Three hours later, they asked to be read the testimony of Sgt.
William Hargrove, a former Internal Affairs investigator who
conducted the first interview of Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove testified that, during that bedside interview in Coney
Island Hospital, Louima said he was never paraded through the 70th
Precinct station house with his pants and underwear around his
knees, but had them pulled down only after he was in the bathroom.
In later statements and at trial, Louima said his pants fell at the
front desk and he was led to the bathroom with his buttocks and
genitals exposed.

 &HT;    Media buzz sends Smoking Gun digging for obscure documents
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the world, or at least the portion of it that
watches the Fox network, was wondering if the hapless marriage
between multimillionaire Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger was going
to last as long as the TV show did, the Smoking Gun Web site was
busy checking out the facts.
</P>
<P>
   They found out that Rockwell, with an estimated net worth of
about $2 million, also had a restraining order placed on him by a
former girlfriend nine years ago. According to the public court
documents Smoking Gun obtained, the girlfriend, Debbie Goyne, told
the court that Rockwell would ``find her and kill her.'' All of the
offical documents are posted for anyone to see on the TSG Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of this sordid story is old news now. NBC's
``Dateline'' interviewed Rockwell, who said he and Ms. Conger are
probably not going to grow old together.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about millionaires getting hitched on national TV.
It's about the Web site that's in the business of ferreting out
legal documents of all kinds _ scholars call them primary source
materials _ on the Web for anyone with an interest in current
events or pop culture to look at.
</P>
<P>
   This Web site should not be confused with Matt Drudge's Drudge
Report (www.drudgereport.com). Drudge relies on tipsters and
disgruntled employees faxing documents to him under cover of night.
Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com) practices online enterprise
journalism the old-fashioned way. They dig for it. They comb police
files, court records and anything else they can get access to. They
do research that's entirely legal, and the information obtained and
posted on their site is available to anybody who has the
inclination to look.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in posting exclusive documents,
described as ``cool, confidential and quirky.'' The documents and
articles posted on the site come from a wide variety of government
and law enforcement sources via Freedom of Information Act requests
for public documents that the law requires be made available.
Furthermore, Smoking Gun guarantees that all the news and documents
it posts are the real deal _ 100 percent authentic. A notice on the
site reads, ``The Smoking Gun is a Pierre Salinger-free zone'' _ a
cheeky reference to Salinger's 1996 touting of a document claiming
a U.S. Navy missile shot down TWA Flight 800 that turned out to be
nothing more than an Internet rumor making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   What Smoking Gun typically comes up with is the kind of ``gee
whiz'' documents that you didn't know existed, and if you did know
they existed, you'd never know where or perhaps even how to track
them down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to uncovering a variety of documents related to the
TV wedding, Smoking Gun also looks into more serious issues such as
the fate of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose flight
to America has triggered a bitter custody fight between the
American and Cuban governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents on Smoking Gun are rough going _ wading
through court papers requiring Gonzalez to appear before a U.S.
judge isn't as scintillating as restraining orders against
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in debunking rumors, hearsay and hype.
When the Andy Kaufman bio-pic opened in December, rumors started
circulating on the Web that Kaufman had faked his death and was
probably hanging out in a bar somewhere with Elvis and other
members of the celebrity undead. However, it was the Smoking Gun
that actually did the legwork and found Kaufman's death certificate
(www.thesmokinggun .com/archive
</P>
<P>
   /kaufmandeath1.shtml) and noted sarcastically that ``in the long
and sleazy history of motion picture promotion, this is the first
use of renal failure as a marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially poignant are the records Smoking Gun found
documenting a ``Real Life Private Ryan,'' who, like in the movie of
the same name, was a private who lost all of his brothers in World
War II combat (www.thesmokinggun.com/ryan/ryan.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun makes great use of both its staff, which seems to
come up with the goods on the newsmakers and pop culture trivia,
and the Web, where documents can be posted and examined at leisure.
The site has made a nice niche for itself as a media watchdog with
plenty of bite.

 &HT;    Lab wants to clone your pet
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technological innovation usually is about making
something better. E-mail is a faster way to get a letter to and
from someone. E-commerce, really, is just shopping from a Web site;
it is the catalog's son, the popular one who spends all his free
time at his computer.
</P>
<P>
   But ever so often, something comes along that promises to do
something truly remarkable: to create.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Genetic Savings &AMP; Clone want to offer people the
chance to clone their pets. It is unclear when _ or if _ they will
be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they're trying to clone Missy, a mutt that is part
border collie, part Siberian husky. Missy's owners gave Texas A&AMP;M
University $2.3 million to start the Missyplicity Project, an
attempt to clone their dog. Information about the effort can be
read at www.missyplicity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the scientists working to clone Missy said
they had formed a separate company to store the genes of other
people's pets using the same technique developed on the Missy
project.
</P>
<P>
   The company will store DNA on other species as well, including
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure can be performed on live animals as well as ones
recently deceased. The company stores the DNA at two places; one is
a backup in the event of a fire or natural disaster. The storage
tanks have alarm monitors and, eventually, the company hopes to
make them available for viewing via a Web site camera. The yearly
maintenance fees range from $100 to $150. The first year's
maintenance is included in the initial service fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in carbon-copying your cat or dog, you'll
have to wait until the technique is improved. In the meantime, the
folks at GSC (www.savingsandclone.com) have provided answers to a
few basic questions about removing and storing pet DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does gene banking hurt the animal?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No. The procedure is done under general anesthesia _ by
your own veterinarian in his/her office. When the animal awakens,
it will have two small stitched areas _ one in the abdomen and one
in the mouth. Animals can be a bit 'woozy' when recovering from
general anesthesia, but we have not observed any discomfort after
that. ... For most animals, the worst part about having stitches
removed is being in the veterinarian's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to gene bank an animal's DNA at GSC?
</P>
<P>
   A:''We offer four grades of service, starting at $1,000,
depending mainly on how quickly you need the work done. ... GSC's
Gene Banking services do NOT include the cost of tissue sampling to
extract the DNA _ a procedure that is performed (and billed) by
your veterinarian, using resources supplied by GSC. The fee for
this service is between you and your veterinarian, but for
comparison purposes, the cost for tissue sampling at the Texas A&AMP;M
Small Animal Clinic ranges from $100 to $700, depending on the
condition of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long after death can you obtain viable DNA?
</P>
<P>
   A:''After numerous experiments and actual post-mortem jobs, we
are currently setting the limit for extraction of viable DNA
following death at seven days, regardless of how the body has been
preserved. Please be aware that the actual limit can be much
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can DNA last when stored using your methods?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no known limit. Cellular DNA stored in liquid
nitrogen has been regrown after decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When pet cloning is possible, how much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's difficult to say. We are spending over $2.3 million
cloning Missy. We're certain that as soon as we're successful,
we'll be able to offer this service commercially at a small
fraction of what it cost to clone Missy. However, even a small
fraction of millions of dollars could still be a large sum for the
average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless, we expect the price to drop quickly as our
techniques improve.''

 THE MAN WHO BREATHED LIFE INTO `PORGY AND BESS' 
(FOR RELEASE: Sunday, March 5) 
 (jw) 
 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore. 
By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess'' comes to the New York City Opera on Tuesday
evening, so it is a good time to celebrate the man largely
responsible for the opera's resilience: DuBose Heyward, the author
of the 1925 novel ``Porgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are those fabulous Gershwin tunes, but no other
Gershwin show has proved revivable, and in no other Gershwin show
do the songs embody dramatic characters, even when sung out of
context or played without the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Miles Davis play ``Gone, Gone, Gone,'' and you are
still in Catfish Row, mourning for Jake Robbins. Heyward invented
those characters, and their provocative mixture of good and evil,
poverty and power makes the opera endlessly fascinating and has
allowed it to survive in many forms, from folk opera to musical
comedy to movie musical (with dubbed voices) and even its current,
but not necessarily final, form, grand opera.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward was born in Charleston, S.C., in 1885. His father died
when he was young, and his mother, a published poet, brought him up
in genteel poverty made worse by bouts of polio and pleurisy. His
mother had taken an interest in the Gullah dialect spoken by
Charleston's blacks. She passed this interest to her son, who (as
he wrote in the introduction to the play ``Porgy,'' which his wife,
Dorothy Heyward, helped adapt from the novel) developed a romantic
image of the ``mystery and movement of Negro life,'' the powerful
motion of the stevedores and the emotional force of spirituals,
which produced ``a contraction of the solar plexus and lachrymal
glands that he was powerless to control.''
</P>
<P>
   After developing enough of a reputation as a poet to be invited
to the MacDowell Colony, Heyward began work on a novel inspired by
a notice in The Charleston News and Courier about Samuel Smalls, a
crippled beggar who had tried to shoot his lover. Smalls was a
well-known figure on Charleston's streets, remembered mainly for
the goat that pulled his cart through town. Heyward's surprising
reaction to the news hints at the complex way he viewed the
characters in ``Porgy and Bess'': ``Just think of that old wreck
having enough manhood to do a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward turned Smalls into Porgy and surrounded him with other
characters he had observed in Charleston: Crown, the muscular
stevedore; Bess, Crown's abused lover; Sportin' Life, the mulatto
purveyor of ``happy dust''; and the inhabitants of the slum known
as Catfish Row. Here were all the ingredients for a best-selling
novel and then a hit play: sex, violence, religion, love both
requited and betrayed, an exotic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Its racial theme resonated with other novels and plays of the
era, like Carl Van Vechten's ``Nigger Heaven,'' Eugene O'Neill's
``Emperor Jones'' and Paul Green's ``In Abraham's Bosom.'' The
black author Zora Neale Hurston called these white authors
Negrotarians, not entirely a term of abuse. The historian David
Levering Lewis writes that soon after its Broadway opening (in a
segregated theater), ``Porgy'' became ``Harlem's play'' and
``Harlemites knew the lines of the play almost as well as the
understudies did.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics _ mostly, but not all, white _ hailed Heyward's novel
for its realism, probably the last word that would spring to mind
for readers today, for whom the book will seem condescending in its
romantic idealization of Charleston's poorest blacks. But Heyward's
characters are more complex and mysterious than they first appear.
Porgy is a sage, a saint, a trickster, an inveterate gambler,
eventually a murderer. He is an idealized ``good'' man who, like
the stereotypical Good Negro, is good only at the cost of his
manhood. In the novel he is of an indeterminate age, but he briefly
regains his youth when Bess moves into his room, only to shrivel
back into old age when she abandons him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bess, Crown and Sportin' Life form a diabolical trinity of
mythical and subversive powers. Metaphorically speaking they are
the blues counterweight to the spirituals sung by the ``God-fearin'
ladies.'' Crown and Sportin' Life, in their very different ways,
appeal to the audience despite their evil deeds. Viewed as an
emblem of rebellion, courage and sexual power, Crown prefigures the
black superstars and super-athletes to come, while Sportin' Life
(dope pusher, pimp and God-denying Voltaire all in one) is the
entertainer, demanding the likes of a Cab Calloway or a Sammy Davis
Jr. to fill his tap shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bess appears surprisingly late in the novel, emerging out of the
shadows like a visitor from the dark side, which is the way Catfish
Row views her. Although her portrayal seems sketchy in the novel,
her finest operatic moment, ``I Loves You Porgy,'' is all there:
``Oh, fuh Gawd sake, Porgy, don't let dat man come an' handle me!
Ef yuh is willin' tuh keep me, den lemme stay. Ef he jus' don't put
dem ho han' on me, I kin be good, I kin 'member, I kin be happy.''
(Heyward's Gullah is easier to sing than to read.)
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Bess' character is filled out to show her strength
and independence, as she leads the ``shout'' to fill the burial
collection plate (transformed operatically into ``Oh, the Train Is
in the Station''), and in her attempts to resist Crown (turned
almost verbatim into ``What You Want wid Bess?''). These changes
only confirm the essence Bess shares with Crown and Sportin' Life,
a fierce independence of spirit which undermines the servile piety
that is the community norm.
</P>
<P>
   Porgy, who seems at times like a type of Christ, at times like
Adam before and after the Fall, is torn between ``doctor Jesus''
and his ``sometime thing'' Princess of Darkness, but it is no
contest. For the play, Dorothy Heyward created a new upbeat ending,
with Porgy following Bess to the promised land of Upper New York.
The secular, urban North is the new Jerusalem, even though it will
be filled with as many Sportin' Lifes and Crowns as Serenas and
Marias. Gershwin set this ending to ``Oh Lord, I'm on My Way,'' a
pseudospiritual with a disturbingly Broadway razzle-dazzle that
mirrors the play's inverted religiosity perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward was not a political radical, and by today's standards
his description of blacks as ``primitives'' seems racist, but
compared with the rabidly anti-black message of the film ``The
Birth of a Nation,'' which appeared in 1916, ``Porgy'' seemed
progressive; its view of blacks as separate but equal in their
humanity was an improvement on D.W. Griffith's movie, which
portrayed them as animals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the novel's denouement, retained in the play and opera,
seems to express racial fears. Porgy murders Crown and proclaims:
``Bess, you got a man. You got Porgy!'' This transplant of sexual
potency proves futile, because Bess leaves Porgy anyway, and the
murder of a strong ``bad'' black man by a crippled ``good'' one
feels like a primitive white fantasy about black sexual power.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward and Gershwin seemed uneasy with this crucial turn in the
plot. In the novel the murder happens between paragraphs and is not
described; in the opera, Gershwin merely transplanted noisy music
from the fight scene in Act I, leaving to the director the
difficult task of making the struggle convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the novel into a play moved the characters farther away
from stereotypes to complex human figures. But the experience of
staging the play profoundly altered Heyward's view of blacks. In
his preface to the published script of the play, Heyward praised
the black cast, many of them drawn from all-black musicals like
Eubie Blake's ``Shuffle Along'' and James P. Johnson's ``Runnin'
Wild,'' as collaborators who contributed important ``bits,'' and
noted that many of them came from theatrical families going back
several generations: anything but primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Already the black performers of ``Porgy'' were transforming the
show, a process that has continued to the present.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollis Alpert wrote in his indispensable study ``The Life and
Times of Porgy and Bess,'' Heyward now ``foresaw Negroes breaking
down the bastions traditionally reserved for whites.'' His next
novel, ``Mamba's Daughters,'' published in 1929, imagines an
all-black opera, with music that would be ``primitive _
sophisticated _ neither? _ both?'' performed on the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera, ending with the singing of James Weldon
Johnson's anthem ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.'' (Years later Ned
Rorem considered making ``Mamba's Daughters'' into an opera.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before he had even discussed an opera with Gershwin, Heyward was
predicting the very different shape ``Porgy'' would take once it
was set to music. It would become a work of affirmation rather than
nostalgia, and its musical genre would be hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   Enter George and Ira Gershwin _ but not exit DuBose and Dorothy
Heyward. The opera libretto follows the play faithfully. The
biggest changes are the replacement of the many traditional
spirituals in the play with newly composed songs, and the expansion
of dramatic moments in the play into musical shape, like the
insertion of the love duet ``Bess, You Is My Woman'' before Bess
leaves for the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original plan was for Ira Gershwin to write lyrics,
DuBose Heyward asked to try his hand, and he eventually wrote or
helped write most of them, including the words to ``Summertime,''
``My Man's Gone Now'' and ``A Woman Is a Sometime Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What did George Gershwin bring to the show besides cloaking
Heyward's characters in imperishable musical garb? That
accomplishment alone would have assured the opera's success, but
Gershwin amplified the complexities that already existed, sometimes
in subliminal ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Melnick, in his recent book, ``A Right to Sing the
Blues,'' notes that ``Summertime'' echoes the melody of the
spiritual ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.'' The
troubling words of the spiritual thus steal into the song as an
ominous undercurrent and so, as Melnick says, forecast the tragic
events to come. The subtly ironic use of musical allusions appears
again in Sportin' Life's ``It Ain't Necessarily So,'' whose melody
recalls the blessing chanted in synagogues before the reading of
the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess,'' however, differs from the earlier novel and
play in a more profound way that reflects the conditions of 1935.
As much as or more than an opera about blacks, it becomes an opera
about poverty, in which the inhabitants of Catfish Row are no
longer the ``other'' but are ``us.'' It is hard to say who was
responsible for this change, but it was inherent in Gershwin's
desire to compose a folk opera rather than the blackface musical Al
Jolson wanted or the grand opera Otto Kahn asked him to write for
the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   The main character of a folk opera is the people, a peasantry
who sing communally in a distinctive national idiom. ``Porgy and
Bess'' presents its African-Americans not as exotic Gullahs but as
the American peasantry singing a music that is American first,
African second. Choral music frames all the action, and the fate of
the leads is always framed by the struggles of the community. The
most popular number in the score, ``I Got Plenty o' Nuttin,' ''
with lyrics by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, became its theme
song. It is at once a minstrel show banjo tune and a typical
Depression-era celebration of the pleasures of penury, like ``Now's
the Time to Fall in Love'' and ``Let's Take a Walk Around the
Block.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gershwin further enforced the universality of the story
by borrowing a device from ``Wozzeck.'' In the first scene of
Berg's opera, the title character suddenly breaks into a passionate
phrase that seems directed at the audience: ``Poor folks like us,
don't you see, Captain, must have money.'' The melody of this
phrase returns several times to become a call for compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the first scene of ``Porgy and Bess,'' Porgy, who
has at first appeared as a ``crap shark'' well liked by the
community, suddenly gets introspective about his condition: ``When
Gawd made cripple, he mean him to be lonely. Night time, day time,
he got to trabble dat lonesome road.'' Gershwin treats his ``Night
time, day time'' melody just as Berg did his tune, bringing it back
as a plea for compassion at the end of the first scene and, later,
as the lead-in to ``Bess, You Is My Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What would DuBose Heyward and George Gershwin think of ``Porgy
and Bess'' today? They would certainly be gratified that it is
still up and running and pleased that it has served as a
springboard for the careers of so many great black singers,
including Todd Duncan, William Warfield, Leontyne Price, Donnie Ray
Albert, Clamma Dale and Wilhelmenia Fernandez. But they might be
saddened that the more at home the work becomes in the opera house,
the more it becomes ``grand'' (at the New York City Opera as well
as the Met), the less ``folk'' it remains.

DOCTOROW LOSES HIS FAITH IN `CITY OF GOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware novels about writers searching for their next subject. A
recent example was Kurt Vonnegut's ``Timequake,'' which drew the
kind of discreet, forgiving notices no self-respecting novelist can
bear. The newest entry in this category is ``City of God,'' but
thanks to E.L. Doctorow's well-worn vernacular charm, it's nowhere
near the debacle it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   To summarize the new Doctorow requires less an effort of
compression than one of collation, because ``City of God'' is
several alternating stories in one. The main strand concerns a
minister nicknamed Pem, whose faltering faith finally snaps when
mysterious vandals steal the large brass cross off the altar of his
impoverished lower Manhattan church. The cross then miraculously
reappears atop an ultra-Reform synagogue on the Upper West Side _
whose demure female rabbi flusters Pem even more.
</P>
<P>
   Like a slightly punchy gin rummy dealer, Doctorow shuffles the
principal narrative of Pem's spiritual crisis into and out of
miscellaneous other hands. Some of these hands come up winners,
some don't. The worrisome one's about Everett, the novelist looking
to transubstantiate Pem's story into a book, while others delve
into cosmology, the two world wars, the movies, Tin Pan Alley,
Einstein, Wittgenstein, even Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a mess, a farrago of 20th century oddments from a
gifted writer who's looking over his shoulder at Don DeLillo's
``Underworld.'' Worse yet, it sounds like a frustratingly
un-Doctorovian mess.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we might have thought, stood America's least postmodern
novelist. Doctorow has always felt most at home in the past,
writing almost exclusively historical novels long before their
current vogue. In 1975, ``Ragtime'' combined storytelling ambition
with outlandish popular success to a degree arguably never equaled
in American fiction. It would be easy to see him bobbing and
weaving here in ``City of God,'' ducking and feinting and winking,
and think, alas, another great yarn-spinner lost to the crack
cocaine of self-referentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, this depressing scenario ignores a couple of things.
First, for all its longevity on the best-seller list, ``Ragtime's''
syncopated style and cinematic crosscutting were never anybody's
idea of an unchallenging read. Doctorow wasn't a character in the
book, as he is here in the character of Everett, but he wasn't an
absentee landlord, either. He's always been a radical innovator,
just one who created plots that worked and characters we wept for.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Doctorow's diminished reliance on story this time around
parallels perfectly his theme: the challenge of faith in a dark
time. Pem falls away from God in precisely the same way that
Doctorow falls away from storytelling, his old rock and redeemer.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, though, where ``Ragtime's'' multiple plots
compounded the suspense, ``City of God'' has only one plot, and
some of Doctorow's digressions damp down the momentum instead of
ratcheting it up.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated readers who still prefer a little melodrama with
their metaphysics may feel crossed up by ``City of God,'' but those
who stick it out may find themselves unexpectedly moved. The book
starts out slow but gathers a formidable head of steam. Unlike so
many current books that end feebly or not at all, ``City of God''
gathers a reassuring gravity near the end that few readers of its
scattershot opening sections would have foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, underneath all the multiple-character
ventriloquism, the Doctorow style _ skeptical, funny, politically
engaged, New York public-school Jewish down to the last serif _
shines through undiffracted. Compressed, it can be found in his
single-word description of ``barnthwacked'' swallows twitching in a
farm field after a storm. More loosely, it's in this paragraph on
the glum phenomenon only recently diagnosed by pop psychologists as
``Sunday blues'':
</P>
<P>
   ``All New York is out this afternoon. We stroll around, watch
some softball, find a grassy spot for ourselves, unwrap the deli
heroes, uncork the Snapples, and prepare to have one of those
balmy, ritually relaxing Sundays when the sense of loss is in every
heart and a nonspecific melancholy seems to permeate the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``City of God'' is a harder novel than ``The Book of Daniel'' or
``Ragtime'' without being a better one. Many, not least the
Doctorow faithful, will find it uncongenial in its reluctance to
please. But it artfully shows the 20th century's two much-mourned
and greatly exaggerated deaths _ the novel and God _ as two aspects
of the same fall from transcendence. More important, it dares to
imagine their resurrection.

BEEF WITH A BROKER? CLICK HERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOLORES KONG   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this day and age, when investors can make trades and get
stock tips online, it seems only appropriate that they should be
able to use the same technology to complain about a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators and industry watchdogs are now letting
investors do just that, by putting complaint forms and a wide array
of consumer-protection material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled
its online complaint form, adding to an ever-expanding list of
investor resources at its Web site, www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are already using the online forms to streamline the
complaint process, said John Gannon, acting director of the SEC's
Office of Investor Education and Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you click `Submit' on the form, it's here within a
matter of seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, for example, an investor complained online to the
SEC that a brokerage had abruptly closed the multiple accounts he
had opened to increase his chances of getting into initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the complaint was forwarded to the brokerage, and
a response was received, Gannon said. Complaints filed by mail can
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC worked with the brokerage and the investor, Gannon said,
getting the investor more time before accounts are closed but
explaining that a brokerage has the right to close multiple
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulatory bodies have online complaint forms, too:
</P>
<P>
   --The Massachusetts Securities Division is at
www.magnet.state.ma.us/sec/sct/sctidx.htm
</P>
<P>
   --NASD Regulation Inc. can be found at www.nasdr.com
</P>
<P>
   Gannon cautions against putting account numbers on online
complaint forms, though, since they may not be secure. A name and
an address is usually enough for a broker to figure out which
account is in question.
</P>
<P>
   But protecting investors goes beyond just providing online
complaint forms, regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important value that the SEC provides you
with,'' Gannon said, ``is an unbiased view on investing and
information on how to get assistance if you do run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good information on the Internet, but there's
also some very bad information on the Internet. Having a government
site . . . gives people an opportunity to check other information
they find on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Investor Education office has had more than 363,000
``hits'' since it was redesigned in May to make it more
consumer-friendly, Gannon said. (Click on ``Investor Assistance and
Complaints'' on the SEC's main page.)
</P>
<P>
   Investors can start with the basics, using an SEC ``road map''
to figure out financial goals, determine risk tolerance, and pick a
financial professional.
</P>
<P>
   They can also tap into a mutual fund calculator, learn how to
avoid Internet fraud, get the lowdown on initial public offerings,
or IPOs, and find out about Edgar, the SEC's electronic database of
documents that companies are required to file.
</P>
<P>
   There is also information about the dangers of day trading.
</P>
<P>
   One of the site's most popular features is the search function,
Gannon said. It lets you use keywords to find a particular topic.
</P>
<P>
   The main SEC site also has information about the latest
enforcement actions, including the agency's 1999 case against three
people who illegally offered stock on e-Bay, an Internet auction
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place that investors can go to 24 hours a day to get
information from the SEC,'' Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Securities Division's site offers similar
material.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can, for example, print out a form that helps them keep
notes when they speak with a broker. They can also get a list of
``10 Do's and Don'ts for Investors.''
</P>
<P>
   And the site for NASD Regulation, an independent subsidiary of
the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., allows
consumers to check for complaints or disciplinary actions against
brokers and brokerage firms. An investor can then make an online
request that public records about the cases be mailed to him or
her.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet sites for investors include:
</P>
<P>
   --The Federal Trade Commission, at www.ftc.gov
</P>
<P>
   --www.nasaa.org
</P>
<P>
   --www.fraud.org

SUPERHEROES ABOUT TO MAKE INTERNET DEBUT 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man and The
X-Men, comes the next innovation in entertainment: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's been around for a while, but the Internet is ripe
for new development, said Peter Paul, co-founder of Stan Lee Media
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   So at 8 Tuesday night, Lee is hosting a giant Hollywood bash to
launch Stanlee.net, the comic book creator's foray into the World
Wide Web as an entertainment medium.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it's the first to have episodic animation
programming designed for distribution on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of Stanlee.net will be ``The 7th Portal,'' an
online animated series chronicling the adventures of a new cadre of
superheroes _ a group of software beta testers _ trying to save the
world from evil forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this effort to introduce a high-concept
episodic animated series represents the coming of age of the
Internet as a bona fide and viable entertainment medium that will
be on par with television in its delivery,'' said Paul, whose
previous marketing achievements include making a cultural icon out
of an unemployed, golden-maned romance novel cover model named
Fabio Lanzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is not the first to embrace the Internet as a medium for
entertainment content, said Dan O'Brien, an analyst with
Maryland-based Internet research firm Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Burton is another animator who is taking advantage of the
medium's compatibility with animation.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who created ``The Nightmare Before Christmas,'' has
signed a deal to create 26 animated episodes for distribution
online.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee is getting out into cyberspace first.
</P>
<P>
   And as data transfer speeds increase, the Internet will grow
into more of an entertainment medium, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of jockeying going on among various creative
media people,'' he said. ``Heretofore, it's been a communication
medium and an information medium, and to a lesser extent an
e-commerce medium, but not an entertainment medium.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can repackage comic book content for the Internet age,
Stan ``The Man'' can, said Chris Bleistein, deputy director of the
Massachusetts-based Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, an industry
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Lee created such comics
franchises as Spider-Man, The Avengers and The X-Men, breathing new
life into the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once before, Stan Lee revolutionized the comics industry and
set it on its head,'' Bleistein said. ``Everyone's wondering, Can
he do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Paul thinks so. He's billing tonight's launch as nothing short
of the introduction of an entirely new entertainment medium.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet has grown into a pervasive source of
information, it hasn't reached its potential as a source of
entertainment with content created exclusively for distribution
online, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other studios are repurposing content from other
media,'' he said. ``They will have to follow what we'll be
pioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a great place for comic book superheroes,
Bleistein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its actually a fairly logical progression. The fact you can
introduce motion and filmic effects on the Internet just increases
the palette that's available for comic creators,'' he said. ``It's
a move the entire industry is beginning to embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Internet, animation is a reasonable first step in its
development into an entertainment outlet, O'Brien said. The current
state of technology is not quite able to handle live video and
sound yet.
</P>
<P>
   But video and sound will eventually be more practical, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That means new players will join the game, and some of them will
win, O'Brien predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find some of the successes coming from outside
the traditional industry,'' he said.

Nice neighbor Maude Flanders was crushed by a box of T-shirts at a
race car track.
</P>

HEALTH WEB SITES MAY BE TRADING DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KAREN HSU   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the most popular consumer sites on the Internet that
dispense medical information may be exchanging personal data about
users who visit there, in possible violation of antitrust laws,
consumer and government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, which often rely heavily on surveys visitors are
asked to fill out online, gather a wealth of information on the
health, medical history, prescription drug use, and other personal
information. Most of that information is given up voluntarily by
visitors to the site, but some of it is not, and few users realize
that the information could be traded or sold to other Internet
health-care sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies have confirmed that personal data is
being captured and exchanged with other companies, and the Federal
Trade Commission is reportedly investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, a noted Internet security specialist, said he
nearly fell out of his chair when he found out a medical Web site,
PersonalMD.com, had given his ZIP code to an advertiser on the site
without his permission or knowledge. He wouldn't have realized it
had he not known how to check the background coding instructions
for the Web page. An internal program apparently knew who to access
the information off Smith's computer and send it to the advertiser,
Doubleclick.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually sites are more subtle about what they send out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of various Web sites has exploded, including
17,000 health-oriented sites that sell products and conduct
interactive health surveys, the whole area of privacy has not kept
pace, Smith said. Some sites include services such as keeping
entire medical records online or sending medication reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and others worked on a report commissioned by the
California Health Care Foundation that was released a month ago.
The report focused on privacy with 21 of the most popular health
Web sites, and found that many of them violated their own privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Web sites highlighted in the report was OnHealth
Network Co, which offered a survey called a Personal Health
Assessment. But what OnHealth didn't inform users was that an
outside vendor called WellMed collected the information for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``OnHealth intentionally tried to hide the role of WellMed in
all this. So you are typing in all this data, which is immediately
going off to another company that you don't have a relationship
with,'' Smith said. After the report came out, the Personal Health
Assessment survey was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   To add confusion last week, OnHealth was bought by
Healtheon/WebMD Corp., another Internet health-care company. A
spokeswoman for WebMD said that the OnHealth Web site will
eventually merge into WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know who owns the data anymore,'' said Zoe Hudson,
senior policy analyst at Georgetown University's Health Privacy
Project who was a co-author of the report. ``You thought you gave
the information to OnHealth, but now it's changing hands. This
merger may not concern the consumer, but it might matter if one of
those sites joined forces with their insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said that because health sites ask for more detailed
information than many other sites, she expected that the privacy
protection would be better. ``We were all surprised at the amount
that was leaving the site,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to another study of 1,009 US adults by the California
Health Care Foundation in January, it found 75 percent of them
concerned about health Web sites sharing information without their
permission. Some sites currently collect information such as Social
Security numbers, credit card numbers, lab results and insurance
information.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report come out, a few companies, including
HealthCentral.com and iVillage.com, have said that the FTC has
inquired about their privacy practices. In addition, industry and
government leaders have met to work on privacy Internet issues. In
1996, a coalition of ethicists, physicians and online providers
formed the Internet Healthcare Coalition, which recently endorsed a
draft of an International e-Health Code of Ethics. Another group of
for-profit health providers have also formed a group called
Hi-Ethics Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both groups and Smith were in Washington last
Friday to testify before a Congressional subcomittee on privacy and
confidentiality about health Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that in the spring, we will be seeing a lot more
activity in self-regulation with privacy,'' said John Mack,
president of the Internet Healthcare Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is a big issue for us. If we lose consumers' trust,
then we have lost the site,'' said Laura Hicks, a spokeswoman for
drkoop.com, which was profiled in Smith's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of unexpected that we are being monitored and
watched in this way. We think it's like a newspaper or a magazine,
but it's much more invasive,'' said Smith, who warns that it is
possible to put together a profile of a user from all the
information gathered by different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report, some e-health companies are already changing
or clarifying their policies. For example, drkoop.com said that it
has rewritten the privacy policy so it is more consumer-friendly.
It has added information, such as how servers keep logs of sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ In March 1927, Tan Shuzhen, 20, a Chinese
violinist, entered the rehearsal hall of the Shanghai Municipal
Orchestra and approached its Italian conductor, Mario Paci. The
orchestra was preparing for a concert to be held on March 26, the
100th anniversary of Beethoven's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra was all foreigners,'' Tan said recently. ``The
rule was, they played in Shanghai for five years and then got one
year paid furlough. I knew they were missing a violinist, so I
asked if I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary request: since the orchestra's founding in
1879 as the Shanghai Municipal Public Band, no Chinese musician had
ever joined its ranks. The orchestra was created by and for the
foreign residents of Shanghai who had lived in self-governing
concession areas since the Opium War in 1842.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paci just looked at me,'' Tan continued. ``Then he said, `Come
tomorrow.''' Tan appeared the next day and played in every
remaining rehearsal and concert. As the season drew to a close, a
Chinese worker in charge of laying out scores urged him to ask
Maestro Paci for his salary. Tan demurred but finally mustered
enough courage to ask if he was to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' came the reply. ``This is a chance for you to
study.''
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who later became vice director of the Shanghai Conservatory
and a renowned violin teacher and maker, was untroubled by this
rebuff. ``I didn't care about the money,'' he said. ``My goal was
to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, as it has been called
since 1953, celebrated its 120th anniversary. As the nation's
oldest symphony orchestra, it has done more to promote the
development of symphonic music in China than any other institution.
</P>
<P>
   Its claim to the title ``best orchestra in the Far East,''
bestowed in the 1930s, is long past. But if judged on the basis of
perseverance and dedication in the face of seemingly insurmountable
odds, the Shanghai Symphony stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   It began humbly, as an amateur band of Filipino musicians. After
the International Settlement, run by the Shanghai Municipal
Council, took it over in 1881, it gradually became more
professional. In 1906, the council recruited a German conductor and
six European musicians, but when World War I broke out, the German
musicians were drafted into military service and the German members
of the symphony's board of directors expelled. Paci arrived in
1919, beginning a 23-year tenure still respectfully known as the
Paci era.
</P>
<P>
   He changed the band's name to Shanghai Municipal Orchestra in
1922 and replaced the missing Germans with White Russians and Jews,
who came to Shanghai seeking sanctuary. He broadened the repertory
to include works by composers like Stravinsky, Bartok and Gershwin,
and increased the number of musicians from 37 to more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   As the quality of the orchestra improved, it began to attract
international attention and world-renowned soloists, including
Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, Fyodor Chaliapin and Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau. In 1930, Paci made headlines by leading the
orchestra in its first work by a Chinese composer, ``In Memoriam''
by Huang Zi, who had studied at Oberlin College and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Concert attendees had remained as foreign as the orchestra; when
Arthur Rubinstein performed in Shanghai in 1935, he complained that
the audience was all European and American. But the appearance of
musicians like Tan began to attract a Chinese audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever seen a Chinese in the orchestra,'' Tan said,
``So many people came to see me.'' The orchestra officially
admitted Chinese in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   It struggled through the wartime years of soaring inflation and
Japanese occupation. Paci laid down his baton in 1942, and Tan quit
in protest when a concert was scheduled in honor of a Japanese
general.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist victory in 1949 brought peace and a stable
currency, but it also ignited a debate: could a symphony orchestra
serve the needs of workers, peasants and soldiers? At a conference
held to discuss arts policy in Beijing, leftists argued that it
should be abolished; moderates, among them Tan and He Luting, later
the director of the Shanghai Conservatory, argued for its
preservation. The moderates won, and the Shanghai Symphony was
placed under the baton of Huang Yijun and the control of the
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Shanghai Symphony survived, its problems with
politics were just beginning. In 1950, cries for its abolition were
heard again after it played selections from ``Madame Butterfly,''
which leftists argued was an effort to spread imperialist culture
even as China fought against the imperialist United States in
Korea. Walking a fine line, the Shanghai Symphony managed both to
preserve its integrity and to adapt to the times.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign symphony members were replaced by Chinese: in 1951 the
56-member Shanghai Symphony still had 16 foreigners, but by 1958 it
was all Chinese, with Soviet advisers on hand to offer support and
training. Huang expanded the repertory to include more Chinese
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Music, like all other art forms, was required to follow the
Communist Party's dictates to be realistic and to ``reflect
society.'' Composers strove to create Chinese symphonic music that
integrated Western concepts of harmony and form with Chinese
melodies, often drawn from folk songs or the music of minority
nationalities. Programmatic music was favored, especially vocal
works, because they were easier for workers, peasants and soldiers
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, politics became more intrusive. During the Four
Pests Campaign, conservatory students were forced to stand under
trees and make noise with their instruments: afraid to land,
sparrows (considered pests) fell from the sky and died.
</P>
<P>
   The Sino-Soviet split in 1961 led to the departure of Soviet
advisers, and orchestra rehearsal time was devoted to studying the
``nine criticisms'' of Khrushchev. A campaign was launched against
``formalism,'' condemning ``ivory tower'' music that sprang from a
composer's feelings rather than the real experience of the people.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Western music
was condemned as bourgeois. Jiang Qing, the wife of Chairman Mao,
created eight ``model operas'' that became the only theatrical
pieces staged in all of China, their melodies reorchestrated as
``revolutionary symphonies,'' which the Shanghai Symphony sometimes
performed attired in soldiers' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, the Shanghai Symphony played only `Shajiabang'
and `Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,''' Chen Guangxian, the
manager of the Shanghai Symphony said, referring to two model
operas re-orchestrated for symphony. Red Guards tormented Shanghai
Symphony musicians and conservatory professors, accusing them of
betraying China, its music and its people by playing Western music.
</P>
<P>
   So merciless was the abuse that 10 professors and seven students
at the conservatory were said to have been driven to suicide. Tan
was locked in a conservatory closet for nine months and beaten
regularly with a stick, then sent to repair toilets. At the
Shanghai Symphony, Gu Shengying, 30, a piano soloist, committed
suicide together with her family, and Lu Hongen, the resident
conductor, was executed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in September
1976, and that November, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra in
Beijing held a concert broadcast nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played Beethoven's Fifth,'' said Xu Ximing, director of
the Shanghai Music Lovers' Association. ``It is about the light
that comes after a period of great difficulty, so it was very
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras and conservatories around the nation began the
arduous process of rebuilding. When the Central Conservatory in
Beijing reopened in 1977, 40,000 people applied; applications to
the Shanghai Conservatory were close behind. Overseas orchestras
traveled to China, famous musicians offered master classes, and
audiences increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, everyone wanted to hear Beethoven,'' Chen said.
``People lined up to buy tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Young composers began to explore new compositional techniques.
But because realism and the preservation of Chinese music remained
official policy, experimental efforts like atonality were
criticized. Zhu Jianer, the Shanghai Symphony's resident composer,
traveled to Beijing to defend the work of young composers like Tan
Dun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that the roots of their music actually lay in the
music of the Chinese nationalities,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that symphonic music was revived in the 1980s,
many composers and musicians emigrated. Then, as economic reforms
advanced and popular entertainment options increased, government
financing and attendance at classical concerts declined. The
Shanghai Symphony struggled to pay wages, and its musicians were
forced to moonlight in hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. The Shanghai Symphony's 94 musicians
are underpaid and their instruments, which belong to the orchestra,
need replacement. Although the orchestra's foundation solicits
corporate contributions, few are forthcoming, and the orchestra
remains almost exclusively dependent on government support.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony is regularly called to play for political
celebrations, often on short notice, making it difficult to
maintain a regular training schedule or plan a season. Concert
attendance has increased, but audience development is still a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to propagate classical music,'' Xu said. ``We have to
train people from childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Communist idea of cultural outreach is to ``go
down to the countryside'' and take culture to the masses, but
moving an orchestra to a cornfield or shipyard is so cumbersome
that the Shanghai Symphony does so only a few times a year.
</P>
<P>
   A more constructive approach would be to bring audiences to the
concert hall, but this is difficult because the orchestra does not
have its own facility. Concerts are held in the Shanghai Concert
Hall, originally a movie theater, or the new Grand Theater. Both
spaces must be rented, and neither is acoustically suited for a
symphony orchestra, a sore point with the musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the orchestra's future looks brighter. Musically, it has
grown under the baton of Chen Xieyang, its music director since
1984. The string sections have played together for years and have a
balanced ensemble and flowing sound, though the woodwind and brass
sections are weaker than the strings.
</P>
<P>
   It is common here to attribute this weakness to physical
deficiencies in Chinese people, but the real explanation lies in
the quality of conservatory faculty and students. China has little
tradition of secondary school ensemble programs like marching
bands, so conservatories must recruit wind players with almost no
ensemble experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing history full circle, the Shanghai Symphony is
compensating by recruiting woodwind and brass players from the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Financial support for recruitment comes from the Shanghai
government, which hopes to make the city more attractive by
improving its cultural institutions. Additional funds for training
have also been allocated, and Chen, the orchestra manager, has
arranged for a steady stream of foreign conductors to work with the
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra is also striving to meet international standards
on issues like copyrights, royalties and artist contracts. It tours
overseas regularly and often gives concerts in other Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its 120th anniversary, the Shanghai Symphony paid
homage to its origins in East and West. Chen, the music director,
led a concert of works by Zhu Jianer and Beethoven. A conference on
the development of symphonic music was held and a commemorative
book published.
</P>
<P>
   The book paid special tribute to the orchestra's foreign
founders, its first Chinese musicians and the musicians who lost
their lives in the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his time locked in a closet, Tan said that endurance
and faith were his keys to survival: ``I just thought, `It's night
now, but the sun will come out eventually.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, has the Shanghai Symphony held together through wars,
purges, political movements and financial crises: with endurance,
faith and an unwavering devotion to music.

MCCAIN AIMS AT MODERATE WHITES WITH RAP ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, whose early campaign success seemed modeled on
Gary Hart's 1984 rush out of New Hampshire, now seems to be taking
a page from the playbook of another former Democratic candidate,
Bill Clinton, with his attempt this week to appeal to centrist
voters by making a public break with a highly-charged constituency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attack Monday on the religious right leaders, Pat
Robertson and Rev. Jerry Falwell, for fostering ``the politics of
division and slander'' was reminiscent of Clinton's tactic in 1992
when he admonished Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition for
hosting a rap singer, Sister Souljah, who had spoken of the Los
Angeles riots in words Clinton said were ``filled with a kind of
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, the action largely succeeded in convincing
Democratic moderates that he would not kowtow to Jackson, whose
political manueverings in earlier presidential campaigns had
alienated many whites and divided the party.
</P>
<P>
   By assailing Governor George W. Bush's appearance at
fundamentalist Bob Jones University and branding well-known
Christian conservative leaders as ``agents of intolerance,'' McCain
made a clear bid for the support of Republican moderates as well as
independents. Ever since a divisive national GOP convention in
Houston in 1992, many Republicans have been privately troubled by
the influence religious figures wield in party affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad terms, the moves look similar,'' said Mickey Kantor,
who was Clinton's national campaign manager in 1992. ``You are
bearding the lion politically; taking on an established interest in
the party. It's somewhat gutsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are different, Kantor said Wednesday, because
Clinton retained the strong allegiance of African-American voters
even while he declared his independence from Jackson. McCain, on
the other hand, appeared to have antagonized the Christian
conservative constituency with his broadside.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls taken during Tuesday's primary in Virginia found that
Bush won the support of 80 percent of the religious conservatives.
Ten days earlier, the religious right supported Bush by a ratio of
only 2-to-1 in South Carolina, though their heavy turnout helped
lead to McCain's defeat in that state.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's advisors, the Arizona senator decided to
make his move after Robertson went to Bush's aid prior to last
week's Michigan primary with a recorded telephone message
criticizing McCain. Robertson, the founding father of the Christian
Coalition, also described McCain's national co-chairman, former New
Hampshire senator Warren Rudman, as a ``vicious bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain was careful in his Virginia Beach speech to praise
the work of some evangelical leaders who are ``changing America for
the better,'' he singled out Robertson and Falwell, who have played
a major roles in the Republican Party for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether
they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left or Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell on the right,'' McCain said. ``The politics of
divison and slander are not our values.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political director, John Weaver, acknowledged recently
that the senator's campaign had studied the history of the Hart
campaign in choosing to concentrate on a breakout strategy launched
from New Hampshire. No one in the McCain camp has linked their
latest move to Clinton's strategy, but there are intriguing
parallels.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Clinton faced a delicate task of dealing with
Jackson's following. Leaders of the Democratic Leadership Council,
a group dominated by Southerners, felt Clinton needed a schism with
Jackson to prevent moderates from deserting the party again, as
they had in 1984 and 1988. As Jack Germond and Jules Witcover wrote
in ``Mad As Hell,'' their book on the 1992 election:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton campaign, in addition to being on the lookout for
ways to reach untapped audiences, also continued to seek means to
show the candidate `going against the grain' to demonstrate that he
was indeed a different kind of candidate. An opportunity was about
to present itself in this regard, handed unwittingly to Clinton by
an irreverent member of the MTV generation -- a young rap
entertainer who called herself Sister Souljah.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton wrapped up his party's nomination in June, he
scheduled an appearance at a Rainbow Coalition conference in
Washington. The night before, the organization had heard Lisa
Williamson, a woman known as Sister Souljah say this of the race
riots that spring in Los Angeles: ``Yeah, it was wise. I mean if
black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and
kill white people.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton rebuked the Rainbow Coalition, saying
that Sister Souljah's remarks were ``filled with a kind of hatred
that you do not honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was indignant over Clinton's statement, but the
candidate's performance ultimately won the praise of many other
black leaders as well as moderate whites.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain heads into showdowns next week in New England, New
York, Ohio and California, where the Republican ranks hold less
religious conservatives than the Southern states, he appears to be
counting on his Virginia Beach speech to convince the moderates in
his own party that, unlike some previous candidates of his party,
he will not bow to the demands of leaders like Robertson.

THAT'S LAIRD TO YOU, MISTER

<P>
   It's no longer very hard to enjoy the trappings of a financial
mogul or earn an aristocratic title conveying pomp and privilege.
Just visit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is filled with outfits that cater to these desires. For
example, type in ``offshoresecrets.com'' and enter a world
promising ``fast, safe, private and affordable offshore services.''
</P>
<P>
   Those services include banking charters in such obscure locales
as Nauru and Vanuatu for a fee of about $20,000. ``Yes! I want to
order my own bank now!'' the site encourages visitors, noting that
such banks allow users to take deposits, give loans and ``operate
free of tax on profit,'' with no ``need to maintain a physical
presence'' in the host country.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the site can help you get a college degree or
even a legal title of nobility. ``With a Title in front of your
name you will experience a difference in people's attitudes,'' the
site notes. ``The moment they know you are a `Sir, Lady, Lord,
etc.' you'll be treated like some sort of royalty or famous film
star.''
</P>
<P>
   An individual identified as Eytan Gold, who operates
offshoresecrets.com from Israel, declined to be interviewed.
Neither he nor his site have ever been charged with wrongdoing. But
his site and others like it have drawn the attention of U.S.
regulators and legislators, who suspect they may be fronts for
money laundering and other financial shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole purpose of many of these banks is to provide havens
for criminals,'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., in an
interview. ``Any criminal worth his salt knows that if you want to
avoid detection, you go offshore _ and with the Internet, you can
point, click and launder.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5 trillion to $6 trillion is sheltered in offshore
accounts, according to reports from the International Monetary
Fund, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the State Department. Schumer and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have introduced money-laundering
legislation that targets ``instant banks'' being peddled on the
Internet. The legislation would prevent those kinds of banks from
having transactions with U.S. financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at one site, offshoreprofit.com, operated from
Venezuela by an individual identified as Lord Antonio D. Gonzalez,
suggests how easy it is for just about anyone to shelter money
abroad. For $399, the site will establish an account in ``one of
Estonia's largest banks'' and throw in a free ``Maestro Card.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's ``Millennium Freedom Package,'' bargain-priced at
$2,299, offers an offshore trust account in Belize, an ``ID Free
Visa card,'' a mail-drop address and a ``full year of personalized
advice'' that includes information on where to get ``a second, or
even third diplomatic passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, privacyworld.com, also offers offshore trusts
and bank accounts, ``legal tax avoidance'' services, press or
travel agent identification and international driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   For the very ambitious, the site will establish ``anonymous,
bearer share'' corporations that will let owners bank abroad using
encrypted telephone, fax or e-mail connections.
</P>
<P>
   The site, operated from Switzerland by Third World Trading
Corp., says it allows clients to ``get rid of lawyers, spouses,
etc., forever.'' The operators of privacyworld.com could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some offshore operators scoff at the notion that they are
selling anything more than a sought-after luxury: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet makes it easy to protect our and our clients'
privacy,'' an individual calling himself Robert Smith said in an
e-mail response to questions about his site, offshoreprofit.com.
``We are located outside the U.S., our actual location being a
secret to avoid interference and sabotage attempts, which have
destroyed or are in the process of destroying other, more
high-profile offshore operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also observed that most illegal activities occur in
onshore banks. In fact, the biggest money-laundering investigation
in history is underway at the Bank of New York, where $7 billion in
suspect funds from Russia are being examined. The bank has not been
charged with wrongdoing and is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some offshore banks and services are used by those who
want to break the law,'' he said. ``However the same thing is true
for onshore banks. In fact, the vast majority of international
money laundering doesn't take place in the Caribbean or in Austria,
but in New York and London. That's where the truly powerful people
launder their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you aren't interested in stashing away money, the sites
point out that many of their products make great gifts. For just
$495 ($795 for couples), offshoresecrets.com will make you a laird,
knecht, viscount or marchioness. And the cachet that comes with
that title, you'll discover, is just priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines will often upgrade you,'' the site promises. ``Bank
managers just can't help you enough. It says more about you than a
Gold or Platinum credit card. For personal confidence and
self-esteem a title will change your life for the better.''

 TAKING THE MUSIC TO THE STREET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)  
 (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ The symbol of the pre-Lenten carnival in the
state of Bahia _ and, in many ways, the symbol of Brazilian popular
music today _ is the trio eletrico, a hulking vehicle loaded down
with massive speakers. Musicians play on the top level and carnival
celebrants jump around the vehicle as it cuts through the throngs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the most lavish ones _ like those used by the pop singers
Ivete Sangalo and Netinho _ are full bars, televisions, lounges.
This year, one of them is reported to have a swimming pool on top.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival in Salvador, the capital of Bahia, is purely a street
carnival, different from the Folies Bergeres-like televised
festivities that take place in Rio de Janeiro. The music played on
top of the trio eletrico _ it's usually the popular new Brazilian
samba-reggae or axe music _ has a direct relationship to the street
and takes part in a kind of natural selection: each year carnival
starts with dozens of songs written specifically for the
festivities, and by the end of the week that repertory has been
narrowed to a handful.
</P>
<P>
   The trio eletrico is the medium, and the street decides. It is a
powerful, mythical machine, memorialized in countless songs. And it
began with two musically inclined inventors, a 1929 four-door Ford
with two conical speakers and a few homemade electric cavaquinhos,
a four-stringed, ukelele-like instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Carnaval 2000 in Bahia, which started on Friday and runs through
Wednesday, is a special one: it not only marks the 500th
anniversary of the founding of Brazil but is also the 50th
anniversary of the trio eletrico. Dodo and Osmar, the two inventors
of the trio eletrico, will be honored with a special trio manned by
Moraes Moreira, one of Brazil's favorite musicians and songwriters
and himself an important part of the story of the trio's
development.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``50 Anos do Trio Eletrico,'' by Fred Goes, recounts
the story of the trio and its meaning in carnival culture.
</P>
<P>
   Osmar's son Armando Macedo, known professionally as Armandinho
and now in his late 40s, says the story of the trio eletrico really
began in 1942. While working as a radio technician, Dodo ordered
electrical parts from the Sears, Roebuck catalog and managed to
electrify a hollow-body cavaquinho. He was intrigued after having
seen the classical violinist Benedito Chaves, who had performed in
Bahia with an electrified violin the previous year. But the
feedback from an electric cavaquinho _ even with flannel cloth
stuffed inside _ was so unbearable that he decided to create a
solid-body instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dodo and Osmar went to a music shop called Primavera, which is
still here in Salvador,'' Armandinho recounted in an interview last
week, ``and asked for two cavaquinhos of medium quality. Right
there in the shop, they smashed the bodies of the guitars; they
just wanted the necks.'' They connected the neck to slabs of thick,
compact wood cut from a table, affixed four strings and two
electric pickups to them _ with a magnetized bridge on top of the
pickup, so the electrical currents from electric wires in the
street wouldn't interfere with the guitar's own electric signals.
</P>
<P>
   The result was what they called the pau eletrico, or electric
stick. They even figured out how to amplify it where there was no
electricity, by connecting the instrument to car batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Les Paul, the American guitarist, is usually credited with
inventing the solid-body electric guitar in 1941. But in some way,
Dodo and Osmar _ who are never mentioned in histories of the
electric guitar _ may have had a relationship to Paul similar to
the one the early Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont had to
the Wright brothers. In both cases, the North Americans receive the
official credit, but there is a parallel history of South American
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Dodo and Osmar played these instruments semiprofessionally until
1950, when, 20 days before carnival, the 150-musician Vassourinha
orchestra from the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco
visited here. Its music inspired Dodo and Osmar to take up the
bright, march-rhythm Pernambucan music called the frevo.
</P>
<P>
   Frevos were already popular in Bahia, but were not a major part
of carnival. Dodo and Osmar changed that irrevocably the first time
they ventured out in their four-door Ford as the Dupla Eletrica
(Electric Duo), with two loudspeakers on the front of the car and a
few drummers marching around it. They wanted to replicate the force
of a huge orchestra with their electric instruments, and they had
hit upon the perfect music for a street parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play sambas, people dance in one place,'' Armandinho
said. ``With frevos, they have to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the second year Dodo and Osmar took a moving vehicle
out into the carnaval parade, a third guitarist was added in the
car. It was now a trio eletrico and was such a success that the
name quickly became a generic phrase: other bands popped up, riding
in cars through the streets and calling themselves trios eletricos,
and soon the trio eletrico denoted the vehicle, not the band.
</P>
<P>
   Before long there were dozens of trios (sometimes with more or
less than three members). They were assuming more and more
beautiful shapes and designs; the singer Caetano Veloso remembers
one designed as a giant alligator with rows of loudspeakers in its
mouth disguised not as teeth, but as flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Another, sponsored by a soft-drink company and designed by
Osmar, was a horizontal bottle with neon lights mimicking the
decanting of its contents. In 1971, when Veloso returned to Brazil
after a year and a half in London as a political exile, he was
honored with a special trio called the Caetanave, or Caetano Rocket
_ a shiny silver vehicle with fins, a high platform for the
guitarists and lower platforms for the drummers.

MAINE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A COMPUTER IN EVERY SCHOOLBAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to bridge the ``digital divide'' in one of the nation's
poorest states, the governor of Maine will propose Thursday giving
all students above the sixth grade laptop computers to keep as
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Angus King's proposal, the first of its kind in the
nation, would provide laptops and Internet service to 16,000
seventh-graders beginning in fall 2001, and to all seventh-graders
in the years following, so that within six years, every student in
the seventh grade and up will have a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for paying half the cost for new
computers for teachers above the sixth grade, with districts paying
the other half.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious plan reflects a world in which computers are no
longer seen as just an accessory, but as a necessity. A month ago,
the Ford Motor Co. said it would give its 350,000 employees
worldwide desktop computers, printers, and Internet access for $5 a
month. Some individual school districts are providing students with
computers. And increasingly, colleges require students bring a
computer along with their other dorm furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Such mass distribution of computers is not without critics, who
question whether students will use the technology for anything more
than sending e-mail to classmates. Anticipating the criticism,
King's plan also includes $1 million to train teachers in how to
tie technology to the learning of the state's new academic
standards, which are measured by a statewide test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this, someone else is going to, and why not
Maine?'' said Dennis Bailey, the governor's press secretary. ``We
can really leapfrog into the forefront of computer literacy with
this, and the governor's convinced that that's where everything's
going. It doesn't matter what field you're going to go into today,
if you're not computer- and Internet-literate, you're going to be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Those left behind tend to be those in poorer rural and urban
areas. A US Commerce Department study in July found that households
with incomes above $75,000 are 20 times as likely to have computers
as those with lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   And Maine lags far behind many states in classroom technology.
According to the state's department of education, there are 1.8
Internet-ready computers for each seventh-grade class in the state,
and 10.3 for each high school class.
</P>
<P>
   Those computers tend to be in labs. King's plan, administration
sources said, is to make them a more integral part of learning _
not just something down the hall, but in the backpack, at home and
in class.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, aides to the governor said, teachers would put homework
on Web sites and integrate Internet research into classroom
projects. From home, students could log on and ask their teachers
or peers questions about their homework. As part of the Internet
service, students will have access to the Maine School Libraries
Network _ which, administration sources note, filters out
pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would set up a $75 million trust fund that would
generate income to pay for the computers, using $25 million in
private and federal money and $50 million from the state's
estimated $300 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this now, we may not have this opportunity
again,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The King administration acknowledges there are details to be
worked out, and a significant hurdle to jump in a Legislature with
its own ideas on how to spend the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   One question is what kind of computers the plan will buy. The
plan aims to give every student e-mail, word processing, and
spreadsheet capability, but officials say that might mean newer
technology that pairs Palm Pilot-size screens with keyboards, or
more common laptops. The administration is predicting each computer
will cost $500, which even their technology consultants admit is
low for laptops on the market now. But through the consultants, the
state has talked to IBM, Compaq, and Hewlett Packard about getting
computers within that budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on where technology is trending right now and where
prices are trending, they think it is going to be feasible to do
what the state wants to do,'' said Eric Smith, a consultant to the
state and vice president of Inacom, a computer reseller. ``I think
(administration officials) are being very realistic in what they
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators also question the wisdom of giving
seventh-graders delicate laptops, which may not survive adolescent
rambunctiousness or trips home on the bus. But the state already
has a program where companies donate used computers that are then
retrofitted as Pentium class computers by the state's prison
inmates. And administration officials note dryly that
seventh-graders seem to be able to take care of their Game Boys,
which are simply hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics have a host of other concerns, from young hands
developing repetitive stress injuries, to a lack of socialization
among children who spend their afternoons staring at a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the concern about the digital divide, and what this
does in one fell swoop is eliminate it from urban and rural schools
_ that's a real plus,'' said Larry Cuban, a professor of education
at Stanford University who has written about technology in the
classroom. ``But people confuse availability with use, and that
raises a number of very complex questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Promises that teachers will be trained, he said, ``are generally
too glib.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how you train them and toward what ends. For test scores
to go up you have to have a lot of connections between what a
teacher does on a daily basis that's connected to the academic
standards, that are connected to the tests and textbooks. It's that
connective tissue that people generally don't take into
consideration. They get carried away with the glamour of just
spreading the computers around.''

 SALVADOR, Brazil: the drummers.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In last year's carnival, a replica of the Caetanave was
commissioned by the popular musician Carlinhos Brown and became one
of the high points of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The trios were playing anything and everything popular _
Paganini, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Ravel's ``Bolero,'' the
Catholic hymn ``Senhor do Bonfim,'' the Beatles' ``I Want to Hold
Your Hand'' _ all frevo-ized. In 1969, Veloso's song ``Atras do
Trio Eletrico'' (``Behind the Trio Eletrico'') became a nationwide
hit, and it was only then that trios eletricos became a profitable
symbol of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   By this time they had passed out of Dodo and Osmar's hands;
starting in the 1960s, the entrepreneur Orlando Campos developed
the trios eletricos into a business. Now they work almost like
sports teams, with each one owned privately and charging high
prices _ up to $300 this year _ for the privilege of wearing the
trio's official shirt and dancing around the trio.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Bahian music was changing, and the trios changed
along with it. In 1975 Moreira, who had just left the popular band
Os Novos Baianos, brought some radical modifications to the
tradition. He was the first to sing atop a trio _ though he
remembers that the first year it was a complete technical failure.
And he started to write an entire catalog of songs meant for that
purpose. He also incorporated afoxe rhythms _ derived from the
Yoruban heritage of this heavily African-influenced city _ into the
music and brought the drums onto the same platform as the other
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as Moreira was a rock musician, his form of rock was
heavily influenced by the sound of the trio eletrico. So it was
only natural that the trio eletrico would be equally influenced by
rock when Moreira got involved with it.
</P>
<P>
   Armandinho remembers buying distortion and phase-shifting pedals
for his small guitarra Baiana and working a strain of Jimi
Hendrix's ``Bold as Love'' into the theme song of his trio in the
early 1970s. ``When Dodo saw the pedals the first time,''
Armandinho remembered, ``he said: `I can't believe I worked so hard
to take all the distortion out of the sound, and now you're putting
it back in. It's either me or these pedals.' And he left, and
waited for me to get rid of the pedals before he got on the truck
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound system had progressed from old-fashioned loudspeakers
to sophisticated amplifiers; it was an imitation of a rock band's
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the thickening commerce around the trios since then has not
dampened their popular power or their suggestiveness. They can be
whatever the crowd is ready for. Carlinhos Brown has worked hard to
keep a spirit of creativity, surprise and renovation in the
procession of the trios; he owns the trio for the band Timbalada,
which last year was festooned with an amazing mixture of ancient
and futuristic totems (not to mention seminude dancing women).
</P>
<P>
   This year the singer Daniela Mercury has turntablists scratching
and mixing on her trio _ a first. The Brazilian-American musician
Arto Lindsay played noise-rock guitar on top of a trio during last
year's carnival; one of his dreams is to create a trio composed of
two smaller trucks that would move together, one bearing treble
speakers, the other bearing bass, for a strange, different sonic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Santtana, an important member of the next wave of young
innovators in Brazilian music, sees a natural connection between
the pipoca (or popcorn, the term for the jumping, exploding crowds
around the trio) of carnival and the audience at Berlin's Love
Parade, a procession that is more like a mobile techno-music rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trio is a rootsy thing, but it's not old, in the folkloric
sense,'' Santtana said. ``It's pop. And when I listened to the
techno music that they play in the Love Parade, I recognized many
things I heard when I was a kid in Bahia. I recognized the sub-bass
of the trios, and the high-hats _ things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His debut record, to be released in two weeks in Brazil, is
called ``Eletrobendodo'' _ an invented word that refers to the trio
eletrico, the musician Jorge Ben and Dodo.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to capture the ecstasy of the trio experience in any
still medium. For such a valued part of a carnival culture, the
trios were scarcely photographed before the 1970s; aside from the
original car and the original paus eletricos, which remain in the
Macedo family's possession, the history is largely oral. That might
be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's not very photogenic, not very good for
television,'' says Caetano Veloso, ``carnival in Bahia has been
protected from becoming artificialized.''

 &HT;    Jeb Bush defends G.W.'s visit to Bob Jones U.
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's Catholic, interracially married
governor went on national television Wednesday to defend brother
George W. Bush's visit last month to a South Carolina college that
frowns on both Catholicism and interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said he himself would speak at Bob Jones University,
even though its published rules would mean he and Mexican-born
wife, Columba, would have been expelled for dating had they met
there as students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was incumbent on political candidates to spread
their message to groups they might not agree with, and accused GOP
presidential rival Sen. John McCain of stooping to a divisive
``wedge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To even have a conversation about this in a political campaign
shows how far we've fallen,'' Jeb Bush said in a taped interview
broadcast on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``Shame on Senator McCain. Shame
on him for doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University, founded by the stridently anti-Catholic
fundamentalist preacher of the same name, did not admit black
students until the IRS took away the school's tax-exempt status in
the 1970s. It continues to ban interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The school nonetheless has been a stop for Republican candidates
for president over the past several campaigns. But this campaign,
McCain used George W. Bush's Feb. 2 visit there to criticize the
Texas governor for failing to condemn the university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush for weeks defended his visit, even though current President
Bob Jones III called the pope ``the anti-Christ'' and Bush's own
father, former President George Bush, ``a devil.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush issued an apology to New York Cardinal John
O'Connor this weekend, after exit polls in the Michigan primary
election last week showed that many Catholic voters had indeed
punished Bush after receiving phone calls from the McCain camp
describing the school and its views.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Democratic Party spokesman Tony Welch, who is black,
called Jeb Bush's defense of his brother reprehensible. ``He's
apparently appointed a new ambassador for Bob Jones University, and
it's Jeb Bush,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch wondered whether Jeb Bush's willingness to talk to groups
he disagrees with would extend to hate groups. ``I would assume
that means a Klan rally?'' Welch said. ``Where do you draw the
line?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an e-mail, told The Palm Beach Post, ``I would not
speak to the KKK,'' but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCarron, director of the Florida Catholic Conference, said
he thinks the Bob Jones controversy has gone too far, although he
was gratified by candidate Bush's apology for not speaking out more
forcefully against the school's ``offensive'' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been blown out of proportion. And I think that
it's highly political,'' McCarron said.

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ There is bad news for anyone planning to
visit Turkey this year. The velvet-lined case that houses the
country's most famous artifact, the glittering Topkapi dagger, will
be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will visitors be able to see the curved battle sword that
hung from Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror's hip when his army captured
Constantinople in 1453, or the inlaid ebony-and-ivory throne from
which the vast Ottoman Empire was once ruled, or the dazzling
emerald-studded turban decoration that awed visitors to the court
of Sultan Ahmed I in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that these objects and more than 200
others, some of which have never before left the Topkapi Palace,
will be missing because they will be on tour through the United
States. They are part of one of the most ambitious exhibitions of
Ottoman treasures ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, called ``Palace of Gold and Light: Treasures
From the Topkapi, Istanbul,'' opened on Wednesday at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington and is to travel to museums in San
Diego and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottoman art has great variety because it draws on so many
different cultures and aesthetic approaches,'' said Tulay Artan, a
history professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul and curator of
the exhibition. ``The Ottoman Empire was an umbrella for a very
diverse group of peoples, and the palace became an umbrella for all
sorts of artists. Their sensibilities blended together, and Ottoman
art became a distinct style that is immediately recognizable. It
isn't well known in the West because it's not represented in most
Western museums. That's what should make this exhibition so
interesting for American audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Topkapi Palace was once the seat of some of the world's most
enticing mysteries. Its inner courtyards and pavilions, which only
a handful of highly privileged lords and ladies were allowed to
enter, were the stuff of countless fantasies in Europe and beyond.
They were both the political heart of a great empire and the home
of concubines about whose sensuality outsiders dreamed for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 15th century, the Topkapi stands high atop a bluff
overlooking the southern end of the Bosporus, with panoramic views
of Asia and Europe. It is a walled complex that housed not only the
famous harems and their royal masters, but also thousands of
courtiers, bureaucrats, diplomats and teachers, not to mention
hundreds of cooks, bakers, confectioners and other servants.
</P>
<P>
   It boasted elaborate and fragrant gardens, a menagerie of exotic
animals, and even a fountain where the royal executioner could wash
his sword and hands after decapitations, flanked by two marble
niches where the severed heads were sometimes displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Topkapi's intricate chambers were decorated with an
exquisite skill that reflected a highly developed aesthetic sense
while also conveying the grandeur of Ottoman power. Many outsiders
who were permitted to enter came away deeply moved and impressed.
That was hardly surprising; during campaigns of conquest that
spread Ottoman rule over much of Arabia, Persia, North Africa and
southern and eastern Europe, commanders were under orders to find
the most skilled craftsmen in captured lands and send them to the
Topkapi.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many palaces in other lands where objects of beauty were
assembled, the Topkapi was never sacked by conquerors or otherwise
pillaged. It remained the residence of sultans until the 19th
century, when they finally moved to more modern palaces along the
Bosporus. Later it was turned into a museum displaying the finest
work of Ottoman artists and craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition that is now coming to the United States includes
more of these items than have ever been shown outside the Topkapi
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the best known, although by no means most artistically
significant, is the celebrated dagger. Part of its modern fame
comes from its central role in the 1964 film ``Topkapi,'' a minor
classic of the caper genre starring Maximilian Schell, Peter
Ustinov and Melina Mercouri. In it, thieves sought unsuccessfully
to steal the dagger by lowering themselves from a skylight. Its
true history is as exciting as any film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dagger was not originally meant to be kept at the Topkapi at
all. It was made in 1747 as a gift from the sultan to a Persian
shah, and few objects have so successfully conveyed one monarch's
regard for another. The scabbard is mother-of-pearl, gilded and
decorated with rows of diamonds. Three enormous emeralds shine from
its handle and a fourth, set into the top and cut into an octagon,
conceals a small timepiece.
</P>
<P>
   As the caravan carrying this extraordinary gift made its way
toward the shah's court, shocking news arrived: the intended
recipient had been overthrown and killed. The caravan turned back,
and the dagger was placed in the royal treasury. Today many
visitors to Istanbul consider it a prime attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in the exhibition are grouped to convey aspects of
life in the Topkapi. Several are connected with the conquest of
Constantinople (now Istanbul), which was a turning point in world
history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating is a talismanic shirt that Mehmet
the Conqueror wore under his armor. It suggests that he may have
been something other than an orthodox Muslim, and indeed John
Freely, an authority on life at the palace, writes that ``he seems
to have been basically irreligious, and in his observance of Islam
he merely observed the forms of the Muslim faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other objects are ceremonial pieces meant to suggest the
empire's strength and magnificence. They include ornately
embroidered caftans, military equipment and banners as well as
books bound with precious metals and gems. Ceremonial seals, keys,
scales and writing sets reflect administrative aspects of life in
the Topkapi.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most beautiful objects come from the palace's inner
sanctums. Among them are superb examples of the wall tiles and
calligraphic panels that awed outsiders and still influence popular
taste in many parts of the world. Other items, like a pencil box
that is almost entirely covered with jewels, reflect the luxury of
daily life inside the palace.
</P>
<P>
   There are also fine works of Chinese porcelain, samples from a
rich collection that reflects the sultans' fascination with arts
and crafts from distant places.
</P>
<P>
   One of the books included in the exhibition is a register of
artisans who worked at the palace. It shows the variety of arts and
crafts that the sultans prized, for among those on salary were
scribes, illuminators, painters, bookbinders, furriers, weavers,
musical instrument makers, armorers, woodworkers, carpet designers,
goldsmiths, embroiderers, glaziers, tile makers and even
specialists in making incense-burning vessels. The book is
displayed along with examples of the work these masters produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first exhibition to focus on the Topkapi and to
address the questions of what an Islamic palace was, how it worked
and how it integrated the arts,'' said Walter Denny, a professor of
art history at the University of Massachusetts who is an adviser to
the exhibition organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of its most interesting aspects is that it focuses quite a
bit of attention on Sultan Mehmet, who with all due respect to
Suleiman the Magnificent and several others was really the most
compelling, the most interesting, the most terrifying and at the
same time most fascinating of all the Ottoman sultans.
</P>
<P>
   But it also brings together a whole spectrum of objects that
show the delicacy, the sophistication, the marvelous complexity,
the subtlety and the fantastic beauty of Ottoman art.''

<P>
   The young and Harry-saturated arrived at Joseph-Beth Booksellers
in Cincinnati in numbers that startled adults like a Hogwarts magic
spell.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 9-year-olds were desperate; they had exhausted the
available supply of three Harry Potter books with frequent readings
and yearned for some palliatives until the fourth book appears
sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And so the folks at Joseph-Beth, who organized the group and
christened it the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club, comforted its
members with the adventures of Dorothy in ``The Wonderful Wizard of
Oz,'' and with ``The Book of Three,'' the first volume in a
35-year-old series about a gallant pig keeper named Taran and his
nemesis, the grim Horn King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing kids' books for 10 years, and I've never seen
anything like this, kids coming in and saying give me something
like this book,'' said Wendi Gratz, a children's buyer for the
Joseph-Beth's chain, who counted 20 children ages 9 to 13 at the
inaugural meeting of the club, one of hundreds organized by
bookstores around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the literary halo effect of J.K. Rowling's best-selling
fantasy series. It has turned knobby-kneed Harry Potter into the
Medici patron of children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the sales of children's books soared on the windstream
of Harry's Nimbus 2000 flying broom. Classics like C.S. Lewis'
``Chronicles of Narnia'' experienced an otherwise inexplicable
burst in popularity, as did newer fantasy titles like Brian
Jacques' ``Redwall'' series, which had been selling well and
steadily over the years until Hogwarts magic gave it a sudden lift.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter series _ with more than 18.5 million copies in print
from its publisher, Scholastic _ accounted for much of the general
sales growth in children's literature. Last year paperback sales
alone increased almost 24 percent to $660 million and hardcover
sales grew more than 11 percent to $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers said they suspected that the sales were buoyed, in
part, by a prosperous economy, but that theory does not extend to
adult books. Hardcover sales to adults increased a modest 2.6
percent to $2.8 billion last year, while trade paperback sales grew
a little over 3 percent to almost $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That literary divide was sharply apparent this month when
youthful readers demonstrated their growing cultural clout. For the
first time, five children's novels elbowed aside the grown-up fare
on the fiction best-seller list of The New York Times on Feb. 20,
with a sixth juvenile title, ``Holes,'' by Louis Sachar, hovering
on the fringes of best-sellerdom. (The Times is now considering
creating a separate children's list.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the best-selling children's novels _ three of them the
Harry Potter titles _ are 230 to 400 pages and emphasize a linear
plot, vivid writing, a high degree of sophistication and few, if
any, illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lucas, 11, a charter member of the Harry Potter
Withdrawal Club in Cincinnati, said Harry, the junior wizard, has
given him a taste for exactly this sort of literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked reading, but after Harry Potter I got more into
the magic ones than the normals,'' he said on Friday while at home
with the flu and speeding to the end of his current book, ``Wayside
School Gets a Little Stranger,'' by Louis Sachar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a completely different world,'' he said of his new
penchant for fantasy titles with a touch of magic. ``You know how
they make books and movies for TV? I've read the books, and my mom
would get the video. I've noticed that every single time the book
is better than the video.''
</P>
<P>
   Librarians and booksellers say that as mighty as Harry is, there
is no doubt that other factors are also driving the fantasy book
boom. They cite a prosperous economy, growing efforts by parents to
encourage children to read and perhaps an inflation in purchases by
adults who are buying children's books to read themselves. Some
experts also said the Potter boom was not an undiluted plus.

   ``There's a lot of halo effect from Harry Potter that's positive
and negative,'' said Diane Garrett, owner of Diane's Books in
Greenwich, Conn., which on Wednesday attracted nearly 150 children
and adults to a reading of the newest ``Redwall'' book by Jacques.
```Harry Potter' is getting many people to read who wouldn't pick
up a book. But what's happening is that it's eclipsing some of the
literature. Kids don't want to read about animals, or they don't
want to read fabulous things for their own age, or they're reading
Harry too young. So we're spending a lot of time reminding parents
that their kids are too young for `Harry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But tell that to the four children of the Jernick family of
Portola Valley, Calif. Ranging in age from 5 to 14, they have all
worked their way through the Potter books and are now exploring
other literary fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read all of the `Redwall' books,'' said Michael Jernick,
14. That is no small boast, since he has gone through 12 books in
the fantasy series about Redwall Abbey mice by Jacques, whose
latest book, ``The Legend of Luke,'' occupies grown-up best-seller
real estate. ``I've also read all three Harry Potter books,'' he
added. ``And I have to read the next one. I can't wait. But I have
to read different things.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ascendance of the high kiddie literary form, publishing
executives are already rushing to capitalize. Their promotions
offer various solutions to the question that librarians and
booksellers say they now frequently face: Children ask what else
they can read while they wait for the next ``Harry Potter'' book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would say this, but for the first time I'm
grateful to `Harry Potter,''' said a keen Potter competitor, Craig
Virden, the publisher of Random House Children's Books, where net
sales were up by 12 percent last year and are expected to rise by
double digits again this year. ``I think `Harry Potter' has made
reading cool. The best advertisement you can have is a kid talking
to another kid about a book.''

HARVARD OPTS OUT OF FINANCIAL ROLE IN HMO'S RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard University rejected Wednesday a proposal from
Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly to play a financial
role in the rehabilitation of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care,
according to hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
   University officials refused to comment, but they have
consistently insisted on participation by other large employers as
a condition of risking any of Harvard's own money to rescue the
ailing health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state has said it may have to raise anywhere from $175
million and $225 million to save Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard and the major employers _ that's where the problem
lies,'' one hospital executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and his staff were not available to comment on the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's decision complicates but does not necessarily doom the
chances that Harvard Pilgrim can continue as the state's largest
nonprofit health insurer, according to members of the hospital
community. The attorney general is believed to be trying to cobble
together other alternatives, although no one involved in the
two-month-old Harvard Pilgrim crisis knew what the other options
were, or if they knew, would give any hint.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives are still waiting for Reilly to tell them
what he'd like them to contribute and on what terms. At one point
this week, hospital officials understood through intermediaries
that Reilly was trying to raise equal amounts of cash from multiple
sources to total $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital sources said that one proposal called for hospitals,
Harvard University and Perot Systems, a computer firm that is the
HMO's biggest vendor, to contribute $75 million each. But it was
unclear whether all three groups would contribute cash, or whether
some would put in cash loans while others would guarantee those
loans.
</P>
<P>
   According to this plan, hospital sources said, no one of these
groups would invest more than others, to guard against undue
influence in Harvard Pilgrim's management.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has called hospital representatives to a 5
p.m. meeting Friday, an indication he is not yet ready to lay a
proposal before them.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Keating, chief financial officer of UMass Memorial Health
Care, said that he and other hospital CFOs have been asked to
attend a meeting to review a ``surplus notes option.''
</P>
<P>
   Surplus notes are IOUs that would not count as debt on Harvard
Pilgrim's books, thereby raising the health plan's net worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is that the only thing holding it up is the
security of the loans, for the most part,'' Keating said. ``The
providers are sitting back and waiting to see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital financial officers remain cautious about lending
Harvard Pilgrim any money. Without a guarantee from the state or a
private investor behind the surplus notes, ``it would not be a
prudent investment,'' Keating said. ``It's a risk we can't take. It
will literally put hospitals in bankruptcy if there's a default to
that extent.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for hospitals' reluctance is skepticism about the
financial impact on Harvard Pilgrim in 2001 and 2002 if hospitals
and doctors win what they consider to be ``catch-up'' increases in
payment rates from the HMO, which insures one-sixth of the state's
population.
</P>
<P>
   If hospitals become major investors in Harvard Pilgrim's
turnaround, they have an interest in its long-term fiscal
viability, one hospital financial officer explained, or they won't
get their loans repaid.
</P>
<P>
   But this investor role potentially conflicts with hospitals'
interest as health care providers in negotiating the highest
possible payment rates from Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   One executive at a major hospital network said the conflict of
interest could be mitigated by spreading out the loans among a
large number of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital executive said that if a small group of hospitals
loan money to Harvard Pilgrim, then the HMO may have to cut
reimbursements to all hospitals to repay those loans and the
accompanying interest. In effect, the small group of investor
hospitals would be cushioned from lower reimbursements by the
interest on their loans, while their noninvesting competitors would
be put at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and state Insurance Commissioner Linda
Ruthardt, who was named on Jan. 4 to administer Harvard Pilgrim
while its fate is worked out, are scheduled to file a progress
report with the court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly had said he hoped to indicate by then which path he was
pursuing _ recapitalizing the HMO as a nonprofit, selling it to a
for-profit company, liquidating it, or restructuring its debt to
give it time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and his staff have said publicly and
privately this week that there are several for-profit suitors for
Harvard Pilgrim in the wings. Speculation has centered mainly
around Connecticut-based Oxford Health Plans and Anthem Insurance
Companies of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of hospital officials and HMO industry
observers are skeptical that for-profit interest in Harvard Pilgrim
is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear there are four potential for-profit buyers, but I
personally don't think there's anything there,'' said one hospital
executive. ``I think it's smoke and mirrors right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That executive said he thinks for-profit companies are mainly
interested in scavenging Harvard Pilgrim subscribers if the HMO
folds rather than taking it over and turning it around.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are for-profit buyers, ``I think people realize
that no for-profit is going to pay 100 cents on the dollar'' to
settle Harvard Pilgrim's debts, said one Massachusetts health
insurance executive.
</P>
<P>
   By these assessments, it appears that all the options for
Harvard Pilgrim involve some degree of risk or pain for hospitals,
which are reportedly owed more than $200 million by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what role the Legislature would be asked to
play in the Harvard Pilgrim endgame. There was talk of setting up a
commission to address HMO regulation and other issues raised by the
current HMO crisis, and possibly to consider state loan guarantees
or hospital relief, but those reports could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mark Montigny, a New Bedford Democrat who chairs the
Senate Ways and Means Committee, said he told Reilly on Tuesday
that he would help expedite any necessary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we learn what the short list of options is from the
attorney general, we have to be prepared to act very quickly,''
Montigny said. One concern, he added, is that all Massachusetts
HMOs should be subjected to the same conditions put on Harvard
Pilgrim as a condition of its rehabilitation so that the ailing HMO
is not put at a competitive disadvantage.

 UNDATED: a book.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Harry'' halo effect has touched classics like ``The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' the first book in C.S. Lewis'
``Chronicles of Narnia'' series, which was first published in 1950.
All seven titles reliably sell about 1.7 million copies a year for
the publisher, HarperCollins, but in the first half of the
company's fiscal year sales have already reached that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have also tripled for Lloyd Alexander's ``Chronicles of
Prydain'' series about Taran, the assistant pig keeper, which in
ordinary years sells about 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Harry Potter's creator, Rowling, expressed a fondness
for Dodie Smith's 1948 book, ``I Capture the Castle,'' about
17-year-old Cassandra who keeps a 6-penny journal of life in a
ramshackle English castle. In response, the book's publisher, St.
Martin's Press, immediately repackaged the book, included an
endorsement from Rowling on the cover, and then watched a steady
backlist title rise in sales to 54,000 from 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Young Americans are making reading choices that show a distinct
preference for a backdrop with a British accent. The ``Potter''
series, the ``Narnia'' books and ``I Capture the Castle'' are all
set in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This month the American Booksellers Association and its Book
Sense marketing staff polled independent booksellers on their
recommendations for what they are calling Harry Potter Deprivation
Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The top response from 400 stores was ``The Golden Compass,'' a
416-page fantasy about an orphan named Lyra who grows up near
Oxford University and, naturally, is caught in a life-and-death
struggle against dark forces.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Top 10 list also includes classics like ``The
Hobbit,'' Edward Eager's 50-year-old ``Half Magic'' and Madeleine
L'Engle's ``Wrinkle in Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from hundreds of independent stores, and they're
all producing lists and fliers or Harry Potter recommendations to
meet the demand,'' said Carl Lennertz, a marketing consultant for
the national Book Sense marketing campaign. ``It's funny, I could
have begged my daughter to read `The Hobbit,' but she might not
have ever read it if this hadn't happened. There's a little bit of
peer pressure. You've got to keep up, but once they're in, they're
hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The burst in sales of juvenile novels follows a gloomy period in
the late 1990s when the children's paperback market dipped by
almost 20 percent, as fans started abandoning the popular
``Goosebumps'' horror series. Over a two-year period through 1998,
customers were buying fewer copies of children's books, according
to the Consumer Research Study on Book Purchasing, which has not
yet released its 1999 study.
</P>
<P>
   Last year consultants for the Association of American Publishers
developed long-term projections that underestimated the percentage
growth in children's hardcover sales by over half, because they had
not factored in what Albert N. Greco, who helped develop the
projections, calls the ``titanic of book publishing: `Harry
Potter.'''
</P>
<P>
   The trends involving younger readers are clearly at odds with
those for younger adults, who according to surveys are devoting
less money and time to books. (People over 49 remain loyal
customers with increasing sales levels.)
</P>
<P>
   At Books of Wonder in New York, the clerks are approached about
four times a day by children and adults who are seeking post-Potter
reading material, said Jennifer Lavonier, manager and buyer for the
store. By now the response has a certain rhythm: Employees hand a
packet to customers that includes ``Harry Potter'' games and
questions and a list of some 20 other children's novels to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Lavonier said she suspected that adults were seeking children's
novels for themselves because ``there's a lot of imagination in
children's books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of scenery and detail that's not in some adult
books,'' she said. ``To be honest, I don't really even read adult
books anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That view has resulted in some odd role reversals.
Eleven-year-old Logan Dill of Kentucky is currently rereading the
three books in the ``Harry Potter'' series to her father while
driving on errands with him in the family car.
</P>
<P>
   She is the most dedicated member of Joseph-Beth's Harry Potter
Withdrawal Club. Although attendance for club meetings has been up
and down, Logan is already planning to read the club's choice for
April, ``The Golden Compass,'' and has voluntarily finished ``The
Black Cauldron,'' the second title in the Lloyd Alexander
``Chronicles of Prydain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for the fourth `Harry Potter' book,'' she
said. ``But the books I've been reading have really helped. There's
nothing that can compare to Harry, but these books have really
helped fill the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Logan has nearly finished reading the third ``Harry
Potter'' to her father, she has found relief just in time. In a few
days she said she will begin reading aloud ``The Black Cauldron''
series to her father.

<P>
   PARIS _ Renzo Piano chuckled as he remembered how he and Richard
Rogers were ``young boys, really young and quite bad boys'' in 1971
when they won the architecture competition for the Georges Pompidou
Center with a design that they considered a parody of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim was to create a sort of anti-monument, a cultural
center that was anything but institutional in appearance, and the
proof of their success was the outcry that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now, at 62, Piano, a good-natured Italian, seemed
amazed that France allowed two young foreigners _ he was 33 and his
British partner was 37 _ to challenge the sober 18th-century stone
facades of eastern Paris with an immense metallic structure
variously described (by its critics) as a refinery or an ocean
liner and (by its architects) as ``a Jules Verne spaceship that
can't fly.'' An international jury chose the design, but the French
government nonetheless accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Pompidou was very courageous, that's for sure,''
Piano recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was almost 30 years ago, and time has a way of
spawning respectability. The Pompidou Center finally opened in
1977, it proved immensely popular and today it (italics)is(end
italics) a monument. Piano in turn made his name, his long black
beard gave way to a salt-and-pepper stubble and he collected
architectural honors, including the highly regarded Pritzker Prize
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems altogether appropriate that the center should now
play host to the largest retrospective to date of his prolific
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibition is a bit like an incestuous relationship with
the building,'' Piano said while guiding a visitor around the show,
which runs here through March 20. ``It will then go to the Neue
Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Mies van der Rohe's building. There it
will be like going into a Greek temple.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which includes scores of models, drawings,
videos and photographs of Piano's principal projects, will be on
display in Berlin from June 1 to Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's interest in his work is hardly accidental. The Renzo
Piano Building Workshop, as his Paris- and Genoa-based practice is
called, has recently given new form to what was the prewar heart of
Berlin by designing both the overall plan and eight of the
buildings of the Potsdamer Platz, the largest new urban complex to
rise in the reunified German capital.
</P>
<P>
   But if the first exhibit in the Paris show is dedicated to the
Pompidou Center, it is not only because this project began Piano's
international career. For the last few years he has again been busy
here, building a reconstitution of Brancusi's studio at one end of
the sloping plaza in front of the center, then overseeing
repainting of the entire structure and, most recently, playing a
central role in reorganizing and renovating the center. After 27
months' work, the center reopened on Jan. 1, with additional space
given over to its public library and modern art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Piano is happy with everything that has changed. Both
he and Mr. Rogers have criticized the decision to end free access
by escalator to a viewing platform overlooking Paris. On the other
hand, Piano has suggested, only half-jokingly, that the center
close every 25 years so its function can be rethought. And the fact
that it can be easily rearranged, he noted, is a tribute to its
flexibility. Indeed, one new space is the 15,000-square-foot south
gallery that houses his show.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's curator, Olivier Cinqualbre, who has worked
closely with Piano and his workshop, has chosen to present the
architect's projects not chronologically but rather around three
broad themes: invention, urbanism and sensitivity. Models and other
illustrations of completed buildings are spread over some 20
tables, each hanging by wires from the ceiling, while a half-dozen
wall panels around the gallery show drawings of projects still at
the design stage, among them new buildings for Harvard University's
art museums and for the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't show everything, we can't say everything,''
Cinqualbre explained. ``Rather, we want to show the visitor as
clearly as possible how Renzo and his workshop work and have worked
for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano likes to describe the exhibition as ``the imaginary
city,'' which seems reasonable enough because it contains examples
of just about everything found in a modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   In the section on invention, for instance, there are displays of
the San Nicola soccer stadium in Bari, Italy; of the milelong
terminal at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan; of a
commercial center in Nola, outside Naples, inspired by the conical
shape of Mount Vesuvius; of a gigantic shell-like church being
built at the shrine to the Italian mystic Padre Pio in San Giovanni
Rotonda, Italy; and of office and residential towers overlooking
the Botanical Gardens in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The section on urbanism naturally includes the Pompidou Center
and the Potsdamer Platz, both catalysts for urban transformation.
In the case of the renovation of the old port in Piano's hometown,
Genoa, to mark the 500th anniversary of the voyage of another
native son, Christopher Columbus, urban improvement was the
principal objective.
</P>
<P>
   With the old Fiat-Lingotto factory in Turin, Italy, the aim was
to preserve the structure of an admired 1925 industrial building
while converting its space into a convention center and hotel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The section on sensitivity presumably covers those projects
closest to Piano's heart. One of these is the widely acclaimed
museum that he built in Houston in the mid-1980's for the art
patron Dominique de Menil, to house the Menil Collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very much about atmosphere,'' Piano said, standing
beside a model of the museum, ``trying to balance the presence of
art and the beauty of the building. Some people believe that to
make a good building for art, you have to make white boxes. This is
absolutely not true. You kill art by making a neutral building.
Others believe you must compete with the art, and I think that is
also very wrong. So you have to find the balance. What we worked on
here was the idea of creating space with a lot of character, not
for formal reasons, but for immaterial reasons, such as the sense
of lightness, the sense of transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, this same approach was used in his elegantly
simple design of a museum for the Beyeler Foundation in Basel,
Switzerland, with its naturally lighted galleries and its large
windows looking out onto the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the project that has most excited Piano is one
that even his closest admirers have probably seen only in models
and photographs: the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center in Noumea
on New Caledonia, a French-run island in the Pacific. Commissioned
by the French government, Piano took his inspiration from
traditional Kanak tribal huts and designed eight semicircular
wooden structures, varying in height from 60 to 90 feet, that seem
to float over low-lying exhibition spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The building looks like nothing Piano has designed before. On
the other hand, even with wooden models giving a certain uniformity
to the exhibition, what is most striking is the absence of a Renzo
Piano ``look.'' While Rogers echoed the Pompidou Center in his
Lloyd's of London building in the mid-1980s, Piano set off
simultaneously in several directions.
</P>
<P>
   His upbringing offers one explanation. His father was a Genoa
builder and, although young Renzo chose architecture, he always
felt close to the crafts and materials used in construction. Thus,
unlike architects with an artistic background who are often more
concerned about how buildings look, he is among those who approach
architecture through engineering or construction and are more
interested in how buildings are made. So a ``look'' has never
interested Piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think style is a very dangerous concept,'' he said. ``It's a
narcissistic attitude. Why should you worry about style? Worry
about coherence. That is a better idea. Style is like a rubber
stamp, a designer label; it becomes quite commercial. Even artists
like Giacometti, in his later years, he was trapped by people
telling him, `I want this.' So style becomes a limitation, a sort
of golden cage, in which you worry about being recognized. What I
like about the Menil Collection is that the building is a portrait
of the client, not of the architect.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reassuringly, he seems all too aware of the potentially
dangerous power enjoyed by architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a bad writer, no one reads your book,'' he said.
``If you're a bad musician, no one listens to your music. But if
you're a bad architect, you impose something on a city forever. I
believe architecture can transform life, it is a utopia, it can
bring lightness and beauty and poetry. But the architect has a
great responsibility. Aesthetics and ethics are very much
connected, but I didn't understand that when I was 30 or when I was
40 or when I was 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Having caused a furor with the Pompidou Center in his 30s, Piano
now looks back with some alarm at how little he knew at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``my feeling is that you should live as
an architect only after you are 50 because for the first 50 years
you just learn. I am not joking. You learn and you make so many
mistakes. Then, when you reach 50, maybe you can work properly for
50 years.'' He paused to light his pipe and smiled. ``And after
that maybe you have another 50 years to teach other people.''

U.S. STALLS SELECTION OF NEW IMF CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton pledged this week to block a
German finance ministry official from assuming the top post at the
International Monetary Fund, in effect vetoing the man the European
Union had chosen for the job, he seemed to risk a diplomatic
confrontation across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   What really happened, Clinton administration and some European
officials now say, is that the president agreed to play the heavy
because both U.S. and European diplomats had trouble communicating
across the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   During the four months that Germany was aggressively promoting
Caio Koch-Weser to take over at the IMF, ending with Europe's
formal endorsement by the 15-nation European Union, officials from
the United States, Britain, Italy and France had regular
conversations in which they agreed broadly on two things: The next
head of the IMF should be a European and the European should not be
Koch-Weser, several Clinton administration officials and European
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. and European officials said that Koch-Weser, a genial
55-year-old state secretary in Germany's finance ministry, lacks
the gravitas and financial expertise to lead the IMF at a time when
it is arguably more powerful than ever before. The problem for
fellow Europeans, and later for Americans, was that Germany ignored
some early signs of unease with Koch-Weser and started the nation's
most aggressive diplomatic campaign in years to install him as head
of the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mistook politeness for support,'' one administration
official said. ``In the end, they kind of backed us into a corner
and made us play big foot.''
</P>
<P>
   That description of events serves U.S. interests, of course, by
cloaking an unusual and potentially explosive decision in the garb
of a broader diplomatic imperative. It also contradicts public
statements that European ministers have made in recent days,
including several comments chastising Washington for its hubris.
</P>
<P>
   But European officials confirmed in interviews that they
supported Koch-Weser mainly to preserve European unity in the face
of an unyielding German campaign rather than because they agreed he
should head the IMF, a post held by a European ever since the
institution was created just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even as they publicly rallied behind Koch-Weser, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin of France and Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
of Italy have been calling each other to discuss new candidates for
the job, diplomats told about the conversations said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition in Europe is solidarity on decisions of this
kind,'' one European diplomat said. ``But there is also an
understanding of the position of the United States. There is
certainly no crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the world often has a hard time selecting leaders for the
main international institutions _ succession at the United Nations
and the World Trade Organization has been contentious as well _ the
search for a head of the monetary fund shows how diplomatically
delicate, and deeply flawed, the search process has become,
administration officials and outside experts say. If there is a
single lesson from the search, it is that the current process,
whereby interested countries nominate their own citizens for key
posts and then use their diplomatic influence to support them,
needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' rejection of Koch-Weser _ and its decision at
this stage not to back anyone else _ means that when the monetary
fund conducts an informal vote on Thursday, there will almost
certainly be no winner. Aside from Koch-Weser, there are two other
candidates. Stanley Fischer, the American who serves as deputy
managing director, was nominated by a group of 20 African and Arab
countries. Japan has nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance
ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after that is uncertain. Clinton administration
officials and European officials say that they hope German
officials will realize after the straw poll, if they have not
already, that the nomination of Koch-Weser was a mistake. That
would clear the way for other possible European candidates,
including the British and Italian finance ministers and the head of
the Bank for International Settlements, who are more likely to
generate broad support, according to U.S. and European officials.

</P>
<P>
   The search for a new IMF leader began last October, when it
became clear to top financial officials that Michel Camdessus of
France, who led the monetary fund for 13 years, planned to retire
two years before the end of his term. The post immediately
attracted a slew of potential European candidates. But the
strongest push came from Germany, which had made clear its
intention of taking a larger role in international institutions and
felt that the French, who have named most IMF directors, should not
claim this one as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans immediately put forward Koch-Weser. On paper, at
least, he had the perfect resume. An economist who worked for a
quarter-century at the World Bank, Koch-Weser had extensive
contacts in financial circles around the world, spoke six languages
and was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of all of Germany's small
circle of financial bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser also had good political ties at home, people who
worked with him said. He left the World Bank in Washington, where
he had risen to managing director, one of the five most senior
posts, to return to Germany soon after the election of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. The new chancellor named him state secretary at
the finance ministry, the No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Larry Summers made clear from the start,
including in conversations with Koch-Weser during meetings in
Europe and Tokyo, that he did not favor the German's bid to head
the fund. The two had known each other when both were working at
the World Bank in the early 1990s. Summers' main concern was that
Koch-Weser was a specialist in poverty relief and had no expertise
in finance. Moreover, the German was seen as a go-along-get-along
guy who thrived at the World Bank by working well with the
bureaucracy, not by leading it, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Koch-Weser's candidacy did not ring alarm bells at
the Treasury Department. Administration officials said the European
reaction to Koch-Weser was even cooler than their own, especially
among France, Britain and Italy. It was given low odds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States was drawn directly into the European fray by
Schroeder himself. Early last month, he called Clinton _ the two
have a close relationship, administration officials said _ and
lobbied him directly. Clinton used diplomatic language to convey to
Schroeder that Koch-Weser had not demonstrated that he had broad
support, not only in Europe but also around the world. Yet, in part
because administration officials still believed Koch-Weser's
chances of getting European backing were slim, Clinton assured
Schroeder that the United States had no objections to a German
candidate per se.
</P>
<P>
   Germany began promoting Clinton's friendly words as a tacit
endorsement, administration officials said. Schroeder promptly flew
to Paris to meet with President Jacques Chirac and Jospin. The
French, who had been the only Europeans to publicly challenge
Koch-Weser's qualifications, were told that Clinton had no problem
with Koch-Weser provided he became the unified European choice,
according to people told about Schroeder's conversation with the
French.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign gathered steam, Clinton administration officials
began fretting that they had been too passive early on. Summers;
Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser; Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser; and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had a series of phone calls to debate strategy.
Sensing that a confrontation with Germany might be inevitable,
Berger and Sperling began doing their own research on Koch-Weser.
If they were going to risk German ire, they wanted to be certain
that Treasury's opinion of Koch-Weser was right, officials said.
Both Sperling and Berger ended up agreeing with the Treasury view,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was the most reluctant of Clinton's top advisers to risk
a diplomatic split with Germany, administration officials said. But
as the European Union endorsement became inevitable last week, he
agreed that it was better to try to stop the candidacy now than to
stay silent and possibly set off a bigger, public confrontation
later.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Clinton initiated a call to Schroeder. The message
was unmistakable: The United States wants a European for the job,
but not Koch-Weser. &QL;

STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHY A 6-YEAR-OLD KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (with CHILD-SHOT)  
 (bl)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the morning, the boy pulled out a pistol and killed his
first-grade classmate, Kayla Rolland.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, police said, he sat at a table and drew
pictures, seemingly unaware that something horrendous had happened.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the culpability of the 6-year-old who
turned a peaceful Tuesday morning at Buell Elementary School in a
suburb of Flint, Mich., into a nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   For the legal system, the question is relatively clear cut.
Because of just such contradictions in behavior, in the United
States and most other industrialized nations, children under the
age of 7 are not normally held responsible for crimes like murder.
And Arthur Busch, the Genesee County prosecutor, said Tuesday it is
unlikely that the boy will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues are much murkier for parents, school officials,
government leaders and others who try to understand why young
children kill, and what can be done to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Garbarino, the author of ``Lost Boys: Why Our Sons
Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'' (Free Press, 1999), said
that, in some ways, the age of the Buell boy was anything but
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of 8-year-olds, he said, show that one-third said they
could get a gun if they wanted one. In several incidents around the
country, children 6 and younger have been caught bringing guns to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing magical or automatic about the age,'' said
Garbarino, a professor of human development at Cornell University,
``There's no built in protection there. Quite the contrary, there
is a built in vulnerability. A young child is even more open to
cultural and family influence than an older kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Those influences, Garbarino said, include the availability of
lethal weapons, and ``ample opportunities to see on television and
in the movies how you threaten people, what it means to shoot
someone, and ample opportunities to learn about revenge and how
desirable it is in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the nation to be shocked and appalled and mystified and
stunned,'' he said, ``is either a kind of denial or hypocrisy.''.
</P>
<P>
   Garbarino and others said that whether a 6-year-old understands
the significance and permanence of death, however, depends on the
individual child, the circumstances of the child's life, and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found in recent years that young children have
a more developed moral sense and a greater ability to grasp
abstract concepts and to reason rationally than was once believed.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 6 or even younger, said Dr. Elliot Turiel, a
developmental psychologist and chancellor's professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, most children understand that
it is wrong to harm another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can understand that it hurts,'' Turiel said, ``and that
they don't want to experience pain and other people don't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it would be okay for one child to hit another without
provocation, he said, most children at 6 would say that it would be
wrong, and would stick to their conviction even if there were no
official rules prohibiting such action or if an authority figure
were to say that it was permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for some children, he said, the threshold for retaliation
in response to another's actions might be lower than for others.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, Dr. Ron Avi Astor, then a graduate student at
Berkeley and now an assistant professor at the University of
Michigan, presented two groups of children with moral dilemmas.
Children in one group had a history of aggressive actions, the
others did not.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was okay to hit another child without
provocation, children in both groups responded that to do so would
be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was okay to hit another child who had teased them or
called them names, however, children with a history of aggression
were more likely to say that retaliation by hitting would be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``While both understand moral judgments,'' Turiel said, ``they
seem to make different judgments with regard to retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young children, experts now say, are also more adept at
understanding some abstract concepts _ basic notions of biology,
for example _ than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Gelman, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said that ``there is good evidence that children have at
least some beginning understanding of biological processes even in
the preschool years.''
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 5, for instance, most children understand that
getting fat is a consequence of eating a lot. And they show a basic
grasp of the notion of heredity: Asked if a baby cow raised with
pigs would be more like a cow or more like a pig, most children
said that the cow would still be a cow, Gelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what light _ if any _ such studies shed on the mind of a
6-year-old who guns down a classmate is uncertain. In the real
world, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, director of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Network on Adolescent
Development and Juvenile Justice, ``there is good reason to believe
that children of this age have difficulty envisioning the future
consequences of actions _ as most parents of children up to the age
of 11 will tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur network, made up of experts in the social sciences
and the law, is studying issues relating to crimes committed by
children, in an effort to determine at what age it is appropriate
to hold someone responsible for a criminal act. Steinberg, a
professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, said
the research is still under way. But he predicted the age would
turn out to be somewhere between 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't enough to say, did the child know right from wrong?''
Steinberg said. ``The issue is whether this individual had the
cognitive and emotional capabilities to stop himself from doing
something, even if he knew it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And a child's emotional state, said Dr. Donald Rosenblitt, a
psychoanalyst specializing in treating children and director of the
Lucy Daniels Center for Early Childhood in Cary, N.C., often can
have a direct impact on the ability to reason.
</P>
<P>
   Children who commit acts of violence, he said, often do not have
a real emotional understanding of injury and death.
</P>
<P>
   Life in a chaotic world _ growing up in a house where adults
come and go, and guns are lying out in the open, for example _ can
produce a child who cannot control aggression and who does not make
the distinctions between play and reality that he said are normal
at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who uses a real gun to discharge these feelings,''
Rosenblitt said, ``shows a failure, at a very significant level, to
find other ways to deal with troubles, and this could come from how
they have been treated, or how they have seen people being
treated.'' What a 6-year-old boy who shoots a classmate may not
have had, he said, ``was the protective umbrella that a normal
child would have, one that would wrap his anger in a regard for
people and a sense of caring and empathy.''

 BUSH'S CAMP UNVEILS TOUGH NEW STRATEGY AGAINST McCAIN IN NEW YORK 
 (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh from his three-state victory for the Republican
presidential nomination on Tuesday night, Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday turned his attention to New York, unleashing a scathing
stream of attacks _ by mail, telephone, and radio _ that portrayed
Sen. John McCain as repeatedly voting against the concerns of New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, tough and precisely targeted at different
regions of the state, was introduced on Wednesday by Gov. George
Pataki, the chairman of Bush's New York campaign, at an afternoon
news conference in Albany, where he labeled McCain as ``anti-New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, Bush began broadcasting a radio
advertisement featuring Geri Barish, a well-known Long Island
advocate for breast cancer research, who attacked McCain for voting
against legislation for some breast cancer research money. ``We
deserve a candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust,''
Barish said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks by Bush came as he and McCain approached what many
Republicans believe could be a climactic round of primaries next
Tuesday, and with Bush's New York supporters arguing that a
divisive defeat for McCain in New York _ a state where polls now
show the two men in a tie _ could effectively end McCain's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that Bush had, as he has in other major states,
handed over much of the control of his effort to local officials,
in this case, Pataki; William Powers, who is the state Republican
Party chairman, and Zenia Mucha, who is Pataki's chief political
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a coordinated campaign of mail, radio ads and
telephone calls, that seeks to highlight votes that McCain cast in
the Senate that may undercut him with voters across the state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one piece of mail, sent to Republican voters in
districts with a heavy concentration of farmers, noted that McCain
had opposed allowing New York to enter the Northeast Dairy Compact,
which would have provided higher payments for milk. Another, sent
to the northern reaches of New York, pointed to votes McCain had
cast against aid to help people paying fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absolutely consistent pattern of voting against the
interests of New York, whether it's specific things like voting
against aid for the ice storm recovery or the dairy compact, or
generic things like the whole transit thing where he voted to cut
us,'' Pataki said in an interview after the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The tough New York strategy ruptured anew the relationship
between Pataki and another prominent supporter of Bush, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. Giuliani has resisted playing a
key role in attacks on McCain, apparently concerned that he is
being perceived as too harsh in his handling of his
all-but-announced Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After initially agreeing to join other Republican mayors on
behalf of Bush at a news conference scheduled for Thursday,
Giuliani abruptly withdrew from the event after seeing a release
promoting it as an assault on McCain for his Senate votes, one of
the mayor's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   While the aide said the mayor would accompany Pataki when Bush
travels in the city on Friday and Saturday for several campaign
stops, Giuliani plans to refuse to engage in any attacks on McCain,
whom the mayor has described as a friend and a hero. This adviser
said that Giuliani believed Bush and his New York campaign were
making a mistake in turning the campaign so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wants to strongly support and campaign with Bush,''
the adviser said. ``But it's becoming increasingly difficult
because of the governor's office.'' This adviser said that the
mayor would not lend his name to any attacks on McCain, and had
already demanded that he not be included in a piece of campaign
literature attacking McCain for voting against relief for upstate
residents following severe ice storms.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's senior New York adviser, Guy V. Molinari, the Staten
Island borough president, ridiculed efforts by Pataki and Bush as
``stupid'' and ``immature.'' He argued that their tactics would
only succeed in weakening the Republican Party for the fall
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making more dumb mistakes,'' Molinari said. ``What
are they going to do if John McCain ends up being the nominee of
the party? How do they swallow their remarks? We can reasonably
expect the Democrats to pick up these charges. This is the dumbest
thing in the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of turning McCain's voting record against him was
reminiscent of what Vice President Al Gore did, to great effect,
against Bill Bradley, his Democratic opponent and a former senator
from New Jersey, earlier in the primary season. Gore, for example,
attacked Bradley during the Iowa caucuses for votes against
agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking in this case is the manner in which Bush and
his advisers appear to be tailoring attacks to appeal to different
parts of the state. The strategy reflects the unusual nature of the
New York contest: rather than just a statewide contest involving
Bush, McCain and a third candidate, Alan Keyes, Republicans in each
of 31 separate congressional districts will be voting for three
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer radio ad, for example, is running mainly on
Long Island and in the New York City metropolitan area. Long Island
is expected to be a key area in the Republican vote _ that is where
Bush will start his New York state swing on Friday _ and the
incidence of breast cancer there has been a subject of concern
among public officials and voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Barish has become a symbol of that effort, and a close adviser
to Pataki, so the advertisement by her could be particularly
potent, as she lists votes in Congress that McCain cast, such as
cutting financing for some breast-cancer research programs. ``John
McCain calls these projects, just `garden-variety pork,'' she said
in the ad. ``That's shocking. America deserves better. Next
Tuesday, John McCain won't have my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki scoffed at the suggestion that the attacks would only
weaken McCain in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, were McCain to be the nominee, many of those
Democrats would be out there pointing out the shortcomings of his
record,'' Pataki said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The severe turn taken by Bush's campaign in New York was
particularly notable given that Bush appears to have a definite
organizational advantage over McCain. He has the support of the
state Republican organization, giving him a ready-made machine to
contact potential voters, and make certain they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Pataki has arguably as much riding on the outcome
as Bush, both because he has so identified himself with Bush's
effort, and because so many Republicans were critical of his
ultimately failed effort to avoid this primary by trying to keep
McCain off the ballot. Pataki's supporters have suggested that Bush
might consider the governor of New York as a potential candidate
for vice president; in any event, Pataki presumably does not want
to be remembered as another Republican governor who failed Bush at
a key time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's New York supporters suggested that Pataki's desire
to prove otherwise accounted for the searing, layered assault on
McCain. The governor, though, shrugged off the idea that a Bush
loss in his state might hurt him. ``I'll leave that to the
pundits,'' he said.

PLAYERS HAVE VOICE, AND THEY PLAN TO USE IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pay attention. History is in the making. College basketball
players have started to organize themselves in an effort to make
their voices heard. Once they realize how much power they have, The
Powers That Be (re: NCAA) might require earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Basketball Council held its first official meeting
by teleconference Sunday night. Duke junior forward Shane Battier
was named chairman and spokesman of the 46-member group. They spent
their first meeting discussing college basketball issues ranging
from summer basketball recruiting to eligibility issues to getting
their slice of the $6 billion NCAA Tournament contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make our voices known and let people know within
the NCAA structure how players feel and produce recommendations for
real change,'' Battier said.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC grew out of a proposal that was unanimously approved by
the National Association of Basketball Coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have taken the initiative six months ago or six
years ago,'' said NABC executive director Jim Haney, who emphasized
that Battier was in charge of Sunday's teleconference. ``This is
one of those things that make so much sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them that they would have independence. We know there
are some issues that they might discuss that won't be particularly
comfortable for coaches. But these \Rstudent-athletes\S, along with
the coaches, are the ones on the front lines. They need to have
their opinions heard.''
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a great year off the court for college
basketball. Eligibility issues have sidelined players at Missouri,
Oklahoma State, UCLA, Michigan, St. John's and Auburn. In some of
those cases, the suspended players have been guilty until proven
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are immediately concerned and highly disappointed about the
image that a lot of players are getting due to perceived violations
of NCAA rules,'' Battier said. ``We feel that a lot of these
players are getting a bad reputation and are being vilified in the
eyes of the public when, in fact, nothing morally wrong has
occurred. So, as a group, we are trying to come together and
support our brothers who have been ostracized.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBC's executive committee will meet face to face during the
Final Four in Indianapolis. Battier wants to take advantage of the
media presence at that event by holding a news conference to
further advance the players' opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not naive. They see what's happening around them,''
Haney said of the players. ``They want to let people know what they
think is in their best interests. I have no doubt they'll expect
their opinion to hold weight; if they don't, they're going to want
to know why.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is this historic? The players have more power than they
realize.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this scenario: Let's say the SBC persuades the two
teams playing in the national championship game to stage a
sit-down. With a nation tuning in on CBS, the ball goes up for the
opening tip and the 10 players walk to their benches and sit for
five minutes. A statement is delivered to the media that says:
``This protest is in remembrance of our fellow players who lost
games due to unfair NCAA suspensions.''
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a little organization, a little all-for-one
attitude, and college administrators will understand that
scholarship athletes have been treated like serfs. And those castle
walls are showing cracks.
Sanchez isn't Cleaves, Chaney says; he's better
Before the season, Temple coach John Chaney was discussing the
merits of his senior point guard, Pepe Sanchez. Sanchez was rated
as the nation's seventh-best point guard by one preseason
publication, the eight-best by another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody put a magazine in my face with this guy from Michigan
State, Mateen \RCleaves\S, who averaged about eight to nine
turnovers a game last year,'' Chaney said. ``And they've got him
down as the No. 1 point guard. He only goes to his right. I don't
mean to down the kid, but I really don't give a damn. I just think
Pepe's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The irascible and demanding Chaney had a point. If it's
difficult to make a case that Sanchez is the nation's best point
guard, it certainly can be said that he is more valuable to his
team than any other player.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls were a preseason Final Four favorite. But Sanchez
suffered a severely sprained ankle Nov. 21. Temple went 5-3 without
Sanchez. With him, the Owls are 17-2. In the eight games Sanchez
missed, Temple shot 33.8 percent and allowed 61.9 points a game. In
the 19 games Sanchez has played, the Owls are shooting 44.1 percent
from the field and allowing 50.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Argentina, Sanchez struggled in his first two
seasons at Temple. Chaney demands three things from his point
guard: get the ball to the scorers, don't turn it over, play
unyielding defense. Shooting and scoring are not on the list. It
wasn't until last season that Sanchez saw the light.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez averages only 6.4 points per game. His value to the Owls
can be seen in his 8.0 assists and 3.3 steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an old-fashioned point guard,'' Chaney said. ``He gets a
big kick out of a steal or a stop. The kind of shooters we have,
they wouldn't have had the games they did if he wasn't there. Every
game we play, we hang on his back. Without him, we don't stand a
chance of playing high-level basketball.''
\Nsubheds:Fast breaks Play to get in Thirty 34, 64. Those are the
numbers the NCAA Tournament stands by. Thirty automatic qualifiers,
34 at-large bids, a 64-team field. Next year, those numbers won't
be so neat and tidy.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Athletic and Mountain West conferences will get
automatic bids, bringing the number of conferences with automatic
qualifiers to 31. The NCAA, not wanting to change its 30-34
balance, will likely require a play-in game to determine who gets
the 64th spot in the 2001 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the NCAA, faced with 33 automatic qualifiers, staged
three play-in games. Those six conference tourney winners were
matched up based on their 1990 Ratings Percentage Index rankings. A
decade later, the format will be different. The men's basketball
committee will announce the playoff pairing when it announces the
field. The play-in game would probably be staged the Tuesday before
the first-round games.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it might work: Let's say that a team with a 200 RPI
ranking was an upset winner of the Southland Conference tournament.
If that team had the worst RPI among the 29 teams that won
conference tourneys, it would face the team with the next-worst RPI
from the 29 league tourney winners. (The Pacific-10 Conference and
Ivy League award their automatic qualifiers to their regular-season
champions). Trash talk Stanford's David Moseley on the play of
teammate Mark Madsen, who averaged 17.6 points and 12.6 rebounds
over the past five games: ```Monn

HINT OF SUCCESS SEEN FOR GENE THERAPY IN TREATING HEMOPHILIA B  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas, Calif.)  By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene therapy, a technique long on promise and so far very short
on fulfillment, may be achieving a glimmering of success in a
treatment for hemophilia B, a disease in which the blood does not
clot properly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of gene therapy is to treat diseases that are the
result of a defective gene by inserting the correct form of the
gene into a patient's cells. If the technique worked, it could be a
powerful remedy for many diseases that are hard to treat. But
despite 20 years of effort and some 200 current trials, the Food
and Drug Administration has yet to approve any form of gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature
Genetics that they gave patients suffering from hemophilia B the
correct form of the gene for Factor IX, part of the cascade of
proteins involved in forming a blood clot.
</P>
<P>
   The trial involved only three patients and was designed to test
the safety of the gene therapy, not its effectiveness. From earlier
tests in mice and dogs, the researchers had calculated that the
dose of the gene given the patients would be too low to offer any
clinical benefit.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, the researchers said they found that two of
the patients were noticeably better, as judged by their lesser need
to inject themselves for bleedings with extra Factor IX protein.
</P>
<P>
   Both patients turned out to be making enough of their own Factor
IX that clinically effective amounts were reaching the bloodstream,
the researchers reported. The correct form of the gene had been
injected into their muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got the result, we said that must be a
mistake,'' said Dr. Katherine A. High of Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, an author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Another author, Dr. Mark A. Kay of Stanford University, said,
``The patient noticed it first, and we were real skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a safety trial can prove nothing about a treatment's
effectiveness, these early results are encouraging because two of
the three patients showed a benefit at the lowest of three planned
doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data is preliminary, but it is quite suggestive that
higher doses will confirm these results are real,'' said Dr. Arthur
Beaudet, a geneticist at the Baylor College of Medicine. ``I think
these investigators are really close.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaudet, who was not involved in the new study, said he thought
that proof that the therapy worked was a year or so away. How soon
a treatment would be widely available, he said, depends on factors
like action by patient advocate groups and the availability of the
virus used to insert the corrective gene.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,300 people in the United States have hemophilia B,
caused by one of several possible mutations in the gene for Factor
IX. Another 12,000 people suffer from hemophilia A, the result of
mutations in the gene for Factor VIII, also a vital component of
the body's blood-clotting system.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known which type of hemophilia afflicted the Russian
royal family. The defective gene was bequeathed by Queen Victoria
through her descendants to the Russian, Prussian and Spanish royal
houses, but has now died out in the English royal family, High
said.
</P>
<P>
   High and Kay have each been trying separately to develop gene
therapy treatments for hemophilia for more than a decade but have
now joined forces.
</P>
<P>
   The promising result of their research comes in the wake of gene
therapy's long record of failures and the recent death of a
patient, Jesse Gelsinger, 18, in a gene therapy trial at the
University of Pennsylvania. Gelsinger died after receiving an
injection into the liver of a high dose of adenovirus, one of the
causes of the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   The team led by Kay and High used a different virus, adeno
associated virus, which has very few genes of its own and depends
on adenovirus to reproduce itself.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are used to deliver the corrective human genes in most
gene therapy trials because of their natural ability to enter human
cells and incorporate their genetic material into human
chromosomes. The adeno associated virus used by High and Kay is not
as provocative to the immune system as adenovirus and the cells it
infects survive much longer. High said that dogs given the Factor
IX gene nearly three years ago were still producing the gene's
protein.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment may be working better in people than it did in
animals, she said, because the adeno associated virus is a human
virus and may be more active in its natural host. One drawback of
the virus is that it can carry only rather small genes. The human
gene for Factor VIII, for example, is too large for it, so some
other virus must be found to treat hemophilia A.
</P>
<P>
   High and others said gene therapy's record of failure was due
largely to the difficulty of finding appropriate viruses for gene
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not be discouraged because the things we and
others are doing are beginning to look promising,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemophilia B is a good target for gene therapy because the level
of Factor IX in the bloodstream needs to be raised and sustained at
only 1 percent of normal for patients to benefit. Having the
protein always available by gene therapy would probably be far
better than the present treatment, in which Factor IX is injected
only after bleeding has occurred. &QL;

 &HT;    Bauer calls for McCain to take back comments about religious
leaders
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After first standing by him, conservative activist
Gary Bauer urged John McCain on Wednesday to retract and apologize
for bitingly critical statements about religious leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not backing away from the speech,'' McCain responded in
his latest reversal of fortune, occurring one day after a triple
loss to Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must in the strongest possible terms repudiate Senator
McCain's unwarranted, ill-advised and divisive attacks on certain
religious leaders,'' Bauer said in a statement. ``Senator McCain
must not allow his personal differences with any individual to
cloud his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a leader among social conservatives, endorsed McCain last
month after dropping out of the Republican presidential race
himself. He was with McCain on Monday when the Arizona senator
criticized the two men onstage, and he said afterward, ``If this
were an attack on Christian conservative voters, I wouldn't be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he criticized McCain's comparison of Robertson and
Falwell with the Rev. Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan. ``Such
rhetoric serves only to divide the party and place into the hands
of the liberal elite material to falsely depict Christian
conservatives as intolerant extremists,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized McCain's later statement, on his campaign
bus, that he was trying to battle ``the forces of evil,'' and was
hampered by the influence of Robertson and Falwell on the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning that, McCain said Wednesday, ``It was a lighthearted
attempt at humor. I did not say or mean to say they are evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush chimed in, too, saying he agreed with Bauer that McCain's
comparison of the two men with Farrakhan was inappropriate, ``but
that's the kind of campaign he's chosen to run.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments, and Bauer's repudiation, could help set the
tone for a critical debate scheduled for tonight, just five days
before the two men square off on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised by losses in Michigan and Arizona, Bush got a
much-needed lift with his triple crown victory in the Virginia,
North Dakota and Washington primaries and is considered the
favorite to win California's 162 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain's hope for survival is to clinch New York's
101 GOP delegates and the 102 delegates in New England's five
states. Three polls released Wednesday show McCain either leading
Bush or in a dead heat in New York. McCain also leads in
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening here is a civil war, north and south,'' said
pollster John Zogby, whose New York-based firm, Zogby
International, is nonpartisan. ``Just as the union troops stormed
Charleston in 1862, Bush attacked the state of Washington. That was
a big victory. ... He crossed the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Austin American-Statesman on Wednesday that the
Washington state primary was pivotal and that he is confident he
will go all the way to the White House. But that victory doesn't
mean the contest is over, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody says they thought Bush was going to win (the
nomination) in Washington, they're a fool,'' he said. ``The one
thing we've learned is that there's no momentum here. There's no
bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast is both delegate-rich and important symbolically.
Most of the New England GOP primaries are closed, meaning Bush
won't face the threat of crossover Democrats voting for McCain.
Only Vermont allows Democrats to vote in its primary.
</P>
<P>
   New York's primary is also closed and the state's Republican
establishment, all the way up to Gov. George Pataki, has staked
itself out for a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   But California remains the Grand Old Party's grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush wins California and McCain wins the New England
(primaries), I'll be paying a lot more attention to California,''
said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg. ``A lot of us
think that New England is quirky and not a particularly good
indicator of the rest of the country. You add California to Texas
and Florida and suddenly you're not an awful long way from the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin American-Statesman staff writers Ken Herman and Mark
Sherman contributed to this report, which also includes material
from the Associate Press.

WHO WANTS TO BE RETRO? MULTIMILLIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Oops.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Darva Conger's answer when Diane Sawyer asked for one
word explaining why she married a so-called multimillionaire and
definite stranger on national television. It is an ``oops'' that
echoes through the culture.
</P>
<P>
   If questions had not surfaced about her groom, Rick Rockwell _
first with reports that his wealth was paper-thin, then with that
pesky news about the restraining order a former girlfriend got
against him _ the bride would certainly have kept such second
thoughts to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Conger and the Fox network are furiously backpedaling
from the crass special, ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
Fox has sworn off tacky reality specials (we'll see), and Conger
has gone on ``20/20'' and ``Good Morning America'' to insist she is
not a gold digger. Trying to recast a public image she did not even
have a month ago, she is the very essence of modern celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Darva and Rick'' show was always zanier than ``Dharma and
Greg'' and about as real as that loopy sitcom, but let's not forget
how hugely popular ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' was
before the backlash. Luring nearly 23 million viewers, the show
borrowed more than its title from ABC's phenomenal ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox contest, in which 50 women competed to marry a mystery
millionaire, cleverly tapped into the same retro impulse that
accounts for the success of the ABC quiz show, several other
television series and much popular culture in general.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its high-tech set and clanging music, ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' offers the veneer of a return to comfy old values,
to the days when quiz shows were king and people pulled together to
cheer on their champions. Even its immense success is a throwback,
uniting the country in a way that is nearly impossible in this age
of 500 channels and fragmented audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' was typical of
the network in putting the sleaziest possible spin on a trend, as
it reveled in the caveman ethos of the marriage contest. But both
the benign quiz show resurgence that ABC's ``Millionaire'' has led
(several clones and counting) and the blatant sexism of the Fox
show are symptoms of a deeper retro impulse.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the judge on CBS's ``Judging Amy'' has gone home
to live with her mom, and the surgeon on NBC's ``Providence'' has
returned to live with her dad. (Oops.) The most alluring romantic
films recently, like ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The End of the
Affair,'' have been period pieces, while the best up-to-the-minute
movies, including ``American Beauty'' and ``Being John Malkovich,''
are about the impossibility of traditional, lasting, loving
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Romance, it seems, can exist only in the past. (So let's parade
women around in bathing suits and wedding gowns and pretend we're
in the 1950s, the Fox special implied.)
</P>
<P>
   All these entertainments are part of the same cultural movement
that has made old-fashioned heroism trendy, from the movie ``Saving
Private Ryan'' to Tom Brokaw's two bestselling books praising the
World War II generation, and even Sen. John McCain's presidential
candidacy, built on his biography as a prisoner during the war in
Vietnam. This nostalgia for a rock-solid past is partly an escape
from contemporary problems. In a culture of divorce and
dysfunction, no wonder there is longing for the security of the
``Father Knows Best'' world that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread though it is, the lure of a simpler past has been
most evident on television, where simplicity thrives. And, of
course, the idea of that idyllic yesterday is a sham. Beneath Fox's
retro glorification of marriage was a cynical commercial ploy,
whose hidden messages actually devalue marriage: because today's
celebrity culture prizes fame over almost anything, it wasn't
difficult to get 50 women to sell themselves in a marriage market;
an easy annulment was promised in a prenuptial contract, so what's
the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   The turn against the Fox special was instant and unanimous.
Forget earnest social critics. Even comedians reacted with a scorn
that saw through the innocuous surface. On Comedy Central's ``Daily
Show,'' Jon Stewart noted the retro criteria the groom used to
choose his bride; she was the one ``least likely to talk back or
form even rudimentary sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   But this swiftly cynical view doesn't account for the special's
gigantic ratings. The contest did not assume the tone of a campy
stunt. Its straight-faced, fairy-tale attitude was the key to its
success, and the audience's eagerness to buy into that attitude is
more revealing than the morning-after jolt of realism.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Millionaire'' and ``Multimillionaire'' share is the idea
that television is the glass slipper that can change anyone's life.
They entice viewers with the appeal: it could happen to you, if
you'll only give into this cultlike retro fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is built on an upbeat,
backward-looking message: that happiness does not come from money
alone but from the neighborly, call-a-friend, ask-the-audience
dynamics of the game. This attitude pulls in the opposite direction
from the impersonal contemporary world of family dysfunction and
e-mail romance. And because the contestants are not brainiacs with
arcane areas of expertise but ordinary Americans who answer
general-knowledge questions, the average viewer gets a vicarious
thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The producers have enough savvy to fret publicly about why there
have been so few women and members of minorities among their
contestants. But their hand-wringing does not disguise the show's
nostalgia for a slower, simpler era.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Fox show didn't bother with the nicety of a
social conscience. It just hauled itself back to the past. The
show's creator, Mike Darnell, has said that his idea was to blend
the ABC ``Millionaire'' show with the Miss America pageant and
``The Dating Game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's practically a definition of backward-looking. The result
was something that could have been a ``Twilight Zone'' in which
someone was playing Barbie with live women. Even the language of
the show seemed to come from the '50s. The host, the ever-smarmy
Jay Thomas, led into a commercial by saying, ``We'll find out which
one of these ladies becomes Multimillionaire right after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath its retro vision of women, ``Multimillionaire''
shares the fundamental secret of the ABC show: that those competing
on screen were ordinary people, that it could happen to you. ``I
work in hotel operations,'' one of the contestants said,
introducing herself. ``I'm in telecommunications sales,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   As Darnell said in a phone interview before the firestorm of bad
publicity hit, these women were ``basic, regular ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked at how nice and normal everyone turned out to
be,'' he said. ``They didn't look like they came from a daytime
talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And it's true that as a group they did not look like
supermodels. They were attractive in a down-to-earth way, not
wildly different from anyone's well-groomed neighbor. When the 10
semifinalists paraded in their bathing suits, most did not wear
revealing thong bikinis but modest little sarong skirts, as if to
emphasize that everyone (at least everyone average) has something
to hide on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Conger stood out from the start. With her near-platinum hair and
lip gloss that was exaggerated even by television standards, she
looked as if she might be more at home than most contestants in the
garish world of Las Vegas, where the special was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality'' shows are always artificial constructs, of course.
``Multimillionaire'' was the time bomb that happened to go off. But
the retro attitude that accounts for its success is in line with a
widening ``chick flick'' ghetto on television, where supposedly
strong female characters are treated like children.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect as much from soap opera piffle like
``Providence,'' as sentimental and predictable a show as there is
on the air. What is new and disconcerting is that the smartest
shows are following a similar pattern. ``Judging Amy'' is so aware
of women's rights that a recent show dealt with a Yemenite woman
who was beaten by her brother because of gossip that she was not a
virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The show's heroine, Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), is a level-headed
family court judge. And still her mother, Maxine (Tyne Daly),
treats Amy like a child and tells her how to raise her own
daughter, Lauren. After Maxine tells Amy to be stern about Lauren's
bedtime, Amy whines, ``Can I tuck her in?'' and Maxine gives her
permission. This crosses the line from typical mother-daughter
tension, which the show often does believably, and infantalizes the
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   This season ``Sports Night,'' struggling in the ratings, has
softened its attitude and its stylized dialogue. The most
conspicuous change is that Dana (Felicity Huffman), the producer of
the show-within-a-show, has become absolutely giddy.
</P>
<P>
   One week she comes to the office dressed in sexy biker leather
because she is on her way to a costume engagement party. Another
week she makes slapstick football moves in the control room. She
now wears an inordinate amount of blue eye shadow and does
everything short of singing ``I Enjoy Being a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still female characters on television who can be tough
yet emotional, like those on ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' But there is a
definite trend toward making even strong women weaker. On
``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' Det. Jill Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson) recently
jeopardized her job by trying to help her drug-dealing ex-husband
outwit the law. And the message of both the vapid ``Providence''
and the substantial ``Amy'' is that however accomplished a woman
may be, a return to her childhood home and a childlike role is
normal, that the old days of the extended family were best.
</P>
<P>
   That image of the weak woman behind the facade of professional
strength is precisely the retro idea behind ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' Much has been made of the fact that Conger is
an emergency room nurse, but here is the way her career was treated
on the show. She described how she was injured when serving as a
nurse during the Persian Gulf war: she bumped into a pole during a
training maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Recently it has been reported that although she was an Air Force
nurse, she never left this country during the war; it didn't take
that bit of information to undermine any seriousness about her
profession. As she walked across the stage in her bathing suit, an
announcer's voice said, ``As a registered nurse Darva saves lives
in the E.R., but she actually passed out the first time she drew
blood from a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is that education is the veneer, not the reality of
these women, fictional or real. As Patricia Ireland, president of
the National Organization for Women, said about the
``Multimillionaire'' pageant: ``The Playboy models always have a
PhD in something, too. What that says is that despite your
accomplishments, how you will be judged hangs on how well you look
in a bathing suit.''
</P>
<P>
   (NOW monitored the image of women on the four prime-time
networks during the February sweeps period and will issue a report
on incidents and types of violence, stereotypes, positive role
models and the social relevance of themes. They could not have been
luckier in their choice of month to study.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the image of men hasn't exactly been brought up to
date by the Fox special. When Rockwell emerged from the shadows at
the end of the show in his tuxedo, he acted the part of the
sensitive guy, apologizing for the inequity of a situation in which
he got to choose a bride from among 50 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with clips that soon surfaced on ``Entertainment
Tonight'' of Rockwell (who was born Richard Balkey and invented
Rick Rockwell as his stage name) wearing a black-and-orange
tigerish jogging suit and skipping antically across a stage during
his days as a would-be comedian, or of Sensitive making Jerry Lewis
faces at the camera. Such moments give the so-called reality
special a whole new dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate proof of the backward-looking impulse behind all
the ``Who Wants to ...'' shows comes from Nick at Nite, which is
built on being comically and willfully nostalgic. It has packaged
six episodes of the '60s sitcom ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' under
the label ``Who Wants to Marry a Mega-Millionaire?'' (starting at
9:00 tonight), with stories focusing on Jethro, the nephew of the
oil-rich family, in love. Two of them feature his friend, a movie
star named Dash Rip-rock. If the show biz name Rick Rockwell seems
an uncomfortable retro echo of Dash Riprock, surely that's a
coincidence.

WHITE HOUSE ATTACKS PATHS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to ask Congress
for sweeping new powers to combat money laundering including the
authority to ban financial transactions between U.S. banks or
brokerage houses and off-shore financial centers, administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The request is the centerpiece of administration efforts to
tighten money-laundering laws after the Bank of New York was found
to have acted as a conduit for about $7 billion in Russian money,
some of which investigators believe was derived from illegal
activities. The administration has also been searching for ways to
make it harder for drug traffickers to funnel their profits through
American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers plans to announce proposed
legislation in a speech to bankers on Thursday, officials said. The
legislation would give his department a broad range of powers to
investigate and in serious cases forbid transactions between
American financial institutions and individual foreign banks or
entire foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that current laws do not provide
enough authority to fight money laundering, the practice of
filtering profits from illegal activities through banks to disguise
their origin. Short of having Congress declare emergency sanctions
against countries deemed to be a national security threat, the
officials said, they are mostly confined to waving a finger at
nations that tolerate money laundering and urging American banks to
be wary of doing business with such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of money laundering is so prominent and public that
we can't ignore it anymore,'' a senior official said. ``We need to
be able to target the root problems without unnecessarily hindering
legitimate economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to seek new powers is clearly a response to Russia,
where financial mismanagement has been a problem for the Clinton
administration and the International Monetary Fund. Some analysts
and members of Congress have complained that widespread corruption
in that country _ helped in part by the ease of transferring funds
abroad _ undermined multibillion-dollar foreign aid programs and
left one of the administration's top foreign policy priorities a
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation also appears to be an attempt to broker
a compromise between congressional proposals and private financial
companies. Both the House and the Senate are weighing bills that
would impose draconian restrictions on foreign banks that hide
money and, in some cases, new enforcement duties on domestic banks
and brokerage houses. Financial companies have complained that such
laws threaten to make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress had a mixed response to the Treasury's
proposal after briefings by Clinton administrations officials
Wednesday. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said the Treasury proposals were exactly what he
had been seeking. He said he would introduce the bill as his own
when it is sent to Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and a member of the Senate's
banking committee, was less enthusiastic. He said the Treasury
proposals were a watered-down version of legislation he has
introduced that would mandate the isolation of foreign banks that
make hiding money their forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave this up to their discretion, diplomacy will
prevail over cutting off money laundering,'' Schumer said. ``The
Treasury seems to be taking a step in the right direction. But we
are going to toughen it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would give the Treasury Department the right
to take any number of steps, along a progressive scale, to fight
laundering. On the light end of the spectrum, the department wants
the power to ask American companies to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an off-shore bank or financial company. That
would help law enforcement officials track suspicious activity, and
would also make American banks wary of doing business with such
places, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where foreign governments stubbornly shield their banks
from prying eyes and act as havens for criminal funds, the
department wants the power to simply cut them off from the American
financial system, without seeking congressional approval for such
action each time.
</P>
<P>
   Although that would not necessarily force those nations to
tighten enforcement, the loss of access to the American market
would cripple any legitimate banking activity there and make it a
much less attractive destination for criminal elements as well, the
officials said. Moreover, officials hope that the U.S. action in
such cases will serve as a model for other developed countries,
putting further pressure on the laundering haven.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ever since the act of money laundering first became a crime, in
1986, Treasury officials have often been sympathetic to private
sector concerns that the old way of fighting money laundering _
putting a burden on banks and brokerage houses to police their
clients _ might simply drive banking business to nations that do
not demand as much. But the rise of multilateral efforts to counter
illicit flows of money through the international banking system in
recent years have made it possible to tighten restrictions at home
without driving too much legitimate banking activity abroad,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials already have sought to step up
anti-laundering activities through the one tool they now have in
their arsenal: moral suasion, or as the Treasury calls it, name and
blame. When a foreign bank or nation repeatedly refuses to abide by
generally accepted standards to make sure they are not being used
by criminals to launder money, Treasury has made that known to
domestic banks, usually through advisories. Those put the banks on
notice that they should be wary of money that flows into their
coffers from such sources. The advisories do not have the force of
law.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation before Congress would add processing the proceeds of
official corruption to the list of foreign crimes that fall under
the money-laundering statute. American financial institutions are
now barred from handling the proceeds from a narrow group of
offenses committed abroad, including drug trafficking, kidnapping
and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   An advance copy of a speech Summers prepared for delivery on
Thursday identifies several countries that have served as either
sources of illicit money or havens for bank secrecy and laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Colombia, and Nigeria, he says, are among the biggest
sources of such funds. The islands of Dominica, Nauru and Antigua
are among the biggest destination spots, with laws that make it
possible or actively encourage criminals to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that such moral
suasion works. Antigua, Nauru, Russia and Colombia are all working
with the United States to toughen their laws, Summers says in his
address. After Clinton administration officials raised public
concerns about Nauru earlier this year, citing its role as a chief
haven for Russian money laundering, some American banks decided on
their own to stop doing financial-correspondent business with banks
chartered in that country.

U.S. AND MEXICO ARE AT ODDS OVER TRUTH ABOUT LIE TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The chairman of a House committee with oversight
over drug policy said Wednesday that Mexico, embarrassed by the
poor showing of its anti-drug agents in lie detector tests, had
canceled the testing program last August.
</P>
<P>
   The legislator, John Mica, R.-Fla., said, ``Everyone was failing
the tests, so they eliminated the program.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mica's assertions _ which came on the same day that Mexico
was officially certified by President Clinton as a reliable partner
in the war against drugs _ were emphatically denied by Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Diaz de Leon, a representative of the Mexican attorney
general's office in Washington, said in an interview that Mexican
agents were still being given the tests. Last August, he said,
Mexico simply began excluding U.S. officials from witnessing the
tests because Mexican technicians felt competent to do them on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about the testing came as the administration
announced that Mexico and Colombia, the two countries that are the
main source and corridor for most of the cocaine entering the
United States, were doing their share to stop the production and
smuggling of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The countries were among 26 identified as tied to the world's
illicit drug trade in an annual report required by Congress. All
but two of the countries _ Afghanistan and Myanmar, the former
Burma _ were certified as cooperating with the United States to
stop drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that fail to be certified as cooperating are
subject to U.S. trade sanctions, including the withholding of
investment credits by international lending institutions. In fact,
only a handful have been punished to the full extent.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Mexico's top narcotics official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo, was discovered to be an associate of a leading trafficker
three years ago, authorities had routinely submitted members of the
country's elite anti-drug squads to lie detector tests as a way of
certifying their integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Mexico began to exclude U.S. officials from the
sessions in which the polygraph tests were administered, arousing
suspicions about the integrity of the process, U.S. officials said
Wednesday. Dismayed, they said, they reacted by reducing
cooperation with several of the squads.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony on Tuesday, William E. Ledwith, chief
of international operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said the testing program had been ``shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledwith was asked to describe the ``problem areas'' in working
with Mexico on drugs. He cited Mexico's failure to arrest any major
traffickers recently, a string of frustrated extradition attempts,
and the suspension of the lie detector program in the elite squads,
which he called ``embedded units.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The polygraph program with embedded units was shut down in
August of last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Parham, a federal Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman, said that U.S. officials are negotiating with Mexico in
an attempt to re-establish the tests.

ROCKER SET TO RETURN AFTER SENTENCE SLICED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a country! Somebody had to help Atlanta's John Rocker out
of the mess he made for himself three months ago. Arbitrator Shyam
Das came to the rescue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing other rulings, Das issued a stunning decision in favor of
the 25-year-old Braves reliever, reducing three major elements of
the penalty issued Jan. 31 by commissioner Bud Selig: Rocker has to
pay only $500 of a $20,000 penalty; he can finish the remaining
exhibition season with the Braves; and he will only have to miss 14
of his original 28-day regular-season penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is expected to be in the Braves training camp Thursday in
Kissimmee, Fla., where he is scheduled to meet with his teammates
and then hold a news confernce.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who was punished for making disparaging remarkers about
foreigners, gays, and minorities could make his first appearence
April 18 against Philadelphia at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Das's ruling was the result of a grievence filed in Shocker's
behalf by the Players Association. Despite a public outcry against
Rocker. The union had argued that the penalty was too great when
compared with past disciplines by the commissioner's office and
promised a nasty fight had not some adjustment been made.
</P>
<P>
   Das's decision, his first for Major League Baseball, merely
reinforced those changes, and the view that arbitrators had
overturned or reduced suspensions before.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's original penalty was believed to be the longest against
a baseball player for an action not related to drug use since Lenny
Randle of Texas got 30 days in March 1977 for punching his manager,
Frank Lucchesi.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the insensitivity of Rocker's remarks in a Sports
Illustrated article, Selig said he thought the penalty should be
more than a slap on the wrist. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the decision,'' said Selig in a prepared
statement. ``It does not reflect any understanding or sensitivity
to the important social responsibility that baseball . . . has to
be the public. It completely ignores the sensibilities of those
groups of people maligned by Mr. Rocker and disregards the player's
position as a role model for children.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the union expressed unhappiness, too. ``We're
disappointed that the penalty wasn't reduced more,'' said Players
Association lawyer Gene Orza.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions varied, in and out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair,'' says Braves pitcher Tom Glavine said, one
of several players anxious to see how Rocker handles himself now.
``It allows him some of spring training to get ready for the
season. . . . If not, you run the risk of John ruining his career.
No one wants that. That would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actions speak louder than words. It's easy to issue an
apology. It's tougher to show remorse day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others still want Rocker pay a stiff price for his actions and
believes baseball should clean its own linen. Atlanta City
Councilman Derrick Boazman, leader of a coalition of minority
groups that has called for the Braves to release Rocker, said,
``Hate and bigotry and homophobia and racism have a place,
evidently, and that place is in Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen activists marched outside Turner Field in Atlanta,
demanding the Braves quickly trade the reliever. An activist group
based in Orlando, Fla., planned a similar demonstration Thursday at
one of the main entrances to the Disney World complex where the
Braves train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're disappointed with such a light sentence _ a
reduction of what was already a slap on the wrist,'' said Boazman,
who testified at the arbitration hearing. ``Where are we to go as
fans?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that John Rocker appeals this suggests that he
does not understand the magnitude of his comments. He really
doesn't get it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Coleman, former National League president, said, ``Baseball
must be a socially responsible institution. The arbitrator's ruling
undermines the disciplinary system and sends precisely the wrong
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz said the ball club is
prepared to take Rocker back. There is no doubt about his talent,
based on the interest from other teams. Also, the Braves would like
to go through a pressure-free spring training and concentrate on
building a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate there will be a problem,'' he said. ``I
think John realizes he needs to mend his place in this team with
his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon, who believes he was the target of Rocker's ``fat
monkey'' comment in the magazine, said he is ready to forgive.
Simon said he hopes Rocker will address the team as a whole, as
well as offer him a personal apology. ``If he comes to me and
apologizes, everything will be all right,'' said Simon. ``He's one
of my teammates. Everybody makes mistakes. . . . He should give me
some respect. I think I deserve an apology so we can move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, another of Rocker's harshest critics, said the
reliever has to change his ways. ``He has to be more mature dealing
with certain situations and dealing with his teammates,'' Jordan
said. ``He has to learn to control his anger. I think that's a big
reason he said what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has all the answers, add Glavine. But a chance to talk
about what happened might produce a few make up their mind about
how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather deal with it now,'' he said, ``when the outcome
of the games doesn't matter, than have it drop on us right dab in
the middle of the season. We still have to exercise some patience.
It's already getting old, and even if he gets here (Thursday) of
Friday, it's not going to go away for a while.''

BRADLEY BACKERS ARE ALREADY IN MOURNING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Confronted by Bill Bradley's humiliating loss in
Washington state on Tuesday, many Democrats, including some of the
former senator's most prominent supporters, said Wednesday that he
had no chance of snatching his party's presidential nomination from
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And several of Bradley's top aides acknowledged that they had
received phone calls and e-mail messages from friends and
supporters, arguing that he should quit now to avoid the risk of
embarrassment of being shut out on Tuesday, the biggest primary day
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
Edward Rendell, who is supposed to stay neutral, spoke in an
interview as if Bradley had already bowed out. He said ``the reason
he lost'' was that the public was content with the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not had a single victory, and many of his backers
said they were hard-pressed to cite one upcoming contest where he
could prevail.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were particularly distressed by the results in
Washington because, while it was a popularity contest with no
delegates at stake, Bradley had stumped there for six days, making
it something of a last stand. They noted that polls in states where
there are contests Tuesday, here in Ohio, New York, California and
elsewhere, show that Gore is swamping Bradley in state after state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A miracle still could happen,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
one of Bradley's earliest and most vociferous supporters. ``We've
all had friends with cancer and the doctor says, `You have a 5
percent chance and we pray for a miracle.''' But in the next
breath, he said, a win in Washington ``was his only chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Tuesday in Huntington Beach, Calif., Bradley brushed
aside such talk. ``Mark Twain put it best when he said, `Reports of
my demise are greatly exaggerated,''' he told reporters after
appearing at a health clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley even suggested that he was prepared to continue his
fight beyond March 7. And Bradley flatly denied that any of his
aides had suggested that he should drop out to save face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero have come to me and said they think I should drop out,''
he said, pinching his thumb and index finger together into an O.
``Nobody has come to me. Nobody has sent a surrogate to me, at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Bradley's backers are resigned to losing _ and a bit
dispirited. Only a few months ago, their candidate was coming on
strong, drawing national publicity as the politician who might
topple a sitting vice president. He was neck and neck with Gore in
polls in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore's backers are stepping up their calls for the
former senator to leave the race now. The vice president's camp is
eager to turn the focus to November _ and not be obliged to channel
any more resources into the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's best known supporters have not dared to call on him
publicly to quit. Yet they often speak of his candidacy in the past
tense. It is not whether he will withdraw, they say now, but when.
And many Democrats are already debating what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent backer of Bradley, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., objected to the Washington state strategy,
acknowledging that he had pressed for the campaign to spend more
time in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, made clear that the campaign's days were numbered.
He pointed out a picture in the newspaper Wednesday of Bradley
looking detached, and chilly, as he campaigned on a ferry to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that photo in the ferry was pretty dismal,''
Moynihan said. ``But look: no illusions. No regrets. And we'll
stick it out one more week.'' Asked whether there was any hope
Bradley could win, he replied, ``If you don't mind, don't ask me
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And asked, also, about the strategy to emphasize Washington
state, he said: ``It's a rather elusive thing. Bill seems to make
his own decisions. In any event, it did not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey conceded Wednesday that Bradley's best chance was to have
won Washington state so he could have drawn positive publicity
before the battery of contests on Tuesday. He said that at first he
thought the Washington approach ``looked like a dumb move'' but
that he had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had a news story this morning that Bradley won,
60-40, or did well,'' he said. ``He would have gotten a bump.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bradley's backers said they feared his public image
could take a beating if he was romped in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's favorable rating of 21 percent is about even with his
unfavorable rating of 20 percent, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Feb. 12 to 14. But the more he
loses, the more his negatives could increase. In December,
Bradley's favorable rating was 20 percent; his unfavorable rating
was 13 percent, according to a CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's aides said that after spending more than a year
building toward March 7, quitting before the climactic day would
disappoint and possibly infuriate thousands of volunteers and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas C. Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, declined to
discuss the entreaties for his candidate to quit the race, saying
only, ``I hear a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Berman lamented how difficult it had been for Bradley
to capture attention because of the more dramatic Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``If you're a Democratic voter out there in the
country and you say, `Look, there's all this coverage of the
Republican contest _ I guess the Democratic contest is over.'
That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, the Democratic Party chairman, said he had no objection
to Bradley's staying in the race _ for a while. He explained that
the Gore operation had already spent most of its advertising money
for Tuesday's contests. Even if Bradley wins two out of three big
states on Tuesday _ Ohio, New York and California _ Rendell said
that would not be enough to catapult him ahead because the race
turns south the next week. And, he noted, Gore is quite potent in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything that would give the senator enough
bounce,'' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Reiss, a New York lawyer who was an early fund-raiser for
Bradley, said win or lose, she did not think her candidate should
withdraw before Tuesday. ``I think he feels a commitment to the
people who have worked for him and supported him financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Diekman, a longtime friend and adviser to Bradley from
Atherton, Calif., said she was unhappy about what appeared to be
the inevitable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific person who ought to be our president; that's
why I'm so discouraged,'' she said. ``We just won't want to see
Bill put through this meat grinder of invisibility or
inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many Gore loyalists stepped up the drumbeat, saying Bradley's
departure was necessary to heal divisions in the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really stopped being a race almost two or three weeks
ago,'' said Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party
and a Gore backer. ``The sooner Bradley moves toward a consensus,
it obviously creates better unity and less expenditure of funds for
our nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   David Worley, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, put it
this way: ``It would be unfortunate if he woke up on Wednesday
morning on the wrong side of the biggest blowout in presidential
history. That's the way it's looking. The best thing would be to
stop now.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted 422-0 Wednesday to allow most
Social Security recipients for the first time to earn as much money
as they want without sacrificing any of their retirement benefits,
repealing a Depression-era policy intended to discourage older
people from holding jobs so younger workers would have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote was a rare display of bipartisanship, and
reflected a consensus that the earnings limits placed on Social
Security recipients had long since become counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, where there is broad support for the change, plans
to take up a similar measure soon. President Clinton has said he
would sign the legislation, which would not have any long-term
effect on the financial health of the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people 65 through 69 years old lose $1 of
their Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn above
$17,000. A 67-year-old man who earned $20,000 last year, for
example, would have lost $1,000 of his Social Security retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings limit, which does not apply to people 70 and above,
is already scheduled to rise to $30,000 in 2002, but the
legislation passed Wednesday by the House would eliminate the limit
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted under the terms of the House bill, the change would
apply retroactively to earnings since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people 65 or above lost some or all of their
benefits last year because they earned more than the limit,
according to the Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Those people would benefit immediately from the change, and
other people might decide to remain in or re-enter the work force
because of the opportunity to hold a job without sacrificing any of
their benefits. But the real significance of the shift might emerge
only over the next few decades as the 76 million baby boomers grow
older, creating a vast new pool of retirement-age people more
willing and able than previous generations to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long sought repeal of the earnings limit,
saying it amounts to a tax. They were blocked for decades by
Democrats, who at various times have cited objections from labor
unions, the costs and the fact that relatively well-off people
would be the biggest winners.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition from Democrats has melted away over the years as
the population has aged and the economy has grown healthier. The
two parties agreed in 1996 to raise the earnings limit, and Clinton
called last year for the limit to be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors said repealing the earnings limit would
benefit the entire economy right away by removing a disincentive to
work at a time when the unemployment rate, at 4 percent, is so low
that employers are having trouble filling all the jobs they are
creating.
</P>
<P>
   They said the change also reflected increases in life expectancy
and the fact that more and more people 65 and older continue to
work at least part time by choice or necessity. But they said the
main justification for the change was simple fairness, calling it
unconscionable for the government to deny workers benefits they had
earned over their careers simply because they chose to remain
employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would we want to discourage any American _
whether they're 17 or 67 _ from working?'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living longer now,'' Archer said. ``Older
Americans can work, they want to work and they shouldn't be
punished by an outdated law if they choose to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found evidence that raising or eliminating the
earnings limit will bring more people into the work force and lead
older people who already have jobs to work more. But there is
disagreement over how much of an effect any change has, with some
economists saying repeal could create a huge new pool of available
labor and others saying the effects would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only a limited amount of evidence on the overall
effect'' on the labor supply from repealing the limit, Kenneth S.
Apfel, the Social Security commissioner, told Congress last month.
But, Apfel said, it was plausible that eliminating the limit would
``lead to a modest increase in work activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the provisions that the bill would repeal are more complex
than Wednesday's debate on the House floor would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security recipients lose some of their benefits in
years in which they earn more than the limit, they get some or all
of the reduction back after age 70, when their benefits are
readjusted to reflect their decision to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the change would not apply to people who take early
retirement benefits from Social Security, which they can do at 62
at a reduced rate. These people, 62 through 64, would continue to
be subject to a strict earnings limit, losing $1 in benefits for
every $2 in earnings above $10,080 a year. About 230,000 people in
that age category lost all or part of their benefits last year
because their earnings exceeded the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agreed to leave the earnings limit in place for
early retirees _ effectively encouraging people not to take Social
Security before 65 _ because research has shown that people who
take a reduced Social Security benefits at age 62 are more likely
to end up in poverty than those who work to full retirement age.
The problem strikes particularly hard at widows of men who retired
early and who rely on their late husbands' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties acknowledged that they found it
uncomfortable to be enacting what amounted to an election-year
benefits increase in Social Security for some people at the same
time that Congress and the Clinton administration are deadlocked
over how to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency.
Without any changes, Social Security is projected to run short of
money to pay benefits starting in 2033.
</P>
<P>
   Under an earlier set of changes made in the 1980s to help
bolster Social Security's financial condition, the age at which
workers can claim full retirement benefits is already increasing
gradually over the next few decades to 67. Many of the proposals to
put Social Security on sounder footing call for further increases
in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the earnings limit would cost Social Security $22.7
billion in additional benefit payments over the next decade,
according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it would not have
an effect on the retirement system's financial condition over the
long run, the Social Security Administration said. That is because
the benefits increases would eventually be offset by a reduction in
the deferred benefits that would have been paid to workers starting
at age 70 to make up for the reductions in benefits paid from age
65 through 69.

 &HT;    Bush: Pundits, opponents wrongly trying to label him
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Feet propped up in first class aboard his campaign's
charter plane, Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday recalled what he
was doing during a key moment in what he is convinced is his
one-way path to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was bedded down for the night in a Marriott near Atlanta
late Tuesday when the networks declared him the winner in
Washington state's primary. The surprising victory completed a
triple sweep, including Virginia and North Dakota wins, that
restored him to front-runner status as next week's Super Tuesday
contests approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, Bush predicted Wednesday as he flew from Atlanta to
St. Louis, the Washington state primary win over Arizona Sen. John
McCain will be recalled as a turning point in what has been a
strange race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Washington state is pretty interesting. I beat Al Gore
and Bill Bradley'' in addition to McCain, he said, referring to
ballots that included candidates of both parties. ``I think you'll
find that to be an interesting state, where all four of us were on
the ballot. ... I won the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On a smooth flight on what has been a bumpy ride, Bush insisted
Wednesday he has never lost his belief that he will win The Whole
Thing. Throughout the wins and losses, and the rumors that he was
about to scrap longtime friend and adviser Karl Rove, Bush remained
positive that America wants him to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' he said, turning back from a glance out the window.
``I'm convinced I'll be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, working hard to avoid the kind of over-confidence that has
knocked off more than one front-runner, believes next week's Super
Tuesday contests might effectively end the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll have the 1,037 delegates,'' he said,
overcalculating by three the number needed to clinch the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes there is a chance that results in the 13
contests could snuff out McCain's insurgent candidacy. And positive
signs pointing that direction continue to pop up unexpectedly _
including a statement issued Wednesday by Gary Bauer repudiating
McCain's verbal assault this week on Jerry Falwell and Pat
Robertson, icons of the Christian conservative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must in the strongest possible terms repudiate Senator
McCain's unwarranted, ill-advised and divisive attacks on certain
religious leaders,'' said Bauer, who had endorsed McCain after he
dropped out of the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wild ride so far has taken him to places he did not
expect to go. The biggest unanticipated outcome is that he winds up
going one-on-one with McCain, who has stolen Bush's thunder as a
big-tent candidate drawing new voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign's infancy, Bush advisers thought he'd be in a
battle against a candidate coming from the right. Now, Bush is
their candidate of choice.
</P>
<P>
   But he insists he hasn't changed. Bush, who gives the same stump
speech every day, over and over, complained that ``the punditry''
is positioning him as some kind of right-wing candidate he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filter is filtering out what I say on a daily basis, which
is the exact same compassionate conservative agenda I said in Iowa,
I said in South Carolina, I said in Washington state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not believe McCain's attempts to glue him to religious
right leaders such as Robertson and Falwell will be a
general-election hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's seen this game before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember the '94 campaign, when Ann Richards tried to do
the same thing,'' he said. ``They can try it again in year 2000. I
am who I am, the people know that. ... People are trying to brand
me one way, and on the other hand John McCain is trying to call me
an anti-Catholic bigot. I got fire coming from all sides. But
eventually the people decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, at a news conference in Duluth, Ga., Bush
made it clear that his relationship with McCain has changed.
Earlier in the campaign, he went out of his way to note that he and
the senator were friends.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush twice declined to identify McCain as a
friend. The governor continues to complain daily about McCain
campaign phone calls reminding voters that Bush spoke at Bob Jones
University, a fundamentalist school with anti-Catholic biases.
McCain's campaign has criticized Bush for not condemning the
university's controversial positions during Bush's speech there.
</P>
<P>
   Offered a second chance to say whether he considers McCain a
friend, Bush said, ``I know what the question was. The answer was,
I try not to take things personally in politics, and I will, of
course, assess things once the campaign's ended. But calling
somebody an anti-Catholic bigot is beyond the reach.''

DON'T CLOSE OUT THIS CLOSER YET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The idea was to begin the weaning process
this spring. Somehow, we had to figure out how to say goodbye to
John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a foregone conclusion for a while now that the
Rangers' closer would be gone after this season when his four-year
contract expires. He is 33, and the Rangers would appear to have a
variety of less expensive closer-in-waiting options available among
Tim Crabtree, Jeff Zimmerman and newly acquired Francisco Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   The economic realities of the game alone _ teams are constantly
looking for ways to save money _ provided ample reason to believe
this would be Wetteland's final spring as a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The last roundup.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. The situation has changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't made the \RJuan Gonzalez\S trade,'' general
manager Doug Melvin said yesterday, ``and if we had re-signed
\RAaron\S Sele and \RTodd\S Zeile, then we might have had no choice
but to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we have some flexibility and some options. It's
definitely not out of the question that we would try and bring him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hurt Wetteland's case for returning that he has come
to camp this spring in perhaps the best condition he has ever been
in as a major-leaguer, which could be the prelude to a monster
season. That's indeed something to contemplate, considering he
produced 43 saves last year despite coming off winter elbow surgery
and a distracting ankle injury that hampered him for much of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons as a Rangers closer he has chalked up 31,
42 and 43 saves. He is just four saves away from becoming only the
12th reliever in baseball history to register 300 saves. He was
recently honored as the Rolaids Reliever of the Decade.
</P>
<P>
   But what Wetteland brings to the Rangers' bullpen can't be
measured in mere numbers or awards. He is the unchallenged leader
of a relief corps that has become arguably the team's strongest
single area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned more from Wetteland in the last six months than I
had my whole life,'' said Zimmerman, the Rangers' rookie sensation
in 1999. ``He taught me how to be a professional, how to prepare
myself, how to react to adversity, how to react to success. He's a
great teammate and a great role model, all rolled up into one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of teammates willing and able to step up and
throw accolades at Wetteland, which is good, because he has
absolutely no interest in talking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the best team guy I've ever been around,'' bullpen
coach Larry Hardy said. ``His first priority is always what's best
for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the only way Wetteland knows how to operate. I've never
seen anyone in sports who more genuinely cares about his teammates,especially his fellow relievers.
</P>
<P>
   `` I was handed the ball at 25 years old in Montreal and told
`You're our closer,' and I had done nothing to prove myself in the
majors,'' Wetteland said. ``I've never forgotten that. These guys,
every one of them, have an awesome attitude and an awesome work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand that they're a cog in the machine; they
understand what they do in helping each other. They've learned that
iron sharpens iron.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Wetteland's way of saying that the tougher you are, the
tougher you get.
</P>
<P>
   ``In helping someone else, I get helped myself,'' he said. ``No
one is above learning, and, if you don't think so, you're a liar,
because everyone needs humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boz \Rpitching coach Dick Bosman\S uses the same quote to open
every spring. He gathers everyone together and starts out by
saying, `It's what you learn after you know it all that's
important.' I learn something new every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What Wetteland isn't into is predicting the future. That, he
contends, is a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pointless to spend one second thinking about tomorrow,''
Wetteland said. ``Tomorrow hasn't been given to me yet. If I take
care of today, tomorrow will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I be a Ranger? I don't know. Will I be a Brewer? I don't
know. Will I even be playing at all? I don't know. Nothing is
automatic. What I need to do here, starting the first day of
spring, is work diligently at what I do, to help this team to the
capacity that I'm supposed to, to help develop others in such a way
that somebody in this group could take over my job and the Texas
Rangers would have smooth sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's truly just as unselfish as he sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more concerned with everybody as a team than he is with
himself,'' Hardy said. ``He leads by example, but he also pushes
each one of \Rthe other relievers\S to get better at what they do.
Pretty soon it becomes part of a perpetual-motion machine, where
they're not just feeding off him but off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Wetteland's selfless approach may have done more
than anything else to pave the way for his departure. It's not a
matter any more of whether the Rangers can live without him,
because everything he does builds toward that day.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is much more simple: Why would they want to?

LOS ANGELES POLICE'S REPORT CITES VAST MANAGEMENT LAPSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a long-awaited report on a burgeoning
corruption scandal, the Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday
offered a scathing indictment of what was by its own admission a
near collapse of its command and control systems and the creation
of a culture that permitted brutality and corruption to flourish
for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the complex 350-page report left some civic leaders here
troubled by what it left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   The document was issued at a news conference where the police
chief, Bernard C. Parks, said he was proud of his department for
having uncovered the wrongdoing, an assertion critics have widely
disputed. Those critics also contended Wednesday that Parks was
using the report largely as a cudgel to fend off the growing
demands for an outside investigation of the department's
management.
</P>
<P>
   Parks did not propose taking any action against officials who
failed in their management responsibilities, although he said a
separate report might address them later. He dismissed suggestions
that he resign to take responsibility for the department-wide
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment issued Wednesday was undertaken nearly six months
ago, after a rogue officer, Rafael Perez, agreed to disclose
widespread abuses in an effort to reduce his sentence for stealing
cocaine from a police evidence room. He reportedly detailed vast
wrongdoing at an anti-gang unit, but now the criminal investigation
is extending to other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The report included a list of 108 recommendations for change,
among them dozens of measures that would give top police officials
more power and financing. It did not, however, recommend increased
outside scrutiny, a step critics had been hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is vague or silent on the question of real concern,
which is the root problem of how this was allowed to go on
throughout the department,'' said Merrick Bobb, a lawyer who is an
adviser to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and helped
draft a police reform plan eight years ago in response to the
beating of Rodney King. ``The LAPD has got to show that it's as
willing to let others look at it as it has shown itself willing to
look at itself. This is a first step, not an end product.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University
of Nebraska at Omaha who is the author of an coming book on
civilian oversight of police departments, said the Los Angeles
department had been fighting effective civilian control for years
and was trailing the police of other major cities in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report begs the real question,'' Walker said. ``It's a
very damning indictment, but it doesn't answer the basic question
of why this was allowed to happen, why their own policies weren't
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he added, ``really does indicate that the LAPD is
incapable of insuring accountability of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says the criminal investigation of wayward officers
is not complete, but it concludes that the corruption resulted from
``a few individuals'' whose wrongdoing ``had a contagion effect on
some of those around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Management shortcomings are addressed as well, however. In some
instances, the report says, officers were hired in spite of known
problems like narcotics use or a history of violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Michael Bostic, a member of the board of
inquiry that drew up the report, described the system for regularly
evaluating officers as ``an atrocity.'' There were too few
supervisors in station houses, and when they had days off, their
officers sometimes went completely unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians' complaints about police officers were not taken
seriously or investigated properly, the report says, and patterns
of complaints were ignored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report also cites a startling lack of internal audits. As a
result, it says, officers routinely ignored policies, in the
knowledge that ``the likelihood of anyone discovering the use of
shortcuts is practically nil.'' It says there was ``near universal
ignorance'' of the department's policies regarding the use of
informers.
</P>
<P>
   The report attributes police wrongdoing in part to the
mediocrity that it contends was allowed to flourish. That notion
was dismissed derisively by several experts here, with one senior
law-enforcement official commenting: ``Mediocrity is not
corruption. It doesn't make an officer shoot an unarmed man in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   In that previously disclosed instance, an officer confessed that
he and his partner had handcuffed an unarmed gang member, shot him
in the head, then planted a gun on him and lied in court when he
was charged with attacking them. His conviction, and 39 others,
have already been overturned as a result of the uncovered
corruption, with many more likely. Further, experts have warned
that the city faces $200 million or more in civil liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings were especially troubling to some critics
because just eight years ago, after the King beating, the initial
acquittal of the officers involved and the ensuing riots, an
independent panel headed by Warren Christopher proposed sweeping
reforms that were supposed to put a stop to the sort of systemic
abuses now being disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Parks told the Police Commission, a civilian
oversight board, that 87 percent of the reforms had been
implemented. Yet some of the same shortcomings were apparently
allowed to continue under Parks, without any clear indication that
anyone within the department was being held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the point: Why would I have confidence in the same
entity that has resisted the Christopher Commission reforms and
that offered false assurances about their implementation?'' Laura
Chick, a member of the City Council and former head of its Public
Safety Commission, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need other perspectives,'' Chick added. ``It cannot come
from the department or the Police Commission, which swallowed the
chief's assurances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard J. Riordan, who has consistently supported Parks
throughout the unfolding of the scandal, offered another
endorsement of him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been so proud of the Police Department,'' the
mayor said in a radio interview. ``To have self-criticized
themselves like this, I have never seen in the history of mankind
any government agency do that. So we are going onward, upward, and
I think everybody will be proud of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Chaleff, a lawyer who is the president of the Police
Commission, said it intended to assemble a large staff of experts
to analyze the report and make their own recommendations to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go beyond the scope of the report,'' Chaleff said,
``to ensure the department and the commission are held accountable,
and to ensure that this doesn't happen again.''

FOUR RANGERS RELIEVERS CAN BLOW FASTBALLS PAST THE BEST
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Tim Crabtree vs. Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' hard-throwing right-hander still smiles and gets
excited when asked about their confrontation last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey was leading off the inning, and it was a one-run
game,'' Crabtree said. ``He fouled off a couple of pitches and
worked the count full. I said, all right, let's see who's better. I
threw a four-seam fastball down the center of the plate but up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw it but couldn't catch up to it. He swung and missed. It
was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   What Griffey saw was heat. Pure heat. White-lightning heat.
</P>
<P>
   It's also something American League hitters should see in
torrents this season when facing the Rangers' bullpen. The Rangers
have four right-handed pitchers _ John Wetteland, Francisco
Cordero, Jeff Zimmerman and Tim Crabtree _ who collectively might
throw harder than any other foursome in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to watch,'' Wetteland said. ``Especially the
three-strikes blow away up in the strike zone, the hitter totally
overmatched. Back when I used to throw really hard, it was not
enough to strike a guy out. You needed to make them look ridiculous
so it would be fresh in their minds. That goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had some impressive heat in their bullpen last year,
but they turned the thermostat up a notch this off-season when they
acquired Cordero from the Detroit Tigers in the Juan Gonzalez
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one guy who can really throw it, it would be
Cordero,'' Wetteland said. ``His ball has tremendous velocity. It
explodes. It looks like it defies gravity with the way it rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cordero with a smile, ``I love to throw hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates called Sparky Anderson on Tuesday to
congratulate him on being elected to the Hall of Fame and... ``All
Sparky could talk about was Cordero this and Cordero that, how
great he could be,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, if he makes the team out of spring training, could
surpass Crabtree as the hardest thrower in the Rangers' bullpen.
Both regularly hit 97-98 mph with an occasional 100 mph pitch mixed
in.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, 33, admits he's no longer in that class. Those who
clocked him last year say he was topping out at a mere 95-96 mph.
But Rangers scout Bill Wood, after seeing Wetteland this spring,
said, ``As good as he looks, he might surprise people again.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman is the ``junk-baller'' of the bunch, coming in at
93-95 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I may have to start throwing a split-finger \Rfastball\S
to get by,'' Zimmerman joked.
</P>
<P>
   Oates admires a hard thrower as much as anybody but quickly and
sternly pointed out that 100 mph fastballs won't do much good
without location and movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are major-league pitchers and minor-league throwers,''
Oates said. ``You can throw 120 mph, but it's not going to do you
any good if you can't control that. Rafael Palmeiro, Mark McGwire,
Sammy Sosa, Tim Salmon, Ken Griffey ... You can't throw it too hard
to them. You've still got to be able to pitch at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Party pooper.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree said pitchers with heat can take two approaches: the
``bull rush'' and the ``high cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bull rush is you try to get ahead of the hitter, keep the
fastball down, try to hit the corners,'' Crabtree said. ``Once you
get ahead of the hitters, then you bring the high cheese. You say
to the batter: `Let's go. Let's see who's better.' Then you let it
fly. You put it at a hitter's chest, where it looks good, but
there's no way he can catch up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what 40,000 paying customers love to see, even if there
was no way Wetteland and Zimmerman could have made the All-Star
Game last year without their hellacious breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing hard definitely pumps you up,'' Zimmerman said. ``But
we don't want to look at ourselves as one-dimensional pitchers just
throwing it as hard as we can. John's the perfect example. He's got
a great fastball, but he throws four quality pitches. He can fool
you as well as flat-out blow you away.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way wins ballgames, which is Oates' only goal. But they
don't put those radar-gun readings on ballpark scoreboards just to
show the difference between a changeup and a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   As Crabtree said: ``There's nothing more exciting than say, a
one-run ballgame, the opposing team has a power hitter up, and we
have a power pitcher out there on the mound. It's one of those
confrontations that's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   It's coming to a Ballpark near you.  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nothing captures Vice President Al Gore's
relationship with his traveling press corps _ and the state of mind
of the Gore campaign _ like the scene here Tuesday night, when Gore
was winning a soaring victory over his all-but-vanquished rival,
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was sequestered in a hotel room here to watch the returns
from Washington state. He had planned no public events, but was
going to make a conference call to supporters in Seattle. The only
access that reporters would have would be when they were escorted
to his suite to watch him make the call.
</P>
<P>
   When the time for the conference call came, there was no escort
in sight. So the reporters pulled out their cell phones and dialed
the 800 phone number to connect into the call themselves. The
telephone operator said the call would be placed in just a few
moments. As it turned out, the wait dragged on for more than half
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore finally made his conference call, reporters were in
hotel elevators, where they had no cell-phone access.
</P>
<P>
   For all that has been made of Sen. John McCain's accessibility
during this campaign season and how the Arizona Republican has used
his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus to hold unending conversations
with his traveling press entourage, Gore's campaign operation
provides a vivid counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters covering the vice president can go for days without
seeing him. Because many are consigned to a press charter while
Gore flies in Air Force Two, they can sometimes be in a different
city.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the vice president has become an extremely
disciplined candidate, saying just what he wants to say and going
no further.
</P>
<P>
   While this might rankle reporters, it has proved a successful
strategy. He is undefeated so far in the primaries, and has the
Democratic presidential nomination within his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has little reason to change to an unscripted format and its
obvious pitfalls, especially while the Republicans are getting
plenty of publicity chewing each other up. Moreover, he wants to
avoid being drawn into discussions of political tactics and
strategy with national reporters. Surveys show that voters are
bored by campaigns about campaigns, and that such chatter
reinforces a negative image of candidates as calculating
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vice president remains unusually distant from his
traveling press corps, especially for a former journalist.
</P>
<P>
   He was not always this way. As recently as a year ago, when he
was traveling with just a few reporters and was not so much in the
spotlight, he was more willing to engage in spontaneous
conversation. But over time, he made blunders _ claiming a central
role in the creation of the Internet, for example _ that got him
publicity he did not want.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his advisers told him that the trappings of
the vice presidency made him seem too imperious, and he went
through a very public transition in which he tried to relate to
voters in a more human way, wearing casual clothes and holding open
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Gore was warming up to voters, he was clamming up to
the press. The campaign wanted to ensure that he was delivering
only the rehearsed message of the day, not random comments that
were ``off-message.''
</P>
<P>
   To see just how focused Gore has become on this task, go back to
the scene in the hotel lobby here on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The escort finally arrived and the traveling horde of perhaps
two dozen journalists took the elevator to the vice president's
suite. When everyone was assembled, Gore said nothing _ this was
supposed to be a ``photo op'' only _ until a reporter asked, ``How
you feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to the people of Washington state because, based
on the projections, it looks like a big win, but I'm not taking
anything for granted,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was then asked what message he had for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, well, I don't, uh, have any, uh, message, uh, for, uh, for
Senator Bradley,'' he responded slowly. ``Uh, I, I, my message is
for the, the voters of the country. Uh, I ask for their support.
I'm not taking a single vote for, for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question came. When would it be time for him to start
unifying the Democratic Party?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Gore aides started trying to remove reporters
from the room. Gore answered, ``I, I am not taking a single vote
for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Much cross-talk ensued as the aides continued trying to hustle
reporters out and Gore asserted, with the same rote-like repetition
with which he famously said that there was ``no controlling legal
authority'' over his fund-raising techniques, that he was not
taking a single vote for granted. This was an important message to
convey to voters in later primaries whose support Gore needs to
guarantee him the nomination, but it provided no grist for the
journalists, which was exactly the point.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To a reporter's final plea for a news conference _ what is
called a ``press avail'' _ Gore cupped his ear in parody of
President Ronald Reagan, who pretended to want to hear reporters'
questions as he ducked under a noisy helicopter blade. Lacking a
helicopter, Gore pointed to the television. ``Oh, look,'' he said,
cranking up the volume and calling out to the last reporter being
yanked from the room, ``Thanks for coming to this press avail!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore conducted his last ``press avail'' of any significance (for
perhaps 20 minutes) on Jan. 19 in New Hampshire. A month later,
when reporters began writing news articles mentioning that the
campaign was coming up on the one-month anniversary of no news
conference, he held a quick news conference on Feb. 19 in
Springfield, Mass., from which most of the regular traveling press
corps was absent. That was also the day the Republican primary in
South Carolina completely dominated the political news.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has become adept at limiting the national
media's access and making the candidate appear accessible through
the local news media. He is a frequent guest on drive-time radio,
and he pays for satellite hookups to distant cities.
</P>
<P>
   What the listener or viewer often does not know, however, is
that by now the Gore campaign _ and anyone who listens to a
succession of these interviews _ can predict the questions in
advance. And Gore has a predictable batch of answers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock question: Will your relationship with President Clinton
hurt your candidacy? Gore's stock answer: Clinton is his friend; he
made a mistake; he has done good things for the country, and Gore
has to run on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Would you rather run against John McCain or George W.
Bush? Answer: ``Whichever one loses.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Who will you pick as your vice president? Answer:
``I'm not letting myself think openly about it because I haven't
won the nomination yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The vice president's visit, not what he says, is big
news in most media markets. The local press usually starts
trumpeting the visit two or three days in advance, covers it live
while Gore is there, and provides another day or two of local
reaction (almost always positive) after he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   So legendary has Gore's unavailability become that Bradley
called up reporters traveling on Gore's bus and reached them by
cell phone. As he said to one: ``I wanted to give you the chance to
speak to a presidential candidate.''

CONFIDENT BUSH CRITICIZES GORE IN WAKE OF PRIMARY WINS OVER McCAIN 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Ga. _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush sounded like a
general election candidate Wednesday as he repeatedly criticized
Vice President Al Gore, while rival John McCain, bruised from a
triple loss in Tuesday's primaries, wagered his future on the
upcoming California primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also revealed that his bitter and yet
unfinished primary fight with McCain may have caused some
long-lasting wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Having restored his front-runner status with victories Tuesday
in North Dakota, Virginia and Washington state, Bush displayed a
renewed self-confidence speaking to about 800 supporters at the
Gwinnett County Civic Center. Bush criticized Gore on issues such
as education reform, tax cuts and appointments to the U.S. Supreme
Court, and never named McCain during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took the lead in the race to collect the delegates who
will determine the party's nominee at the national convention this
summer. Bush now has 170 delegates to McCain's 100.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stepped up his appeal for support among California voters
Wednesday as he sought to dispel perceptions that his campaign for
the presidency may be sputtering to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies in Southern California, McCain acknowledged that the
success of his ``reform crusade'' may hinge on the outcome of
Tuesday's California primary, where 162 Republican delegates are at
stake. More than a dozen states also vote that Super Tuesday in
what will be the biggest collection of primaries in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a microcosm of America,'' the senator told a
cheering crowd in Riverside. ``What you do next Tuesday will have
an incredible impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Super Tuesday states, polls show McCain ahead in
Massachusetts, tied with Bush in New York and trailing in others.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll of California voters released Wednesday
shows Bush ahead of McCain among GOP voters by 21 percent. Bush
also leads McCain by 6 percent among voters in general, including
independents and Democrats who plan to vote in the GOP race even if
it doesn't count toward the delegate prize.
</P>
<P>
   The two men debate with third-place rival Alan Keyes Thursday
night in Los Angeles. But before that serious event, Bush and
McCain each got to compete by wisecracking for ratings, if not
votes, with appearances on the late-night talk shows Wednesday.
Bush appeared on CBS's ``The Late Show with David Letterman,''
while McCain was a guest on NBC's ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno.``
</P>
<P>
   Although the senator sounded optimistic about his chances in
California, his advisers, for the first time since his big win over
Bush in the New Hampshire primary, did not.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's chief political adviser, told reporters
that without California's delegates, there was no way McCain would
be able ``to make the math work out'' without at least sweeping the
northeastern primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Even before all the results were in in Washington state Tuesday,
McCain was trying to characterize his attempt at the White House as
something other than a quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our mission is to get people involved ... we've had some
success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But later, he noted that if he continued to win the popular vote
but lose among Republicans, he would cause a stir within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a split decision, that's going to be a debate
that's taking place within the Republican Party,'' McCain told
reporters.``Do they want somebody who won the majority or do they
want somebody who only won Republican votes?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush _ who earlier in the campaign repeatedly referred to McCain
as ``my friend'' _ afterward refused to say whether the Arizona
senator was still. As soon as the Republican campaign became a
horserace after McCain swamped Bush in New Hampshire, the two have
waged an intensely negative campaign that peaked when McCain linked
Bush to Southern fundamentalists who hold anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the question was,'' Bush said the second time he
was asked about his friendship with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to take things personally in politics, and I'll of
course assess things once the campaign ends, but calling somebody
an anti-Catholic bigot is beyond the reach,'' Bush said. ``I don't
accept that kind of campaigning, and I'm not going to tolerate that
kind of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Louis University, a Jesuit school, Bush rallied amid
signs that read, ``Catholics for Bush,'' and said: ``I don't
appreciate the politics that's happening in America today using
religion as a race card.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed ready to put the personal politics aside, telling
a town hall meeting: ``Look, Governor Bush is a good man from a
good family, and he would make a good president of the United
States. But I would make a better president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina and Michigan earlier this month and in
Tuesday's primaries in Virginia and Washington state, McCain's
campaign called Catholic voters to criticize Bush for speaking at
Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a school whose founder
expressed anti-Catholic sentiments. Bush has since apologized to
Catholics for not denouncing the schools' anti-Catholic and racist
sentiments while speaking there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted McCain compared evangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in his pivotal
Virginia Beach speech on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Farrakhan preaches hate. Louis Farrakhan is a hateful
person who has preached an anti-Semitic message which is ugly,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain criticized Bush for a Jan. 30 appearance on Fox News
Sunday in which Bush said the Nation of Islam would be eligible for
federal funds under Bush's proposal to turn more government social
service programs over to faith-based organizations. Bush's
statement was denounced by the National Jewish Democratic Council.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Wednesday he was answering a question about the Muslim
faith, not the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we can allow public dollars to fund programs
where spite and hate are in the core of the message,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his contest with McCain has allowed him to consolidate
the Republican base before the general election. Bush has been
winning among core Republicans, but McCain scored victories in New
Hampshire and Michigan with the help of independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have a candidate who can bring people
together, who can consolidate, not a candidate who has divided
people up. That's really the difference right now where we're
headed in this primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm the nominee, I'll begin to reach out to Democrats and
independents who heretofore have not participated in our
primaries,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain hardened his attack Wednesday on Bush's positions by
challenging his new campaign finance proposal as a ``joke'' because
it does not set strict limits on contributions. He also laughed at
Bush's assertion that he is a ``reformer with results,'' noting
that the governor has increased spending in Texas and has not
identified where he would cut wasteful spending or how he would
preserve Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing his battle with McCain in news conferences,
Bush's focus before his supporters was on Gore, the front-runner
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Gore as backing education programs that
emphasized federal funding for facility construction over improving
results, for declining to support Bush's $483 billion tax cut plan
and over judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental difference between me and Al Gore is who are
we going to put on the bench,'' Bush said. ``Appointments to the
Supreme Court will have a lasting effect on the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore will put jurists on the court who will legislate,
while he promised to put on ``strict constructionists.'' Bush
afterward declined to say whether a strict constructionist judge
would uphold the controversial Roe vs. Wade decision abortion
rights decision as standing precedent or overturn it as a
constitutional ``stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A strict constructionist judge is one who strictly interprets
the constitution,'' Bush said.

 &HT;    Bush jaunty in Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A confident George W. Bush predicted Wednesday _ the
day after he drubbed John McCain in two primaries and a caucus _
that not only will he eliminate his pesky Republican opponent
within a few weeks, but he also fully expects to become the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Bush said quietly Wednesday as he flew to St.
Louis after an overnight stay in Atlanta. ``I'm convinced I'll be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain isn't looking quite that far. He focused on next week's
do-or-die Super Tuesday contests in 13 states. This week's stinging
losses in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota highlighted
McCain's underdog status, a position he sought to exploit Wednesday
in delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday's biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment is intent on breaking me,'' he told a crowd
in Riverside, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sought to downplay any sense of Bush's possible
inevitability as the party's nominee, saying he has learned at
least one lesson in this up-and-down primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I can assure you about the election next
Tuesday, it will not be what you predict,'' McCain said at a news
conference after the Riverside town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, in an interview with Cox Newspapers aboard his
campaign jet, said he may have guaranteed his nomination with the
victory in Washington state. Some day, he said, that primary will
be recalled as a pivotal moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the three states yesterday were open primaries. I think
Washington state is pretty interesting. I beat Al Gore and Bill
Bradley,'' he said, referring to ballots that also included
candidates of the Democratic Party. ``I think you'll find that to
be an interesting state where all four of us were on the ballot _
independents, Democrats, crossovers here, crossovers there. I won
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls show Bush won Tuesday by relying on a solid
foundation of Republican voters who gave him a solid victory in
South Carolina less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's inability to draw Republican votes in Washington stood
as the most troubling aspect of his defeat. But other problems
dogged him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's attack Monday on fundamentalist Christian
leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``agents of
intolerance'' was intended to reinforce McCain's argument that he
can attract not only Democratic and independent voters, but also
moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the speech seems to have rallied conservatives and some
previously undecided voters to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gaining some support here (in California) because he's
so anti-establishment, but now people are going to vote for Bush,
not because they support him, but because of the perceived bigotry
and divisiveness in McCain's statement,'' said Steve Frank,
president of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, a
union of conservatives within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash grew Wednesday with conservative activist Gary
Bauer urging McCain to apologize. Bauer endorsed McCain after
dropping out of the Republican presidential race last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must in the strongest possible terms repudiate Senator
McCain's unwarranted, ill-advised and divisive attacks on certain
religious leaders,'' Bauer said in a statement. ``Senator McCain
must not allow his personal differences with any individual to
cloud his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters his comments were aimed at Falwell and
Robertson, not religious conservatives as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain refused to back away from his description of Bush as
a ``Pat Robertson Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``I talked to Gary and I hope we can work things
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer criticized McCain's comparison of Robertson and Falwell
with the Rev. Al Sharpton and Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan. He also criticized McCain's later statement, on the
campaign bus, that he was trying to battle ``the forces of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to downplay those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a half-hearted attempt at humor,'' he told reporters.
``I did not say and did not mean to say they are evil. (But) They
are bad for our party. ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who campaigned in St. Louis on his way to California, said
he agreed with Bauer that McCain's comparison with Farrakhan was
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Farrakhan preaches hate,'' Bush said. ``Louis Farrakhan
is a hateful person who has preached an anti-Semitic message which
is ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he does not believe McCain's attempts to glue him to
Robertson and Falwell will be a general-election issue. Others have
tried that approach _ and failed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can try it again in year 2000,'' Bush said. ``I am who I
am, the people know that. People are trying to brand me one way and
on the other hand John McCain is trying to call me an anti-Catholic
bigot. I got fire coming from all sides. But eventually the people
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Georgia, Bush made it clear at a news conference
in Duluth that his relationship with McCain has changed. Earlier in
the campaign, he went out of his way to note that he and the
senator were friends. On Wednesday, Bush twice declined to identify
McCain as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush continues to complain daily about the McCain campaign's
phone calls reminding voters Bush spoke at Bob Jones University, a
South Carolina fundamentalist school that has expressed
anti-Catholic biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgive people,'' Bush said, ``but this kind of campaigning
is not necessary in his campaign and he ought to be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered a second chance to say whether he considers McCain a
friend, Bush said, ``I know what the question was. The answer was I
try not to take things personally in politics and I will, of
course, assess things once the campaign's ended. But calling
somebody an anti-Catholic bigot is beyond the reach.''

</P>
<P>
   A WINNING ADVANTAGE: There is more than one winner and one loser
at each turning of the primary circuit. In Virginia, the big winner
beyond Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was former Gov. George Allen,
who is already running fast and hard for the Senate seat held by
Charles S. Robb, a Democrat. Allen was co-chairman of the Bush
drive, and he scored in his own behalf in delivering a big party
vote to the Bush victory on Tuesday. He compounded his advantage in
the final heavy days when he was one of the chief spokesmen for
Bush.

   COSTLY CRITICISM: When Bob Offutt ran for the Texas State Board
of Education in 1996 with the backing of the state's Republican
establishment, he raised $20,000 from a single political action
committee alone. In this year's race he has raised a total of only
$2,500, including a $2,000 loan from himself, while his leading
opponent in the Republican primary on March 14 has raised more than
$25,000. The difference? In between, Offutt traveled to New
Hampshire to criticize Gov. George W. Bush's education policy and
endorse Steve Forbes. ``To put it in a nutshell, you don't tug on
Superman's cape,'' Mona Taylor, a political consultant, told The
Austin American-Statesman.

their primary on March 11, despite a lawsuit that would block
online voting on the ground that it could discriminate against

the numbers showed disproportionate participation by whites with

   PRIMARY PLANS FOR 2004: This year's presidential primary
calendar is not even half over, but Democratic and Republican
leaders in the South are already arguing that it should be
reconfigured for 2004. Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said this
week that his state should hold its 2004 primary between the early
primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Alabama will not
vote until June 6 this year, presumably well after both parties'
contests have been settled. At a hearing in Atlanta on Saturday,
Georgia Democratic leaders told national party officials that at
least one Southern primary should have an earlier date, and thus a
more influential role, in the 2004 campaign.

received from groups that support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be glad to return this honorary degree, and all my
honorary degrees,'' Ashcroft said in a statement, ``if my opponent
will send back his political money from special interests that
support partial-birth abortion.'' He called Carnahan's veto of a
bill banning the late-term procedure that opponents call
partial-birth abortion the ``most offensive insult to Catholic

MONTANA ASBESTOSIS VICTIMS TELL THEIR STORIES TO LEGISLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four quiet people from Libby, Mont., came here this
week to show lawmakers what it's like to be dying of asbestosis.
They found themselves watching a legislative tornado of
name-calling, dueling experts and frenzied lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just working stiffs from Libby, but 300 or 400 people in
our tiny town have got the disease and the legislation that's
supposed to help us out won't do a damn thing for almost any of
them, including those that are close to dying,'' says Les
Skramstad, a vermiculite miner who worked at the W.R. Grace mine
outside Libby.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation the Montanans came to oppose is the Fairness in
Asbestos Compensation Act. It is a highly contentious package of
laws promoted, for the most part, by GAF Corp., W.R. Grace and
others in the asbestos industry. For almost three years this bill
and earlier versions have been pushed hard, mostly by Republicans
on the Senate Commerce and the House Judiciary committees.
</P>
<P>
   Like much legislation, the verbiage sounds noble and beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors insist it will end the logjam of hundreds of
thousands of victims waiting for their day in court and prevent
personal injury lawyers from pocketing large chunks of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, mostly unions, victim's groups, consumer
coalitions and the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, say it
should be called the ``Asbestos Industry Relief Act,'' since it
will prevent thousands of terminally ill victims from filing suit
for holding the industry accountable for the disease they
contracted.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is getting sloppy, even by Washington standards.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that more than $6 million has been spent in
lobbying by both sides and the conflict has grown far beyond
Republicans snarling at Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers and attorneys for the victims are denouncing
each other as ambulance-chasing hacks delaying the process to
increase their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, some of them industry consultants, developed the
medical screening criteria for the law. But other physicians,
including some nationally recognized pulmonary and cancer
specialists _ those who traditionally treat the patients _ call the
proposed standards ``antiquated,'' ``exclusionary'' and
``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated by public-interest groups that over the past 25
years settlements have been made in more than a half-million
asbestos cases and another 450,000 may be pending.
</P>
<P>
   Since the EPA's ban on asbestos mining and the manufacture and
sale of asbestos-containing products was overturned in 1991 after
an industry-sponsored lawsuit, several government agencies fear
that a new generation of victims may be created.
</P>
<P>
   As with many legislative debates, those voting on the
compensation bills must deal with facts, statistics, history and
interpretation provided, to some degree by committee staff, but,
for the most part, by lobbyists on both sides. For example, the
language for the bill originally presented to House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) was written by a Harvard law
school professor working with an asbestos industry-funded group.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress admit it's often difficult to put a
face on the people affected by legislation being debated.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday and Wednesday, the group from Libby showed any committee
member who was willing to meet with them precisely who will be
impacted by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Skramstad, 63, was diagnosed with asbestosis six years ago. His
wife, Norita, and two of their three children also have the
disease, having been contaminated with asbestos dust on his work
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Priest is 72 and was diagnosed with asbestosis last year,
17 years after her husband Virgil, died from it. She dragged a
wheeled canister of oxygen behind her as she shuffled across the
marble floors of the congressional buildings she visited. Her
neighbors lugged three extra tanks of oxygen and worried she would
run out.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Redman is 44. She and her brother and sister all have
asbestosis, also from the dust on her father's work clothes. He
died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Benefield doesn't have asbestos, but her mother and father
both died slow, painful deaths from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   For two days the Montanans told their stories to anyone who
would listen. Tears sometimes flowed as they recounted life and
death with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law, if passed, would have exclude all of these people
from any protection,'' Benefield said, indicating her friends and
their families. ''The medical criteria and lengths of exposure that
the asbestos industry wants included would just slam the door shut.
There would be no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Whitehouse, the Spokane chest specialist who first
recognized that scores of people in Libby had asbestos-related
diseases, examined the medical history of the more then 300
patients he has treated or is treating and, according to Benefield,
determined that 78 percent would be excluded under the screening
criteria of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a bunch of people who have already had
settlements made and others who are near death,'' she says. ``I'm
not sure that these congressmen have a clue of what they're really
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Montanans walked into a House Judiciary Committee
hearing. Within a minute after their arrival, Hyde adjourned the
session and left the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's committee office was asked to comment on Whitehouse's
finding, but didn't return calls.
</P>
<P>
   At least one member of his Judiciary Committee did not hesitate
to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Libby have been let down by one government
agency after another over the years,'' said Rep. Marty Meehan,
D-Mass., ``Those who could have stepped in, made Grace do the right
thing and provide some relief, instead passed the buck and pointed
the finger elsewhere. Now the regulators are beginning to make up
for it. But the damage is largely done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan spoke about the fact, reported by the Post-Intelligencer
last December, that the tainted Libby ore was sent to at least 60
processing plants around the country. ``One of those plants is in
my district,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee was expected to approve the bill this
week and send it on to the House for a vote, but it may no longer a
done deal. The committee's vote has been delayed for at least a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Public reaction to the Post-Intelligencer series and the
resulting investigations by the EPA, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission and other federal agencies have increased visibility of
the debate, according to a Congressional Quarterly report this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all those red flags out there, I question why we're
rushing into marking up this bill. I could see an argument for
moving ahead if we had at least done all we could to get to the
bottom of these medical criteria and see what they mean for flesh
and blood human beings like those here today. But we haven't,''
Meehan said, pointing to the four people from Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was further jolted last month when Bruce Vento, a
popular Democratic representative from Minnesota, announced that he
was retiring because he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma. Vento
got the disease, a deadly cancer of the lining of the lungs, after
being exposed to asbestos as a youth while working at a brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The latency period, the time from when someone is exposed to
asbestos to the first serious signs of disease, can be as long as
40 years. Many of the people dying today worked with asbestos when
it was called a ``miracle fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   In thousands of different products, it was found in every home,
factory and construction site. Asbestos manufacturers knew the
hazards, but most kept silent. Some fought, and continue to fight,
government attempts to regulate use of asbesteos. The lethal
exposures and the lawsuits piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court asked Congress to solve the
problem, calling the backlog of cases a judicial nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Asbestos
Compensation under the Justice Department. Government-approved
doctors, using criteria defined in the law, would be gatekeepers,
issuing a pass to qualifying victims who wished to sue or seek a
government-ordained settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress shouldn't add insult to injury. It shouldn't be the
latest in a long line of potential protectors who in fact failed to
protect,'' Meehan said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Congressional staff members old enough to remember the
years of debate to pass laws to help coal miners suffering from
Black Lung disease, say they see similarities which are alarming.
Miners in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and other coal states often
fought lengthy battles with local Black Lung certification boards
who were sometimes staffed with coal-company doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say they're sure that wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The four from Libby don't believe them.

PAC-10 COULD BE SHORTCHANGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With impressive non-conference victories,
sparkling individual performances and two dominant teams, this
might be the best regular season in Pacific-10 history.
</P>
<P>
   The league is 5-0 against the Big Ten and has beaten Kentucky,
Michigan State, Texas, Duke, Auburn, North Carolina, Purdue and
DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's Eddie House tied the conference scoring record
with 61 points. A few weeks later, USC's David Bluthenthal had 28
rebounds and Arizona's Loren Woods blocked 14 shots. No conference
in the country has a better group of freshmen. Stanford and Arizona
are headed for top seeds in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, it's been all smiles and good cheer at the
league office in Walnut Creek. But the jocularity could end
Selection Sunday (March 12) if just three teams make the NCAA
Tournament. And unless someone gets hot, that's exactly what will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at who's in, who's out and who's on the brink:
</P>
<P>
   Stanford: The Cardinal (24-1, 13-1) clinched a bid weeks ago. It
has beaten Duke, Auburn, Iowa and Georgia Tech. Its record (24-1)
and power rating (No.7 in the RPI) are superb. Even if it loses at
Arizona next week, Stanford probably has clinched a No.1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left is placement. If the Cardinal wins the Pac-10
title outright, it probably will play in Tucson. (The Selection
committee likes to place conference champs in their home region.)
</P>
<P>
   But if Arizona wins the league and plays in Salt Lake City the
Wildcats can't play in Tucson, of course Stanford probably goes to
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona: The Wildcats (24-4, 13-1) aren't making the Selection
committee's job easy. They've defeated Kentucky, Texas, Michigan
State and Stanford and probably will clinch a No.1 seed if they
beat Oregon on Saturday and Stanford next week. But that seems
unlikely given star center Loren Woods' back injury. (He's out
several weeks, at least.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the injury affect Arizona's seed? Wildcats athletic
director Jim Livengood is on the Selection committee and will
provide a detailed report on Woods' tournament status. If he's out,
the committee could drop the Wildcats a spot or two.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if Woods is expected back for the tournament, the
committee could disregard losses incurred without him - just as it
will disregard Michigan State's losses without Mateen Cleaves and
Temple's losses without Pepe Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon: The Ducks have solid power ratings (30th in Sagarin,
34th in RPI), and they have several impressive non-conference wins
(Minnesota, Wake Forest and Gonzaga).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their victory at USC last week, the Ducks (19-7, 10-5)
probably are one win from clinching an at-large berth. That could
come this weekend against the Arizona schools or March 11 against
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   However, forward A.D. Smith's injury - he's out several weeks
with a broken cheekbone - could cost the Ducks a few spots in the
seedings.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State: The Sun Devils (16-10, 8-6) are difficult to
evaluate. Yes, they're playing well in the stretch and have a
chance to finish fourth. But their best non-conference victory is
Colorado State, and they have a non-Division I win (American
U.-Puerto Rico) that the Selection committee will disregard.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the critical 18-victory plateau, ASU must win three of
its last four games. That makes tonight's showdown at Oregon
critical - for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Cal: With a freshman-dominated roster, coach Ben Braun has done
a superb job getting the Bears (15-11, 6-8) this close to a
tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   But even Braun probably can't overcome last week's loss at
Washington State. With a power rating in the 60s and only one
impressive non-conference win (Gonzaga), Cal needs to win three of
its last four to have a chance. That means sweeping the L.A.
schools this weekend and winning at Arizona State next week.
</P>
<P>
   USC: The Oregon loss was devastating, and it left the fading
Trojans (14-12, 6-8) with one realistic path to the tournament: win
three of their last four (Cal and the Washington schools) and hope
for a break.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do 17-win teams make the field, but Sam Clancy's return
could place the Trojans in a different category. If he'd been
healthy all season, they'd surely have two or three more victories.
Then again, he was healthy when the Trojans lost to Utah State,
Long Beach State and St. Bonaventure.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA: With a lofty power rating (No.28 RPI), the Bruins have
become convinced they can make the tournament with 17 wins.
</P>
<P>
   They're misinformed. Power ratings are important, but they
aren't the most important criteria. The Selection committee values
late-season performance above all; record against quality teams is
a close second.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins (15-11, 6-8) win three of their last four and
reach the 18-victory plateau, they're in - no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't - if they get swept in the Bay Area, then sweep
the Washington schools - they're in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting those games would give UCLA a 5-5 record in its last
10. That includes two heartless losses in the desert. It's hard to
justify inviting a 17-win team that lost by 29 points at Arizona
State in mid-February. It's also hard to justify inviting a 17-win
team that would have two losses to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the Bruins had better win tonight.

NCAA TOURNAMENT HOPES ON THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the rest of the nation, the NCAA Tournament
begins March 16. For the UCLA Bruins, it begins tonight at Cal in
the first of four games to determine their postseason fate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (15-11, 6-8) must win three of their last four to
secure a tournament berth. If they lose tonight, they must defeat
No.1 Stanford on Saturday to keep pace a situation they're
desperate to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be single elimination, but it's awfully close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play each game like it's a first-round game,''
Bruins senior forward Sean Farnham said. ``To get there, the best
way is to be mentally prepared like it's an NCAA Tournament game.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of qualifying for the tournament the minimum standard
for a successful season in Westwood tonight's game probably is the
most important UCLA has played in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the final weekend of the 1980 regular season, coach Larry
Brown's 15-9 team visited the Bay Area needing two wins to make the
tournament. Behind senior forward Kiki Vandeweghe and freshman
guards Rod Foster and Michael Holton, who's now an assistant coach,
the Bruins swept Cal and Stanford, made the tournament and charged
to the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the program again sits on the brink of
tournament rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure fighting for the Pac-10 title or playing in
the West (region) or playing for a high seed,'' Bruins coach Steve
Lavin said. ``But this is a different form of pressure. This is the
first time with two weeks to go that we've had NCAA Tournament
ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the Bruins are better prepared today than they were
last week after miserable performances in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They reduced turnovers against the Oregon schools, refined their
offense and gained a speck of momentum. Their practices are more
intense and their spirits are rising.
</P>
<P>
   They also have revenge on their minds. If the Bruins had
defeated Cal last month in Pauley Pavilion, they wouldn't be in
this predicament. Instead, they botched several last-minute
possessions, misused their timeouts and lost to a team with five
freshmen playing extensive minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They embarrassed us,'' UCLA forward Rico Hines said. ``It hurt
to see their younger guys get a win in Pauley. We're definitely
thinking about revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric update: Center Dan Gadzuric has practiced sparingly
this week after injuring his knee against Oregon State, but he
expects to play today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I banged it when I dove on the floor,'' he said. ``Monday, I
did some individual workouts to break a sweat. But (Tuesday) I was
able to run. I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong: Guard Earl Watson struggled for most of the
season but has flourished since point guard Ryan Bailey entered the
starting lineup six games ago. Bailey's presence frees Watson to
roam the court, score from the wings and rebound aggressively.
Watson is averaging 15.6 points and shooting 60.3 percent in the
six games.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he was named Pac-10 player of the week for his 41-point
effort against the Oregon schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's found a happy medium,'' Lavin said.

DISPUTE MAY KNOCK ABC'S TV STATION OFF CABLE SYSTEM IN HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Va.)  (rk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an increasingly bitter dispute between Time Warner Inc. and
Walt Disney Co., an ABC television station in Houston is due to go
dark early Friday morning in more than 650,000 homes served by the
Time Warner cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, ABC's parent, has asked for several concessions from
Time Warner for the right to continue transmitting the signals of
its Houston station, KTRK, on the cable system. Along with several
lesser demands, Disney has asked Time Warner to change its Disney
Channel from a premium or pay cable channel to a basic channel and
to pay it 71 cents for every subscriber to its cable systems, a
relatively high figure.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in Houston, which could spill over to other cities,
including New York, will be closely watched for what it could mean
for future negotiations between broadcasters and cable operators
and how networks might use the growth of satellite television
service as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have become increasingly aggressive recently in
dealing with cable systems. Late last year, Fox pulled its signal
from a group of communities served by the cable systems of Cox
Communications Inc., including Dallas and Fairfax, Va., to win a
place for its movie channel. The dispute was resolved after a week,
and the movie channel is now being carried.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives assailed Disney's tactics as
``blackmail,'' ``terrorism,'' and ``extortion.'' Disney executives
said Time Warner had engaged in a pattern of ``preferential
treatment'' for its own channels at the expense of channels owned
by Disney and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a last-minute deal can be arranged _ and executives from
both sides said they were not even talking Wednesday _ viewers in
Houston cable homes served by Time Warner will lose access to ABC,
as of 12:01 a.m. Friday. After that, they will be compelled to use
old-fashioned antennas or sign up with a satellite distribution
company to receive ABC programs.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute threatens to affect other cities where Time Warner
has cable systems, principally New York, where the company has 1.2
million customers. ABC granted a 30-day extension in New York; the
new termination date is March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ABC said it selected Houston to begin this showdown because it
offered the best opportunities for viewers to get access to ABC in
other ways. ABC Thursday will begin offering $99 rebates to viewers
in Houston for purchases of satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Luftman, the vice president of communications for Time
Warner Cable, labeled the Disney position ``an extortion demand''
and likened Disney's tactics in choosing Houston as the city to
fight out the dispute to ``terrorists taking hostages and then
taking one out and shooting him in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Disney president, accused Time Warner of
refusing to negotiate in good faith out of desire to give
``preferential treatment'' to channels owned by Time Warner,
including the Cartoon Network, which is a direct competitor to the
Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Iger noted that the Disney Channel was moved from Channel 33 to
Channel 66 in New York, while channels owned by Time Warner, like
CNN and TBS, have been moved down to the lowest channels. The
low-numbered channels tend to have the heaviest traffic on cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies gave directly opposite accounts of how the
negotiations have gone. Fred Dressler, the senior vice president or
programming for Time Warner Cable, said he had a deal completed
with ABC but for one small detail in December.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that ABC changed the terms after the AOL-Time
Warner merger was announced in January. Patricia Matson, the senior
vice president of corporate communications for ABC, said the
company was already unhappy with the terms but that the merger
increased ABC concerns, because it would be dealing with a more
powerful organization with control over cable and internet access.
She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Dressler said the Disney channel switch would cost Time Warner
an additional $100 million. ABC executives said the figure was
vastly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, both sides agree, Disney offered to take the
entire Disney Channel issue off the table and simply take a cash
settlement for the rights to carry ABC's stations. No cable system
has ever paid a broadcaster for rights to its signal. The offer was
declined.

AUTO SALES IN FEBRUARY NEAR MONTHLY RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The U.S. auto industry is poised to have its
second-best month for sales ever after General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG reported higher vehicle sales for
February on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be
about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining
companies report sales Thursday. That would put February sales in
second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Every automaker that reported February sales Wednesday posted an
increase, and most set February records. A half-dozen companies,
including BMW and the smaller Asian carmakers, are scheduled to
report sales Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   GM had its best February since 1988, with vehicle sales totaling
467,010 cars and light trucks, up 16.1 percent, compared with
results in the month a year earlier. Trucks led the way, rising
20.9 percent, to 223,503 units. Car sales increased 12.1 percent,
to 243,507 vehicles. GM's sales were lifted partly by a $500
loyalty coupon offered to current owners on the purchase of a new
vehicle. The coupon expired Tuesday and will not be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported it sold 348,510 cars and light trucks, an increase
of 3.9 percent from the month a year earlier. Car sales increased
to 4.6 percent, to 146,074 vehicles. Truck sales climbed 3.3
percent, to 202,436.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it sold 250,230 cars and light trucks in
February, an increase of 5.5 percent compared with sales in the
month a year earlier. The automaker sold 168,813 light trucks, up 9
percent. Car sales fell 1.1 percent, to 81,417 units, because of
decreases in the sales of the Chrysler group cars. Mercedes-Benz
car sales increased.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors set
February sales records. Volkswagen had its best February since
1975. Nissan Motor, Subaru and Isuzu Motors also reported higher
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts pointed to the strong economy and increasing
consumer wealth as factors keeping vehicle sales humming in early
2000 after a record-setting 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Paul Ballew, GM's general director of
market and industry analysis, also attributed higher sales to the
affordability of vehicles. Intense competitive pressures have
prevented price increases and have led manufacturers to offer
attractive incentives, including cash rebates and low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices, which hit record levels during the month, and
climbing interest rates appeared to have no effect on vehicle
sales. Sales of vehicles like full-size pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles that use gas heavily as well as luxury
automobiles, were brisk during the month. Ford's F-Series pickup
trucks and its sport utility vehicles had their best February in
history. GM broke records in every truck segment, including
pickups, sport utility vehicles and vans.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect the pace of vehicle sales to slow somewhat
from February's scorching rate. Still, they predict the final tally
for 2000 car and truck sales to rival the 1999 record of nearly 17
million vehicles.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: BY MOST ANY MEASURE, McCAIN'S BLACK TUESDAY  
(js) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Before Washington state's votes rolled in late
Tuesday, aides to Sen. John McCain tried to minimize Gov. George W.
Bush's victory in Virginia, which had reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The only place Bush had shown any strength, McCain aides said,
was in the most conservative section of the country, the South,
with victories in South Carolina 10 days earlier and now Virginia.
McCain himself chimed in, ``Seems as if he has a Southern strategy
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact McCain was comprehensively beaten on Tuesday: in a
big Southern state with one foot in the mid-Atlantic region,
Virginia; in a small, isolated Midwestern state whose economy is
based on agriculture, North Dakota; and in a Northwestern state
with a progressive tradition, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was by some margin the biggest wipeout of the Republican
presidential campaign, and it came just one week before 13 states
hold Republican primaries and caucuses in what may prove to be the
decisive moment of the fight for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   New polls taken in a number of those states since McCain's
victory in Michigan a week ago, but before Bush's sweep on Tuesday,
show tough going ahead for the Arizonan. He has taken a narrow
lead, within the margin of error, in three New York surveys, and he
has an enormous lead of 36 points in Massachusetts. But he trails
Bush by 21 points in the latest Los Angeles Times poll of
Republican voters in California, the nation's most-populous state,
and Bush also holds double-digit leads in Maryland, Missouri and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Bush's campaign looked wobbly. Now he has regained
the initiative, and he said he felt a spring in his step Wednesday
morning as he began campaigning in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's biggest problem is his inability to shake Bush's hold
on Republican loyalists, whose votes will decide the allocation of
New York and California delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Washington primary tells me,'' said David Olsen, a
political science professor at the University of Washington, ``is
that Bush has done what he needed to firm up his base, but the cost
may be the election in November. Bush had to move so far to the
right he may have trouble getting back to the center in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bush is having problems in attracting crossover votes,
which he would need to beat the Democrats. But he has months to try
to overcome that shortcoming; McCain has only a week left to woo
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like neither Bush nor McCain made much headway here
on the other guy's turf,'' said Stuart Elway, an independent
pollster in Seattle. ``It was the same old stalemate that we have
seen in the other states.''
</P>
<P>
   In the popularity contest in Washington, which was open both to
Republicans and to independents, Bush led McCain by only 9,000
votes, with more than 200,000 absentee ballots still to be tallied.
But among Republicans, whose votes were the only ones counted in
selecting delegates, Bush trounced his rival, 58 percent to 38
percent, gaining 7 of the 12 delegates at stake. McCain took 5.
Twenty-five more will be named in caucuses next week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made his strongest showing in King County (Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   The Washington system is similar to that in California, where
some politicians have suggested that McCain will do well in the
popularity contest while Bush gets most of the 162 delegates, the
largest bloc at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota uses a caucus system, and the turnout was small on
a frosty night. But Bush thoroughly trounced the field, beating
McCain by 76 percent to 19 percent and taking 14 delegates to 4 for
McCain and 1 for Alan Keyes, the former State Department aide who
has hung on doggedly.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia as in Washington, it was the Republicans who
propelled Bush to victory, which gave him a fat packet of 56
delegates. McCain prevailed among Democrats in the Old Dominion, 87
percent to 11, and among independents, 64 percent to 31. But
Republicans constituted more than 60 percent of the electorate in
the primary, and Bush took the votes of two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity was even more marked between voters who identified
themselves with the religious right, fully 80 percent of whom went
for Bush, and those who did not, who opted for McCain by a narrow
margin, 52 percent to 45 percent. McCain certainly did not help
himself, and may have damaged his chances, with his attack on Pat
Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the two Virginians who are
among the most prominent Christian conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When voters were asked, without any particular target specified,
whether McCain had made unfair attacks, almost half said he had,
and Bush won the votes of three-quarters of them. Only a third said
Bush had made unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The figures on the religious right came from an exit poll by a
consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press. No
comparable figures were available for Washington, where no such
poll was taken. So it is difficult to judge what effect, if any,
McCain's harsh criticism will have in the big Northern industrial
states with no particular affinity for the religious right whose
primaries are scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain raised the stakes in Virginia by spending heavily in its
most expensive media market, the Washington suburbs, and making
several campaign stops in the state. From that perspective, his
showing was a disappointment, and Gov. James S. Gilmore III, who
backed Bush, gloated that McCain's campaign bus, the Straight Talk
Express, ``ran out of gas in Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the entire Republican establishment arrayed against
him, and with a very late start in organization, McCain made a
contest of it. He lost by 9 percentage points, considerably less
than the polls had suggested, and he did very well in Norfolk,
Virginia Beach and the rest of the Hampton Roads area, where
several vast military installations are situated. He carried
Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, and the
Virginia suburbs of Washington, including Arlington, Alexandria and
Fairfax County.
</P>
<P>
   That was not enough, though, in the face of huge Bush majorities
in the suburban Richmond counties of Henrico and Chesterfield.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is a must-win state for the Republicans in November,
and one party leader here said on Tuesday night: ``Clinton lost the
state by only a couple of points four years ago. I worry that if
McCain and Bush keep battering each other, the way Reagan and Ford
did in 1976, the result will be the same. They let Jimmy Carter in,
and these guys may end up electing Al Gore.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley had just finished a talk
on gun control at a San Francisco hospital when he looked into his
audience and said, ``If you'd like to ask any questions, I'd be
pleased to answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Pamela Tam, a reporter for KPIX, the San Francisco
affiliate for CBS, piped up from the rear of the crowd: What was
his reaction to the shooting of a first-grade girl by a classmate
in Michigan that morning? But Bradley quickly cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he said, ``We were going to do the people.'' But
midsentence, he caught himself and relented. ``Go ahead,'' he
continued. ``You didn't know the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules,'' as Bradley's campaign has unofficially sought to
define them, go something like this: Voters get to ask lots of
questions at almost every event, almost every day. Reporters must
wait for news conferences. In a busy week, there will be four of
them. Sometimes fewer. And all tend to be short. (Fifteen minutes
or less.)
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, for instance, Bradley answered Tam's
questions, and took a follow-up. But then he fielded several
questions from his audience on issues like health policy and police
brutality, giving long, detailed answers. Then he left, without
taking any more questions from the 20 or so reporters in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Again Wednesday, Bradley spent nearly half an hour answering
questions from voters at a health clinic in a Latino section of Los
Angeles. Afterward, his news conference with reporters lasted less
than 10 minutes, time enough to answer four questions.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bradley is avoiding reporters. Indeed,
he has spent a large chunk of each day recently doing interviews
with local news organizations as he tries to spread his message to
the 16 states that hold Democratic primaries and caucuses on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he devotes relatively little time to schmoozing with the
press crew assigned to trail him every day. Though he can be
playful with certain reporters and photographers _ knocking their
pads out of their hands, tossing basketballs at them, nodding to
them in crowds _ he rarely strikes up conversations with them
between events.
</P>
<P>
   And on his charter airplanes, Bradley sits in the front, where
he can be seen poring through files and briefing books, while the
reporters stay in the rear. On occasion, Bradley will stroll back
to chat, off-the-record. But that happens almost exclusively when
the restroom is in the tail section.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reporters sometimes shout questions at him as he
enters events or shakes hands with voters afterward. But he will
not always answer, and he can be terse or testy when he does.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the New Hampshire primary in February, for
instance, Bradley was visibly annoyed with a throng of reporters
who clung around him as he tried to greet voters. He muttered
one-word answers to their questions and then canceled a visit to
another polling station out of concerns that the cameras and
reporters were angering voters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Los Angeles last month, Bradley was shaking hands and
signing autographs in a crowd of middle school students when a
television reporter tossed him the kind of feather-pillow question
most politicians practically beg to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   What did the endorsement of Michael Jordan, just announced that
morning, mean for Bradley's campaign, the reporter shouted through
a crowd of teen-agers. Another politician might have delivered a
breathlessly exuberant sound bite ready-made for the 5 o'clock
news. But Bradley could barely hide his irritation with the
reporter's intrusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a big help,'' he said, then moved on.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they took an old woman in Texas from her cell on a
gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her
instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in
Europe _ were agitated.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about
the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't do any good. They don't take much notice of what
the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over
here. There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though
it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor
George W. Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems
to so enjoy its executions. After all, the man was obeying the laws
of Texas, which were made before he entered government.
</P>
<P>
   He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just
as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas.
Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to
him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
And there isn't much doubt that Mrs. Beets was guilty of the crime
she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best
exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life
was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by
killing an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical
politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or
the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades
ago. It's as well to be clear about why it is so. The taking of
life itself is not always wrong, after all.
</P>
<P>
   We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend
ourselves, for instance. And we expect others to do it on our
behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to
achieve some greater good.
</P>
<P>
   But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to
involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal.
Anything else is lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such
good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to
post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill. It is a
commandment. It really is set in stone, and you had better have
some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops
killing. In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades
after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining
again.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statistical relationship. Any consideration of the
rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what
is at stake here is simple retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is no consideration. Indeed the legal process
permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process
that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course. But it
has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the
legal slums.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to
call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the
death penalty. Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been
released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have
drawn interest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people have died. How many of them were innocent?
Now that they are dead, will we ever know?
</P>
<P>
   This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla
Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually
discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words
that have been frequently quoted since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation,
``don't kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't
blame him for the explosion of state killing. The point is that for
governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a
life has become just too easy.
</P>
<P>
   They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the
governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper
come across their desks. No one in high office questions it: that
would be too hard.
</P>
<P>
   One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however.
Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment
because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had
ended with the conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it
is growing in intensity.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the argument; it's over now. Betty Lou Beets is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone
there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and
Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And
America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ From the moment the alarm rings in the morning, it is
all a blur. One cup of coffee, then pack the lunches, dress the
children, wolf a piece of toast, race to school in the rain, belt
to the station.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful respite, albeit in the company of hundreds of other
harassed commuters, reading some documents or the newspaper. Then a
sprint to the desk at the other end, plunging straight into eight
or nine or ten hours of work with no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then home as fast as possible to take over the child care, to
the relief of partner or nanny. Finally, most professional days end
comatose in front of the TV, drink in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Is this you?
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of working life is one of the staples of dinner
party conversation: the long hours, having to take work home at the
weekends, the impossibility of escape from the demands of mobile
phone and pager.
</P>
<P>
   Many a person with a good and satisfying job is likely to feel
completely overburdened and harassed, unable to square the demands
of their work with the needs of their family, never mind having any
free time for themselves. The pace of life feels as though it is
growing ever-faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the face of it unrelated, such pressures are one
aspect of the demographic problem suffered by most industrialized
economies.
</P>
<P>
   All have an aging population due to lower birthrates in recent
decades. The ratio of the elderly to the working-age population is
rising, very sharply in the case of countries like Germany, Italy
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the policy focus has concerned the fiscal problem this
implies. If the public sector is paying pensions though a
pay-as-you-go system, aging implies exploding government spending.
</P>
<P>
   And the policy prescriptions have consisted of measures to cap
this public spending, replacing it with private pension provision.
British governments tackled this early; the U.K. pension problem is
to ensure that low earners do not fall into poverty in their old
age.
</P>
<P>
   But is aging an economic problem in a broader sense? There is
some evidence that it is linked to slower productivity growth, but
even this is not necessarily a matter for concern when retirement
is seen as a positive choice for more leisure over more income.
</P>
<P>
   After all, older people could continue to work longer, yet the
average retirement age has been trending downwards for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development show that for the average OECD male with life
expectancy of 76 years, 38 years are now spent in the work force
and the rest in education, unemployment and, especially,
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The typical retirement component has climbed from a couple of
years in 1960 to more than a decade now.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for women is different, with 28 years of the
expected 80 spent in employment, decreased unemployment, and an
increase in retirement from less than 10 to more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect is that, on present trends, the share of the
population in work will peak at close to 50 percent some time
between now and 2005, and then as the postwar baby boom starts to
think longingly of leisurely days pottering in the garden, to
plummet to 41 percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is nothing innately bad, in an economic sense,
in mass gardening or line-dancing by the over-60s.
</P>
<P>
   But given the scale of the aging affecting the OECD economies,
and the nature of the intense pressures being felt by those
currently working, a blazingly obvious policy question is why on
earth do we have a tax and benefit system that encourages people to
take all their leisure when they are older, and none when it would
be most desirable to them, in the prime of life?
</P>
<P>
   After all, research conducted by the OECD's analysts shows that
on the whole people do not use their formal retirement to sail
around the world, visit the lost temples of the Incas or start a
new e-business from the spare room.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly they do more of the things they always used to do in
their leisure time anyway: watch TV, see family and friends, or
plant lobelias in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe bet that most people would rather spread their
leisure more evenly over their whole lifetimes, and not take it all
in the final 10-20 years. Peter Hicks, the OECD's aging expert,
says the existing institutional framework makes this financially
untenable, however.
</P>
<P>

do not have a free choice.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, tax systems favor saving for a pension in old age
far more than ordinary saving that can be spent at any time of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and benefit systems, employment rights and career status are
still firmly tied to the full-time breadwinner model, and tend to
militate against part-time work, so it can be hard to work
part-time for more years out of one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Many company pensions are linked to final salary, making them
far more generous for salarymen who slog away for ever-increasing
pay until they are past 55. &QL;

<P>
   Hicks says: ``Why should governments be funding retirement?'' A
tax system generous to savings might be a good idea for other
reasons, but it should be neutral about when people choose to spend
their savings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will always be a role for government in
ensuring that old people _ like younger ones _ have adequate
incomes. And there is a question of ensuring there are incentives
for people to save enough for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But making a special effort to create incentives for people to
stop working at 60 is sheer pensions madness.
</P>
<P>
   When will governments have the vision to lift their eyes above
the problem pensions pose for their budgets and tackle the crazy
structure of lifetime work incentives? &QL;

   LONDON _ From the moment the alarm rings in the morning, it is
all a blur. One cup of coffee, then pack the lunches, dress the
children, wolf a piece of toast, race to school in the rain, belt
to the station.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful respite, albeit in the company of hundreds of other
harassed commuters, reading some documents or the newspaper. Then a
sprint to the desk at the other end, plunging straight into eight
or nine or ten hours of work with no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then home as fast as possible to take over the child care, to
the relief of partner or nanny. Finally, most professional days end
comatose in front of the TV, drink in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Is this you?
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of working life is one of the staples of dinner
party conversation: the long hours, having to take work home at the
weekends, the impossibility of escape from the demands of mobile
phone and pager.
</P>
<P>
   Many a person with a good and satisfying job is likely to feel
completely overburdened and harassed, unable to square the demands
of their work with the needs of their family, never mind having any
free time for themselves. The pace of life feels as though it is
growing ever-faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the face of it unrelated, such pressures are one
aspect of the demographic problem suffered by most industrialized
economies.
</P>
<P>
   All have an aging population due to lower birthrates in recent
decades. The ratio of the elderly to the working-age population is
rising, very sharply in the case of countries like Germany, Italy
and Japan.

   LONDON _ People who use the Internet for as little as five hours
a week are less likely to talk to or visit their family and friends
and are in danger of shutting themselves off from society,
according to new research.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet expands so people can shop, chat with friends
and conduct business online, researchers from the Stanford
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in America have
found that the technology is having a damaging social impact even
when people use it in modest amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spent 5-10 hours a week online reported a 25 percent
fall in social activity _ spending less time talking on the phone
or face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Norman Nie, director of the Stanford Institute and his
colleague, Professor Lutz Erbring, have published preliminary
results from the biggest study yet into how the Internet is
changing daily life.
</P>
<P>
   They found that as people increasingly turned to the Internet
for their needs they were isolating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 60 percent of the time they spent online came from
watching less television, the rest was at the expense of seeing or
talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use the Internet at even modest amounts, of five or
10 hours a week, are reporting that they see fewer people, talk to
fewer people and go out less often. This merits concern,'' said
Professor Nie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 4,113 adults in nearly 3,000
households across America. More than half had Internet access and
one-quarter used the Internet for between five and 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   These people reported that since they had gone online they spent
8 percent less time attending social events, 13 percent less time
with family and friends and 26 percent less time talking to people
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Nie there is no doubt that people do form
strong relationships over the Internet but it is not the same as a
healthy social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't share a coffee or a beer with somebody on e-mail, or

FOLLOWING DAD'S PATH AS TRAINER HAS UPS, DOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Ted H. West was 10 years old, and already
planning a career as a trainer, the day the elder Ted West saddled
the tender-footed Interco to upset John Henry and Gato del Sol in
the 1984 Santa Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted to be a horse trainer, to follow in my
father's footsteps, but that's what sealed it,'' the son recalled
as he prepared Budroyale for Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap. ``I
thought, `If it's like this all the time, wouldn't that be great?'
I found out it isn't like that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So did I,'' his father chimed in with a rueful smile.
</P>
<P>
   Ted H. West was just out of Cal Poly Pomona, living on a
shoestring in the San Francisco Bay Area while caring for a couple
of his dad's horses, when Luthier Fever joined the West barn here
in time to finish second to Mr Purple in the 1996 Santa Anita
Handicap at 64-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the horse who got me out of the tack room at Bay
Meadows,'' said the son, who had been bedding down in the barn to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   After Luthier Fever's unlikely performance in the Big 'Cap, and
the younger Ted's success training those cheap horses up north,
things turned around for the struggling West barn, which grew from
eight horses to its present 30-something.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings the Wests to this week and the family's next
encounter with the Big 'Cap, the $1 million race that's been
pivotal in the lives of Edward Kenneth ``Ted'' West, 63, Edward
Harry ``Ted'' West, 26, and Mary Ellen West, the wife, mother and
barn bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Jeffrey Sengara's Budroyale would give the
7-year-old gelding his first Grade I win after tenacious seconds at
generous odds in the 1999 Hollywood Gold Cup and Breeders' Cup
Classic and establish the former $32,000 claimer the nation's
leading older horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the victory that kind of puts him over the top
with the fans,'' Ted. H. said. ``They can start to compare him to
(popular geldings) John Henry and Best Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a victory over horses trained by D. Wayne Lukas (Cat
Thief), Bob Baffert (General Challenge), Paco Gonzalez (Bagshot)
and Richard Mandella (Malek, Puerto Madero) would be a feather in
the cap of young Ted H., the titular head of the barn since last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much that helps a trainer more than winning a race
like that,'' said his father, himself the son of a trainer, the old
Caliente fixture Harry West.
</P>
<P>
   Ted H. took over as trainer of record while his dad served a
90-day suspension after eight horses, including Budroyale, tested
positive for clenbuterol in 1998. The barn continued to win, and so
the horses have remained in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The two men say they actually share an equal training
partnership - ``two Teds are better than one,'' Ted H. deadpanned -
and say Mary Ellen, responsible for the barn's unusually intricate
feeding, vitamin and supplement program, is the unsung heroine.
</P>
<P>
   To some it appears the son had a free pass to the winner's
circle, becoming trainer of record for a ready-made barn. Mary
Ellen answers that, saying that when he was living in the tack
room, she told her boy: ``Nobody will ever be able to say it was
easy (for you).''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for the senior West either.
</P>
<P>
   --After foot problems forced Interco's retirement in 1984, West
didn't win another major race until Stocks Up won the 1988
Hollywood Starlet. The deaths of owners George Warwick and George
Shahood shrank his barn.
</P>
<P>
   --After the 1992 death of Interwit, a promising son of Interco
whom West trained and co-owned, an arbitrator ordered West and the
other owners to pay $60,000 to the owners of another horse who died
in the same grisly accident at Hollywood Park. It included $45,000
that Pat Valenzuela would have had to pay if the jockey hadn't
declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   --After the arrival of Luthier Fever, whose Mexico City-based
owners had a falling out with trainer Gary Jones, the barn's savior
turned into a headache when the owners moved him to Eduardo Inda's
barn in order to run in the Pacific Classic against West's advice.
When Luthier Fever became the only horse to start in the Big 'Cap,
Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic that year and earned a
$500,000 bonus, West had to take the owners to the track stewards
to collect his $43,000 share.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 90-day suspension last year was the result of bad
luck or misbehavior is subject to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of clenbuterol in the United States had recently been
approved. The bronchial dilator was OK'd for use in training but
not in racing. West maintained his horses - and nearly a dozen
other trainers' - tested positive because California authorities
failed to tell them how close to race day the drug could be
administered without risking detection.
</P>
<P>
   Sengara is fighting to hold onto the purse for Budroyale's
tainted victory in the June 13, 1998 Super Diamond Handicap at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the elder West said, the family doesn't use clenbuterol
because ``I don't want to take a chance of having another
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sense of the word, a positive came out of the
suspension. Ted and Mary Ellen traveled extensively for the first
time in their 28-year marriage. And Ted H. proved himself a good
fit in his father's footsteps.

   LONDON _ People who use the Internet for as little as five hours
a week are less likely to talk to or visit their family and friends
and are in danger of shutting themselves off from society,
according to new research.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet expands so people can shop, chat with friends
and conduct business online, researchers from the Stanford
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in America have
found that the technology is having a damaging social impact even
when people use it in modest amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spent 5-10 hours a week online reported a 25 percent
fall in social activity _ spending less time talking on the phone
or face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Norman Nie, director of the Stanford Institute and his
colleague, Professor Lutz Erbring, have published preliminary
results from the biggest study yet into how the Internet is
changing daily life.
</P>
<P>
   They found that as people increasingly turned to the Internet
for their needs they were isolating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 60 percent of the time they spent online came from
watching less television, the rest was at the expense of seeing or
talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use the Internet at even modest amounts, of five or
10 hours a week, are reporting that they see fewer people, talk to
fewer people and go out less often. This merits concern,'' said
Professor Nie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 4,113 adults in nearly 3,000
households across America. More than half had Internet access and
one-quarter used the Internet for between five and 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   These people reported that since they had gone online they spent
8 percent less time attending social events, 13 percent less time
with family and friends and 26 percent less time talking to people
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Nie there is no doubt that people do form
strong relationships over the Internet but it is not the same as a
healthy social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't share a coffee or a beer with somebody on e-mail, or
give them a hug,'' he said. &QL;

TROJANS LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ When USC coach Henry Bibby looks at tonight's
opponent, Stanford, he sees more than the No.1-ranked team in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby also sees a team with leadership, something he feels the
Trojans have lacked at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a legitimate leader in Mark Madsen, who demands they
play hard on every possession,'' Bibby said. ``Once you get a
leader, you can go wherever you want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Trojans have that leader?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' Bibby said. ``We really don't have that leader
that steps up. Jarvis Turner has at times, Brian Scalabrine has at
times, Brandon Granville has at times, but we don't have that
consistent leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have one guy who says, `Enough of this nonsense, if
you're not on board, get off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: This week's commitment from 6-foot-5 guard
Travis Hanour of Laguna Beach High secured the Trojans their No. 1
priority of the spring signing period. He is projected to play
point guard, shooting guard and small forward next season after
averaging 25.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 5.4 assists for the
Artists. Hanour also shot 40 percent on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some comparisons with (Stanford guard) Casey
Jacobsen,'' Laguna Beach coach Bret Fleming said. ``You don't see a
lot of kids his size with point guard skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Utah coaches were reportedly upset this week that
Hanour committed early and canceled recruiting trips to their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans might also sign his teammate, 6-9 forward Chris
Manker, although no decision has been made. He would likely
redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Manker is scheduled to visit Colorado State, Oregon State and
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   There were erroneous reports that Compton Centennial forward
Ellis Myles might commit soon, but USC has not offered him a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame decision: Forward Sam Clancy (broken foot) is still
scheduled to make a decision before tonight's game to see if he can
play. Clancy has been out since Jan.20, but will definitely play
Saturday against Cal if he cannot go tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine shines: Scalabrine is making a case for the
Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Year award, although his
chances obviously have been hurt by the team's recent slide.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine is averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and shooting
55 percent from the field in Pac-10 games. He has set a new
career-high in two of his past four games, and scored 100 points in
the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently second in the conference in scoring, fifth in
field-goal percentage and 13th in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a candidate, but I don't know how it will work
out,'' Scalabrine said. ``There's a lot of good players who are on
the top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Bibby is backing Scalabrine as player of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's had that type of year. If we can finish on a
solid note, he can get that,'' Bibby said. ``In my estimation, he's
the best player in the Pac-10. Before he got hurt, I thought Sam
Clancy was the best player. That's why we were 6-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review: Although Scalabrine appeared to merely trip
on his own when he fell going for an inbounds pass with seven
seconds left in the 80-77 loss to Oregon, the game film revealed he
actually tripped on forward David Bluthenthal's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal was wide open on the play, but Granville threw the
ball toward Scalabrine, who tripped, which allowed Oregon to regain
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wide open,'' Bluthenthal said. ``There was no one around
me.''

 By HAMISH MCRAE  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is, as someone else said in a rather different
context, a funny old world.
</P>
<P>
   Two global corporate titans, Ford and Unilever, announced
recently that they are getting rid of thousands of their workers.
But we are undoubtedly going to go on needing Unilever's detergent
powder, shampoo and frozen peas, and we will certainly be driving
around in Ford cars for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy may be out of fashion, but we still need the
things it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the shares of companies like Nokia and Freeserve
continue to dazzle. Yet in another 30 years' time the Internet is
going to be so utterly different that the companies involved in it
may not even exist.
</P>
<P>
   And while I do think we will still be making mobile phone calls,
surely there won't be much added value in transporting electronic
signals across the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, we all could manage without high-speed Internet
access, but most of us would find it tough to manage without
shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   For personal investors this commonsense approach clearly rings
true. There is a new boom in people investing online, but despite
the fact that the dealing is done over the Internet, apparently
most of the funds are going into old economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the professionals in the financial markets, though,
high-technology is the only thing that matters. Were it not for a
couple of sectors such as mobile communications and any form of
Internet-related business, we would be in a bear market, with
shares of the old-economy companies plunging almost by the day.
</P>
<P>
   So the professionals have, so far at least, been right. But has
the world gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the investment experts in London's City and the other
financial centers can produce sound arguments to justify this twist
in share prices, reasons why those of the old economy should plunge
and those of the new should soar. They are very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   But all people, however highly paid, make errors of judgment. In
the 1980s most of the professionals assumed that the Japanese
economy would continue to conquer and that America's was set for
inevitable decline. Now we know that both ideas were rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   So will the current adulation of the new economy look equally
daft 10 years from now? The answer, I think, is no and yes.
</P>
<P>
   No, because the whole world economy will be transformed in a way
that none of us have experienced in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, as it happens, is Henry Ford's invention of
the production line. This popularized the car, turning it from an
elite item into a mass consumer one.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a similar transformation to take place as a result of the
telecommunications revolution. Just as the production line brought
costs down and improved quality, expect a similar change as a
result of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is that squeeze on both prices and costs that is spooking the
shares of the companies in the old economy. Yes, we will go on
shopping in supermarkets, but we will be able to compare prices
between them at a click of the mouse. So they have to cut their
margins. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But these companies do have a way of fighting back, which is to
use the same technology to cut their own costs.
</P>
<P>
   We think of communications revolution as chatting to our friends
on a mobile or sending e-mails. But the same technology is being
used by companies to crunch their production chains. Ordering and
paying for components becomes automatic.
</P>
<P>
   An example. A few weeks ago the first generation of hi-tech
refrigerators were rolled out. Apparently they remember if you are
running out of, say, milk, and will order more _ over a mini-mobile
phone _ from the supermarket, so that the next delivery will
include the appropriate number of cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though our stock control at home leaves a great deal to be
desired, I cannot imagine anything I would like less than have the
fridge deciding what to buy from the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are making shampoo it would presumably be great if
the machine always made sure it has the appropriate amount of raw
materials. So the Tescos, Unilevers and Fords of the world will
spend the next 10 years using this new technology to squeeze down
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary, but it is quite plausible that 10 years from now
the price we pay for goods will be five percentage points lower
than it would otherwise be, simply as a result of the new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But we are not going to wash our hair more often or eat more
frozen peas, so volumes will not rise much. It is tough to run a
business in a world where prices come down and volumes don't rise.
The old economy will be a cold economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   On the other hand we will make more mobile phone calls _ and
even if we don't, our children will.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, all the old-economy companies will have to buy
expensive communications kit to upgrade their offices and
factories. The companies that develop these, the new economy
companies, will duly flourish.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage even these new technologies will become
commonplace. Instead of being the hottest product in town, the
Web-enabled mobile phone will become just another thing we all
have, like a color television.
</P>
<P>
   But there is perhaps another 20 or 30 years before that happens.
Meanwhile the boom will continue.
</P>
<P>
   So it is easy to understand the adulation of the new economy,
and the concern about the old one. But at the same time, might this
adulation appear daft a decade from now? Because it has gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long history of markets (and remember that markets
are just a collection of individuals) getting carried away with
themselves when a new technology bursts out. There were successive
railway booms in the last century. There was a radio boom in the
U.S. in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   During such booms people correctly identify the growth potential
of the new technology, but they price it wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, mobile phone penetration in Britain will rise from 50
percent this year to 80 percent in 2003. But maybe we won't all
change our phones every 18 months as we do now. Maybe phone charges
will plunge so much that while we will talk more, we will pay less
for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the potential of high-technology firms will be
reassessed and, who knows, maybe even the new dot.com companies
will have to make a profit. &QL;

ARENA LEAGUE SEASON IS ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Arena Football League players agreed to form
an organizing committee to settle their labor dispute with owners,
which effectively means the season will not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Angeles, the result is the expansion L.A. Avengers will
start their inaugural season as planned April 9 against the
Oklahoma Wranglers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The season was temporarily canceled last week by the owners,
after the players could not agree to work out labor problems under
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   A group of players had filed an antitrust lawsuit in a Newark,
N.J., district court on Feb.3, seeking a chance to market their
services through free agency. But league owners said they would not
negotiate with the players with a lawsuit pending.
</P>
<P>
   The players decided by vote, however, to form a collective
bargaining organization this week, according to George LaFrance,
who plays for the Tampa Bay Storm and is a representative on the
players' organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys weighed the differences,'' LaFrance said Wednesday by
telephone from Detroit. ``They saw more advantages to the
collective- bargaining agreement than to the lawsuit. The majority
of players feel that's the best way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those players is former Cal quarterback Justin Vedder,
who has signed with the Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get on the field and make this happen in
L.A.,'' Vedder said. ``This was a good business decision. It's good
for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and players will immediately begin negotiating an
interim collective bargaining agreement for the 2000 season.
According to the league, the lawsuit and NRLB complaint will
continue to wind their way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get resolved, nobody knows,'' said league deputy
commissioner Ronald Kurpiers.
</P>
<P>
   League commissioner David Baker was eager to see the season
proceed as scheduled, particularly for the fledging Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a brief interruption but we're moving
forward,'' Baker said. ``L.A. is a special market. I don't expect
it to be successful immediately but this is a great day for Arena
Football and the L.A. Avengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said an expansion draft involving the Avengers will take
place early next week. Training camps open March 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers, who have sold more than 4,000 season tickers, have
had a schedule change, because the AFL's Detroit franchise has shut
down operations. That means a June 23 game against Detroit, will
now be played against the Houston ThunderBears at the Compaq
Center.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is, as someone else said in a rather different
context, a funny old world.
</P>
<P>
   Two global corporate titans, Ford and Unilever, announced
recently that they are getting rid of thousands of their workers.
But we are undoubtedly going to go on needing Unilever's detergent
powder, shampoo and frozen peas, and we will certainly be driving
around in Ford cars for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy may be out of fashion, but we still need the
things it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the shares of companies like Nokia and Freeserve
continue to dazzle. Yet in another 30 years' time the Internet is
going to be so utterly different that the companies involved in it
may not even exist.
</P>
<P>
   And while I do think we will still be making mobile phone calls,
surely there won't be much added value in transporting electronic
signals across the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, we all could manage without high-speed Internet
access, but most of us would find it tough to manage without
shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   For personal investors this commonsense approach clearly rings
true. There is a new boom in people investing online, but despite
the fact that the dealing is done over the Internet, apparently
most of the funds are going into old economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the professionals in the financial markets, though,
high-technology is the only thing that matters. Were it not for a
couple of sectors such as mobile communications and any form of
Internet-related business, we would be in a bear market, with
shares of the old-economy companies plunging almost by the day.
</P>
<P>
   So the professionals have, so far at least, been right. But has
the world gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the investment experts in London's City and the other
financial centers can produce sound arguments to justify this twist
in share prices, reasons why those of the old economy should plunge
and those of the new should soar. They are very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   But all people, however highly paid, make errors of judgment. In
the 1980s most of the professionals assumed that the Japanese
economy would continue to conquer and that America's was set for
inevitable decline. Now we know that both ideas were rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   So will the current adulation of the new economy look equally
daft 10 years from now? The answer, I think, is no and yes.
</P>
<P>
   No, because the whole world economy will be transformed in a way
that none of us have experienced in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, as it happens, is Henry Ford's invention of
the production line. This popularized the car, turning it from an
elite item into a mass consumer one.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a similar transformation to take place as a result of the
telecommunications revolution. Just as the production line brought
costs down and improved quality, expect a similar change as a
result of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is that squeeze on both prices and costs that is spooking the
shares of the companies in the old economy. Yes, we will go on
shopping in supermarkets, but we will be able to compare prices
between them at a click of the mouse. So they have to cut their
margins. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But these companies do have a way of fighting back, which is to
use the same technology to cut their own costs.
</P>
<P>
   We think of communications revolution as chatting to our friends
on a mobile or sending e-mails. But the same technology is being
used by companies to crunch their production chains. Ordering and
paying for components becomes automatic.
</P>
<P>
   An example. A few weeks ago the first generation of hi-tech
refrigerators were rolled out. Apparently they remember if you are
running out of, say, milk, and will order more _ over a mini-mobile
phone _ from the supermarket, so that the next delivery will
include the appropriate number of cartons.

TV RIVALS EXTEND DEADLINE BY 24 HOURS IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN HODGES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The local ABC affiliate and Time Warner Cable on
Wednesday extended by 24 hours their deadline for reaching a new
retransmission agreement, keeping the station on the cable system
until midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no day-by-day extension _ the one we granted
ends at midnight, and we won't change that,'' said KTRK-Channel 13
president/general manager Henry Florsheim.
</P>
<P>
   When KTRK is pulled off the cable, what Time Warner's 680,000
Houston subscribers will see on that channel is the cable company's
explanation of why the ABC station is not being carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``After midnight (tonight) the ball is in their court,'' said
Ron McMillan, president of Time Warner-Houston Division. ``Every
other (ABC) market is getting 30 days more. Only in Houston are we
getting one day. Disney has chosen to make an example out of
Houston for the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, Time Warner will put a ``free'' sample of its
premium channel, HBO Family, on the cable spot until the dispute is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   KTRK countered that it will give the first 1,500 Time Warner
subscribers to switch to satellite dish a $99 rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's one-day delay came after Disney/ABC extended by a
day its own deadline to pull its station from the cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's delay prompted a letter from Fred M. Dressler, Time
Warner's corporate negotiator, to Bob Iger, president/CEO of The
Walt Disney Co., saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that you saw fit to extend the retransmission
consent for almost all your ABC stations. We are sorry you have
chosen to punish the people of Houston because you are dissatisfied
with the terms of an agreement your representative agreed to with
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to lose ABC in Houston for even one minute, and
we are willing to take any extension ... while our negotiations
continue,'' Dressler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have offered several solutions to this dilemma. However, we
cannot capitulate to this heavy-handed approach to negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said Dressler, senior vice president of programming, is
continuing to negotiate by phone with Anne Sweeney, president of
Disney/ABC Cable Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are in progress, contrary to what ABC local
management continues to say,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 13's Florsheim denied negotiations are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one call between Dressler and Sweeney Tuesday, and
it lasted minutes. There were no negotiations,'' he said. ``And
there were none (Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Disney/ABC has been negotiating its 10-year
retransmission agreements for stations it owns in Houston, New
York, Los Angeles and other cities, representing 3.5 million Time
Warner subscribers. In all those other cities, ABC has given a
30-day extension.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner claims that Disney reneged on an original verbal
agreement to put the Disney Channel on basic cable in Houston,
where most Time Warner subscribers are paying extra for it. The
deal would have added the two new Disney cable channels, Toon
Disney and SoapNet, a soap opera channel.
</P>
<P>
   However, McMillan said, ``the company changed its mind and asked
for an additional $100 million, which we are not prepared to pay or
to pass on to our subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim disputed that, too: ``There is no deal, and there
never was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that they are the 800-pound gorilla that owns
75 percent of the cable in Houston, and as a producer of product we
are very concerned about getting our product on cable,'' he said.
``What this is all about, is our inability to get Time Warner to
talk to us. Right now we are not talking, and we cannot reach a
deal without talking. The only way to get them to talk is, there's
got to be a line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, they're putting their own paid channel on Channel 13,
the most-used channel on the system,'' he added. ``If they are
going to give a preferential position to some of their own product,
we object to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The city grants cable franchises, but has no jurisdiction in
this dispute because it cannot get involved in programming.
</P>
<P>
   But City Councilman Carroll Robinson, chairman of the city's
Transportation, Technology and Infra-Structure Committee, wrote
McMillan and Florsheim on Wednesday, asking them to sit down and
talk with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome his help,'' said McMillan. ``This type of dispute
is exactly what the cable industry tried to tell Congress would
happen under the 1992 Cable Act.``
</P>
<P>
   He said ``four to five hundred'' callers had requested the free
antenna kits to pick up broadcasts of KTRK and many more such
requests are expected Friday.
</P>
<P>
   KTRK-TV also has had hundreds of calls from viewers asking what
they can do, Florsheim said. The channel is telling them ``to call
Time Warner and ask them to get back to the negotiating table,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 rebates KTRK is offering are for satellite dishes and
receivers for DirecTV. The satellite company will offer free
standard installation to consumers who sign up by May 5. DirecTV
will also offer Houston subscribers a free local channel purchase _
which usually is an added charge of $5.99 a month _ until April 2.
DirecTV's subscription rates are comparable to cable's.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DirecTV added KHOU-Channel 11 to its satellite
lineup, which now includes the four biggest network affiliates _
KTRK-Channel 13 (ABC), KPRC-Channel 2 (NBC) and KRIV-Channel 26
(Fox). No other local channels are available on satellite. PBS is
offered as a national feed, rather than Houston's KUHT-Channel 8.

PEPPERDINE CONTROLS DESTINY AT WCC TOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The easiest thing for Pepperdine to do is win the
West Coast Conference tournament, which starts this weekend, get
the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, then sit back and let the
other bubble teams worry about their future.
</P>
<P>
   If the top-seeded Waves, who open Saturday against Loyola
Marymount at Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion, go on to win the WCC
tournament championship Monday, they're guaranteed a spot in the
Big Dance. If they slip, their fate rests with the NCAA selection
committee, were nothing is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pepperdine (22-7) has a tournament-friendly win total,
an RPI rating in the 40s and the regular-season WCC crown, the
Waves don't want to leave anything to chance.
</P>
<P>
   The key for Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff is getting that
message across without suffocating his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a balance there,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``You
don't want to tell them on the first day that if you win, you go,
but if you lose, there's no chance. We'll do what we've been doing,
and that's to let things play out and take it one game at a time.
The fact is we need to win three games in three days, and we feel
like we are capable of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine ended the regular season with a 71-42 win at St.
Mary's, two days after a discouraging loss to San Diego, only its
second setback over the previous 14 games. Going into the St.
Mary's game, the Waves knew they were the WCC regular-season
champions, thanks to Gonzaga's loss to Santa Clara the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine could have coasted at that point, knowing a loss to
the Gaels would not affect their status. Instead they played one of
their best games of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the sign of a good team,'' van Breda Kolff
said. ``We talked about not being satisfied and the importance of
going out there and playing well, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping down the roar: If everything goes according to plan,
Pepperdine should easily get past Loyola Marymount in the first
round. The Lions have lost 14 games in a row, haven't beaten a
Division I-A team all year and will lose coach Charles Bradley, who
announced his resignation last week, at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley rarely talks to the media, but assistant Ronnie Stubbs
said the Lions are making the most of a difficult situation.
Players still show up to practice and coaches still teach, even
though no one is sure where they'll be after Saturday.
</P>
<P>

LAWMAKERS QUESTION CLAIM THAT OIL PRICES WILL DROP SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn, Calif., N.Y., Ill., Mass.)   (Subs for rewriting throughout)

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson withstood a
grilling from lawmakers over high oil prices Wednesday, as
legislators scorned his cautious forecast that oil-exporting
countries would increase production later this month and end a
year-long steep hike in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, testifying before the House International Relations
Committee, rejected calls from lawmakers to quickly draw down
emergency government oil stocks, a move that advocates say would
lower prices. He said, however, as President Clinton did on
Tuesday, that that option was still ``on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   With the price of oil nearly tripled, to $31.77 a barrel in the
last year, and with drivers facing $2-a-gallon prices at the
gasoline pump this summer, the administration is under increasing
pressure to dip into the 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum
Reserve in Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson repeatedly urged patience while talks continued
with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other
important producers like Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be prudent and not overreact,'' he said, pointing
out that the emergency stocks were meant to be used only when
national fuel supplies were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guardedly optimistic that OPEC will increase production
when it meets on March 27,'' Richardson said. He noted that the
Mexican oil minister said Wednesday in Paris that he favored a
production increase. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela are also
considering increases.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is considering increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million
barrels a day, an about-face from production cuts of 4.3 million a
day that began in 1998 after the financial collapse in Asia. The
cartel now produces about 26 million barrels a day, or 35 percent
of the world's oil production.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, especially those from the Northeast, Midwest and
California, dismissed the encouraging statements that Richardson
had elicited in talks with oil officials from Kuwait, Mexico,
Norway, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on a weeklong trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, you came back with nothing,'' said Rep. Donald A.
Manzullo, R-Ill. ``You got no promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman, I came back with quite a bit,'' Richardson, a
former Democratic representative from New Mexico, replied. ``Thirty
days ago, OPEC was saying its production cuts would continue. Now,
key members are saying they'll consider increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC votes to raise output at its March meeting, the big
questions are when and by how much. Typically, it takes six weeks
for production in the Middle East to pass through refineries and
reach local gas stations. ``We're running out of time,'' said Rep.
William Delahunt, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats and Republicans expressed frustration that
Richardson apparently did not use at least the threat of tapping
the strategic reserves to wring concessions from oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on God's green earth didn't you add to your leverage by
opening that spigot?'' demanded Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut,
the panel's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve means
intervening and manipulating the market,'' responded Richardson,
who said earlier that the negotiations were meant to ``convince,
not coerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes sense,'' he said, ``is to let the results of our
energy diplomacy work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson retorted: ``This isn't the marketplace at work. This
is OPEC flexing its muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers, like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R.-Calif.,
criticized Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for cutting back output and
driving up prices at a time when U.S.troops are protecting those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we keep troops in these countries when they're part of
an international price-fixing conspiracy to shaft the people of the
United States?'' Rohrabacher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why has the administration sat idly by?'' asked Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., who heads the committee. Gilman announced that he
would introduce legislation this week that would bar military aid
to any oil-exporting country involved in price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   As he fended off verbal volleys from the legislators, Richardson
underscored efforts that the administration took in recent weeks to
soften the blow of soaring fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for instance, Clinton said he would order that the
remaining $125 million in a low-income home energy assistance
program be made immediately available. That is on top of $200
million already released. Clinton said he would ask Congress for
$600 million in additional emergency funds for states hardest hit
by the winter cold.

MIXED REACTION IN NEW YORK TO REDUCTION IN ROCKER SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID KOEPPEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news that an arbitrator had decided to reduce the
suspension of Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker drew mixed
reactions from baseball fans around New York City Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some expressed disappointment and anger, others criticized
Commissioner Bud Selig's initial decision to suspend Rocker as a
violation of his freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to the incident several years ago when the former
Oriole Roberto Alomar spit on a major league umpire, calling it a
more serious offense. Alomar was suspended for just five games,
though that penalty was levied not by Selig but by Gene Budig, who
was then the American League president.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator, Shyam Das, cut Rocker's regular-season ban from
28 days to 14, and cut his fine from $20,000 to $500. He also said
Rocker could begin spring training immediately.
</P>
<P>
   George Evertz, 29, of Brooklyn, condemned the decision and said
baseball should have taken an even harder line and suspended Rocker
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sending the message that this is what happens to
someone who fans the flames of hatred,'' said Evertz, who works for
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``If they just kicked
him out, that would send the right message to anyone else who wants
to spew this garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Evertz predicted that if Rocker did not open his mouth again
this season, the incident would eventually be forgotten by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   But Andre Stewart, 36, a security guard who works at the South
Street Seaport, believes that Rocker will be tagged permanently as
a racist by his teammates and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed by this decision; they should have kicked him
out for the whole season,'' he said. ``These athletes have legions
of fans, they have to be careful what they say. He only apologized
under pressure, he just threw something out there for the fans to
believe and they didn't buy it. He's going to get really booed.
Especially in New York, fans are going to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sullivan, a 33-year-old bartender in Lower Manhattan, said
he disliked Rocker as a person but defended his right to say what
he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Mets fan, so I really hate him,'' said Sullivan, a Bronx
resident. ``What he said was really stupid, but there's no law
against being stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``His real punishment will come from the other players and fans.
He's going to get his due. This is going to stay with him his whole
career.'' &QL;

ROCKER'S SUSPENSION CUT BACK BY ARBITRATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES, additions thruout) 
 (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's arbitrator slashed by about two-thirds Wednesday
Commissioner Bud Selig's suspension of John Rocker, the Atlanta
Braves pitcher, who in a magazine interview disparaged foreigners,
gays and members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of missing all 45 days of spring training, Rocker will
be permitted to join the Braves at their Lake Buena Vista, Fla.,
camp, which he is expected to do Thursday. Instead of missing the
first four weeks of the season and 24 games, he will sit out only
the first two weeks and 12 games. Rocker, a 25-year-old closer, has
missed 13 days of spring training, so the arbitrator, Shyam Das, in
effect, reduced the suspension from 73 days to 27.
</P>
<P>
   Das also sliced the $20,000 fine Selig levied against Rocker to
$500, the maximum amount a commissioner may fine a player under the
best-interests-of-baseball provision in the major league rules.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was not happy with the ruling, but he was not the first
commissioner to have a suspension reduced or overturned by an
arbitrator. In fact, baseball's drug history is filled with similar
arbitration decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This ruling, at first glance, would seem to be a sharp rebuke to
Selig, but the players association, which had filed a grievance
challenging the commissioner's action, contended from the start
that the heavy suspension and fine were more for a public relations
effect. The penalty was levied, a union lawyer said, ``with an eye
toward the arbitration process.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who has vehemently denied that suggestion, said in a
statement Wednesday that the ruling ``does not reflect any
understanding of or sensitivity to the important social
responsibility'' that baseball has to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It completely ignores the sensibilities of those groups of
people maligned by Mr. Rocker and disregards the player's position
as a role model for children,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension was the first of its kind in the 30-year history
of baseball's impartial arbitration procedure. All previous
suspensions by commissioners involved drugs or on-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the setback, Selig gained one significant victory. By
allowing two weeks of the suspension to stand, Das found that the
commissioner had the authority to discipline a player for speech.
Das, on the other hand, obviously found the suspension too severe,
saying that Selig's action was ``without just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Das, who did not immediately issue a written opinion explaining
his ruling, let stand the requirement that Rocker participate in an
in-season program of diversity training. Under Selig's penalty,
Rocker, a premier reliever in the National League, was not losing
any salary. He signed a new contract on Tuesday that will probably
pay him about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's action against Rocker was undermined in part by
precedent, including a 1988 incident involving Bob Knepper, a
Houston Astros pitcher, who reacted to the prospect of a female
umpire getting a major league job. Knepper spoke disparagingly of
women generally, and specifically of the National Organization for
Women after it criticized him.
</P>
<P>
   Knepper was not disciplined and, in fact, Major League Baseball
officials said at the time that he was entitled to his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker expressed his opinion about an assortment of people in an
interview that appeared in a December issue of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Rocker, who feuded with New York fans last
season, said the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium was like riding
through Beirut. He described the subway ride as including ``some
kid with purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to
some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time next to some
20-year-old mom with four kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rocker complained about New York's ethnic
diversity, saying: ``I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. You can
walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking
English.''
</P>
<P>
   In suspending him Jan. 31, Selig said that Rocker's remarks
``offended practically every element of society and brought
dishonor to himself, the Atlanta Braves and Major League
Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association challenged the suspension and, as in
many drug cases of the past 20 years, gained a reduction, though
the union said it was disappointed that the arbitrator ``did not
accept all of our arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Howe, LaMarr Hoyt, Pascual Perez, Willie Wilson and
Ferguson Jenkins were among the players who had drug suspensions
shortened or overturned. Howe was suspended for life by
Commissioner Fay Vincent in June 1992, after another in a series of
drug incidents, but the following November an arbitrator ordered
him reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the success of Rocker's challenge to Selig's action
was the testimony of Scott Sanderson, a former major league
pitcher. Called as a witness Feb. 10 during the two-day hearing,
Sanderson talked about the importance of spring training to a major
league pitcher. Selig said Rocker could begin participating in
extended spring training with the Braves' minor league teams on
April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson said Wednesday that, among other things, he testified
about the significance of facing in exhibition games the caliber of
hitters a pitcher will see during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a pitcher's out there and you're facing competition you
know you're going to be facing during the season,'' Sanderson said
by telephone from Tucson, Ariz., ``you deal with the aspect of
adrenaline kicking in and what adrenaline will do to cause your
body to react in ways it otherwise wouldn't. You push yourself, and
your body reacts differently. If you don't have any of that in the
spring, the very first time you're called into a game and ask your
body to react, it can't the way you want it to. And you take a
chance on getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, Sanderson said, ``like to say it's just a game; all
they do is go out and throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But if you're going to excel and make a career,
there's a lot more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the suspension, the Braves' president, Stan
Kasten, called Rocker's remarks repugnant and unconscionable and
said Rocker would probably have been suspended indefinitely had he
made them during the season. Thursday, the Braves will have to find
a way to make Rocker a part of the team again. Randall Simon,
widely considered Rocker's intended target when he called one of
his teammates a ``fat monkey,'' said that if Rocker apologized,
everything would be OK and he would move on.
</P>
<P>
   Although Braves officials have said they will take Rocker back
with no animosity, a baseball official said he believed they would
trade him as soon as they find a club willing to take him and the
fallout from his remarks.

3COM'S SHARES SURGE IN ANTICIPATION OF OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in 3Com Corp. surged to a record high
Wednesday in anticipation of the initial public offering of its
Palm Inc. unit.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, Palm sold 23 million shares, or a 4.1
percent stake, at $38 each, valuing the company at about $21
billion. The shares had been expected to sell at $30 to $32 a
share, or double the originally projected range of $14 to $16.
</P>
<P>
   Because 3Com is offering only a fraction of Palm to the public _
it will still own 94 percent after the initial public offering _
the value of the unit is still reflected in 3Com shares.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny float also encourages a torrid reception for Palm
shares, although analysts said this was always likely to be a hot
offering because of the strong brand name and the popularity of the
company's Palm organizers. 3Com plans to distribute the remaining
Palm shares to its shareholders within two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   3Com shares closed Wednesday at $104.125, up $6.125, in Nasdaq
trading. 3Com shares have traded as low as $20 in the last year,
and were trading in the high 50's just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the Internet start-ups that have gone public
recently, Palm is profitable. In the fiscal year ended May 28,
1999, Palm earned $29.6 million, or 6 cents a diluted share. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under growing fire over his recent attacks on
leaders of the Christian right, Sen. John McCain Wednesay
apologized for remarks he had made the day before in which he
characterized Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell as forces of
evil. He said those remarks were intended as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating that he ``disagrees with the political message and
tactics'' of Robertson and Falwell, McCain added in a prepared
statement, ``I do not consider them evil, and I regret that my flip
remark may have mistakenly created that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my campaign,'' he said, ``I often joke about Luke
Skywalker, evil empires and death stars. It was in that vein that I
used the phrase yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain issued the statement shortly after his most prominent
supporter on the Christian right, Gary L. Bauer, harshly criticized
McCain for his recent attacks on Falwell and Robertson, and
suggested that they could cost him the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a staunch opponent of abortion who endorsed McCain
several weeks after ending his own candidacy for the presidency,
insisted that he was not withdrawing his endorsement. But, he said
in an interview ``there is no way that any candidate can get the
presidential nomination if there is a perception that the candidate
is hostile to voters concerned about the breakdown of values.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's apology late Wednesday was a clear reflection of a
campaign suddenly on the defensive after losing three contests the
day before to Gov. George W. Bush. And with the race possibly
hanging on the results of next Tuesday's contests in more than a
dozen states, McCain can ill afford to have his campaign consumed
by controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast Wednesday, was clearly buoyed by his lopsided
victories in Virginia, Washington State and North Dakota, telling
an audience in the heavily Republican suburbs of Atlanta, ``You
might notice I walked in with a little spring in my step.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the results in those states brought him, ``a step
closer to ending the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.'' And through
a cross-country campaign day that brought Bush from Georgia to
Missouri to California, he put a heavy emphasis on his signature
theme of education, an issue with broad appeal to the kinds of
moderate voters who will be important in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also moved to press his advantage over McCain
in California, announcing that he would participate in a debate
there in person to underscore his commitment to one of the most
critical states in next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   But as it has for days in the Republican campaign, religion
continued to occupy a central spot in the day of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Riverside Wednesday morning McCain
sought to assure voters that his harsh comments recently about both
Robertson and Falwell were not an indictment of all Christian
conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a couple of individuals,'' McCain said.
``The overwhelming majority of people who are members of the
Christian right are good and decent people. I think they've been
led astray by a couple of individuals that, very frankly, have done
some things which I find reprehensible in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to hammer McCain for phone calls the senator's
campaign had made to Catholic voters alerting them to Bush's South
Carolina appearance at Bob Jones University, which forbids
interracial dating and whose leaders have espoused anti-Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``John ought to be ashamed of running that kind of campaign,''
Bush said. ``It's going to backfire on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the Bush campaign is still working to minimize
any damage done with Catholic voters by McCain's broadsides, the
crowd sitting as a backdrop to Bush Wednesday morning near Atlanta
included a woman prominently at the governor's side who held a
placard saying, ``I'm Catholic and I'm for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the opportunity to criticize the leader of the Nation
of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, but not the leaders of the religious
right whom McCain, in a fiery speech Monday, had branded along with
Farrakhan as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Farrakhan preaches hate,'' Bush said. ``Louis Farrakhan
is a hateful person.'' He said Farrakhan preached an ``anti-Semitic
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also talked about Farrakhan in criticizing McCain, saying
it was wrong for the senator to mention him and the Rev. Al
Sharpton in his criticism of Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparison of these respected conservative leaders to the
demagogic race-baiter Al Sharpton and the anti-Semitic Louis
Farrakhan was unfounded and unwise,'' Bauer said. ``Such rhetoric
serves only to divide the party and plays into the hands of the
liberal elite to falsely depict Christian conservatives as
intolerant extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's criticism of McCain Wednesday came as somewhat of a
surprise, given the fact that he stood near McCain in Virginia
Beach on Monday as he delivered the speech in which he attacked
Robertson and Falwell. And he later commented on the speech without
distancing himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he explained: ``I didn't get a chance to see that
speech until it was too late to do anything about it. It had
already been passed out to the press.'' McCain's aides challenged
the statement, saying that Bauer not only reviewed the speech in
advance but added a paragraph to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he was not pressured by fellow Christian
conservatives to disavow McCain's remarks. ``I just think that
Senator McCain's larger message, which is pro-life and pro-family,
is getting lost in this controversy between him and Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters on his campaign bus Wednesday afternoon,
McCain insisted that he stood by the speech he gave on Monday and
that he apologized only for his remarks suggesting that Falwell and
Robertson were having an ``evil influence'' on the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing any of my speech,'' he said. ``I'm sure that
Gary and I will have an understanding about the speech and what was
intended and what was intended by my remarks yesterday. It was a
light-hearted attempt at humor and sometimes it isn't interpreted
that way.''

evokes reverent sound bites like ``intensely lyrical'' and ``smart

   (NYT6) NEW YORK -- March 1, 2000 -- NY-VILLAGE-HOUSE-1 -- The
restored reading room of a house built in 1887 as the Jackson
Square library by Richard Morris Hunt, a legendary figure of the
Beaux-Arts period and the architect of the main entrance of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. The room was used by W.H. Auden and

stumbled upon the house in the 1980's, it looked as though it had
been through a long journey. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

 _ SF CHRON   Rolling Stone Finds Its Direction Home Courtesy of Emusic.com 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
What goes around, comes around for Rolling Stone.
<P>
   The magazine made its name by chronicling the rock and roll
revolution that grew up in San Francisco in the 1960s. But Rolling
Stone then forsook its hometown roots and moved to New York City in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Internet is revolutionizing the music industry,
Rolling Stone's electronic arm is coming home ... sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is staying put in its Manhattan offices, across
from Radio City Music Hall. But its Web site, at
www.rollingstone.com, has been acquired by a Silicon Valley
upstart, Emusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which closed two weeks ago, Rolling Stone
magazine retains ownership of the domain name. On the site, the
magazine posts its extensive archives, its writers contribute
breaking news, and a staff of five Web-only writers and editors
post articles and review music.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had licensed out the main business of running the
Web site to various Internet providers, most recently to a Chicago
company called JamTV that later became Tunes.com. In the deal that
closed two weeks ago, Emusic of Redwood City bought Tunes.com for
about $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Emusic owns the exclusive license to RollingsStone.com
until 2010, with an option to renew it to 2015. Emusic gives the
magazine company, which is still owned by founder Jann Wenner, an
undisclosed set payment each quarter and keeps everything above
that. Wenner also has an equity stake in Emusic.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, we have a venerable old media brand teaming up
with a prototypical Internet company. Emusic was established in
January 1998 and is led by 24-year-old Gene Hoffman _ that's right,
24 years old _ who says he's the youngest CEO of a Nasdaq company.
In the past quarter, it reported, ending December Dec.  &LR; 31, Emusic
had revenue of $423,000, while its net losses were more than $14
million. Its stock, which peaked in June at $35 a share, this week
hit its 52-week low. It closed yesterday at $5.59
</P>
<P>
   Emusic has grown largely through acquisitions; in addition to
snapping up Tunes.com, it also has bought DownBeatJazz.com and the
Internet Underground Music Archive, or IUMA.com. It says it's the
leading seller of downloadable music, with direct relationships to
post the digital MP3 formats of such artists as Elvis Costello,
Phish, Tom Waits, B.B. King and They Might Be Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolling Stone brings to the table a huge brand, an unbeatable
brand,'' gushed Hoffman, the Emusic chief. But the magazine needed
training wheels online, he said, adding, ``This is a business in
which they were not fluent.''
</P>
<P>
   RollingStone.com likes the huge MP3 library that Emusic brings
and sees an opportunity to use its musical expertise to help Web
surfers navigate the MP3 maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much material out there, it's chaos,'' said Larry
Carlat, editor of RollingStone.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you trust to filter these things? People do trust
Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual nature of a partnership between a venerable old
media brand and a flashy technology company is underscored by the
different routes Carlat and Hoffman took to their current posts.
Hoffman, who attended the University of North Carolina, came from
the geeky side of the business, having started a software firm. He
moved to Silicon Valley when he sold his company to Pretty Good
Privacy. He was a music fan who had managed bands and worked in
radio, and he launched GoodNoise Corp. in 1998, later changing the
name to Emusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   Carlat, on the other hand, is a New York magazine guy through
and through, having worked at Hachette Filipachi and Fairchild
Publications, and having written for Esquire, GQ and Self. He
joined RollingStone.com four years ago because, ``like a lot of
people in magazines, I always wanted to work for Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 43, he'll be working with a 24-year-old  &LR; CEO who wasn't even
born when the Beatles, the Doors or Janis Joplin were in their
heyday. But that's OK, he said of Hoffman, ``He's old enough to be
my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUNI METRO: &QL; 
Metro, a free newspaper now making waves in Philadelphia, may be
trying to splash down in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Metro gives subway commuters a quick read through the headlines
of the day. Already popular in cities from Stockholm, Sweden, to
Santiago, Chile, Metro ran into trouble when it launched in Philly
in January because of its unusual relationship with the local
subway authority.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of that deal, Metro is distributed at rail
stations,including some areas that other newspapers don't have
access to. That ignited the ire of the mainstream press, and
companies including Knight Ridder and Gannett sued the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, trying to halt Metro's
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   That's not stopping Metro from looking to launch in other
cities, including San Francisco. Metro North America Vice President
Floyd Weintraub met with officials from BART and Muni to check the
chances of starting up here.
</P>
<P>
   BART spokesman Ron Rodriguez said Metro representatives made
``no formal or informal proposals.'' Muni spokeswoman Maggie Lynch
said, ``It isn't something we're actively pursuing. We have other
irons in the fire. Improving our service is our No.1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub said he'd love to bring Metro to the Bay Area. ``San
Francisco is a great city,'' he said. ``It has a great
transportation system. We think our product can be good for riders
and the transit agencies, if the conditions are right for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if the agencies express an interest, Metro will make a
proposal.

 Wells Fargo, eBay to Start Billpoint Service  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;    c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Online auctioneer eBay and Wells Fargo announced an alliance
yesterday to let consumers make payments to other people by credit
card, a venture the companies hope will eventually replace checks
as the main way individuals send money to others.
<P>
   Billpoint, as the service is called, is starting as a payment
option on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   After refining its system on that site, the firm plans to roll
out the service to other electronic commerce sites and the general
public, aiming to seize a dominant share of payments between
individuals. EBay and Wells Fargo estimate the market at $100
billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like very much to see Billpoint become the
person-to-person and person-to-small-business payment standard,''
said eBay Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Most online auction buyers now pay for goods by check or money
order, which can delay transactions if sellers wait to ship items
until they receive payment.
</P>
<P>
   Using Billpoint, eBay buyers can use credit or debit cards to
complete a purchase. Sellers get paid immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Several young Internet companies, including PayPal.com, X.com
and dotBank.com, already offer person-to-person payment services by
credit or debit card.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal, for one, has already gotten wide acceptance. It was
cited as a payment option for nearly 300,000 items up for sale on
eBay yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't see much competition from big names in
consumer-to-consumer credit card payments,'' noted Scott Anderson,
an electronic commerce consultant with the Georgia firm Global
Concepts.
</P>
<P>
   That's likely to change fast. Several major Internet payment
powers are eyeing the online person-to-person market, using
customer credit cards, checking accounts or other systems as
payment vehicles. They say eventually individuals will routinely
use the Internet to send cash to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's massively on our radar,'' said Ruthann Lorentzen,
marketing director of Transpoint, the Microsoft-sponsored
electronic payment company that the software giant recently agreed
to sell to online payment leader Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   EBay bought Billpoint, a tiny Internet escrow company, for $125
million in May 1999. Wells Fargo, the West's largest bank, is
purchasing a 35 percent stake for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts described the eBay-Wells Fargo alliance as a marriage
of convenience. EBay brings millions of customers looking for
payment options, while Wells Fargo offers an established
credit-card payment processing operation and a well-known name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you introduce a product, it's often easier to do as an
ingredient of a familiar brand,'' said Chris Musto, an online
banking analyst with the Massachusetts research firm Gomez
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is already a leading Internet banking player, with 1.6
million online customers. Through Billpoint, it gets payment
processing income as well as part-ownership of a potentially
enormous enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   After a free introductory period, Billpoint will charge sellers
a minimum of 35 cents, up to 3.5 percent of the sale amount. In
addition, sellers must register with Billpoint to receive payments.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, anyone with an e-mail address can get payments
through PayPal and other services, and recipients don't have to pay
anything. The companies say they will get revenue as customers set
up accounts and deposit cash with them.
</P>
<P>
   Billpoint payments have nothing to do with the escrow service
eBay sells to customers who want purchases to be protected. A
customer who uses escrow can pay by check, money order or by credit
or debit card through Billpoint.

STRAWBERRY CHECKS INTO CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla _ Darryl Strawberry checked into a
drug-rehabilitation clinic Wednesday in Florida, two days after he
was suspended for a year by Major League Baseball for violating his
after-care program.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry released a three-paragraph statement, typewritten on
plain sheets of paper, through the New York Yankees' media
relations department. There was no Yankee letterhead, no team logo.
``By the time you read this statement,'' the statement said, as if
to quote Strawberry, ``I will have checked myself into a
rehabilitation clinic, where I intend to be for the foreseeable
future. My goal is to take control of my drug addiction once and
for all and I believe that this step is required in order to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``While I regret that I cannot say this
in person, I do want to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to
the many people who have provided me with support through this most
difficult time for me and my family. My teammates, Joe Torre, the
Yankee organization and, of course, Mr. Steinbrenner, as well as my
doctors and the National Council of Alcohol and Drug Dependence,
have provided a bedrock of love, understanding and hope beyond
which I could have never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to say to the fans everywhere, many of whom I
certainly understand are disappointed and perhaps even angry at me,
I will work every day of my life to restore the belief you have had
in me.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, declined to
comment on Strawberry's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 37, has been admitted to dependency-treatment
facilities twice before, in 1990 and 1994. Strawberry was suspended
for 60 days by Major League Baseball in 1995, after testing
positive for cocaine, and last year he was given a 120-day
suspension after being arrested for cocaine possession and
solicitation of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading substance-abuse clinics in Florida is the
Hanley-Hazelden clinic in West Palm Beach, and there were reports
that Strawberry had checked in there. Several security guards were
posted outside the clinic but Jerry Singleton, the director of the
clinic, refused to confirm or deny whether Strawberry had been
admitted. The facility is part of the Hazelden Foundation, based in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The average patient stays for 28 days, Singleton said, and is
treated by a four-member team _ a medical director, psychiatrist,
psychologist and an addiction counselor.

 MAC Q&AMP;A/HENRY NORR  &HT;     New iMacs Work Well With MIDI Interface 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: I'm considering buying a new iMac, but I want to be sure that
I'll be able to hook up a MIDI interface to it for music
programming. Are MIDI devices compatible with the iMac? Where can I
buy one? And will I need an additional port to run MIDI and at the
same time be connected to both printer and keyboard?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're smart to check before buying, because when the iMac first
came out, and for a surprisingly long time thereafter, there was no
way to connect MIDI devices. Happily, that's now ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know, MIDI stands for Musical Instrument
Digital Interface. It's the standard protocol for passing musical
data among computers, electronic musical instruments and
synthesizers. To use MIDI on a Mac, you need an external interface
box, which in turn connects to the musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   There were two obstacles _ one hardware, one software _ when the
iMac appeared in 1998. For one thing, MIDI adapters were usually
made to connect to traditional serial ports, which Apple dropped
from the iMac in favor of the newer Universal Serial Bus (USB).
Second, the Apple software that manages the USB ports didn't
support MIDI.
</P>
<P>
   By now, though, many MIDI-makers, including big names like
Roland and Steinberg, have USB versions. You can find a good list
of them, with links to the vendors' sites, at
www.macintouch.com/imacusb.htmlMIDI.
</P>
<P>
   These devices aren't easy to find at local dealers or even mail
order and Web sites, but in most cases you can order them directly
from the vendor Web sites. Some are also available at USB Stuff, a
company that specializes in selling USB peripherals
(www.usbstuff.com).
</P>
<P>
   You're right that you'll also need another USB port, unless you
want to keep unplugging your printer every time you use MIDI. That
problem is easy to solve: Just pick up something called a USB hub,
a little box that connects to one of the iMac's USB ports and
provides several new ones in exchange (usually two, four or seven).
They're available at most dealers, with prices starting at around
$30.
</P>
<P>
   As for software, in addition to using Mac OS 9, you should
probably add a recent Apple patch called Audio Update, Version 1.3,
which you can download at
asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11573). The notes
accompanying the patch don't say explicitly that it affects MIDI,
but they promise ``improved USB audio support for computers using
Mac OS 9.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Browser Warning
</P>
<P>
   : Here's a problem no one seems able to help me with. My Mac
Performa 475, purchased in 1993, uses System 7.1p3. It works fine.
But recently, a dialog box started appearing whenever I open
Netscape. It says: ``Verisign Warning: You are using an older
browser with a security certificate that will expire soon.'' When I
proceed as directed, I am given a choice of two new browsers, one
for PCs and one for Power Mac. My computer is pre-Power Mac and I
don't think I can use any programs designed for Power Macs. Do I
have another option? If not, can I get rid of the dialog box?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: My advice: Learn to love those warnings until you're ready to
get a new Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Verisign is a company that develops software ``certificates''
that make it possible to do secure, authenticated transactions over
the Web. Both leading browsers, Microsoft's Internet Explorer as
well as Netscape Navigator, have such certificates built in.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that they were designed, on purpose, with a
finite life span _ in many older browsers, they were programmed to
expire Dec. 31, 1999. (The connection to the Y2K issue is strictly
coincidental.)
</P>
<P>
   For most users, the solution to this problem is simple: Just
download an up-to-date version of your favorite browser. But for
you and others with older Macs, things are more complicated because
both Microsoft and Netscape some time ago stopped developing
software for the Motorola 680x0 (sometimes written 68K), the chip
that powered all Macs until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There is actually a solution available for you, but I doubt it's
worth the expense and hassle. It turns out that Version 4.08 of
Netscape Navigator is compatible with pre-PowerPC Macs and has
certificates that are still valid. It's available on the Web at
www.netscape.com /download/archive/clientarchive 40x.html.
</P>
<P>
   The complicating factor is that that version requires Mac OS
7.6.1, according to Netscape, but you're still using System 7.1p3.
Apple will sell you a copy of System 7.6, but it will cost you $99
plus tax and shipping _ more than most dealers charge for Mac OS 9!
And then you'll have to download and install a four-floppy updater
to get to 7.6.1. If you're up for all that, you can find details at
til.info.apple.com /techinfo.nsf/artnum/n26170.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Apple make 7.6.1 available free, or at least at a
more reasonable price? Probably because doing so would let folks
like you get another year or two out of your old hardware, which in
turn would mean fewer sales of new Macs. It's decisions like that
that earned Steve Jobs his jet plane and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Wiping Out Files
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have over 1,000 items, using up close to 20 megabytes on the
hard disk, in my browser cache. I think you've addressed this
question before, but could you please tell me again how to erase
all of those files?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, I haven't answered that one before, but just about
every other computer Q&AMP;A columnist has, so I might as well take a
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Just launch your browser, go to the Edit menu and choose
Preferences. If you're using Internet Explorer, look at the list of
options on the left. Under the first item, Web Browser, you should
see 10 or so subcategories, the last of which is ``Advanced.'' (If
you don't see it, clicking on the triangle to the left of ``Web
Browser'' should reveal it.)
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``Advanced.'' On the right side of the Preferences
panel, under the heading ``Cache,'' there's a button labeled
``Empty Now.'' Click it and you're done.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep your cache growing right back up to 20
megabytes in the future, you can a smaller maximum size for it _
say, 5 or 10 megabytes _ by the value in the field labeled
``Size.''
</P>
<P>
   With Netscape Navigator the drill is similar, except that the
cache settings in the Preferences panel are under the last main
category, labeled ``Advanced,'' in the list on the left. (If
there's nothing under that heading, click on the triangle.) Click
on the ``Cache'' subheading, then on the ``Clear Disk Cache Now''
button. Here, too, you'll need to set a smaller size for the cache
to keep it from growing back to 20 megabytes. Note, though, that
Netscape lists the size in kilobytes, not megabytes, so if you want
to limit the cache to about 5 megabytes, type in 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever browser you use, be aware that the cache is there to
boost performance, and if you make it smaller, your surfing might
be slower, depending on the speed of your connection and how often
you return to the same pages.
</P>

 Kids Have Their Own Place to Trade Treasures  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
While most swap sites are hoping they can persuade convince &LR; 
 &LR; adults to start trading their toys like children do, Pasadena's
Swap.com has simply set up a trading post for kids.
<P>
   It makes sense: Children don't usually have credit cards or much
cash to buy things they want. And they get a lot of presents from
well-meaning adults _ often things they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really inventing something that kids don't do
already,'' said CEO Bill Keenan, whose says his three
grade-school-aged sons trade skateboard parts and other odds and
ends with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Web sites that cater to children are usually subject to fear
and scrutiny from parents. They also have to comply with stricter
laws than other sites. Starting April 21, the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act will take effect, limiting the information
that sites can collect about children without their parents'
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In compliance with the law, Swap.com requires that parents give
their consent before a kid can sign up. In order to prove that
they're really the parent, mom or dad has to enter a credit card
number, an e-mail address and a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Online bartering presents an especially nerve-racking issue for
parents: In order to receive the goods they traded for, kids give
out their mailing address to the person on the other end of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be another kid,'' warned Parry cq  &LR; Aftab, an
Internet lawyer who wrote the book ``The Parent's Guide to
Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a pedophile who goes out and buys buy  &LR; the
Pokemon things that kids really want, they'll trade them for
(nearly) nothing so kids will give out their address,'' she Aftab &LR; 
 &LR; said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that risk, Swap.com offers to receive all packages
for children, then remail them, thus concealing the child's home
address from strangers. This service costs $5.77 per trade, in
addition to the 77-cent transaction fee that Swap.com plans to
charge when its free introductory offer ends.
</P>
<P>
   Parents could save the extra money and still protect the child's
address by arranging for the goods to be sent to a work address or
post office box, Aftab suggested.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Children age 10 and under should avoid trading things on the
Internet without a parent, but older kids should be able to barter
on their own, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Gaska, who lives in Florida, signed up her daughter
Shiloh, 11, for Swap.com. Shiloh traded two dresses she didn't like
for a make-it-yourself lamp kit and a doll. Gaska said she liked
the fact that the Web site e-mailed her each time her daughter
agreed to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Gaska had the option of contacting Swap.com and
canceling the trade.
</P>
<P>
   When Shiloh tried to list an unopened bottle of bath oil for
trade on the site, a representative from Swap.com called Gaska and
asked if the bottle had a safety seal on it. It didn't, so they had
to remove the item from the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was watching out for other people's kids, too,'' Gaska
said.
</P>
<P>
   The items available on Swap.com are not just Pokemon cards or
Barbie dolls _ some are surprisingly expensive. A Chevy S-10
pickup, truck,  &LR; full computer systems and electric guitars have all
been listed on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Parents always get an e-mail message alerting them that a truck,
or a doll or a videotape, is being traded. But lest parents skip
checking their e-mail for a few days, then come home to find the
family car missing and a new electric guitar in the den, Swap.com
calls and checks with a parent if an item seems outrageously
expensive, Keenan said.

 Making Little Deals Online  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Madison Chabert, an actress who lives in Half Moon Bay, was dying
to attend last week's Grammy music award show in Los Angeles.
<P>
   Searching for tickets online, she stumbled across a Web site she
had never heard of before: IntelliBarter. Like eBay, IntelliBarter
of Santa Cruz serves as an online meeting place where people living
all over the world can get rid of stuff they don't want, and find
things they want. But unlike an auction, IntelliBarter _ and the
growing number of Web sites like it _ focuses on arranging trades,
not sales.
</P>
<P>
   To get the tickets, Chabert traded a signed photo of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' star Sarah Michelle Gellar and a copy of the
script from the film ``Good Will Hunting.'' Now she's trying to
trade some TV scripts for tickets to the Academy Awards show March
26.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliBarter is one of many Web sites that have been launched
in the past six months by entrepreneurs hoping that swapping among
consumers becomes an Internet sensation. Other swap sites include
Switchouse (formerly known as SwapRat.com), WebSwap, MrSwap.com and
Qswap, all in the Bay Area. Based elsewhere are Swap.com, Spun.com,
SecondSpin.com and ExchangeAnything.com. But despite their
optimism, the concept of profiting by consumer-to-consumer
bartering is untested, and the sites face a number of daunting
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists seem to like the idea: Sequoia Capital and
Accel Partners invested $13 million in WebSwap. And Swap.com, a
trading site for teenagers and children, has about $10 million in
capital, mostly from Pasadena incubator Idealab's venture capital
arm. Switchouse recently received $8 million in its first round of
venture funding.
</P>
<P>
   They are betting that consumers will like swapping because it's
useful and fun. Something that seemed worthless suddenly has value.
Outgrown baby clothes can be traded in for in-line skates. Unwanted
Christmas presents are swapped for office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're beating the system,'' said Michael Lin,
founder of San Francisco's Switchouse.
</P>
<P>
   And it's like a game: You make a wish list, post it on a swap
site and _ with luck _ a stranger comes forward to fulfill the
wish, in exchange for something you listed in your inventory. Or
someone offers you something you never thought of wanting. Some
sites even allow trading in services: ; &LR; one of IntelliBarter's
members _ presumably a dentist _ is offering dental implants for
trade.
</P>
<P>
   But swap sites need to persuade people to engage in a form of
commerce that many left on the playground when they outgrew trading
marbles and baseball cards. Swapping online involves hassle: On
most sites, you have to find another participant who has what you
want and come up with something they want in exchange. Then you
have to weigh, wrap and send the goods. Finally, you wait for your
goods to arrive _ if the person you swapped with comes through.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the companies persuade enough people to try bartering
online, can a business really squeeze much revenue out of cash-free
transactions among frugal individuals? While San Jose's eBay, the
Net's foremost auction site, is profitable, that site lists more
than 4 million items _ some costing more than $100,000 _ and takes
up to 5 percent of each sale.
</P>
<P>
   When no money is exchanged, and the goods are low-ticket items
such as compact discs, swappers may not be willing to pay much to
the Web site. So most of the sites plan to keep their transaction
fees under a dollar. At that rate, they're going to need a lot of
traffic to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man developed currency for a reason: to simplify
transactions,'' said Evie Black Dykema, an online retail analyst
with Forrester &UR;  &LR; Research. Dykema believes that all the barriers
that keep people from buying things online, such as the
inconvenience and expense of shipping things, will prevent the
barter market from ever becoming large enough to sustain more than
one Web site.
</P>
<P>
   MrSwap.com's founder, Patrick Ford, agrees that people don't
like to go to the post office to weigh and send packages. To solve
that problem, MrSwap.com will send traders an empty, postage-paid
mailer to send off a CD, game or video. This service costs $2.99
per order, just slightly more than it costs MrSwap.com to provide.
</P>
<P>
   MrSwap.com doesn't plan to charge a transaction fee. Instead, it
hopes to make money by letting retail partners _ such as Fingerhut
_ sell to its members, and by selling advertising. Another possible
revenue stream: MrSwap.com plans to distribute advertising leaflets
or free product samples in the empty mailers it sends its members.
</P>
<P>
   ExchangeAnything.com, a Massachusetts company that intends to
provide barter capabilities for a number of Web sites, is getting
around people's distaste for postage by arranging swaps according
to geographical location, then suggesting safe, public places where
the swappers can meet.
</P>
<P>
   But the main problem that swap sites face is that it's hard for
two people to agree on a mutually beneficial trade, especially if
the goods being exchanged are very different and difficult to
compare.
</P>
<P>
   To make matches more likely, Spun.com and SecondSpin.com are
concentrating on a commodity they see as extremely ``swappable''
because it's ubiquitous, inexpensive and has a narrow price range:
music on compact disc. Switchouse started out swapping CDs only and
is now introducing books, videos and games. MrSwap.com will launch
this month with similar categories.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of MrSwap.com decided that compact discs are a good
starting point when they learned in a survey that the average
consumer owns 109 CDs _ and only listens to half of them. Used CD
shops only pay $2 to $3 for a pre-owned disc, which means you would
have to sell five or six old CDs to raise enough cash to buy one
new one.
</P>
<P>
   But on most swap sites, you can trade one used CD for another of
about the same age and popularity. Or two of yesterday's Oasis
might net one copy of Santana's ``Supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   On WebSwap, traders can swap absolutely anything, from lawn
mowers to baby-sitting service. To make swaps more likely among
these disparate goods, WebSwap's software searches for potential
three-way trades. So if the Grammy ticket holder hadn't wanted a
``Buffy'' photo, WebSwap may have found a third party who did want
it, and who could in turn provide something desirable, like a camp
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Chabert could have offered to pay cash for the tickets or
sweetened the deal by adding cash to her barter goods. Both
IntelliBarter and WebSwap allow traders to use cash.
</P>
<P>
   MrSwap.com, Spun.com and SecondSpin.com eliminate the need for
``perfect matches'' by using virtual currency, or store credit.
Members sell CDs to the companies in exchange for points, and then
use the points to shop for other used CDs. This method is already
in use in offline barter clubs, where small businesses offer
services or goods to other club members, and get paid in barter
dollars instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer swapping may be fun, but business-to-business swapping
is where the money is, said Mary Cicalese, an analyst at Los Altos'
Internet Research Group. Parallel to the explosion in
consumer-to-consumer trading sites, business-to-business swap
forums have been starting up, with names such as BigVine.com and
uBarter.com. Unlike consumers, many small businesses are already
active in offline swapping clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer-oriented sites would do well to expand to
business-to-business swapping because the market is bigger _ $1
billion in goods are bartered by businesses in North America each
year, according to the International Reciprocal Trade Organization
_ and because getting rid of excess inventory is more vital to
businesses than it is to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pained every day by having 25 Pez dispensers in our
attic,'' Cicalese said. But in a business, excess inventory can be
fatal.

JUDGE IN TEXAS ORDERS RELEASE OF DEATH ROW INMATE WHOSE LAWYER
SLEPT AT TRIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tex. _ After 16 years on death row for a 1984 murder
conviction in which his lawyer slept through long portions of the
trial, Calvin Jerold Burdine was ordered released from prison
Wednesday by a federal judge because state prosecutors missed a
procedural deadline for granting him a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Hittner of U.S. District Court, who voided Burdine's
conviction last year based upon the behavior of Burdine's lawyer,
had given prosecutors 120 days to set a new trial. The deadline
passed in January, and Wednesday Hittner ordered Burdine released
from prison within five days, although he did not bar prosecutors
from re-trying Burdine.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order said that a retrial would provide Burdine with
another lawyer, affording him his constitutional right to counsel.
Thus a new trial would not violate Burdine's constitutional rights,
according to the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful development for Texas in that there is
someone looking out for the citizens and trying to keep them alive
in the face of bad lawyering,'' said William Moffitt, president of
the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Burdine was convicted in a state court in Houston in the April
1983 stabbing death of his former housemate and companion, W.T.
Wise. The conviction was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals in 1986, but, last September, Burdine appealed the
conviction in federal court and won, when Hittner ruled that
``sleeping counsel is equivalent to no counsel at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the judge ordered the state either to retry Burdine
or release him within 120 days of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's order, Hittner appeared to be irritated with
state prosecutors when he wrote: ``Throughout its brief, the state
seeks to minimize its failure to comply with established procedural
rules as `excusable neglect.' However, a similar procedural error
by defense counsel in a capital case could result in a defendant's
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Wednesday at his Houston office, Hittner refused to
comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   A terse statement issued by the Texas attorney general's office
said: ``We are filing an immediate appeal and are confident the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will block the release and keep
Burdine in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffitt, who has been a defense lawyer for more than 25 years,
said the case was unusual. ``The trend,'' he said, ``has been that
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals generally passes on these kinds
of cases and allows people to die. I'm happy that a federal judge
at least has finally stood up and said, `Where there is an
ineffective lawyer, we're going to do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' death penalty policies have recently been the focus of
national attention both because of the number of people being put
to death and the visibility of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign. There have been 121 executions in Bush's administration.

Jeanne Jackson, chief executive of Gap Inc.'s Banana Republic
division and head of Gap's Internet operations, was named yesterday
as CEO of Wal-Mart.com, the newly created online subsidiary of the
world's largest retailer.
<P>
   Wal-Mart.com, a joint venture with Palo Alto venture-capital
firm Accel Partners, is aiming for nothing less than to topple
Amazon.com as the Web's dominant retailer. The company expects to
go public by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 48, former president of Victoria's Secret, will leave
Gap Inc. at the end of the month. Gap said a trio of Banana
Republic executives will run the division on an interim basis after
Jackson departs. A new CEO will be chosen later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for her,'' said Janet Kloppenburg, an
analyst with broker Robertson Stephens in New York. ``She's been
very successful, and the Gap's sites are extremely well done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson placed 41st on Fortune magazine's 1999 list of America's
most powerful businesswomen.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has been courted by numerous other companies and
has consistently turned down all offers, Jackson told The Chronicle
that Wal-Mart's overture was too tempting to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't just mean the oodles of stock options in her
compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will believe this, but that wasn't the most important
thing,'' Jackson said. ``I mean, you can only spend so much, and my
Gap stock has done so well already, I'm as comfortable as I want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she admitted she'll be taking a hefty pay cut when she
moves from Gap's San Francisco headquarters to the
as-yet-undetermined Peninsula base of Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   What compelled her to make the switch, Jackson insisted, was the
strength of Wal-Mart's brand and the company's commitment to
bridging the divide between its online and real-world sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wal-Mart has had an online presence since 1996, the
Arkansas company has struggled to establish itself as an e-commerce
powerhouse. Its partnership with Accel, announced in January, is
intended to reinvent Wal-Mart.com as a hip and cool place to buy
everything from books and CDs to toys and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they don't know,'' Jackson said of Wal-Mart's
senior executives. ``They've stepped up to the fact that they need
partners who are Net savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Breyer, Accel's managing partner and one of three
Wal-Mart.com board members, said he first approached Jackson about
becoming CEO in December.
</P>
<P>
   The two had met only a month or so earlier, when, as chance
would have it, they were seated side by side on a flight from New
York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent six hours together,'' Breyer recalled. ``I came away
extremely impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved toward finalizing the Wal-Mart.com deal, she was
the first person who came to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer praised Jackson's management abilities, as well as her
strategic and marketing skills. ``She has an innate sense of what
consumers are looking for in an online experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sense will be put to the test as Jackson reconciles the
upscale style that is the hallmark of Banana Republic with the more
down-market sensibility of Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Her first goal will be to attempt to persuade at least a portion
of the 100 million customers who visit Wal-Mart stores each week to
give e-commerce a try.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart sees this as a more workable strategy than trying to
reach out to a whole new demographic, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also will seek to build on a recently established
alliance between Wal-Mart and America Online to create a co-branded
Internet service targeting rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is protecting the Wal-Mart brand,''
she said. ``If you tinker with that, you're tinkering with the
entire company.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added that she isn't worried about grasping Wal-Mart's
well-entrenched corporate culture. ``My expertise is with great
brands,'' she said. ``Wal-Mart has one of the best brands out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Her past experience included stints at Federated Department
Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue and Disney. She joined Gap Inc. in 1995
as head of Banana Republic and soon took on the company's Internet
business as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson can only laugh now when she thinks how her life is
changing as a result of having shared a plane ride home with
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serendipity is an amazing thing,'' she said.

POLICE PAINT PORTRAIT OF A TROUBLED CHILD WHO TOOK LIFE OF
CLASSMATE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ His father was in and out of
prison. His mother, evicted from her own home, sent him and his
brother to live with an uncle in a dilapidated house here, just
north of Flint. There, he did not even have his own bed and fell
asleep in a place that neighbors say was filled with noise, drugs
and guns.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, the police say, the 6-year-old got his hands on
one of those guns, stuffed it in his pants pocket and went off to
first grade, where he killed a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, cars paused outside the white clapboard residence, as
passers-by tried to get a look at the home of a troubled child, a
boy who the police say did not fully comprehend what he did when he
used a .32-caliber handgun on the 6-year-old girl, Kayla Renee
Rolland.
</P>
<P>
   She was shot once in the neck just before 10 a.m. Tuesday in
front of a group of about 22 first-graders as they made their way
into the hall of the Theo J. Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The boy put the gun in a desk after the shooting and simply
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla was rushed to the Hurley Medical Center. She was
pronounced dead at 10:29 a.m., less than an hour after the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by detectives, the boy did not cry, the police said,
and afterward sat and drew pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young boy appears not to have many advantages in life,''
said Arthur A. Busch, the Genesee County prosecutor, who said the
boy probably would not be charged and was released Thursday to an
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities appeared to take a sympathetic attitude
toward a child who took another child's life, many residents said
the real sympathy belonged with Kayla's family and questioned
whether it was safe to send their children back to school.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say the boy's own father, serving time in jail
for a parole violation involving a burglary, said the boy was
living in a ``crack house.'' The neighbors say they suspected it
all along.
</P>
<P>
   In a raid Tuesday night, the authorities found a stolen handgun
and some narcotics in the home and jailed the boy's uncle,
Sirmarcus Winfrey, on an outstanding warrant for theft. Another
man, 19, who the authorities said lived in the home and brought the
stolen gun used in the killing into the home, turned himself in to
the police Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said they were considering charges of
involuntary manslaughter against whoever brought the gun into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   They are also considering pressing charges of child neglect
against the family or guardians of the child, whose name was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my position that we have, at this point, enough evidence
to establish child neglect,'' the prosecutor said. ``My attorneys
will go to court even today to argue that the court should take
jurisdiction of this little boy. I am very concerned about the
placement of this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the boy's parents appeared in probate court
for a hearing on custody of the child, his 8-year-old brother and a
5-year-old sister who had been living with another relative. The
state moved to gain custody of the three children, saying the boy's
mother was a drug addict who had admitted that she had exposed the
children to marijuana on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said there were also reports that the mother had
physically abused one of her children. The boy's father, who was
brought from the local jail, spoke to the court, saying he was
sorry for what had happened and acknowledging that he had not
always been a good father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had never happened,'' he said. ``I just feel sorry
for the other child.'' The mother sobbed nearby, wiping her eyes
with tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Robert Pickell said that he went to the jail on Tuesday
night to ask the boy's father if he knew anything about the gun.
The sheriff said the boy's father said the child was frequently in
trouble and had been in fights at school.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the boy did not seem to comprehend what had
happened and appeared nonchalant when interviewed by detectives on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their impression the boy didn't understand what he had
done, did not appreciate the consequences of his actions and
appeared to take this as some sort of, well, that this just kind of
happens like on television,'' Busch, the county prosecutor, said at
a crowded news conference Wednesday morning. ``This is a young boy,
6 years old, who cannot obviously form criminal intent. He does not
seem to understand the gravity of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shooting, the public schools in this
working-class town remained closed. Flags flew at half-staff.
Grieving residents left flowers and notes and toys at the doors of
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The horror at Buell, the authorities say, was born of the anger
of a little boy who found a weapon under a blanket on the bed at
home and used it on a young girl he had quarreled with the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chad Ballard, who lived next door to the boy's family for three
years before the family was evicted, said the house had been raided
by the police several times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a home where cars were always stopping, late into the
night, Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the best of neighbors,'' he said. ``I tried to
avoid them because there was always conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he often quarreled with the family. The boy and his
8-year-old brother often teased his dog, and when Ballard tried to
stop it, the boys' parents often intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `Stop yelling at my kids,' and I would say,
`You need to take care of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard said the mother worked during the day and into the
evening and that the boy's father was not around very often.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the boy's mother was evicted from the home.
She moved elsewhere and often sent the two boys to stay with her
brother and at least one family friend, in a house on Juliah
Street, about a half-mile from Buell.
</P>
<P>
   The two-bedroom home is a kind of makeshift auto shop. A
Corvette sits on the front lawn, propped up by cement blocks.
Another car, its hood ajar, sits to the back of the house next to a
weathered John Deere snowmobile, which appears to be undergoing
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are auto parts and mangled hub caps scattered outside the
house, candy wrappers, soda bottles and wires and equipment out
front. The windows are shaded with old blankets and broken windows
are patched with blue tarp. A deep and muddy hole sits to the left
of the house. And a dull light burns inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't associate with them,'' said Will Oscar, a 31-year-old
neighbor who said he was planning to move soon. ``There was always
a lot of traffic there; I heard gunshots. I didn't feel safe. My
car was stolen out of my driveway twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar said he did not know the boy and his older brother were
living next door. He said the mother often dropped them off there.
They sometimes teased his dog, he said, but otherwise the boys were
``just normal kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In school, the boy was often in trouble, the authorities said
Wednesday. He had a social worker and had been in several fights.
The authorities said they had heard that the boy had recently been
in a quarrel or scuffle with Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, walking by Buell Wednesday, said they witnessed the
fight on Monday. ``He was fighting with that little girl a few days
ago,'' said John Owens, 13, who was walking by the schoolyard after
school on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morris, 14, said there were lots of drugs in the area.
``We walk down the street,'' he said, ``and we hear guys say,
`Weed? Weed?''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda Ide, 8, a third-grader, said she had heard the gunshot.
``I was in my class, writing from the dictionary,'' she said. ``I
heard something go `bang,' and I immediately started crying,
because I knew it was a gunshot, because we hear gunshots all the
time around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda said she did not sleep Tuesday night, but she was not
too afraid to go back to school. ``I think tomorrow will probably
be the same as it was before the gun was fired,'' she said. ``But I
think I'll probably cry for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for reopening the schools. The front door
of Buell is jammed with flowers, bunnies, teddy bears and candles.
Cards read, ``Kayla, we won't forget you.'' There are baskets of
M&AMP;M's and sunglasses, drawings of broken hearts, splashed with
crayon.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Rasu King, 31, said she was dropping off a candle
and a teddy bear. ``I hope people realize how serious this is,''
she said. ``If you can't go to elementary school, you can't go
anywhere.''

AT BRAVES' COMPLEX, CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla., March1 _ Bobby Cox was pacing around the
batting cage watching the Atlanta Braves smack baseballs on an
empty field when Jim Schultz, the public relations director,
suddenly appeared in the dugout. Cox shouted to Schultz, summoning
him as if he needed a closer in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cox told Schultz that too many reporters were milling around in
the clubhouse so the manager planned to close it after the workout.
John Rocker had not even arrived at spring training, but the
ongoing distraction about the chatty and controversial reliever was
percolating.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did inexplicably shut their doors, telling 20
reporters who were there that there was a team meeting.
Interestingly, several players were still on the field when the
meeting was supposedly taking place. It was a tense and hectic day
here and the atmosphere at the Braves' complex will turn into more
of a circus when Rocker rejoins the team for his first workout on
Thursday, following the reduction of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see what he has to say,'' catcher Eddie Perez
said. ``Then, after that, we just need him to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   There were candid words, encouraging words and revealing words
from the Braves regarding the return of a 25-year-old whose own
disparaging words to a national magazine about various ethnic
groups have made him the poster boy for insensitivity. Since
Rocker's anti-New York diatribe, teammates, team officials, and
civic and political leaders have criticized him. Now Rocker's words
will be scrutinized once more as he has a chance to speak and
apologize to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John realizes that he needs to mend his place on this
team with his teammates,'' said General Manager John Schuerholz,
who did not discount the possibility of trading Rocker. ``I believe
that's his intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker told Tom Glavine he would apologize to his teammates,
including Randall Simon, whom Rocker referred to as a ``fat
monkey'' in the article. Rocker will also read a statement to the
news media, but the Braves were unsure if he would answer
questions. The Braves will also close their clubhouse on Thursday,
preventing reporters from seeing how teammates initially react to
Rocker. Major league baseball said it would not intervene and order
Atlanta to provide normal accessibility because this is an
extraordinary circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said all he needs to say to me,'' Glavine said. ``I'm
going to put more weight on how he acts every day and what he does
when he thinks no one is looking. As they say, actions speak louder
than words.''
</P>
<P>
   After Simon first heard of Rocker's remarks, he said that he
would ``bust'' him up. But Simon, who spoke eloquently on the
subject before a Braves official interrupted the interview,
softened his stance and will forgive his teammate as long as
Rocker's apology is sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time I was mad,'' Simon said. ``Everybody can be mad.
I got advice from my wife and my mother. Some of my friends said I
should hit him, some said not. I know anyone can make a mistake.
Why not give someone a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rocker will be returning, his future with the team is
not clear. Since Rocker will miss the first two weeks of the
season, the Braves will use Kerry Ligtenberg or Rudy Seanez as
their closer. Interestingly, Schuerholz, who never discusses the
names of players involved in trade speculation, spoke openly about
the possibility with Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been interest from other teams in John,'' Schuerholz
said. ``Whether he will be a Brave when the suspension is over, I
can't answer that with any more assurance than if you were to ask
me the question about anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz later said that Rocker would be the closer if he
maintains his ``effectiveness and remains with us.''

PAULIE AYALA COULD FIGHT FOUR TIMES THIS YEAR UNDER TOP RANK INC.'S
PROMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As many as four fights loom for Fort Worth's Paulie
Ayala in 2000, but not the encore the reigning World Boxing
Association bantamweight champion wistfully wants most.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala capped his 1999 championship-winning season with a one-two
public relations flurry. Ayala was voted ``The Ring'' magazine's
Fighter of the Year, and his 12-round upset victory against the
formerly undefeated Johnny Tapia was selected as Fight of the Year
by the publication known as ``The Bible of Boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala logged 24 almost nonstop rounds in his victories against
Tapia and No. 1-ranked contender Saohin Srithai Condo of Thailand
in 1999, admittedly leaving himself with the mother of all tough
acts to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning all those awards last year, they've put me at such a
level to where, shoot, I want to fight myself,'' Ayala said with a
laugh. ``I mean, I want to beat that Ayala guy! But I guess what I
would say is I want to just try to defend my title and try to unify
it this year. Let's see if we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's first action of 2000, and the opening round of promoter
Bob Arum's marketing plan for a fighter he projects as a ``midlevel
star,'' is scheduled to unfold Saturday night. Ayala will meet
Denmark's Johnny Bredahl, the reigning International Boxing Council
bantamweight (118-pound) champion, in a scheduled 12-rounder at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center. The bout will be Ayala's first in Las
Vegas since June 26, when he walked into the same ring in the same
arena as a 6-1 underdog and nobody and walked out as a real
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of came out of nowhere,'' said Bruce Trampler, the
main matchmaker for Arum and Top Rank Inc. ``Paulie fought about 10
years to become an overnight sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he is poised to help Ayala, and Top Rank, cash in on
the most recent ``overnights.'' Ayala-Bredahl is the main event of
a four-fight TVKO pay-per-view card billed as ``Bring on the Heat.
Caliente!'' By world-title fight standards, it is a modest
production. Arum said the arena is being set up to accommodate
5,500 fans, approximately half of its boxing capacity. Competing
against the NASCAR Busch Grand National and Winston Cup races at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway this weekend, Arum said the fight has sold
approximately 2,000 seats. With brisk walk-up business on fight
night, Arum said the card could draw a respectable 3,500 to 4,000
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Paulie can be a midlevel attraction for us,''
Arum said at his office here yesterday. ``He'll never be an Oscar
De La Hoya. But we think that he can be a Johnny Tapia _ on that
level. Again, it's going to depend on how he draws on the
pay-per-view on this fight. It's going to also depend on how many
shots we can get him on HBO, because they're the ones that pay real
money. If we get him on HBO and in some marquee fights, he can make
probably as much as a half-million for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has been shopping Ayala to HBO executive Seth
Abraham for the cable network's newest boxing series, ``KO
Nation.'' Arum said the series is being slotted for late Saturday
afternoons in the fall, primarily from college campus sites. TCU,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HBO stuff will definitely happen by the end of the year,''
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his crowd-pleasing style and squeaky-clean
lifestyle, Arum said Ayala's Hispanic-American heritage is working
in his financial favor. Ayala, 29, is scheduled to make a
career-best $150,000 for this fight, plus a percentage of
pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Paulie will draw very well for us, particularly
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and in other areas in California and
the Southwest,'' said Arum, referring to potential Hispanic
pay-per-view buys. ``As far as we're concerned, those are the
markets now for boxing in this country. So, I look for exciting,
interesting Hispanic kids. They're the ones that enable me to
market boxing. And Paulie Ayala has always filled that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said part of the attraction to matching Ayala against
Bredahl, the WBA's No. 4-rated contender, is to expose the Texan to
the European TV market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peripheral benefit that it showcases Paulie in Europe.
And that's great,'' Trampler said. ``But if you're rating
attractions in terms of the kind of shows we do, there's two weight
classes in boxing right now. There's the heavyweights, especially
where you've got Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis
and those guys, and there's whatever division Oscar De La Hoya is
in. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trampler said Ayala-Bredahl also delivers sizzle because it is a
``mixed-match'' racially.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level \Rheavyweights\S, it doesn't matter what
flavor you are,'' Trampler said. ``Aesthetically, a little lower
down, if Paulie was fighting another Hispanic, it might not be as
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie's one of the better attractions below the
heavyweight/Oscar level. He hasn't risen to that double-digit
\R10,000-plus attendance\S level yet, but he may. He doesn't push
himself. He's not controversial. He doesn't get thrown in jail.
He's just a real nice kid. Sometimes it takes fans awhile to
appreciate ability, and the kind of character he has.'' nn

   WILKINSBURG, Pa. _ A gunman who set his apartment on fire and
went on a lunchtime shooting spree at two fast-food restaurants was
taken into custody Wednesday after two people were killed and three
were critically wounded in this suburb of Pittsburgh, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, 39-year-old Ronald Taylor, surrendered after
holding police off for about two-and-a-half hours in an office
building. He was to be arraigned Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wilbert Young and police officials said they were
investigating whether the shootings with a .22-caliber handgun were
racially motivated. Taylor, who had no criminal history, is black,
while the five shot were white males, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed by one day the shooting death of a first
grader by a 6-year-old gunman in Mount Morris Township, Mich.,
leading President Clinton to urge Congress again to pass stricter
gun-control legislation. Clinton said the violent incidents ``call
on us to recognize the fact that we haven't done everything we can
do to keep these guns away from criminals and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident in this faded working-class suburb of
25,000 began about 11:15 a.m., when the police received a call that
a person had been shot and had been taken to a hospital. Officers
were given the address of the suspected gunman and arrived to find
Taylor's fifth-floor apartment on fire, the Wilkinsburg police
chief, Gerald Brewer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, there were more calls saying that someone had
been shot at a nearby Burker King and three more persons had been
shot at a McDonald's, Brewer said, adding that the callers provided
a description of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as John Kroll, 55, of Cabot, Pa., and
Joseph Healy, 71, of Wilkinsburg. One of the wounded, Richard
Clinger, was shot while sitting in his van at McDonald's, witnesses
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A maintenance worker at the apartment building told The
Associated Press that Taylor had become angry that the broken door
to his apartment had not been repaired quickly enough. ``He said,
`You're all white trash, racist pigs,''' the worker, John DeWitt,
told the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said of the standoff: ``I'm very proud of how the
officers responded. They used uncommon restraint in not taking his
life. That can be debated today and tomorrow, but today it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brewer said that the police were investigating a report that
Taylor had walked into a woman's home after he left his apartment,
telling her, ``I'm dead anyway, I just need to hide a couple of
minutes,'' and also saying, ``I'm just out to shoot white people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing things, but we don't have anything factual,''
Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Tuite of the Wilkinsburg police said that he and two
officers had spotted the suspect walking along a street and that he
turned and fired two shots, then went into an office building.
Taylor entered a doctor's office and apparently attempted to take a
woman hostage, but she escaped as a door closed between her and the
suspect, Tuite said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also entered a senior citizens center but took no
hostages, Tuite said, adding that he entered the building and saw
Taylor sitting in the hallway, about 40 feet away, with the handgun
in his mouth. Taylor later pointed the gun at his head, and talked
about killing himself, the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to do that, relax, we'll get through this,''
Tuite said he told Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor pointed his gun at the officers several times but they
did not fire, the lieutenant said, adding that the officers felt
they had him isolated and that they had sufficient cover behind a
cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tuite said that he spoke to Taylor for about 15 minutes, and
that Taylor had asked for a cigarette, adding that when the suspect
was asked if he needed a light, he replied that he had a lighter
and had used it to set his apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team and a negotiator were called in from Pittsburgh, and
about 125 people, including 37 children from a day-care center,
were evacuated from the office building, other police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Fischer of the Pittsburgh police department, who
negotiated with Taylor, told reporters: ``His mood went from anger
to confusion, distraught, fear and remorse. He bantered back and
forth between killing himself and surrendering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, gang activity and violent crime had
been significantly reduced in Wilkinsburg, Brewer said, adding that
his department's records showed no no prior arrests for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Young sounded a similar note Wednesday night saying: ``We are
sad and shocked over this. We're totally surprised.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scouts and coaches this week began dissecting an overflow of
paperwork, interviews and videotape on more than 320 college
players. It is their time to focus on last weekend's combine in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time when draft-day decisions are, in part, being
made. This is a stretch for teams to check their homework and then
check it again, to begin developing their consensus for the April
15 draft.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, even after the five-day combine that ended this past
Monday, more testing is required.
</P>
<P>
   Following a trend, several of the projected first-round players
at the combine refused to perform drills, especially the 40-yard
sprint. Most of the upper-tier players enjoy that luxury: Want to
see me run? Come to my campus at a later date when I am ready.
</P>
<P>
   Miami tight end Bubba Franks, for example, told the scouts and
coaches that. He will run for them Thursday on the Miami campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys who don't want to run at the combine are injured and
want to heal to run a better time,'' said Jon Kingdon, the Raiders'
director of player personnel. ``Others, the agents tell them don't
do it. It may be 40 yards in distance any where you run it, but at
the combine, it is a little different. The guys are up early. Some
have had their physicals the day they run. It's winter and even
though you're indoors, it's just not as ideal for some. But the
other side is if you can run, you can run.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you can really run, the scout will come to see.
</P>
<P>
   Even at your place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of those expected to be drafted did arrive for the
combine if only to be interviewed by the teams. Several players did
perform. And three of them really ran.
</P>
<P>
   Teams were mesmerized by the blinding speed of Melvin Harris, a
Virginia cornerback. He ran a 4.34 in the 40-yard sprint. A 4.5 is
good. A 4.4 is wonderful. A 4.34 is wondrous. Close behind were R.
Jay Soward of Southern California and Chris Cole of Texas A&AMP;M who
ran 4.35 and 4.37, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soward was unusual because while he ran he was counting,
yelling the numbers out loud,'' said Gil Brandt, a draft analyst.
``He was extremely boisterous, something we had never seen before.
We asked him why and he told us that if he can count while running
the 40 and not get to the number 19 that he knows he ran under 4.4
seconds. Now, that was a twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt added: ``Speed is important in football, and it is the
skill that every team craves. This draft is good at wide receiver,
offensive line and running back. All drafts are basically the same
in terms of the number of people that are going to make it. But
this one is different in that the first five or six drafted are Pro
Bowl-caliber players, and then after that there are a lot of good
players. Especially in the second round, or from picks 7 to 50, you
are going to find a contributing football player.''
</P>
<P>
   The first four players expected to be drafted include receiver
Peter Warrick from Florida State, offensive tackle Chris Samuels
from Alabama and linebacker LaVar Arrington and defensive end
Courtney Brown from Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first four picks, up and down the first round, it's
wide open,'' Kingdon said.
</P>
<P>
   The school most represented at the combine was Texas A&AMP;M _ it
had 10 players present. Florida State and Virginia Tech each
produced eight. Arkansas had seven. Marshall had five. Consider
that Texas El-Paso and Jackson State each featured three players
but Notre Dame only two.
</P>
<P>
   The tight ends were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Three _ Franks, Anthony Becht from West Virginia and Erron
Kinney from Florida _ averaged 6 feet 5 inches and 270 pounds. Five
fullbacks weighed in at 250 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, those numbers would have been the size of
offensive linemen,'' Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts were shocked at the strength of Leif Larson, a defensive
end from Texas El-Paso. It is special if a player can bench press
225 pounds 20 times. Larson did it 45 times, the most ever at the
combine. Afterward, though, he was upset _ he said he had been
routinely benching it 50 times in his preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Janikowski from Florida State ``showed up in an area
that is as difficult at the combine as any _ place-kicking,''
Kingdon said. ``You're working with new snappers, new holders, but
this guy didn't miss a beat. He made 3 of 3 from 50 yards. The ball
exploded off of his foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But teams may be hesitant to draft Janikowski because the
Polish-born kicker was accused of bribing a police officer and may
face deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The star of this combine, however, was safety Brian Urlacher of
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He may indeed play safety in the pros, but several scouts said
they expect him to be moved to linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We list him as 6-3 7/8, 258 pounds,'' Brandt said. ``He ran a
4.6 and at that size, that is remarkable. He did 27 reps on the
bar. In my estimation, he is going to be a top 10 pick. He did
everything at the combine, and, so, he will probably be the only
player in the top 10 who went there and showed his all.''
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher weighed 253 pounds at the Senior Bowl a few weeks
earlier but had added 5 pounds by the combine. At New Mexico he was
a mammoth safety, worked as the gunner on the punt coverage team,
played on other return teams and on offense caught seven passes,
six for touchdowns. He told scouts and coaches at the combine that
he has lived for draft day all of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really good,'' Kingdon said. ``He's flying up there.''
</P>
<P>
   As teams sift through their charts, with the draft more than a
month away, with so many private workouts coming, there is still
time for others to fly. And time, too, for others to slip and fall.

<P>
   DOBROSIN, Yugoslavia _ Just across the boundary line from
Kosovo, guarded more visibly now by U.S. troops in watchtowers,
armed Albanians wearing uniforms of a new branch of the Kosovo
Liberation Army are training in Serbia for a battle that the West
does not want them to have.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers and leadership are a mystery, but on Wednesday
fewer than 20 men, wearing a mixture of German and American
fatigues, did exercises in a muddy field with their weapons,
including a heavy machine gun on a tripod.
</P>
<P>
   On their arms they wear a cloth badge of red, black and yellow
that looks exactly like that of the supposedly disbanded and
disarmed Kosovo Liberation Army. The only difference is their name:
the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, all towns
in Serbia itself, although their populations are largely ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Their commander here would not give his name, but said he had
been wanted by the Serbs since the mid-1980s. The men said they
were all former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
guerrilla army of Kosovo Albanians that fought for independence
from Serbia, and villagers said they were local people.
</P>
<P>
   They are acting ``to defend their country, their village and
their land,'' said Zymer Zajidi, 30, a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials of the United Nations and the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, known as KFOR, say the men appear to
be members of the Albanian rebel group who refused to turn in their
weapons and now want to ``liberate'' what they call ``Eastern
Kosovo,'' where at least 70,000 Albanians live in the arc from
Medvedja in the north to Presevo in the south.
</P>
<P>
   By ordering the ambushing of Serbian police officers and
sometimes the intimidation of Serbian farmers, the leaders of this
new army ``are hoping that the Serbs will retaliate with excessive
force against civilian populations and create a wave of outrage and
pressure on KFOR to respond,'' said a U.N. official. ``It's
explosive and dangerous, and we hope KFOR uses restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German who commands the peacekeepers,
said in an interview that he had pushed the Americans hard to seal
the boundary between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia. And in fact,
less than two weeks ago, the Americans moved checkpoints and built
observation towers on the boundary line.
</P>
<P>
   One overlooks this village from a hill, while listening
equipment and U.S. tanks line the ridge above Dobrosin. The
Americans are now at the edge of a 3-mile demilitarized zone in
which the Serbian police can operate, but not Serbian troops with
heavy weapons, a zone in which Dobrosin sits.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt is adamant in saying his troops will not support any
new insurgency in Serbia. Still, the situation is not always so
clear on the ground. A U.S. sergeant first class, commanding this
checkpoint, said, ``We're just here to make sure the locals are
OK.'' But when asked what he could do if the Serbian police
returned and the locals were not OK, he shrugged and said, ``There
ain't much we can do, unless they shoot at us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers can return fire, he said. Wouldn't that encourage
the Albanians to fire on the Americans if the Serbs came, to make
it seem as if the Serbs were shooting? He shrugged again, saying he
could not provide his name.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans now have checkpoints and towers along the three
main roads into the area from Kosovo, officials said. But despite
those, it was a simple matter to drive over primitive country roads
of mud, ice and snow in the demilitarized zone in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle and avoid any checkpoint, in a region that
has for centuries been used by smugglers and drug runners.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters were nervous Wednesday, even brusque, and would not
give their names or allow photographs of their faces. In fact, they
did not really want journalists around at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday they shot up a car belonging to the office of the
U.N. high commissioner for refugees, which had come from Belgrade
and apparently did not stop at one of their checkpoints. An
Irishman was wounded in the leg, and the fighters, embarrassed and
worried about a possible Serbian response, took the man and his
Serbian interpreter to the Americans near the watchtower for
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters say their organization was born on Jan. 26, when
two local farmers here, brothers named Isa and Shaip Saqipi, 36 and
32, were killed by the Serbian police as they were returning to the
village from cutting wood in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers say the Serbs of the militarized police were on an
operation, with full uniforms, flak jackets and heavy weapons,
including a tank. Some seven Serb policemen were in the village,
with 40 more in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time the Serbian police have shown up here,
but this village of about 1,500 now has fewer than 30 families
living in it, the rest having fled into Kosovo, staying with
friends and relatives in Gnjilane, Malisevo and Podgradje, where
the Americans have another checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here with one eye open,'' said Halim Hasani, a teacher
in the village. ``We're always ready to flee.'' He said people were
afraid now even to go shopping in Bujanovac, because the Serbian
police had checkpoints along the road and sometimes turned the
villagers back.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1945 until today, the municipality of Bujanovac has not
given a penny to the village of Dobrosin,'' Hasani said. And he
said that except for the police, no Serbian official, whether tax
collector or postman, had shown up in the village for two years.
``Really we're in Kosovo and we want to be in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of course they are not in Kosovo. Hasani asked, ``If the
Serbs attack in Dobrosin, can the Americans come to help?'' Told
that the answer seemed to be no, he seemed very thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the presence of the fighters might bring the
Serbian police back to Dobrosin, he went silent, then said,
``Possibly.'' He stopped, then added hopefully: ``But they attack
no one. They are only working to defend our land.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes these fighters do attack, and they are being
disingenuous when they say their group was born with the deaths of
the Saqipi brothers a month ago. The Serbian police have been
complaining of attacks on Serbian villagers around Medvedja since
the late summer, and U.N. officials in Pristina say the group has
been active in Dobrosin at least since November.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January three Serbs were killed in nearby Mucibaba,
closer to Presevo, and the Serbs moved at least four units of the
Interior Ministry's militarized police to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ambushes of policemen have intensified, with one killed and
three wounded last weekend. One Albanian fighter was also killed in
a shootout. And the Serbs say they found a bomb over the weekend in
a courthouse in Bujanovac, which they blamed on ``armed Albanian
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on moderate or loyal Albanian politicians in Serbia have
also increased, including the murder last month of Zemail Mustafi,
the Albanian vice president of the Bujanovac branch of President
Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   And more Albanian civilians _ nearly 300, according to the
United Nations _ have gone into Kosovo from Serbia proper since
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``KFOR is being played with by these guys,'' said a senior U.N.
official, who is assuming that their leadership is based in Kosovo
and tied to parts of the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the official says he believes that the leaders
are associated with Rexhep Selimi, who headed the rebel group's
ministry for public order and security. But no one seems to know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. James Shufelt, in an interview at the U.S. military
headquarters at Camp Bondsteel, said: ``The concern here isn't that
the Serbian police will come across, but that Albanian attacks on
the Serb police and army will inspire a response great enough to
cause public clamor for a KFOR response.''
</P>
<P>
   His commander, Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, said: ``The Presevo valley
is a significant concern for us. We are making a significant effort
to control the activity running across that boundary. I don't
believe we can ever fully seal the border between Serbia and
Kosovo. But we have sent a clear message that any cross-border
insurgency will not be tolerated or supported.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``we've gotten some very good
feedback that the people of Dobrosin feel better because of our
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, but perhaps emboldened, too. The fighters are exercising
within sight of the U.S. watchtowers, and say that once, when the
Serbian police were near the village, U.S. helicopters flew
overhead and the Serbs withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Vahid Sylejman, 39, a villager, said he was sure the Americans
would come to their rescue if the Serbs came again. ``Why else are
they there?'' he asked, pointing to the tanks on the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Zajidi said: ``We have a kind of protection from the Americans.
If they were not on the hill, no one would be left in this village
at all.''

FCC AND FTC MOVE TO CRACK DOWN ON DISCOUNT TELEPHONE SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government said Wednesday that it would
begin to crack down on what it said was widespread deception in the
way discount telephone services have been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown was announced by the Federal Communications
Commission and the Federal Trade Commission after the government
received thousands of consumer complaints about the services, which
advertise low rates for long-distance telephone calls, but include
additional fees that are advertised only in fine print.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies disclosed new guidelines intended to make
advertising more complete and less deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these ads are just galling to me because they are so
misleading,'' said William E. Kennard, the FCC chairman. ``They
aggressively market the cheapest rates, but they don't tell you
what's in the fine print.''
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference Wednesday morning, Robert Pitofsky,
the chairman of the FTC, held up a circular from Vartec, a small
phone company that advertised rates of 10 cents a minute in large
type.
</P>
<P>
   But in print so small Pitofsky needed a magnifying glass to read
it, the ad said that there was a minimum of 30 cents a call and
interstate calls were limited to 125 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you need a map as well as a magnifying glass to figure out
their rates,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky also displayed a newspaper ad by AT&AMP;T that promised 7
cents a minute for all calls, and then noted in fine print an
additional monthly charge of $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday morning, AT&AMP;T ignored the
criticism and applauded the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At AT&AMP;T, we have always adhered to the highest advertising
standards,'' said the statement, which was issued by James Cicconi,
the company's general counsel. ``Unfortunately that's not been the
case for all of our competitors. For this reason, we welcome the
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said advertising practices had improved
recently. They also predicted that the guidelines would be an
effective remedy to past problems.

EDITORIAL: RESIGNATION PLOY IN AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, March 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jorg Haider's resignation as leader of Austria's Freedom Party
is a tactical stunt that changes little. With or without the title
of party leader, Haider remains the dominant figure in this racist
and Nazi-admiring party and, sadly, a defining force in Austria's
current coalition government. Europe, Israel and the United States
have rightly distanced themselves from Vienna, and should continue
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's resignation will cost him little in terms of party
power. Formal leadership now passes to his most loyal lieutenant,
Susanne Riess-Passer, who promises to continue their close
partnership. But as a nominally free agent, Haider will be able to
put a little space between himself and a coalition government whose
current unpopularity is likely to deepen as it proceeds with needed
tax increases and spending cuts. That could serve him well as he
pursues his open ambition to become chancellor after Austria's next
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party won notoriety, and 27 percent of the votes in
last year's elections, by denouncing the presence of foreigners in
Austria in terms that echoed Nazi Party rhetoric. It wants to ban
all immigration, blaming foreigners for crime, drugs, welfare abuse
and the spread of tuberculosis in Austria's public schools. Freedom
also opposes the European Union's plan to admit the new democracies
of Central and Eastern Europe. Haider and other party leaders have
made light of Nazi crimes and urged respect for SS veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom's racist message siphoned votes from Austria's two
mainstream parties, the center-left Socialists and the center-right
People's Party. Both parties grew stodgy and complacent in their
long years of coalition rule. Still, 60 percent of Austrian voters
cast ballots for these two mainstream parties last October, and 7
percent for the environmentalist Greens.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Party leader, Wolfgang Schussel, erred badly in
imagining that the Freedom Party could be a respectable coalition
partner. Haider's resignation is not enough to reverse that
mistake.

BP AMOCO AND ARCO ASSAIL FTC ON OPPOSITION TO MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: West Coast)   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With wide gaps remaining in settlement
negotiations, BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield Co. on Wednesday
accused the Federal Trade Commission of misinterpreting antitrust
law in an effort to block their $30 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in federal court in San Francisco, the companies
offered the clearest glimpse of their legal defense, contending
that the FTC had failed to follow its own guidelines and that the
merger would ``benefit competition worldwide and in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers asked the court to stop the deal after the
commission concluded it was anti-competitive and could lead to
sharply higher prices for refiners in California and other West
Coast states where gasoline prices at the pump are already among
the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers for the companies recently began a new round of
settlement discussions, the two sides remain far apart. The
government has not altered its opinion even as BP Amoco has
essentially agreed to sell off the equivalent of all of ARCO's
Alaska assets in deals that it says would keep the market for
exploration competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The talks could continue until oral arguments in the case begin
on March 20. The commission's chairman, Robert Pitofsky, has grown
more cautious about approving large oil deals as the industry has
undergone a wave of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's decision to try to block the deal has made the
proposed merger the largest in U.S. history _ both in terms of
combined revenue and purchase price _ to be challenged by the
government. But the oil companies have decided, unlike other
companies facing similar obstacles, to defend the deal rather than
abandon it, making the case an important test of the government's
interpretation of federal antitrust law, and one that could have a
substantial impact on future deals.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Arco asserted Wednesday that the commission had
basically bent antitrust law as it methodically tried to block the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC cannot demonstrate a lessening of competition in crude
oil sales to the West Coast,'' the companies said. ``BP Amoco and
ARCO do not compete in the U.S. West Coast states. BP Amoco sells
Alaska crude oil in those states; ARCO does not. ARCO sells refined
products in those states; BP Amoco does not. BP Amoco in Alaska
produces crude oil to sell to others; ARCO in Alaska produces crude
oil for its own refineries. Indeed, ARCO is a net buyer of crude
oil from other sources because it does not have enough to supply
its West Coast refining needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies also disputed the government's claim that the
merger would reduce competition for oil and gas exploration leases
in Alaska. Rather, they said, the revenues to both Alaska and the
federal government from leasing for exploration would actually
increase, not decrease, if the deal were completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC apparently has decided that in this case the normal
steps in the analysis should be ignored,'' lawyers for the
companies asserted. ``The reason is clear. Under proper analysis,
the FTC cannot demonstrate a likelihood of succeeding on its theory
that the proposed transaction is likely to lessen competition in
the sale of crude oil on the West Coast or in bidding for leases on
the North Slope.''

DODGERS' GREEN TOO NICE TO BE A SUPERSTAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Somebody needs to tell Los Angeles Dodgers
right fielder Shawn Green he's playing this leading man role all
wrong. The public expects Leonardo DiCaprio, and he's giving it
Jimmy Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The first day Green reported to Dodgertown for spring training,
we could tell he didn't have a good bead on how to portray his
character. He was sitting in the training room talking with Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone when in walked retired pitching great
Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Koufax is a primary vein that goes to the heart of the Dodgers'
mystique, but Green isn't supposed to get all flush in his
presence. The only thing the public expects to be more tenuous than
the modern superstar's grip on reality is his grasp of history. A
plausible performance would have been Green acting like it was a
coup for Koufax to be meeting him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Green behaved around Koufax the same way Malone's
10-year-old son would if he scored a personal audience with Haley
Joel Osment.
</P>
<P>
   His nerve left him like air from his lungs. He shyly greeted the
Hall of Famer as ``Mr. Koufax.'' Later, Green gushed, ``Mr. Koufax
is so down to earth, he takes the edge off.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Green could benefit from some direction by Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants outfielder wouldn't hesitate to remind Green he's
being paid for his home runs, not his wholesomeness; his
left-handed bat, not his boy scout's honor; his speed, not his
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown should pull Green
aside. Who better than he to advise Green that if he wants to come
across as believable in his role as one of the highest-paid players
in baseball he needs to strip a couple layers of polish from his
personality?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing sticks in the modern superstar's craw quite like the
knowledge that a rival is making more money. It's all about the
principal, and not the kind that sits in the bank, yielding
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Green has 84 million reasons to be serene. Over the length of
his six-year, backloaded contract with the Dodgers he will enjoy
the highest average salary of any position player in the majors.
That's no less than any club's leading man believes he is due but
more than Green acts like he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his contract, Green said, ``It's going to be nice
when some people pass me by.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that, talking as though setting the gold standard in his
sport was as discomforting as setting the pace in history's fastest
marathon. Somewhere in Port St. Lucie, Fla., Mike Piazza is shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Green needs to hook up with Piazza on Sunday when the
Dodgers and Mets play an exhibition game. The one-time Dodgers
catcher evidently didn't get Green up to speed on greed when the
two players teed off last month in Las Vegas in the first round of
the resurrected Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Green also could use a few pointers on handling the fans. The
way he acts around the public is nothing like what we've come to
expect from the modern superstar. The first day of the Dodgers'
full-scale workouts here, Green gladly signed autographs inside
Holman Stadium while most of his teammates deferred until after
they had completed their workouts (if then).
</P>
<P>
   Green had just finished hitting and had a few hours of work left
when a teen-age boy wearing a New York Mets cap and a St. Louis
Cardinals T-shirt summoned the nerve to ask if he could have the
player's bat. To his wide-eyed surprise, he got it and a slightly
embarrassed smile from Green. Later that day the sixth-year veteran
would acknowledge, ``It's hard for me to say `no.' I want to please
people.''
</P>
<P>
   That simply won't do. You can't go around being nice to the fans
and then expect to be taken seriously in a starring role. The
Dodgers take on Baltimore in an exhibition game Monday. Perhaps
Albert Belle can be persuaded to pull Green aside and explain to
him that fans exist to be spit on, snarled at or stared straight
through.
</P>
<P>
   Green has none of the guile we've come to associate with the
modern superstar. He doesn't act like his personal information is
currency to be reserved for feeding the marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   He oozes naivete. ``That would be a great word to use to
describe him,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   When Green mentioned to a reporter in Toronto last year that he
was exploring his Jewish heritage, he never dreamed rabbis would
try to reach him in every successive city the Blue Jays visited,
offering to officiate his bar mitzvah. It dumbfounds him that
synagogues in L.A. are competing for his membership.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for spring training, Green bought a house in L.A.
that is not in a gated community. It never dawned on him to seal
himself off from the public.
</P>
<P>
   That's not behaving at all like the modern superstar, who knows
fame runs with sycophants and psychos and arms himself accordingly,
with bodyguards and security systems and tons of wrought iron.
</P>
<P>
   There's no getting around it. When it comes to casting, Anne
Heche was more convincing as Harrison Ford's love interest than
Green is as the Dodgers' leading man.
</P>
<P>
   Green doesn't look the part, despite the fact he is strong and
supple and stands 6-foot-4. The modern superstar is expected to
wear tattoos like sunscreen and wear his weight in gold. Green, 27,
doesn't sport a tattoo, doesn't put diamond studs in his earlobes,
doesn't wrap gold ropes around his neck or wrists.
</P>
<P>
   His look is as austere as winter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity Raul Mondesi didn't leave a piece or two of his
jewelry behind when he migrated to Canada to take Green's place in
the Toronto outfield as part of the four-player deal that brought
Green to L.A. Goodness knows Mondesi had a few carats to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing remotely flashy about Green is his swing. When
the ball comes off his bat, it's as breathtaking as light
reflecting off a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was pitching batting practice
the other day from behind a protective screen when Green stepped to
the plate and took a few cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball jumps off his bat so quick,'' Dempsey said. ``The
ball whizzes by the mound so fast, it's scary sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Gary Sheffield said he doesn't need to see Green at the
plate to know when he is hitting. ``All you have to do is listen to
the sound,'' Sheffield said. ``When he makes contact, it sounds the
same way every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe that's the most noise Green makes? In the
clubhouse he prefers to blend into the background. He acts nothing
like the modern superstar who is expected to sit at his locker
cubicle and yak on his cell phone or tell crude jokes to someone
across the room and generally suck all the oxygen out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Green can be drawn like a breath into a clubhouse game, so long
as it's chess. He and Karros went to war for two hours the other
day. When it became clear Karros had positioned himself for the
kill, Green didn't angrily sweep the pieces off the board with the
brush of his arm, as would be expected of today's leading man.
</P>
<P>
   Green played it out, same as he would if he hit a chopper back
to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, misguided Green; he is infusing this character he has been
chosen to play with ability and courtesy and commitment and grit.
That's all well and good, but it won't play in Panorama City, much
less in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   No, the public long ago was conditioned to discount genuine
greatness.

PANEL SEEKS BETTER MONITORING   OF EXPERIMENTS USING PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also SCI-GENE-HEMOPHILIA) 
(DW) 
 By PHILLIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing failures of scientists to report problems, federal health
officials and members of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission
said Wednesday that changes are needed in the monitoring of
research on people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission heard testimony Wednesday as part of its review
of the safety and ethics of human research.
</P>
<P>
   It has been working for more than a year, holding hearings
around the United States, but during that time several problems in
experiments involving people have emerged. Federal regulators have
halted experiments at several major institutions citing violations
of ethics rules. Certain trials involving gene therapy were halted
after a patient died.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing testimony from witnesses representing the National
Institutes of Health and the federal Food and Drug Administration,
Dr. Harold T. Shapiro of Princeton University, chairman of the
bioethics commission, said: ``One problem we have heard again and
again is that, once an experiment is approved, there is a failure
to follow what's going on with the patients. I think there is a
growing consensus that something that something must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lana R. Skirboll, director of the Office of Science Policy,
acknowledged that there had been some serious problems with
experiments in gene therapy, which is designed to treat inherited
defects by giving patients infusions of working genes. She said
that NIH has begun to change procedures to deal with the problems
and noted that the Department of Health and Human Services would
soon announce further changes needed to protect participants in the
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue of Wednesday's discussion was the disclosure,
after the death of Jesse Gelsinger, a patient in a gene experiment
at the University of Pennsylvania, that scientists had often failed
to inform federal agencies of ``serious adverse effects'' involving
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse events can include anything that happens to a subject
while an experiment is under way, even things seemingly unrelated
to the research. (Sometimes a serious event may not appear to be
related to an experiment, but is later found to be related. For
example, if a patient falls down stairs and is injured, that may be
a accident, but if the patient was given a drug in an experiment
that brought on dizziness, the experimental drug could be
considered the cause of the fall.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the NIH said there had been 691 ``serious
adverse events'' in gene therapy experiments involving the use of
adenovirus, a weakened cold virus used to carry genes into the
body, but that scientists had reported only 39.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skirboll said the number for 1999 was 970 in adenovirus
experiments, and an additional 100 in other gene therapy
experiments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy experiments are among the hottest in medicine, and
the number is rising. Dr. Claudia Mickelson of MIT, who is chairman
of the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee that helps make
policy on what kind of gene experiments should be permitted, said
that in 1988 there was one experiment, but in 1999, there were 91.
In that period, there has been more than 300 experiments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few reports of success, but there is still hope
for the experimental treatments in a variety of conditions from
cancer to hemophilia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skirboll said that most of the reporting failures discussed
Wednesday involved potential problems, rather than harm to
patients. But she said the reporting is important both to
understand which types of experiments might be more hazardous, and
in building trust that scientists are carefully watching for
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This research we think is very exciting and may produce huge
benefits to human health ultimately,'' she said. ``But to get there
we have to go through the door of clinical trials with human
patients. And we can't go through there if we don't have the
patients' trust.''

ONCE A TEEN - AGE DRUG DEALER, REID NOW SEEKS A CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As a boxer, if David Reid does not take care of
things in the ring with his fists, his fate rests in the hands of
judges. But there was once a time when a Pennsylvania court judge
held Reid's fate in his hands, and his decision could have derailed
Reid's future as an Olympic champion and a world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the biggest fight of his career against Felix
Trinidad here at Caesars Palace on Friday night, Reid talked
candidly about his reckless years as a teen-age drug dealer in
Philadelphia and how his promising boxing career nearly got
sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   Reid faced three years in prison on charges of selling crack
cocaine, but a judge dismissed the charges and allowed Reid to get
on with his life as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if he saw me in his courtroom again he would
throw me in jail,'' Reid said. ``That was a chance of a lifetime,
getting off like that. I went on to win the Olympics, have a great
amateur career and now I'm in the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who is 14-0 and the WBA superwelterweight champion, will
face the toughest test of his career against Trinidad (36-0), the
WBA welterweight champion. Reid will earn his biggest payday, $3
million, and Trinidad will make $4 million. The fight will be shown
on pay-per-view by Showtime Event Television, with the undercard
beginning at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 26, has made a remarkable turnaround from the days when he
ran with a crew called the Marston Street Gang, selling drugs and
dodging bullets in North Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he and some of his fellow gang members had been
sitting around one day when a car drove by slowly and someone began
firing from the passenger's side. The bullets missed Reid and the
others, but struck an 8-year-old boy in the back. The boy survived
the shooting, but he was severely injured.
</P>
<P>
   Al Mitchell, Reid's trainer, was a surrogate father for the
young boxer. Mitchell tried to get Reid out of North Philadelphia,
taking him to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich.,
when Mitchell accepted a job there as the boxing coach in 1991.
Mitchell was also the coach of the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He was
trying to prepare Reid for the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1992, Reid said, he had grown tired of his idyllic life
at Northern Michigan, where he was not a student. ``Too many trees,
too much fresh air, too slow, not enough noise,'' Reid said. ``It
was great for me, but as a young person then I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid headed back to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went home that's all I knew was to sell drugs,'' Reid
said. ``I was selling crack. I never used it, because I knew what
it could do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he sold drugs, Reid said: ``To eat. Money for
school. To buy clothes. I was young. I really didn't have to do it.
I could have gone another route, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his criminal activities nearly gave his mother, Marie, a
nervous breakdown. When Reid was 19, in 1993, he was picked up on
an outstanding bench warrant on a drug selling charge. Mitchell,
who had remained in touch with Reid, said he got his brother,
Arnold, who works at the state court in Philadelphia, to put in a
good word with the judge on Reid's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this is a good kid, he just needs a break,''
Mitchell said he told his brother. ``About 85 percent of the kids
in the inner city need help. If someone doesn't pull you out,
you're going to get swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he spent six days in jail on the bench warrant, but he
did not serve any time on the drug charges. He said the case was
dismissed, because the arresting officer in the case was himself
arrested and charged with selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said if he had gone to jail for three years, his life would
have been much different. ``I would have come out not wanting to
box,'' Reid said. ``I hadn't learned anything and I would have gone
back to the thing I knew, which was selling drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after he got out of jail on the bench warrant, he won
at the Olympic Festival. In 1996 he became the only U.S. boxer to
win a gold medal at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I've been through everything, but fighting
Trinidad is something I want to experience in my lifetime, because
being an Olympic champion you want to face the best,'' Reid said.
``It's either going to make you a man or a boy. This is the turning
point of my career. This right here is going to make me a man.''

NCAA CRITICIZES ST. JOHN'S HANDLING OF BARKLEY CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the NCAA rebuked St. John's on Wednesday,
saying school officials had misrepresented the facts surrounding
Erick Barkley's eligibility case to the media and had refused to
follow the organization's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Dempsey's statement was a departure from the NCAA's
policy of not commenting about possible violations _ the NCAA is
considering St. John's appeal of Barkley's suspension for receiving
tuition aid. His statement is also another sign of how contentious
the relationship between the two sides is.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA president disputed several claims made by St. John's
athletic director, Ed Manetta Jr., and its coach, Mike Jarvis.
Dempsey also challenged the school's defiant stance, which has also
been embraced by St. John's president, the Rev. Donald J.
Harrington, throughout the monthlong investigation into the Red
Storm's basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, a sophomore guard, was declared ineligible moments
before the Red Storm faced Seton Hall on Tuesday night, when the
NCAA ruled the $3,150 Barkley received from Riverside Church to
attend Maine Central Institute in 1997-98 violated the
organization's amateurism bylaw.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's statement, Dempsey disputed everything from St.
John's account of the hours leading up to that decision to the
repeated criticisms by university officials that the NCAA adheres
to a guilty-until-proven innocent credo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In media accounts today, St. John's has given the appearance
that the NCAA is holding up the process. Quite the contrary,''
Dempsey said in the statement. ``What held up the process is that
the university did not provide information necessary to make an
interpretation of NCAA legislation. The university has known there
was concern about the eligibility of one of its student-athletes
since Feb. 17. The university did not provide its final report to
the NCAA until late yesterday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime of Tuesday's game, St. John's issued a statement
that said it had completed its internal investigation of Barkley's
tuition arrangement at 10 a.m. that day and ``at that time''
notified the NCAA there had been no violation. St. John's said the
NCAA informed them at 5:05 p.m., however, that a violation had
indeed occurred and Barkley must be ruled ineligible or the
university would face more serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey also challenged St. John's refusal to acknowledge that a
violation had occurred. Instead, Manetta asserted Tuesday that the
university and NCAA ``divert from each other on interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA staff works with its member schools every day to
interpret bylaws,'' Dempsey said. ``These bylaw interpretations
sometimes show that certain activities are contrary to rules and
are violations. The interpretation process is one that has been
used for years. When a university disagrees with an interpretation
of rules, it can take the issue to an interpretation committee for
review. St. John's declined to utilize this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Manetta said Wednesday that St. John's stands by its version of
the events. ``I can understand why the NCAA felt the need to defend
the process,'' Manetta said in a statement. ``I've read the press
release and I have no further comment other than to reiterate the
statement that we issued last night, which is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey also indicated the NCAA has grown weary of St. John's
depiction of the organization as unfair and oppressive. When
Barkley was suspended on Feb. 5 for swapping cars with a family
friend who also was a Rucker League coach, Jarvis angrily compared
the NCAA to the Gestapo and said he felt he had been ``raped'' _
remarks for which he later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's has filed an appeal for Barkley's reinstatement that
will be ruled on by NCAA staff perhaps as early as Thursday. If
that appeal is denied, St. John's can ask the Division I
Reinstatement Appeal Committee to rule before the Red Storm's game
Sunday with Miami. That group is composed of administrators and
faculty members from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, DerMarr Johnson of Cincinnati was suspended one game
and told to pay an undisclosed amount of restitution by the NCAA
for accepting $7,000 from a summer Amateur Athletic Union coach to
attend the same prep school.

BELTRE NEGOTIATION INCHING ALONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Though slow and laborious, it appears
progress was made in negotiation between the Los Angeles Dodgers
and Adrian Beltre's agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   Boras and Bob Daly, managing general partner and CEO, met for
two hours Wednesday at Dodgertown to discuss a multi-year deal. For
the first time during the negotiation process, financial aspects of
a contract were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Boras wouldn't discuss the financial terms of what is
believed to be a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged a lot of data,'' Boras said. ``The dialogue is
good, the attitudes are good and we're doing our best. We got into
comparables (of how Beltre would measure to other players) and
discussions of more into the economics of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting Boras compared Beltre to other major-league
players who are making at least $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Daly would comment after the negotiating
session; the Dodgers media relations department failed to contact
Daly for a statement or to address requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boras and Daly will talk again this afternoon and hope a deal
can be worked out before Boras leaves town Friday seems to be
fading. The negotiation is being bogged down by the unknown:
whether arbitrator Shyam Das will rule in favor of Beltre's request
to be a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, is seeking free agency because the Dodgers signed
him at age 15, which is against baseball rules. A hearing date is
expected to be announced soon by Das, who just ruled on the John
Rocker issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of it is there are risks on both sides, and we
understand, and that's why we're negotiating,'' Boras said. ``But
this is not a customary negotiation. It is not something that is
standardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a player with Beltre's experience (one-plus year at the
major-league level) has his contract renewed by the club with
little incident or negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with less than three years service time, the Dodgers
must renew Beltre's contract by March 10. The club has its own
deadline of midnight tonight, but Boras made it clear that he's not
here to work on that. Beltre made $220,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be negotiating a one-year contract for Adrian
Beltre,'' Boras said. ``If the Dodgers are going to renew us,
they'll renew us. We're going to pursue this from the standpoint of
trying to resolve the issue as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Depth at shortstop: If Alex Cora wins the starting shortstop
job, which is what the Dodgers are planning, the club will probably
look to carry three players that have extensive experience at that
position.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean Jose Vizcaino, who manager Davey Johnson likes in a
utility role, and non-roster invitee Kevin Elster, who has the
right- handed power the Dodgers need off the bench, could make the
opening- day club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you double-switch on the shortstop, you want to have
another middle infielder in case something happens,'' Johnson said.
``I have to have those parts, and I don't want to weaken my
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro will also be given a chance, but his lack of offense
is such an issue it makes him a long shot. Johnson also said
utility outfielder F.P. Santangelo and second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek, both of whom played shortstop, weren't part of the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Dodgers signed pitchers Matt Herges, Jamie
Arnold, Kris Foster and Chad Ricketts and outfielders Kevin Gibbs
and Tony Mota to one-year contracts.... In need of power off the
bench, Johnson said he'll look at former Oakland slugger Geronimo
Berroa at first base to backup Eric Karros.... Sen. Jack Latvala
(R-Palm Harbor) officially introduced a bill to Florida legislature
that could provide $7 to $8 million of funding to various spring
training sites, including Dodgertown.

UNARMED MAN KILLED BY OFFICER JUST BLOCKS FROM WHERE DIALLO DIED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 23-year-old unarmed man was shot dead by a
plainclothes police officer Wednesday night after a struggle in a
Bronx apartment building just three blocks from where Amadou Diallo
was killed last year, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Malcolm Ferguson, who the police said was on parole for
a drug conviction, was shot once in the head, at about 6:30 p.m.,
and declared dead at the scene, said John Scanlon, the Police
Department's chief of patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of hours, scores of people had gathered behind
police tape on the street, some carrying signs in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said five housing officers who were part of an anti-drug
unit had been traveling to a public housing unit in the Soundview
section of the Bronx, but as they passed by, they noticed something
going on in a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers went to go into the hallway, and one individual
bolted up the stairs,'' Scanlon said. ``An officer pursued after
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, on the second-floor landing, there was a
struggle,'' Scanlon continued. ``The officer's firearm discharged
and the individual succumbed.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., Scanlon said that no weapon had been found on
Ferguson, but that there was ``a continuing investigation for
weapons and other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the police had found that Ferguson was carrying ``a
quantity of heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson had been arrested on drug charges six times dating back
to 1995, and was on parole until April 3 for selling drugs, the
police said. He was also one of dozens of protesters arrested last
Friday after the four officers who shot Diallo, an unarmed
immigrant, were acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said that the officer who shot Ferguson, Louis Rivera,
was Hispanic. Ferguson was black. Of the five officers in the unit,
one was white, two were black and the other two Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
who arrived shortly after the shooting, said that the police had
changed their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not told there was a scuffle,'' Siegel said. ``I was
told initially that he was running from the cop.''

 &HT;        Democrats Bash Ridge on Education Remarks   By Laura J.
Winter   c. 2000 States News Service   WASHINGTON (March 1) -
<TEXT>
Pennsylvania's Democratic musclemen on Capitol Hill towed the party
line Wednesday admonishing Republican Gov. Tom Ridge for statements
he made about President Clinton's education funding priorities
Monday.
<P>
   Democrats the likes of former mayor Ed Rendell called Ridge's
comments partisan. The governor's spokesman Tim Reeves called the
Democrats' remarks ``Beltway backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Rep.
Bob Brady D-Philadelphia and senate hopeful Rep. Ron Klink
D-Pittsburgh called Ridge's statements ``offensive.'' They took
special issue with the governor's characterization of Clinton
administration programs and proposals as ``token little programs,
which really don't do anything except generate headlines and really
don't improve the public education.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was referring to programs and proposals like
funding school construction, reducing class sizes by hiring 100,000
new teachers and Headstart - which already serves 30,000
Pennsylvania children, 7,000 of whom attend Philadelphia schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked he made that statement,'' Rendell said. ``Does
Gov. Ridge think that the 30,000 kids in Pennsylvania are
'token?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the governor meant is what he said,'' said Reeves. ``That
the Clinton Administration has forgotten what we know President
Clinton knew before becoming president. That is: the 'Beltway boys'
don't know best. There are literally 501 needs for our 501 school
districts. Some of the federal education initiatives are just what
they need and for some others it is not what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves added that during the governor's recent trip to
Washington, he pressed congressional GOP leaders to pay 40 percent
of Pennsylvania's special education bill - as is stated in the 1972
federal law - in order to free-up state education funds.
Pennsylvania receives 13 percent of its special education funds
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Ridge's proposed budget, the state will spend $97 million on
special education programs in Philadelphia - the missing 27 percent
in federal funds equals $26.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the governor in his meeting with congressional GOP
leaders missed an opportunity to bring federal school construction
dollars to Philadelphia and all of Pennsylvania. As part of his
budget proposal, Clinton asked Congress to give $24.8 billion in
tax credits to modernize schools and to appropriate $1.3 billion
for 8,300 renovation projects nation wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit more offended because the city of Philadelphia is
effected,'' Brady said. ``I toured my district with the former
mayor. The schools are deplorable. The bathrooms don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have schools that are over 100 years old,'' Klink
said. ``What the governor is saying is let's put this on the
property owner and the taxpayer.''

SALES TAX GONE FOR GOOD ON MOST CLOTHING; CIGARETTE TAX RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City shoppers found bargains Wednesday in
sweaters, slacks, leotards, lab coats and other garments as the
8.25 percent combined city and state sales tax was eliminated for
nearly all clothing and shoes at $110 or less _ this time, for
good.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut will cost the city $237 million in revenue in the
coming fiscal year, Department of Finance officials have estimated.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has made sales tax relief a
priority for the past four years, predicted the repeal would
discourage New York shoppers from crossing the Hudson River to
avoid the tax, and the resulting spike in sales would ultimately
lead to thousands of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic example of one hand giving and the other taking
away, Wednesday was also the day that the state tax on a package of
cigarettes went up by 55 cents, to a total of $1.11, the highest of
any state. As the new tax took effect, newsstands that used to get
$3.65 to $3.85 a pack began charging $4.50 to $5.
</P>
<P>
   But clothing shoppers around the city Wednesday said they were
grateful for the sales tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked all night but somehow I found the energy to come out
and shop,'' said Carmen Flores, a registered nurse who headed for
Bloomingdale's as soon as she got off the night shift at Lenox Hill
Hospital. ``I'll probably end up spending just as much, but it
feels better knowing I'll save the tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sayevich, a New York businessman, said he waited until
Wednesday to buy clothes for his vacation. ``Basically, I'm looking
at this as a kind of bonus,'' he said as he emerged from Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Before eliminating the sales tax, New York officials tested the
waters by staging seven sales-tax-free weeks, beginning in 1997.
Giuliani said these trials were a huge success, with some retailers
experiencing as much as a 77 percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But some shoppers said Wednesday that they wished the ceiling
had been raised to $500, as it was during the experiment. Lora
Rassi, an interior design consultant from Manhattan, said the tax
relief would come in handy when she bought clothes for her two
sons, but not for her own wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to purchase things over $110,'' she said as she
examined _ and then rejected _ a pair of multicolored, sequined
slides that carried a $108 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Four percentage points of the sales tax cut applied everywhere
across the state, with an estimated annual loss in revenue to the
state of almost $600 million, said Marc E. Carey, a spokesman for
the Department of Taxation and Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Local governments were given the option of deciding whether to
get rid of their sales tax, and only four cities besides New York
(Fulton, Norwich, Gloversville and Sherrill) and 14 of the state's
62 counties went along, creating disparities that are likely to
confuse consumers. In Westchester County, for example, the sales
tax now ranges from 2.75 percent in much of the county to 4.25
percent in Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon. Rockland and
Suffolk Counties are tax-free, but Nassau County has a 4.25 percent
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester officials rejected the sales tax exemption because
it would have cost between $27 million and $35 million, a loss that
would have required an increase in property taxes, said Susan
Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Andy Spano, the county executive. ``The
main problem in Westchester County is not high sales taxes,'' she
said. ``It's high property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some confusion is also likely to arise when consumers try to
figure out which items are exempt and which are not. Belt buckles
and handkerchiefs are not taxed, for example, but handbags and hair
bows are. A sports uniform is tax-free, but a helmet or a catcher's
mitt is not.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption also applies to fabric, thread, buttons and snaps,
and to alterations made to tax-free clothing. But jewelry and
watches continue to be taxed. As do gowns for Barbie dolls and
coats for cocker spaniels. The exemption applies only to ``clothing
and footwear worn by humans,'' the department made clear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sales tax relief was originally supposed to take effect on
Dec. 1 but was deferred at the request of the retail industry,
which feared that consumers would stay away from stores on the day
after Thanksgiving, a mega-shopping day known as Black Friday. But
that delay resulted in Wednesday's collision between the sales tax
cut and the cigarette tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers visiting newsstands and candy stores experienced sticker
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Bent, who works in a theater box office, paid $5 for a pack
of cigarettes Wednesday and then went shopping for clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a $40 jacket and gave the tax I saved over for
cigarettes,'' he said. ``It's a rip-off: you take away the sales
tax on clothes and raise the cigarette tax. I'm not getting a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional tax on tobacco _ intended to go toward providing
coverage for people without health insurance _ is expected to raise
about $273 million in the next fiscal year, said Carey of the state
taxation department. The last increase in the state's cigarette tax
came in 1993, when it climbed to 56 cents a pack, from 39 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For Muhammed Hossain, who operates a newsstand outside the
subway station at 72nd Street and Broadway, the tax increase was a
big blow. Still, his experience suggested that the increase would
have the desired effect of antitobacco groups, to discourage
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big drop in sales today,'' Hossain said as he was
hand-lettering a sign to reflect the new price. ``Nobody is buying
cigarettes today. Three customers gave their packs back when I told
them it was $4.50. One guy said: `This is my last pack. I'm
quitting.'''

FOR OPERA LOVERS, A WORLDWIDE WEB CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By PETER DIZIKES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many opera buffs claim to be technophiles, but in my
observation, that usually goes only as far as their audio
equipment. They are generally happy to leave the world of computers
to the electronic music crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be hard to imagine members of, say, the local
Wagner Society hunkering down to learn HTML, the Web has scores of
impressive sites about opera and is a rich source of information
about all aspects of this enduring art form.
</P>
<P>
   The sites include detailed reference collections, encyclopedias
of librettos, fan pages dedicated to performers, archives of rare
audio clips and global listings of schedules and performances _ the
better for planning that much-anticipated trip to Vienna or San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of opera, the Web is truly worldwide, and fans,
whether ardent or casual, have never had so much material at their
fingertips. Even a neophyte operagoer, using the Web, can easily
make arrangements to see a particular opera, study the libretto,
learn about its production history and sample some of its music.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious starting point for planning to attend a performance,
Operabase (www.operabase.com), available in six languages, contains
an exhausting (if not quite exhaustive) compilation of worldwide
schedules, recent reviews, festivals and opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   A searchable database even lets you to find out the activities
of specific performers: the mezzo-soprano Cecelia Bartoli, for
instance, will be appearing in Zurich, Paris and Berlin this spring
and summer, but not in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Operabase's interactive global map is useful if you want to
fit some opera into a travel itinerary. I tried clicking on Europe,
then on Italy, and then Milan, and found that the schedule for La
Scala had been updated through next October. For each opera house
listed, ticket-ordering information was also provided.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have made plans to see a performance, go to the Public
Domain Opera Libretti site
(php.indiana.edu/(tilde)lneff/librettik.html). This site has a
formidable collection of 18th- and 19th-century librettos, and the
operas are listed by both composer and title.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer modern operas, as these librettos are not yet in
the public domain. Translations are not provided, but there are
links to other libretto Web sites, as well as a lot of
bibliographic information about finding librettos in print.
</P>
<P>
   Those who just can't wait to get to the opera house can warm up
their vocal cords at home, using the Aria Database
(www.aria-database.com). It is a collection of the lyrics to more
than 1,000 arias, many of which also have sound files of the
background music in MIDI format. Of course, the sound quality of
these compressed files is not perfect. While listening to Don
Jose's ``Flower Song'' from ``Carmen,'' for example, it would be
hard to imagine that you were inside the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when it comes to singing along, your results may
also vary from Placido Domingo's.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Domingo, the Tenorissimo site (www.r-ds.com), is
a thorough fan page that has a biography, a discography, a list of
Domingo's roles and links to the accompanying librettos. It also
lists his schedule, links to newspaper and magazine reviews that
are posted on the site the day they appear, audio clips and copious
photographs. It even has an audio file of his recorded New York
taxi message: ``Buckle your seatbelt for safety, because you are
important.'' Now, that's a fan page.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other fine fan sites about singers, and
Operaglass (opera.stanford.edu) is a good place to find links to
them. Operaglass itself is a trove of information, with a growing
collection of plot synopses, ``performance histories'' that show
when operas were first performed in various countries and a long
list of composers and their works.
</P>
<P>
   And for some aural history, readers can listen to singers from
earlier in the century at a Web site run by an idiosyncratic singer
named Carlton Higginbotham. This site (www.bassocantante.com) has
good audio clips of many famous voices, including Enrico Caruso and
Marian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   All told, opera lovers are taking to the Web so readily that I
may even have to change my long-standing image of them, and of
Wagnerians in particular. Although Wagner himself was chronically
wary of the future, at least 13 Wagner societies worldwide have
their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the Wagner Society of Northern California
(www.wagnersf.org) says, a bit awkwardly, ``Wagner is sometimes
best enjoyed in groups.'' True enough. And since these groups now
extend into cyberspace, perhaps opera is sometimes best enjoyed on
the Web, too. &QL;

IN SENATE CAMPAIGN, CHARGES LINKING SUPPORTERS AND GUNS

   VALLEY COTTAGE, N.Y. _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton warned
elementary school children here about the danger of guns Wednesday,
her campaign staff sharply criticized New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for accepting a donation from Charlton Heston, the
president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign countered with a statement saying that
Clinton was a hypocrite for bringing up the issue because her
campaign had accepted a donation from the rap impresario Sean
Combs, who was indicted last month on weapons possession charges
stemming from a shooting in December at a Manhattan nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Coming a day after a 6-year-old boy in Michigan shot a
6-year-old girl in a first-grade classroom, Clinton's comments were
calculated to buttress support from those who favor more stringent
gun control, which both she and Giuliani have advocated. In this
Rockland County hamlet, where she spent the morning talking to
students at Valley Cottage Elementary School, she said she would
strive to ``stop children from killing each other and stop guns
from getting into the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end by asking you, because you are going to be such
good citizens, to do me a very big favor,'' Clinton said in a
gymnasium filled with fourth and fifth graders. She asked the
students to question their parents about whether they owned guns
and to promise that they would ``never play with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plea to the students, delivered before a phalanx of
television cameras, provoked an angry exchange between the managers
of the Clinton and Giuliani campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign manager, Howard Wolfson, issued what he
called a ``pre-emptive statement'' in the form of a news release on
Heston's $1,000 contribution in December to the Giuliani campaign.
``The National Rifle Association opposes the kind of sensible gun
control legislation that would save lives and prevent tragedy's
like yesterday's school shooting in Michigan,'' Wolfson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum,
said Clinton had undermined her position on gun-related violence by
accepting a $1,000 campaign contribution in October from Combs, the
entrepreneur rapper who performs under the name Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mrs. Clinton wanted to make a statement about gun violence,
she should have returned that money,'' Teitelbaum told reporters at
City Hall. ``We're talking about hypocrisy and we're talking about
phoniness, and that is the core of what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rockland County, Clinton also traveled to Pearl River for a
lunch meeting of the Rockland Business Association. She told more
than 100 of the county's executives that she favored deregulation
of utility companies to lower costs for power and the creation of
business incubators for entrepreneurial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended her campaign swing with a brief visit to nurses
picketing outside Nyack Hospital. The nurses, members of the New
York State Nurses Association, have been on strike for 72 days,
principally over what they say is inadequate staffing and the
requirement that they work double shifts, said Lee Levine, a
spokeswoman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose motorcade stopped for 15 minutes next to the line
of pickets, said she was making the visit as a ``morale booster.''

U.S. STALLS SELECTION OF NEW IMF CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT quote.)  
(js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton pledged this week to block a
German finance ministry official from assuming the top post at the
International Monetary Fund, in effect vetoing the man the European
Union had chosen for the job, he seemed to risk a diplomatic
confrontation across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   What really happened, Clinton administration and some European
officials now say, is that the president agreed to play the heavy
because both U.S. and European diplomats had trouble communicating
across the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   During the four months that Germany was aggressively promoting
Caio Koch-Weser to take over at the IMF, ending with Europe's
formal endorsement by the 15-nation European Union, officials from
the United States, Britain, Italy and France had regular
conversations in which they agreed broadly on two things: The next
head of the IMF should be a European and the European should not be
Koch-Weser, several Clinton administration officials and European
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. and European officials said that Koch-Weser, a genial
55-year-old state secretary in Germany's finance ministry, lacks
the gravitas and financial expertise to lead the IMF at a time when
it is arguably more powerful than ever before. The problem for
fellow Europeans, and later for Americans, was that Germany ignored
some early signs of unease with Koch-Weser and started the nation's
most aggressive diplomatic campaign in years to install him as head
of the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``By choosing to peddle politeness as openness,'' said a senior
administration official, they backed us into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   That description of events serves U.S. interests, of course, by
cloaking an unusual and potentially explosive decision in the garb
of a broader diplomatic imperative. It also contradicts public
statements that European ministers have made in recent days,
including several comments chastising Washington for its hubris.
</P>
<P>
   But European officials confirmed in interviews that they
supported Koch-Weser mainly to preserve European unity in the face
of an unyielding German campaign rather than because they agreed he
should head the IMF, a post held by a European ever since the
institution was created just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even as they publicly rallied behind Koch-Weser, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin of France and Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
of Italy have been calling each other to discuss new candidates for
the job, diplomats told about the conversations said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition in Europe is solidarity on decisions of this
kind,'' one European diplomat said. ``But there is also an
understanding of the position of the United States. There is
certainly no crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the world often has a hard time selecting leaders for the
main international institutions _ succession at the United Nations
and the World Trade Organization has been contentious as well _ the
search for a head of the monetary fund shows how diplomatically
delicate, and deeply flawed, the search process has become,
administration officials and outside experts say. If there is a
single lesson from the search, it is that the current process,
whereby interested countries nominate their own citizens for key
posts and then use their diplomatic influence to support them,
needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' rejection of Koch-Weser _ and its decision at
this stage not to back anyone else _ means that when the monetary
fund conducts an informal vote on Thursday, there will almost
certainly be no winner. Aside from Koch-Weser, there are two other
candidates. Stanley Fischer, the American who serves as deputy
managing director, was nominated by a group of 20 African and Arab
countries. Japan has nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance
ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after that is uncertain. Clinton administration
officials and European officials say that they hope German
officials will realize after the straw poll, if they have not
already, that the nomination of Koch-Weser was a mistake. That
would clear the way for other possible European candidates,
including the British and Italian finance ministers and the head of
the Bank for International Settlements, who are more likely to
generate broad support, according to U.S. and European officials.

</P>
<P>
   The search for a new IMF leader began last October, when it
became clear to top financial officials that Michel Camdessus of
France, who led the monetary fund for 13 years, planned to retire
two years before the end of his term. The post immediately
attracted a slew of potential European candidates. But the
strongest push came from Germany, which had made clear its
intention of taking a larger role in international institutions and
felt that the French, who have named most IMF directors, should not
claim this one as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans immediately put forward Koch-Weser. On paper, at
least, he had the perfect resume. An economist who worked for a
quarter-century at the World Bank, Koch-Weser had extensive
contacts in financial circles around the world, spoke six languages
and was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of all of Germany's small
circle of financial bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser also had good political ties at home, people who
worked with him said. He left the World Bank in Washington, where
he had risen to managing director, one of the five most senior
posts, to return to Germany soon after the election of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. The new chancellor named him state secretary at
the finance ministry, the No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Larry Summers made clear from the start,
including in conversations with Koch-Weser during meetings in
Europe and Tokyo, that he did not favor the German's bid to head
the fund. The two had known each other when both were working at
the World Bank in the early 1990s. Summers' main concern was that
Koch-Weser was a specialist in poverty relief and had no expertise
in finance. Moreover, the German was seen as a go-along-get-along
guy who thrived at the World Bank by working well with the
bureaucracy, not by leading it, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Koch-Weser's candidacy did not ring alarm bells at
the Treasury Department. Administration officials said the European
reaction to Koch-Weser was even cooler than their own, especially
among France, Britain and Italy. It was given low odds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States was drawn directly into the European fray by
Schroeder himself. Early last month, he called Clinton _ the two
have a close relationship, administration officials said _ and
lobbied him directly. Clinton used diplomatic language to convey to
Schroeder that Koch-Weser had not demonstrated that he had broad
support, not only in Europe but also around the world. Yet, in part
because administration officials still believed Koch-Weser's
chances of getting European backing were slim, Clinton assured
Schroeder that the United States had no objections to a German
candidate per se.
</P>
<P>
   Germany began promoting Clinton's friendly words as a tacit
endorsement, administration officials said. Schroeder promptly flew
to Paris to meet with President Jacques Chirac and Jospin. The
French, who had been the only Europeans to publicly challenge
Koch-Weser's qualifications, were told that Clinton had no problem
with Koch-Weser provided he became the unified European choice,
according to people told about Schroeder's conversation with the
French.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign gathered steam, Clinton administration officials
began fretting that they had been too passive early on. Summers;
Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser; Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser; and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had a series of phone calls to debate strategy.
Sensing that a confrontation with Germany might be inevitable,
Berger and Sperling began doing their own research on Koch-Weser.
If they were going to risk German ire, they wanted to be certain
that Treasury's opinion of Koch-Weser was right, officials said.
Both Sperling and Berger ended up agreeing with the Treasury view,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was the most reluctant of Clinton's top advisers to risk
a diplomatic split with Germany, administration officials said. But
as the European Union endorsement became inevitable last week, he
agreed that it was better to try to stop the candidacy now than to
stay silent and possibly set off a bigger, public confrontation
later.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Clinton initiated a call to Schroeder. The message
was unmistakable: The United States wants a European for the job,
but not Koch-Weser. &QL;

NOTES FROM 1994 SHOW FED'S INNER WORKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve began its last big round of
interest rate increases, in 1994, without any clear sense of how
strong the economy was, how many rate increases would be needed or
how the stock and bond markets would react, according to
transcripts released Wednesday of the central bank's policy
meetings for that year.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts show the sway held over the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee by the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, and reveal how concerned Greenspan was even then with
the possibility that stock prices were becoming out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in which the Fed had cut rates and then held
them at low levels to nurse the economy through a downturn,
Greenspan recommended a quarter-point increase in the benchmark
federal funds target rate in February 1994, to 3.25 percent, to
forestall the threat that a recent surge in growth would generate
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately came under pressure from interest rate ``hawks''
to approve a half-point rate increase. But Greenspan pressed the
committee to go along with him, warning about the perils of a split
within the Fed and saying too big a move would destabilize the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the committee voted unanimously to raise rates by a
quarter-point, as Greenspan wanted. It went on to raise rates six
more times in the next year, doubling the federal funds rate to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, nearly three years before Greenspan began worrying
publicly about ``irrational exuberance'' in the stock market, the
Fed chairman was clearly concerned that investors were creating a
bubble in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when both the stock and bond markets fell sharply after
the February rate increase, Greenspan said the Fed had ``partially
broke the back of an emerging speculation in equities.'' &QL;

TIMING TAKES ATTENTION AWAY FROM MISSOURI PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON and STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Super Tuesday isn't looking quite so super in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   With California, New York and Ohio primaries taking place on the
same day as Missouri's March 7 voting _ and with big-prize Texas
and Florida to follow a week later _ presidential candidates and
their advertising dollars are rarely seen in the Show Me State.
</P>
<P>
   With 28 primaries or caucuses in little more than two weeks,
scarcity of time and money argue for skipping flyover country.
</P>
<P>
   So why should Al Gore come to Kansas City for a bite of
Missouri's 92 Democratic delegates when they could troll for votes
in Brooklyn and some of New York's 294 delegates?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that Missouri is being ignored on purpose,''
said Washington Democratic political consultant Annie Burns. ``It's
just that with these bigger states, Missouri would have had to have
its primary before March 7 to draw anybody's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Or why should George W. Bush spend days in a state that offers
35 Republican delegates when California offers 162?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to play where the big enchiladas are,'' said Evan
Tracey of the Virginia-based Campaign Media Analysis Group.
</P>
<P>
   His company tracks where and when candidates buy television
time. So far, only former Sen. Bill Bradley has purchased blocks in
Missouri; commercials started airing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got all their money into running spots in California,
New York, Ohio,'' Tracey said. ``That's where there's the most at
stake in the next week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The treasure trove of delegates available in 16 Super Tuesday
states easily ranks as the richest of the campaign. For Democrats,
31 percent of the 4,336 delegates are on the line. For Republicans,
nearly 27 percent of their 2,066 delegates are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone, by measure of the 2000 campaign stopwatch, is the
time when a candidate could afford to blitz a small state such as
Iowa with radio spots, television commercials and mailed brochures.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller states such as Missouri, the campaign has moved to
the generic national monologues delivered on C-Span, the two-minute
stories squeezed into the network news and an occasional airport
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten something in the mail asking for money, but that's
it,'' said Harold Fridkin, a Kansas City lawyer and former aide to
the late U.S. Rep. Richard Bolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense there's much awareness among people that
Missouri has its primary coming up,'' he said. ``They just know
about the national campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that, he said, is because the local media haven't had
much to cover in the way of presidential campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dropped into Kansas City's Downtown Airport last week,
barely staying much longer than needed to refuel his plane.
Wednesday he sandwiched stops in St. Louis and Springfield while on
his way from Atlanta (Georgia has 54 GOP delegates) to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona is scheduled for an airport rally
Thursday night in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who grew up in Crystal City, Mo., officially announced
his candidacy there last year, stopped by the Kansas City Downtown
Airport last month but won't be here for the week leading up to
Super Tuesday. His wife, Ernestine, came to Kansas City on
Wednesday, however.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis supporters of Gore, who has come to Missouri 14 times
as vice president, hear he might stop in on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the bottom line,'' said Doug Hattaway, a national spokesman
for Gore, ``we have to go where the delegates are.''
</P>
<P>
   The political parties in Missouri pledge delegates in
dramatically different ways. For the GOP, all 35 delegates will be
awarded to the candidate who gets the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the process is more complicated. Forty-nine
delegates will be awarded based on Tuesday's vote in the state's
nine congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   That March 7 vote also will determine the proportion of 26
delegates pledged to Gore or Bradley and chosen when party leaders
meet May 6 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the state will send 17 so-called ``super'' delegates to
the Democratic National Convention, mostly elected officials such
as Gov. Mel Carnahan and five members of Congress who are free to
back either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Any registered voter can participate Tuesday in any of the five
party primaries. So on Primary Day, voters can ask for a Democratic
or Republican ballot or one from the Libertarian, Reform or
Constitution parties.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's first primary was in 1988, the year U.S. Rep. Richard
Gephardt, a St. Louis Democrat, ran for president. However, efforts
to pass a law making the primary permanent failed, so caucuses were
held in 1992 and 1996. The law that created the 2000 primary and
made primaries in Missouri a permanent event passed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Rebecca Cook, an advocate of the primary
system, said the change will be a big improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the caucus system, only about 2 percent of Missouri
voters participated, and I found many Missourians wanting a primary
to have a better opportunity to be part of the presidential
selection process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Missouri's voters turned out for the 1988
primary, and Cook expects a similar turnout this year.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll be turning out for a contest in which the candidates
are slugging it out elsewhere.

KINGS MEET TO IRON OUT KINKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are plenty of excuses to explain a loss and
a tie in the Los Angeles Kings' past two games. But Bryan Smolinski
knows better.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings center met for 15 minutes Wednesday with coach Andy
Murray and linemate Glen Murray to discuss the lack of scoring and
intensity from the team's second unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better that we are fighting this now than during the
playoffs,'' Smolinski said. ``But we have to make sure this is a
two-, three- or four-game thing that everybody goes through. It was
good to meet and talk about things. (Murray) still has confidence
and that helps it not get out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   When Luc Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel were
sidelined in November and early December, the second unit carried
the offense. Smolinski was among the NHL's leading scorers and
considered the key to the deal that brought he and Palffy from the
New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, clocked with one of the league's hardest shots, had
three two-goal games in a five-game stretch. Donald Audette had 10
goals in his first 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   All that has faded. Smolinski does not have a goal in his past
seven games and one in his past 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret he has struggled,'' Andy Murray said
Wednesday, as the team was preparing for tonight's game against the
Carolina Hurricanes. ``We need him to work and play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray had four goals on the Kings' seven-game trip but
played poorly in Tuesday's 1-1 tie with the Vancouver Canucks.
Audette's season has unraveled. He has one goal since Dec.14 and
spent six weeks on injured reserve with a badly sprained left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   During Audette's absence, rookie Jason Blake played the left
wing and showed good chemistry with the other two. Three games
after Audette's return, he was back on the second line and there
were comments on the bench about the loss of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   What made it worse in the tie with Vancouver was the Kings twice
botched 5-on-3 advantages on the power play. The blame didn't go to
the first line, which includes Palffy, the team's leading scorer
(63 points), and Robitaille, who has a career-high 14-game scoring
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski took the whole thing personally and has had several
discussions with Andy Murray looking for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been to the playoffs since the 1995-96 season with
Pittsburgh. With 19 games left and the Kings sixth in the
eight-team Western Conference race, Smolinski knows this should be
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to shut up and work hard,'' he said. ``It would
be great to get a goal. Even better to make it a power play goal.''

NEW YORK CATHOLICS PLAY DOWN STRIFE OVER BUSH'S BOB JONES VISIT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York's Republican primary approaches, Roman
Catholic leaders and laymen are playing down the importance of the
recent strife within the party over anti-Catholic fundamentalism,
saying they will likely vote on the basis of substantive issues
that touch their day-to-day lives and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   From Bishop Thomas Daily of Brooklyn, spiritual leader of 1.7
million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens, to Republican voters like
George T. Parker, a retired chemist in Rensselaer County, Catholics
said the dispute over George W. Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University was not the make-or-break issue of the election. The
school's president, Bob Jones, has called Catholicism ``the
religion of the Antichrist and a satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily said that while he considered the university's rhetoric
offensive, ``it's a matter of praying for them so they come to see
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more troubling, he said, was the Texas governor's record on
capital punishment. In recent years, Pope John Paul II and the
nation's Catholic bishops have become increasingly outspoken
against the death penalty. Since Bush became governor in 1994,
Texas has executed 120 convicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Catholics, if they're really concerned about issues,
even in regard to Governor Bush, they might be concerned about
capital punishment in Texas, where they put more people to death
than in any other state in the union,'' Daily said. ``That's the
more fundamental issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop said voters in Brooklyn and Queens had more immediate
problems than debating whether Bush should have spoken at the
university. ``We have real concerns about immigrants and poor
people trying to survive, living two, three families to an
apartment to share the rent,'' he said, adding that health care and
education were also critical issues he hoped to hear the candidates
take on.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Neuhaus, editor in chief of a conservative
monthly called First Things, said he considered Bush's appearance
at Bob Jones unimportant. ``Everybody speaks at Bob Jones,'' he
said. ``It's a major center down there, and politicians make
speeches where they have crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent for the Republican nomination, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, has repeatedly attacked the Texas governor for failing
to condemn the South Carolina school's anti-Catholic teachings and
its policy against interracial dating. The senator has used the
incident as a springboard for attacking some religious
conservatives on the Republican Party's fringe.
</P>
<P>
   The issue had the potential to be a significant one in New York
state, where 46 percent of Republicans are Catholic. But in
interviews this week, several Catholic Republicans described Bush's
visit to the school in terms more applicable to a missionary than a
politician, saying the Texas governor was ``reaching out'' to a
wayward element of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's trying to do is move it toward the center,'' said
Eva De Luca, 75, who meets each week with a small group of Catholic
women to discuss politics and other issues at St. John the
Evangelist Church in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she derided McCain's avowed goal of broadening
the party's appeal, saying, ``You don't exclude a major part of the
Republican Party, and then say you want to be inclusive. You're
cutting out a warm and important part of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, head of the Catholic League, a New York-based
national group that fights anti-Catholic discrimination, had
originally criticized Bush for his appearance at Bob Jones. But
then he formally called a truce after the candidate sent Cardinal
John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, a letter apologizing for
not speaking up against the university's anti-Catholic record while
he was there.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's delay in apologizing was not lost on him, Donohue
said did not want the Catholic League ``to become the issue, by
being the one that demanded an apology, and then when he supplied
it, we said `that's not good enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``One of the great touchstones of Catholicism is
forgiveness for the wrongdoer who admits that he or she is wrong,
and there's nothing to be gained by beating this dead horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said he believed, nevertheless, that anti-Catholic
bigotry was a serious problem in fundamentalist Christian circles,
one that some would prefer to ignore. ``There are some Catholics
who are so desperate to get a Republican back in the White House,
they're willing to overlook anything,'' he said. ``Our feeling is,
let the pus come to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue noted that Catholics had traditionally belonged to the
Democratic Party in New York, but that in the 1980s many were drawn
to the GOP by Ronald Reagan's charisma and by conservative
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned: ``They didn't park themselves in the Republican
Party when they went over to Reagan. They're up for grabs. I think
Bush has alienated them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, the 87-year-old retired chemist, said he voted
Democratic only once in his life _ for Franklin D. Roosevelt for
president. Parker said he had not decided how he would vote in the
Republican primary on Tuesday, but he said he had not warmed to
either McCain or Bush in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both playing politics and slapping each other around a
bit,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alexander S. Janow, a professional headhunter, called Governor
Bush's appearance at Bob Jones ``a terrible mistake,'' but said he
now considered it ``a moot issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Janow remembered the first vote he ever cast, in 1964 for Barry
Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, who has remained
a lifelong hero. Before Goldwater's death in 1998, the former
Arizona senator said he feared that the religious right was
becoming too powerful in the Republican Party, Janow noted, adding
that he, too, worried about the party's alliance with ``intolerant
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Janow has not decided who will get his vote next week, but said
he was not averse to McCain's call for distance from the religious
right. ``I don't think the Republican Party will suffer for it,''
he said. ``In fact, it will be stronger.''

PAULIE AYALA COULD FIGHT FOUR TIMES THIS YEAR UNDER TOP RANK INC.'S
PROMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As many as four fights loom for Fort Worth's Paulie
Ayala in 2000, but not the encore the reigning World Boxing
Association bantamweight champion wistfully wants most.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala capped his 1999 championship-winning season with a one-two
public relations flurry. Ayala was voted ``The Ring'' magazine's
Fighter of the Year, and his 12-round upset victory against the
formerly undefeated Johnny Tapia was selected as Fight of the Year
by the publication known as ``The Bible of Boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala logged 24 almost nonstop rounds in his victories against
Tapia and No. 1-ranked contender Saohin Srithai Condo of Thailand
in 1999, admittedly leaving himself with the mother of all tough
acts to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning all those awards last year, they've put me at such a
level to where, shoot, I want to fight myself,'' Ayala said with a
laugh. ``I mean, I want to beat that Ayala guy! But I guess what I
would say is I want to just try to defend my title and try to unify
it this year. Let's see if we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's first action of 2000, and the opening round of promoter
Bob Arum's marketing plan for a fighter he projects as a ``midlevel
star,'' is scheduled to unfold Saturday night. Ayala will meet
Denmark's Johnny Bredahl, the reigning International Boxing Council
bantamweight (118-pound) champion, in a scheduled 12-rounder at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center. The bout will be Ayala's first in Las
Vegas since June 26, when he walked into the same ring in the same
arena as a 6-1 underdog and nobody and walked out as a real
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of came out of nowhere,'' said Bruce Trampler, the
main matchmaker for Arum and Top Rank Inc. ``Paulie fought about 10
years to become an overnight sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he is poised to help Ayala, and Top Rank, cash in on
the most recent ``overnights.'' Ayala-Bredahl is the main event of
a four-fight TVKO pay-per-view card billed as ``Bring on the Heat.
Caliente!'' By world-title fight standards, it is a modest
production. Arum said the arena is being set up to accommodate
5,500 fans, approximately half of its boxing capacity. Competing
against the NASCAR Busch Grand National and Winston Cup races at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway this weekend, Arum said the fight has sold
approximately 2,000 seats. With brisk walk-up business on fight
night, Arum said the card could draw a respectable 3,500 to 4,000
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Paulie can be a midlevel attraction for us,''
Arum said at his office here yesterday. ``He'll never be an Oscar
De La Hoya. But we think that he can be a Johnny Tapia _ on that
level. Again, it's going to depend on how he draws on the
pay-per-view on this fight. It's going to also depend on how many
shots we can get him on HBO, because they're the ones that pay real
money. If we get him on HBO and in some marquee fights, he can make
probably as much as a half-million for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has been shopping Ayala to HBO executive Seth
Abraham for the cable network's newest boxing series, ``KO
Nation.'' Arum said the series is being slotted for late Saturday
afternoons in the fall, primarily from college campus sites. TCU,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HBO stuff will definitely happen by the end of the year,''
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his crowd-pleasing style and squeaky-clean
lifestyle, Arum said Ayala's Hispanic-American heritage is working
in his financial favor. Ayala, 29, is scheduled to make a
career-best $150,000 for this fight, plus a percentage of
pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Paulie will draw very well for us, particularly
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and in other areas in California and
the Southwest,'' said Arum, referring to potential Hispanic
pay-per-view buys. ``As far as we're concerned, those are the
markets now for boxing in this country. So, I look for exciting,
interesting Hispanic kids. They're the ones that enable me to
market boxing. And Paulie Ayala has always filled that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said part of the attraction to matching Ayala against
Bredahl, the WBA's No. 4-rated contender, is to expose the Texan to
the European TV market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peripheral benefit that it showcases Paulie in Europe.
And that's great,'' Trampler said. ``But if you're rating
attractions in terms of the kind of shows we do, there's two weight
classes in boxing right now. There's the heavyweights, especially
where you've got Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis
and those guys, and there's whatever division Oscar De La Hoya is
in. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trampler said Ayala-Bredahl also delivers sizzle because it is a
``mixed-match'' racially.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level \Rheavyweights\S, it doesn't matter what
flavor you are,'' Trampler said. ``Aesthetically, a little lower
down, if Paulie was fighting another Hispanic, it might not be as
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie's one of the better attractions below the
heavyweight/Oscar level. He hasn't risen to that double-digit
\R10,000-plus attendance\S level yet, but he may. He doesn't push
himself. He's not controversial. He doesn't get thrown in jail.
He's just a real nice kid. Sometimes it takes fans awhile to
appreciate ability, and the kind of character he has.'' nn

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER DAY OF GUN VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, March 2: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It just keeps getting more senseless. On Tuesday a first grader
in Michigan shot and killed a 6-year old classmate. Wednesday an
adult gunman in Pennsylvania shot a worker at his apartment
building, then fired on customers at two fast-food restaurants. He
fled into a center for the elderly, taking hostages before finally
surrendering. These new eruptions of violence, coming just a day
apart, only confirm the urgency of solving the nation's gun
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gun tragedies have a devastating effect on individuals, families
and communities. But in a larger sense the entire nation is
victimized when parents must fear little children toting revolvers
to elementary school to shoot other children, and a routine lunch
trip to McDonald's can end in bloodshed when a deranged person with
a gun goes on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The need for stronger gun control laws has never been plainer.
But as President Clinton aptly said Wednesday, the nation's elected
leaders have not done all they can ``to keep guns away from
criminals and children.'' He called on Congress to approve gun
safety legislation languishing in a House-Senate conference
committee before lawmakers begin a long recess at the end of next
week. In light of this week's events, it hardly seems an
unreasonable request.

   WILKINSBURG, Pa. _ A gunman who set his apartment on fire and
went on a lunchtime shooting spree at two fast-food restaurants was
taken into custody Wednesday after two people were killed and three
were critically wounded in this suburb of Pittsburgh, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, 39-year-old Ronald Taylor, surrendered after holding
police off for about two-and-a-half hours in an office building.
Taylor, who was arraigned Wednesday night, was charged with two
counts of criminal homicide, a charge that includes various degrees
of murder and manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wilbert Young and police officials said they were
investigating whether the shootings with a .22-caliber handgun were
racially motivated. Taylor, who had no criminal history, is black,
while the five shot were white males, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed by one day the shooting death of a first
grader by a 6-year-old gunman in Mount Morris Township, Mich.,
leading President Clinton to urge Congress again to pass stricter
gun-control legislation. Clinton said the violent incidents ``call
on us to recognize the fact that we haven't done everything we can
do to keep these guns away from criminals and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident in this faded working-class suburb of
25,000 began about 11:15 a.m., when the police received a call that
a person had been shot and had been taken to a hospital. Officers
were given the address of the suspected gunman and arrived to find
Taylor's fifth-floor apartment on fire, the Wilkinsburg police
chief, Gerald Brewer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, there were more calls saying that someone had
been shot at a nearby Burker King and three more persons had been
shot at a McDonald's, Brewer said, adding that the callers provided
a description of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as John Kroll, 55, of Cabot, Pa., and
Joseph Healy, 71, of Wilkinsburg. One of the wounded, Richard
Clinger, was shot while sitting in his van at McDonald's, witnesses
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A maintenance worker at the apartment building told The
Associated Press that Taylor had become angry that the broken door
to his apartment had not been repaired quickly enough. ``He said,
`You're all white trash, racist pigs,''' the worker, John DeWitt,
told the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said of the standoff: ``I'm very proud of how the
officers responded. They used uncommon restraint in not taking his
life. That can be debated today and tomorrow, but today it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brewer said that the police were investigating a report that
Taylor had walked into a woman's home after he left his apartment,
telling her, ``I'm dead anyway, I just need to hide a couple of
minutes,'' and also saying, ``I'm just out to shoot white people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing things, but we don't have anything factual,''
Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Tuite of the Wilkinsburg police said that he and two
officers had spotted the suspect walking along a street and that he
turned and fired two shots, then went into an office building.
Taylor entered a doctor's office and apparently attempted to take a
woman hostage, but she escaped as a door closed between her and the
suspect, Tuite said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also entered a senior citizens center but took no
hostages, Tuite said, adding that he entered the building and saw
Taylor sitting in the hallway, about 40 feet away, with the handgun
in his mouth. Taylor later pointed the gun at his head, and talked
about killing himself, the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to do that, relax, we'll get through this,''
Tuite said he told Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor pointed his gun at the officers several times but they
did not fire, the lieutenant said, adding that the officers felt
they had him isolated and that they had sufficient cover behind a
cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tuite said that he spoke to Taylor for about 15 minutes, and
that Taylor had asked for a cigarette, adding that when the suspect
was asked if he needed a light, he replied that he had a lighter
and had used it to set his apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team and a negotiator were called in from Pittsburgh, and
about 125 people, including 37 children from a day-care center,
were evacuated from the office building, other police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Fischer of the Pittsburgh police department, who
negotiated with Taylor, told reporters: ``His mood went from anger
to confusion, distraught, fear and remorse. He bantered back and
forth between killing himself and surrendering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, gang activity and violent crime had
been significantly reduced in Wilkinsburg, Brewer said, adding that
his department's records showed no no prior arrests for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Young sounded a similar note Wednesday night saying: ``We are
sad and shocked over this. We're totally surprised.''

CALIFORNIA MAY FACE HEALTH INSURANCE CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ State Controller Kathleen Connell on Wednesday
said that the number of California residents without health
insurance continues to rise and could eventually have a negative
impact on the state's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poorer health means a less productive work force and higher
medical costs for the state,'' Connell told an audience of health
care workers and economists at a symposium at the Skirball Cultural
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, California spends $8.1 billion a year on Medi-Cal
alone to treat uninsured residents, which should increase to $10
billion by 2005, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium was sponsored by Connell's office and the
Healthcare Collaborative at the University of California, Los
Angeles. She also released a report titled ``The Importance of
Healthcare in California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is immoral and deeply discouraging to think that in this
time of unprecedented economic growth and prosperity, so many
productive residents will be denied access to the most basic health
care,'' said Connell.
</P>
<P>
   In January, California's unemployment rate dipped to 4.7
percent. Over the 12 months ending in January, California's
employment grew by 3.1 percent compared with 1.7 percent
nationally. That translated into more than 350,000 new jobs in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the booming economy, one out of six uninsured people
in this country lives in California, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot expect to continue our current economic expansion
without providing comprehensive health insurance for California's
staggering 7.3 million uninsured residents,'' warned Connell.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured increases by 23,000 every month, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   And 50 percent of California's uninsured live in households
headed by a full-time worker.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the health care industry agrees with Connell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Shield is looking at ways to increase access to health
care for the uninsured,'' said David Joyner, the company's vice
president of external affairs. For example, the Woodland
Hills-based company supports legislation to expand coverage under
the Healthy Families Program to parents of children covered by the
low-cost insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rest of the nation, California is at a
disadvantage when it comes to providing health care coverage
through the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Only 48 percent of California companies now offer health
insurance to their employees, well below the national average of 61
percent, said Connell. The numbers are even worse for businesses
with 25 or fewer employees, she said, with fewer than two in five
offering their employees health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of the uninsured is predominately an affordability
issue, as the increase in the number of uninsured is driven by the
cost of health care,'' said Joyner. ``Policy makers concerned by
the uninsured should consider the financial impact of legislation
and regulatory mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell noted that some companies are outsourcing health care
coverage to save costs. Xerox Corp. has opted to offer each
employee a flat amount of health care dollars to be spent on any
health plan he or she chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Employee are at risk for any overruns, but if they are fortunate
to have no health problems, they can pocket the savings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical health plan, the company would have swallowed any
increase in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Connell added, ``The $63 billion health care sector has become a
dominant component of the state's economy. The changing
demographics of California will mandate the need for more and
improved health care delivery systems, products and technologies
between now and 2040.''

TV SURVEY SHOWS AD   TIME UP FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ How do you know there are too many ads on
television? Even the advertisers start grousing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Last November each hour of prime-time network television
contained an average of 16 minutes, 43 seconds of advertising and
other ``nonprogramming'' content, a jump of 59 seconds from the
preceding year, says a survey by the American Association of
Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's been this way for at least 10 consecutive years the
advertising group has been tracking the issue. And advertisers are
increasingly worried about it because they fear their messages can
get lost in the ad clutter.
</P>
<P>
   And prices for commercial time keep going up, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't measured this, but I would suggest there is a
direct correlation between the increase in clutter and a
diminishment in the effectiveness of our creative campaigns,'' said
Steve Grubbs, chief executive of OMD USA, a media buying firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Mandel, chairman of the AAAA National Television and Radio
Committee and an executive with the ad firm MediaComm Inc., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increases in clutter are a hidden increase in cost to the
advertiser and the economy. If the television industry doesn't
recognize soon that they are killing the golden goose, they will
lose the battle for the attention of consumers ... and the
attention of advertisers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising group measures both pure ad time and
nonprogramming time, which includes commercials, public service
spots and promotional spots for local and network programming.
</P>
<P>
   According to the AAAA, the amount of ad time has gone up by
nearly a minute and a half in just two years. Since 1991, the
average amount of commercial time in a prime-time hour has
increased by three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more dramatic if compared with the '60s and '70s.
Watch an old TV show today, and you'll probably notice scenes and
credits chopped in order to make room for more commercials.
</P>
<P>
   They're not mentioned in the AAAA report, but children's shows
are the only class of programming during which the amount of
commercial time is regulated by the federal government. Guidelines
of a maximum 12 minutes of ads per hour on weekdays and 10 minutes
on weekends have been in place for a decade, following the
Children's Television Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of commercials carried on all other types of
programming is strictly up to the networks. In the face of stagnant
ratings, rising program costs and a booming market for ad time on
the part of dot-com companies, many networks have been packing more
and more promos and commercials into a typical hour.
</P>
<P>
   No network stood out in its ad time, with ABC leading the majors
by a small margin.

<P>
   Among the morning shows, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' averaged
about a minute more of ads per hour than its competitors on NBC and
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was last in total nonprogramming time, but showed the
greatest increase.
</P>
<P>
   And promos - those spots the networks run touting their own
shows seem to be becoming ubiquitous. During this year's Super
Bowl, there were almost as many commercials for ABC as for outside
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC spokesman said that network's head of promotion, Alan
Cohen, was out of the country and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   George Schweitzer, executive vice president of marketing and
communications for CBS, said the network tries to be sensitive in
not running too many promo spots close together. Schweitzer said
these spots, which can be as short as five or 10 seconds, can
bother viewers when they're stacked together in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   He said the amount of promos CBS runs has remained fairly
consistent over the past few years, and that the networks all
monitor one another and run a comparable amount of promo spots.

GORE AND BRADLEY DISAGREE ON LITTLE IN A HARMONIOUS EXCHANGE

   LOS ANGELES _ Meeting in their last debate before more than a
dozen states vote in primaries on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley appeared uncharacteristically
harmonious together Wednesday night, going out of their way to
agree on virtually every issue and avoiding the kind of attacks
that characterized their raucous debate just over a week ago in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley signaled early that he would not be too critical of Gore
when he passed up a chance to fault the vice president, as he
usually does, as failing to do more to combat racial profiling, and
they both then talked about their own proposals, forgoing their
usual potshots at each other.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wednesday night's was perhaps the most conciliatory of
their encounters, reflecting the recognition of both that with
Bradley's failure to win a single primary contest so far, the race
was likely to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   In one poignant moment, Bradley was asked what mistake in his
life he had learned the most from. He talked about how he learned
to fail from his rookie season with the New York Knicks in 1966-67,
when he had been heralded as the team's savior, only to be booed
and spit on by fans when he played poorly. Some of his supporters
have likened that traumatic year to the struggles of his current
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused me to ask myself, `You have to come to terms with
this,''' he said. ``I also began to see that life was not all good,
not all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, revising his answer after Bradley answered, said his
biggest mistake was not being kind.
</P>
<P>
   With both reining in the harshness that has characterized their
campaign, the two revealed just how ideologically similar they are.
Both were given a chance to condemn the evangelical right wing,
which they did. Both want legal recognition for gay partners,
although both oppose legalizing gay marriage. Both condemned racial
profiling. Both praised their wives.
</P>
<P>
   And both praised the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have watched any of the eight previous meetings
between Gore and Bradley, many topics seemed familiar, even if the
candidates answered the questions somewhat differently. Last week
in Harlem, for instance, Bradley asserted that the vice president
had shown a lack of leadership by not pressing President Clinton to
sign an executive order to ban racial profiling by federal
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But when the question was raised Wednesday night, Bradley
avoided conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the civil rights issue of our time,'' he
said, not mentioning Gore. ``It is no longer blocking people from
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to stop. I want to be tough on crime. I want to
be tough on discrimination, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also passed on the opportunity to criticize Gore over
sending mixed signals on whether to allow China to join the World
Trade Organization. A few days ago, the former senator asserted
that the vice president had put ``the nail in the coffin'' of the
treaty that would bring China into the trade group when Gore
suggested to AFL-CIO officials that he might renegotiate the treaty
if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, Bradley declined to make that argument when
a question about China and Taiwan relations was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Having repeatedly criticized Gore as a ``risk'' to the
Democratic Party because of his role in the campaign fund-raising
abuses of the 1996 presidential campaign, Bradley did not mention
Gore's problems Wednesday night. Instead, when a question about
money in politics was asked, Bradley spent more time talking about
the differences between himself and Sen. John McCain, the
Republican presidential candidate who has made an overhaul of the
system a centerpiece of his campaign. He noted that McCain was a
conservative on issue like abortion or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore agreed. ``We can't talk about it too much,'' he said about
campaign finance reform. ``It is one of the major issues in this
campaign. It unites us, but it divides the two Republican
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the debate started, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
entered the room of reporters covering the candidates and announced
that he was endorsing Gore, whom he called ``the most qualified and
experienced candidate in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore team has sparked the greatest economic boom
in the history of this country,'' Jackson said. ``Therefore, the
vice president is perfectly positioned to continue this growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's announcement ends months of courtship by the two
Democratic candidates for his support. And while it is not clear
how many voters he might sway on his own, his endorsement is just
one of several by high-profile Democrats in recent days that have
added to the impression that the vice president has united the
party behind him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson called on Bradley to avoid creating the kind of
bitterness that split the party in 1980 when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts challenged President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That must not happen now,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to urge Bradley to quit the race. And he praised
the former senator for having raised important issues in the
campaign and having recruited athletes, including Michael Jordan,
into the party fold.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has his own history of bitterness with Gore. In 1988
when both men ran for the Democratic nomination, Gore and his
supporters criticized Jackson's position on Israel and other
issues, prompting Jackson to accuse Gore of negative campaigning.

 IOUs PUT THE POWER IN YOUR HANDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mid-level managers from some of the Kansas
City area's largest companies came for the Holy Grail of workplace
advancement _ the key to wielding power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours later they had the secret: I scratch your back,
you'll scratch mine.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dwyer, director of the Management and Behavioral Science
Center at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, shared
his ``secret'' Tuesday at an Institute for Management Studies
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   First, Dwyer warned, don't confuse authority and power.
Authority is a temporary privilege granted by your position in an
organization. Power is the ability to persuade individuals over
whom you may have no authority.
</P>
<P>
   People who wield power best weren't born with charisma or
promoted into positions of responsibility over others. A powerful
person gets others to do what he or she wants by convincing them
it's in their best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, an executive and organizational behavior consultant,
admits his message is contrary in the team-based environments
fostered in many organizations. For him, power lies in one-on-one
influence:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to influence me, you have to plant in my head the
perception that your desired action is the best thing for me, that
it best fulfills my values.''
</P>
<P>
   He shuns mission statements and motivators that say, ``Do it for
the team,'' or ``It's good for the organization.'' Dwyer contends
teams and organizations have no values; values attributed to them
are the acting out of values held by their individual workers.
</P>
<P>
   If you get to know an individual and you scratch the other's
back by rewarding what he or she values, you create an
indebtedness, Dwyer says. And those psychological IOUs give you
power.
</P>
<P>
   When you do a favor for a co-worker (and toot your own horn just
enough to make sure it's known), the professor says, you maximize
your ability to get requested behaviors from that person in return
_ especially when you perceive the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, immediately after you stay late and finish an
emergency project for your boss is the perfect time to ask for
tomorrow off in return.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the strategy is manipulative and self-serving. That's why
Dwyer cautions it must be accompanied by constant recognition of
and assistance to others. You need to fill a reservoir of good will
among co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The more compliments _ handwritten notes are best _ you give,
the more others (bosses, peers or subordinates) will be inclined,
if not eager, to help you. You have made them feel good, and they
owe you something in return.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer also suggests that an effective tool for getting others to
do what you want is to say, ``I have a problem.'' You will get
better response than if you say, ``We have a problem,'' or ``You
have a problem,'' or ``The company has a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people want to help you _ not the organization _ provided
they trust and respect you and can tally up what they perceive you
have done for them. Everybody knows that, Dwyer says, but for most
people it's too much hard work to turn that secret key.

gold medalist before he was 23, Bradley talked about how he learned

  (Adds father's name in 10th graf and mother's name in 15th graf)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ His father was in and out of
prison. His mother, evicted from her own home, sent him and his
brother to live with an uncle in a dilapidated house here, just
north of Flint. There, he did not even have his own bed and fell
asleep in a place that neighbors say was filled with noise, drugs
and guns.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, the police say, the 6-year-old got his hands on
one of those guns, stuffed it in his pants pocket and went off to
first grade, where he killed a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, cars paused outside the white clapboard residence, as
passers-by tried to get a look at the home of a troubled child, a
boy who the police say did not fully comprehend what he did when he
used a .32-caliber handgun on the 6-year-old girl, Kayla Renee
Rolland.
</P>
<P>
   She was shot once in the neck just before 10 a.m. Tuesday in
front of a group of about 22 first-graders as they made their way
into the hall of the Theo J. Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The boy put the gun in a desk after the shooting and simply
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla was rushed to the Hurley Medical Center. She was
pronounced dead at 10:29 a.m., less than an hour after the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by detectives, the boy did not cry, the police said,
and afterward sat and drew pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young boy appears not to have many advantages in life,''
said Arthur A. Busch, the Genesee County prosecutor, who said the
boy probably would not be charged and was released Thursday to an
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities appeared to take a sympathetic attitude
toward a child who took another child's life, many residents said
the real sympathy belonged with Kayla's family and questioned
whether it was safe to send their children back to school.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say the boy's own father, Dedrick
Owens, &UR;  &LR; serving time in jail for a parole violation involving a
burglary, said the boy was living in a ``crack house.'' The
neighbors say they suspected it all along.
</P>
<P>
   In a raid Tuesday night, the authorities found a stolen handgun
and some narcotics in the home and jailed the boy's uncle,
Sirmarcus Winfrey, on an outstanding warrant for theft. Another
man, 19, who the authorities said lived in the home and brought the
stolen gun used in the killing into the home, turned himself in to
the police Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said they were considering charges of
involuntary manslaughter against whoever brought the gun into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   They are also considering pressing charges of child neglect
against the family or guardians of the child, whose name was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my position that we have, at this point, enough evidence
to establish child neglect,'' the prosecutor said. ``My attorneys
will go to court even today to argue that the court should take
jurisdiction of this little boy. I am very concerned about the
placement of this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the boy's parents appeared in probate court
for a hearing on custody of the child, his 8-year-old brother and a
5-year-old sister who had been living with another relative. The
state moved to gain custody of the three children, saying the boy's
mother, Tamarla Owens, was a drug addict who had admitted that she
had exposed the children to marijuana on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said there were also reports that the mother had
physically abused one of her children. The boy's father, who was
brought from the local jail, spoke to the court, saying he was
sorry for what had happened and acknowledging that he had not
always been a good father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had never happened,'' he said. ``I just feel sorry
for the other child.'' The mother sobbed nearby, wiping her eyes
with tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Robert Pickell said that he went to the jail on Tuesday
night to ask the boy's father if he knew anything about the gun.
The sheriff said the boy's father said the child was frequently in
trouble and had been in fights at school.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the boy did not seem to comprehend what had
happened and appeared nonchalant when interviewed by detectives on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their impression the boy didn't understand what he had
done, did not appreciate the consequences of his actions and
appeared to take this as some sort of, well, that this just kind of
happens like on television,'' Busch, the county prosecutor, said at
a crowded news conference Wednesday morning. ``This is a young boy,
6 years old, who cannot obviously form criminal intent. He does not
seem to understand the gravity of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shooting, the public schools in this
working-class town remained closed. Flags flew at half-staff.
Grieving residents left flowers and notes and toys at the doors of
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The horror at Buell, the authorities say, was born of the anger
of a little boy who found a weapon under a blanket on the bed at
home and used it on a young girl he had quarreled with the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chad Ballard, who lived next door to the boy's family for three
years &UR;  &LR;  before the family was evicted, said the house had been
raided by the police several times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a home where cars were always stopping, late into the
night, Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the best of neighbors,'' he said. ``I tried to
avoid them because there was always conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he often quarreled with the family. The boy and his
8-year-old brother often teased his dog, and when Ballard tried to
stop it, the boys' parents often intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `Stop yelling at my kids,' and I would say,
`You need to take care of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard said the mother worked during the day and into the
evening and that the boy's father was not around very often.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the boy's mother was evicted from the home.
She moved elsewhere and often sent the two boys to stay with her
brother and at least one family friend, in a house on Juliah
Street, about a half-mile from Buell.
</P>
<P>
   The two-bedroom home is a kind of makeshift auto shop. A
Corvette sits on the front lawn, propped up by cement blocks.
Another car, its hood ajar, sits to the back of the house next to a
weathered John Deere snowmobile, which appears to be undergoing
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are auto parts and mangled hub caps scattered outside the
house, candy wrappers, soda bottles and wires and equipment out
front. The windows are shaded with old blankets and broken windows
are patched with blue tarp. A deep and muddy hole sits to the left
of the house. And a dull light burns inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't associate with them,'' said Will Oscar, a 31-year-old
neighbor who said he was planning to move soon. ``There was always
a lot of traffic there; I heard gunshots. I didn't feel safe. My
car was stolen out of my driveway twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar said he did not know the boy and his older brother were
living next door. He said the mother often dropped them off there.
They sometimes teased his dog, he said, but otherwise the boys were
``just normal kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In school, the boy was often in trouble, the authorities said
Wednesday. He had a social worker and had been in several fights.
The authorities said they had heard that the boy had recently been
in a quarrel or scuffle with Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, walking by Buell Wednesday, said they witnessed the
fight on Monday. ``He was fighting with that little girl a few days
ago,'' said John Owens, 13, who was walking by the schoolyard after
school on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morris, 14, said there were lots of drugs in the area.
``We walk down the street,'' he said, ``and we hear guys say,
`Weed? Weed?''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda Ide, 8, a third-grader, said she had heard the gunshot.
``I was in my class, writing from the dictionary,'' she said. ``I
heard something go `bang,' and I immediately started crying,
because I knew it was a gunshot, because we hear gunshots all the
time around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maranda said she did not sleep Tuesday night, but she was not
too afraid to go back to school. ``I think tomorrow will probably
be the same as it was before the gun was fired,'' she said. ``But I
think I'll probably cry for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for reopening the schools. The front door
of Buell is jammed with flowers, bunnies, teddy bears and candles.
Cards read, ``Kayla, we won't forget you.'' There are baskets of
M&AMP;M's and sunglasses, drawings of broken hearts, splashed with
crayon.
</P>

   A neighbor, Rasu King, 31, said she was dropping off a candle
and a teddy bear. ``I hope people realize how serious this is,''
she said. ``If you can't go to elementary school, you can't go

EX-COACH WATCHES LAKERS TOP BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Portland
Trail Blazers on Tuesday, a familiar, professorial-looking
white-haired fellow watched the proceedings with great interest
from his seat at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris, the Lakers' coach for four-plus seasons until he was
fired in February 1999, is now working for friend Mike Dunleavy,
the Blazers' coach, as an unofficial consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they do that?'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said with a
laugh. ``He's such a turncoat. They're paying him still in L.A.,
aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Harris' contract was to expire at the end of last
season anyway. Since his departure, he's worked briefly for one
longtime friend, Milwaukee Bucks coach George Karl, and now
Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached many games against Del, and Mike too, so I know
there's only so much you can contribute,'' Jackson said. ``(The
Blazers) were well prepared, there's no doubt about their
preparedness, they know what we're going to run and everything
else, but execution beats that every time....
</P>
<P>
   ``Del's been very successful, he's had some good successes
against the triangle (offense), particularly. Mike has, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was unaware his former coach was in the
building and working for the Lakers' biggest rival. But he said it
doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del probably told those guys a couple of our guys' secrets,''
O'Neal said, ``but we don't have Nick (Van Exel) and Eddie (Jones)
and Elden (Campbell) anymore, so he probably only knows about me.
But nothing can break me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers' personnel has changed a bit in the last year,
their offensive and defensive philosophies have changed to an even
greater degree under Jackson, which would seem to minimize Harris'
insights into the current team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he probably just told them personal stuff, like if you
bump this guy, he'll get mad, stuff like that,'' O'Neal said.
``What else is he going to tell them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have saw him,'' added O'Neal, who had his
differences with Harris. Would he have said hi? Yes. ``I'm a
cordial big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bench boost: It's been a rare day that the Lakers' unheralded
bench has played a major role in a big win, but the reserves came
up huge at Portland, outscoring the Blazers' highly regarded second
unit, 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's the experience of our players,'' Jackson
said. ``Rick (Fox), Brian (Shaw), Robert (Horry) are all
experienced players in the NBA. It is a pressure situation for
everyone, but it's not like they haven't ever been in this
situation before. And the capabilities are there for them to score.
Derek (Fisher), too, contributed last night....
</P>
<P>
   ``And then to win that kind of battle _ with their vaunted bench
and their backup situation - to win that on the road was a big
factor in winning the game.''

LOUISA MATTHIASDOTTIR, 83, ICELANDIC PAINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly
representation that runs through the history of postwar American
art, died Feb. 26 at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83
and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to
Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also a painter.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik,
Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first
solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists'
cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few
interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ``As
to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and
to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple,
blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all
dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no
reworking.
</P>
<P>
   It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and
Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included
portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled,
light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which
she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She
maintained close ties with friends and family members in Iceland,
where she was viewed as something of national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Although Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial
success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition
proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney
Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four
major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite
Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion
that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive
states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form,
color and paint a power all their own.
</P>
<P>
   The artists who acted on this belief during the late 1940s and
early '50s included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine
Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later
Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park and Elmer
Bischof. Yet Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the
war; its rudiments were largely in place by the time she came to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   She was born into a cultured, well-to-do family in Reykjavik,
where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged
her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything
else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a
three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged
her natural penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938
her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel
Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to
Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small,
struggling avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the
post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as
well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists.
When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students
League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann,
whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible.
Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome
painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944
marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side
studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double
exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on
Madison Avenue, where Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964
and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago,
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the
Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of
Iceland in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Matthiasdottir
is survived by four granddaughters.

(PHOENIX) - Admit it. You've been waiting a whole year for this.
Reaching into your desk drawer and pulling out the list of your
best excuses to e-mail the boss why you're not coming in today. Or
tomorrow or the next day . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cactus League baseball is back. So, break out the sun block and
prepare your taste buds for a hot dog, a bag of peanuts and a cold
one or two.
</P>
<P>
   The annual rite of spring begins today when six of the league's
10 clubs play their first game. The first full schedule of games is
Friday, March 2.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the National League West Division champion
Diamondbacks open today, March 1, against the Chicago White Sox at
Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area games feature the Milwaukee Brewers and Oakland
Athletics at Phoenix Municipal Stadium and the San Diego Padres and
Seattle Mariners at the Peoria Sports Complex. All games begin at 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will miss the fluid grace and lightning-quick bat of center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr., recently traded from Seattle to the
Cincinnati Reds. Plenty of smiles and home runs remain, however,
with the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, the San Francisco Giants' Barry
Bonds, the Anaheim Angels' Mo Vaughn and the Diamondbacks' Matt
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   You also can see the Diamondbacks' 6-foot-10 left-hander, Randy
Johnson, the 1999 NL Cy Young Award winner, peering menacingly from
behind his glove.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry, we won't tell the boss. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Are you, uh, ill and don't feel like working? Another season of
Cactus League baseball can provide chicken soup for the soul and a
chance to get an early start on that tan. &QL;

PROTESTER NESTING IN A TREE IS ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How many police officers does it take to get a man
out of a tree?
</P>
<P>
   The answer in downtown Manhattan Wednesday was more than 50, as
a small armada of police officers _ including a squad on scooters
and a rescue team equipped with what looked like a super-size
inflatable mattress _ descended on City Hall Park to remove a
demonstrator who climbed an elm tree to protest the city's
bulldozing of a Lower East Side community garden last month.
</P>
<P>
   The event unfolded in the courtyard in front of City Hall, in a
tree that is more than 50 years old and stands just across from
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office. The protester, Aresh Djavadi, 36,
climbed the tree at 9:30 a.m., carrying a dragon-fly puppet and a
sign that read ``11,000 vacant lots. Why take our garden plots?''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dozen or so other protesters from Djavadi's
environmental group, More Gardens Coalition, also tried,
unsuccessfully, to perch in trees. By 10 a.m., the park had been
sealed off as 30 police officers prepared to remove Djavadi and
another 20 or so officers guarded the park's perimeter. Spectators
lined Broadway and Park Row, and City Hall staff _ including the
mayor's press secretary, Sunny Mindel, _ also went outside to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department Emergency Service Unit arrived in at least
three trucks, two of which carried small rescue boats and a medley
of other specialized rescue equipment. Before long, a blue and
white helicopter began to hover overhead, although the department
would not say whether it belonged to its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Djavadi, undeterred, continued to wave his dragon-fly puppet and
chant slogans, climbing even higher in the 70-foot, broad-reaching
elm as three officers went up after him.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers used portable fans to inflate a yellow,
10-foot-tall device intended for use in case of a fall. Meanwhile,
an officer reached Djavadi and put straps around his waist and
chest, giving him little option but to surrender. He did so at
10:55 a.m., and after climbing down the tree, was taken away in
handcuffs. He was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting
arrest, reckless endangerment and obstructing government
administration, Detective Robert Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar protests last year generated attention that led to the
preservation of 112 community gardens on city-owned lots.

HIALEAH SET FOR GULFSTREAM SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ South Florida's embattled race tracks
appeared to have taken a step toward some sort of peaceful
coexistence Wednesday when Hialeah Park announced it had reached an
agreement to run its season at Gulfstream Park starting two weeks
from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was declared ``a dead deal'' and ``a long
shot'' as recently as last weekend, was revived through a series of
all-night meetings that culminated with Wednesday's truce.
</P>
<P>
   Only the forthcoming season is involved, but both sides said
they detected good omens for the future of Florida racing, which
for 20 years has been torn by a dispute over which track could
operate during the desirable and profitable winter tourist dates.
</P>
<P>
   Hialeah will send its first landing party to Gulfstream next
week and will be in position to operate racing on March 17, the day
after Gulfstream closes its two-month meeting. But instead of
operating at the once-elegant jewel of a race track 15 miles south
of Gulfstream, Hialeah will be running its races at the more modern
facility at Gulfstream through May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Florida racing then switches to the Calder track, the third
point in the triangle, where it will be held for most of the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that we've done it again, found peace in Florida
racing,'' said John J. Brunetti, the chairman of Hialeah. ``It's
been a long day coming. I, for one, feel this is a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonny Powell, executive vice president of Magna Entertainment
and the leading spokesman for Frank Stronach, who bought Gulfstream
last year, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our leasing of our facility to Hialeah is
currently agreed upon for one season, we consider it to be symbolic
of the desire of our company and Stronach to work with all segments
of the Florida thoroughbred industry, including Calder, the
horsemen and breeders, to facilitate a positive spirit of
cooperation in order to make the highly respected Florida
horse-racing industry even stronger and more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunetti said Hialeah would keep its barns open for trainers who
prefer to stable their horses there and train over its superior
surface. But he said not many other details had been reached. &QL;

ASHCROFT-CARNAHAN RACE IS A TOSSUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The marquee match-up between Republican John
Ashcroft and Democrat Mel Carnahan for the U.S. Senate in Missouri
is a statistical dead heat, with Ashcroft holding a narrow lead,
according to a recent statewide survey.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, the incumbent senator, led Carnahan, the two-term
governor, by 47 percent to 44 percent, according to the poll
commissioned by The Kansas City Star. The survey had a
4-percentage-point margin of error, so the race is a tossup eight
months before Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research, was taken from
Friday to Monday and involved 628 registered Missouri voters who
said they vote regularly in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated that only 9 percent of likely voters said
they were undecided, an unusually low total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really remarkable,'' said Carnahan aide Marc Farinella.
``It's an indication that there are very few voters available to
either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll revealed another unusual circumstance: Neither
candidate faces the costly hurdle of having to improve his name
identification. Ashcroft and Carnahan are recognized by virtually
every Missourian. The poll said only 1 percent of voters were
unfamiliar with Ashcroft. Carnahan was known by 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both had similar favorable-unfavorable ratings. Ashcroft was
recognized positively by 48 percent, compared with 23 percent who
viewed him unfavorably. Twenty-eight percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's totals: 46 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable
and 27 percent neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a positive result,'' Ashcroft spokesman Steve
Hilton said. ``It says that Senator Ashcroft's issues and his
record are well-known to people. We are very comfortable with our
position at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Republican poll showed Ashcroft leading by 10 points,
Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Farinella also viewed the new poll's totals with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistent with all the other polls we've seen in this
race,'' he said. ``We read it as very positive news for us. We
don't really expect to be ahead of an incumbent senator at this
point in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   He viewed Ashcroft's failure to grab more than 50 percent
support as a sign of weakness for an incumbent officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan led Ashcroft in the state's two major urban areas. The
Democrat topped Ashcroft 50 percent to 44 percent in Kansas City
and 49 percent to 43 percent in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft led in the four rural regions, taking his biggest
advantage in his home area of southwest Missouri, where he led 56
percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also revealed a gender gap. Ashcroft led among men by
53 percent to 40 percent while Carnahan led among women, 48 percent
to 41 percent.

 BUSH'S CAMP UNVEILS TOUGH NEW STRATEGY AGAINST McCAIN IN NEW YORK 
(CORRECTS ``divisive'' to ``decisive'' in 4th graf.)  
(sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh from his three-state victory for the Republican
presidential nomination on Tuesday night, Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday turned his attention to New York, unleashing a scathing
stream of attacks _ by mail, telephone, and radio _ that portrayed
Sen. John McCain as repeatedly voting against the concerns of New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, tough and precisely targeted at different
regions of the state, was introduced on Wednesday by Gov. George
Pataki, the chairman of Bush's New York campaign, at an afternoon
news conference in Albany, where he labeled McCain as ``anti-New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, Bush began broadcasting a radio
advertisement featuring Geri Barish, a well-known Long Island
advocate for breast cancer research, who attacked McCain for voting
against legislation for some breast cancer research money. ``We
deserve a candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust,''
Barish said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks by Bush came as he and McCain approached what many
Republicans believe could be a climactic round of primaries next
Tuesday, and with Bush's New York supporters arguing that a
decisive defeat for McCain in New York _ a state where polls now
show the two men in a tie _ could effectively end McCain's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that Bush had, as he has in other major states,
handed over much of the control of his effort to local officials,
in this case, Pataki; William Powers, who is the state Republican
Party chairman, and Zenia Mucha, who is Pataki's chief political
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a coordinated campaign of mail, radio ads and
telephone calls, that seeks to highlight votes that McCain cast in
the Senate that may undercut him with voters across the state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one piece of mail, sent to Republican voters in
districts with a heavy concentration of farmers, noted that McCain
had opposed allowing New York to enter the Northeast Dairy Compact,
which would have provided higher payments for milk. Another, sent
to the northern reaches of New York, pointed to votes McCain had
cast against aid to help people paying fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absolutely consistent pattern of voting against the
interests of New York, whether it's specific things like voting
against aid for the ice storm recovery or the dairy compact, or
generic things like the whole transit thing where he voted to cut
us,'' Pataki said in an interview after the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The tough New York strategy ruptured anew the relationship
between Pataki and another prominent supporter of Bush, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. Giuliani has resisted playing a
key role in attacks on McCain, apparently concerned that he is
being perceived as too harsh in his handling of his
all-but-announced Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After initially agreeing to join other Republican mayors on
behalf of Bush at a news conference scheduled for Thursday,
Giuliani abruptly withdrew from the event after seeing a release
promoting it as an assault on McCain for his Senate votes, one of
the mayor's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   While the aide said the mayor would accompany Pataki when Bush
travels in the city on Friday and Saturday for several campaign
stops, Giuliani plans to refuse to engage in any attacks on McCain,
whom the mayor has described as a friend and a hero. This adviser
said that Giuliani believed Bush and his New York campaign were
making a mistake in turning the campaign so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wants to strongly support and campaign with Bush,''
the adviser said. ``But it's becoming increasingly difficult
because of the governor's office.'' This adviser said that the
mayor would not lend his name to any attacks on McCain, and had
already demanded that he not be included in a piece of campaign
literature attacking McCain for voting against relief for upstate
residents following severe ice storms.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's senior New York adviser, Guy V. Molinari, the Staten
Island borough president, ridiculed efforts by Pataki and Bush as
``stupid'' and ``immature.'' He argued that their tactics would
only succeed in weakening the Republican Party for the fall
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making more dumb mistakes,'' Molinari said. ``What
are they going to do if John McCain ends up being the nominee of
the party? How do they swallow their remarks? We can reasonably
expect the Democrats to pick up these charges. This is the dumbest
thing in the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of turning McCain's voting record against him was
reminiscent of what Vice President Al Gore did, to great effect,
against Bill Bradley, his Democratic opponent and a former senator
from New Jersey, earlier in the primary season. Gore, for example,
attacked Bradley during the Iowa caucuses for votes against
agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking in this case is the manner in which Bush and
his advisers appear to be tailoring attacks to appeal to different
parts of the state. The strategy reflects the unusual nature of the
New York contest: rather than just a statewide contest involving
Bush, McCain and a third candidate, Alan Keyes, Republicans in each
of 31 separate congressional districts will be voting for three
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer radio ad, for example, is running mainly on
Long Island and in the New York City metropolitan area. Long Island
is expected to be a key area in the Republican vote _ that is where
Bush will start his New York state swing on Friday _ and the
incidence of breast cancer there has been a subject of concern
among public officials and voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Barish has become a symbol of that effort, and a close adviser
to Pataki, so the advertisement by her could be particularly
potent, as she lists votes in Congress that McCain cast, such as
cutting financing for some breast-cancer research programs. ``John
McCain calls these projects, just `garden-variety pork,'' she said
in the ad. ``That's shocking. America deserves better. Next
Tuesday, John McCain won't have my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki scoffed at the suggestion that the attacks would only
weaken McCain in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, were McCain to be the nominee, many of those
Democrats would be out there pointing out the shortcomings of his
record,'' Pataki said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The severe turn taken by Bush's campaign in New York was
particularly notable given that Bush appears to have a definite
organizational advantage over McCain. He has the support of the
state Republican organization, giving him a ready-made machine to
contact potential voters, and make certain they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Pataki has arguably as much riding on the outcome
as Bush, both because he has so identified himself with Bush's
effort, and because so many Republicans were critical of his
ultimately failed effort to avoid this primary by trying to keep
McCain off the ballot. Pataki's supporters have suggested that Bush
might consider the governor of New York as a potential candidate
for vice president; in any event, Pataki presumably does not want
to be remembered as another Republican governor who failed Bush at
a key time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's New York supporters suggested that Pataki's desire
to prove otherwise accounted for the searing, layered assault on
McCain. The governor, though, shrugged off the idea that a Bush
loss in his state might hurt him. ``I'll leave that to the
pundits,'' he said.

GORE, BRADLEY TONE DOWN SNIPING IN DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what was probably the final debate of the fight
for the Democratic presidential nomination, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley adopted a newly conciliatory tone Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted to paint a bright picture of how they would be a
more tolerant chief executive than either major Republican
contender.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off came as Bradley, winless against Gore, faces
questions about how long he realistically can remain in the race.
Bradley has pledged to stay in the fight at least through the mass
of primaries coming Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Few delegates have been selected so far, Bradley said in the
debate, and Tuesday ``is takeoff day for me.'' Although the two
Democrats in earlier debates had sniped and snapped at each other,
they seemed to find an unusual amount of common ground in support
of gay rights, judicial activism and the need for federal oversight
of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore dueled briefly again about how conservative the
vice president's record was as a member of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has evolved. I'm glad he has evolved,'' Bradley said of
Gore's move to firmly support abortion rights. But, Bradley said,
Gore's seeming inability to deal with past votes and positions ``is
relevant to consideration'' by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore praised recent criticism from Republican
contender John McCain, a senator from Arizona, of religious right
leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who are supporters of the
Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far right has gone too far time after time after time on
social issues and has tried to dominate this country with their
particular viewpoint,'' Bradley said. ``I think it's important to
resist that. I've always resisted that. ... I've never voted in
ways that they wanted. And I would be very emphatic in saying that
religion should not be a part of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he agreed with McCain on issues such as campaign
finance reform and reigning in ``big tobacco,'' but the vice
president noted that McCain and Bush oppose most abortion rights
and ``neither had the guts to speak out against the Confederate
flag'' atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party today is in the midst of an identity
crisis,'' Gore said with quiet glee. ``They're trying to figure out
who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately before the debate, Gore won the endorsement of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader who twice has sought the
Democratic nomination. Speaking to reporters at the debate media
center, Jackson, with Bradley in mind, said: ``At some point we
have to fold our tents and create a bigger tent.'' Jackson said the
vice president, a Tennessean, had ``steadfastly shunned the
demagoguery in the South'' arising from the flying of the
Confederate flag over South Carolina's capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lost to the vice president in the Iowa caucuses, New
Hampshire primary and, on Tuesday, in a nonbinding presidential
preference vote in Washington state that the former senator had
hoped would resuscitate his campaign. Instead, he lost to Gore by a
margin of about 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it clear that he would let Bradley make up his own
mind about leaving the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to the voters, not to him,'' a sweat-soaked Gore
called out as he jogged along a Pacific Ocean beach in Santa Monica
with daughter Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their belief that the nomination effectively will soon
be Gore's, the vice president's top advisers have cautioned him
against appearing too confident or cocky. Gore and Bradley left
immediately after the debate for overnight flights to New York, the
second-biggest prize in the mass of primaries on Tuesday. Answering
questions from undecided California voters, Internet users and
reporters, the two Democratic contenders covered a range of issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore said he would nominate Supreme Court justices who see the
Constitution as ``a living and breathing document.'' Bradley said
his nominees could not be ``someone locked into an original
interpretation.'' Both answers would put them far to the left of
either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both, although opposing same-sex marriages, criticized a
measure that will be on the California ballot Tuesday to define
marriage as the union of a man and woman. Both Democrats supported
domestic-partnership arrangements in which same-sex couples could
have legal rights of married people. Gore called the initiative
facing voters a ``mean-spirited wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In the wake of police corruption cases in Los Angeles and
brutality incidents in New York, both Democrats expressed support
for an increased federal role in overseeing local law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Bradley's defeat in Washington, a state where he
had put in almost a full week of campaign time and poured tens of
thousands of dollars into television commercials, his aides engaged
in the rankest rationalizations. Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said
that while the campaign was ``a little disappointed,'' he contended
that ``the energy, the enthusiasm'' from Washington state would
``carry us forward very assertively'' into the busiest week of the
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former professional basketball star, put on his game
face as he prepared for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Twain put it best when he said, `Reports of my demise are
greatly exaggerated,''' Bradley said. ``We're going on to March 7.
We're moving fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised a spirited campaign in several states with primaries
next week, including New York, Massachusetts and Maryland. But Sen.
Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat and one of Bradley's few
congressional supporters, said that beneath the political spin his
former colleague was realistic and ``knows that it's going to take
a miracle for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ranking adviser was quoted as saying that Bradley would
withdraw from the race if he fares poorly again Tuesday. Bradley's
outlook for several of those contests, including the biggest, in
California, is not much better. A new Los Angeles Times poll of
likely Democratic voters in the Golden State showed Bradley
trailing not only Gore 54-11 percent but also lagging McCain, who
had 20 percent support in the Democratic sampling, and tied with
Bush, who also drew 11 percent support from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to prove that he was serious about pressing on for at
least another week, Bradley began to air four new television
commercials in a snappier, more urgent black-and-white format. He
also taped a five-minute national spot to air Thursday night on
CBS. A new Spanish-language ad targeted Hispanic voters in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The California debate, broadcast nationally by co-sponsor CNN
and held in an auditorium at the headquarters of co-sponsor Los
Angeles Times, came eight days after Gore and Bradley engaged in
the most raucous face-off of either party during the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage of the Apollo Theater in New York, the two
Democrats traded political jabs. To a continuing chorus of boos and
catcalls from the audience in the venerable theater in the heart of
Harlem, Bradley said Gore was a conservative when it came to
abortion rights, gun control and federal tax treatment for
segregated private schools, and the vice president responded by
contending Bradley was ``desperate'' and willing to divide the
party for personal political gain.

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore find common ground
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling a truce in their war of words, Democrats
Bill Bradley and Al Gore finished the last scheduled debate of the
Democratic primary season Wednesday with a largely high-minded
exchange that included none of their earlier animosity.
</P>
<P>
   The two agreed on a wide range of issues important to Democratic
voters and spent part of the time during their 90-minute debate
criticizing Republican candidates Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The civil, almost friendly encounter was a dramatic contrast to
their last debate in New York on Feb. 21, when they berated each
other on race, gun control and abortion. The change in tone, set in
a large measure by Bradley, may reflect the fact that Bradley
trails Gore badly in many key primary states and acknowledgement
that his attacks on Gore were not helping him.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again questions that 10 days ago prompted angry
outbursts from Bradley instead produced measured answers. Instead
of calling Gore the poster child for the National Rifle Association
when he was in Congress, Bradley directed his response at the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm there to beat the NRA,'' Bradley declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that,'' Gore responded moments later. ``We have
to take them on.''
</P>
<P>
   The two tangled on one issue that arose during their last
debate, Gore's support of congressional legislation to prevent the
Internal Revenue Service from denying tax-exempt status to schools
that discriminate. Bradley said Gore's votes ``define who you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you brought that up,'' Gore snapped. Gore described
his votes were on the issue of ``quotas,'' not extending tax
exemptions to schools such as Bob Jones University in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refused to bite on a question that his presidential bid
was doomed, noting that only 250,000 Democrats had cast ballots so
far. But Bradley essentially declined to look beyond next week,
saying that Tuesday must be the ``take-off day'' for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates said they would nominate Supreme Court justices
who would not be strict constitutionalists, strongly implying they
would appoint justices that upheld Roe v. Wade, permitting legal
abortions. Both also said they would work with Congress to enact
strong hate crimes legislation to protect gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed that the federal government should not
over-regulate the Internet. Both candidates also suggested the
federal government should involve itself in local law enforcement
issues, such as the use of race to target suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They reserved some of their sharpest language for McCain and
Bush, calling them throwbacks who would turn back the clock on
abortion, gun control and race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bush of a ``calculated decision'' in apologizing to
Catholic leaders for his appearance at Bob Jones, which bans
interracial dating and whose founder has made anti-Catholic
statements.
</P>
<P>
   However, both Democrats were asked to defend their own meetings
with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has fanned racial flames in his
native New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he met with Sharpton privately, not publicly,
and said that he used the meeting to raise concerns about his past
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with everything that Rev. Sharpton has said or
done,'' Bradley said in answer to the question. ``But I think he
has grown. ... We have to allow people the right to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore headed into Wednesday's debate buoyed by more news that he
is solidifying his grip on the Democratic nomination. A Los Angeles
Times poll published Wednesday showed Gore with a 5-to-1 lead over
Bradley in California, which has the most Democratic delegates at
stake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed Gore 15 minutes before the
debate began, calling the vice president the natural choice to
continue the economic policies of the Clinton administration.

ASHCROFT SUPPORTS FEDERAL AID FOR ACADEMICALLY PRODUCTIVE SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri is proposing that
federal aid to failing schools in Kansas City, St. Louis and other
cities be tied to the schools' academic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft planned to introduce a bill Thursday using federal
money to help failing schools emphasize basic classroom courses and
attract high-quality teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It would give additional money to schools on the rebound
academically and would make more college aid available to
high-achieving students in failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conversations with school officials, parents and students
and in visits to schools in St. Louis and Kansas City, it was made
clear to me that federal resources should be doing more to benefit
the kids,'' said Ashcroft, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the bill calls for $800 million in additional funding
over five years _ $750 million of it for college assistance and $50
million for schools that regain lost state accreditation status.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City schools are to lose Missouri State School Board
accreditation May 1. St. Louis schools are on probation in lieu of
accreditation withdrawal. Ashcroft has mentioned the troubled
schools in his campaign for re-election against Gov. Mel Carnahan,
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an effort to fix the blame; this is an effort to
fix the problem,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's campaign manager, Marc Farinella, said Ashcroft's
bill is politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft has not paid an ounce of attention to the
problems of urban schools until this election year,'' Farinella
said. ``Secondly, John Ashcroft was largely the reason the courts
ran those schools for two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Farinella said that as governor from 1985 to 1993, Ashcroft
chose to litigate instead of negotiate a way out of the federal
desegregation order imposed upon the Kansas City and St. Louis
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnahan has finally made real progress in getting the courts
out of the way and returning schools to local control,'' Farinella
said. A federal court had lifted the desegregation order and
federal oversight of Kansas City Schools, but that was overturned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft proposes that federal aid for schools failing to meet
state accreditation standards be based on whether they stress basic
skills courses, have more mentoring programs and hire and keep
high-quality teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that regain accreditation for two straight years would
have those funding restrictions lifted and would have access to $10
million annually, over five years, in new federal funding to reward
teachers and principals for improved student performance and for
professional development courses.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would at least double federal financial aid to
high-achieving students in failing schools.

1999 JOBS DATA PAINT A ROSIER PICTURE FOR UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upstate New York, where the economy remained bleak even as an
economic boom swept the rest of the nation, suddenly spurted ahead
of much of the country in terms of job creation, according to new
data for 1999 released Wednesday by the New York State Department
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   And because job growth in and around New York City continued at
a white-hot pace last year, employment in New York state as a whole
grew faster than the national average for the first time since
1983, state officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of private-sector jobs upstate grew by 2.5 percent
last year, while downstate _ in the city, Long Island and the
northern suburbs _ private-sector employment jumped 3.2 percent.
Nationally, jobs grew by 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New York state added almost 200,000 jobs last year, and is now
ranked seventh in terms of employment growth, behind Sun Belt
states like Nevada and Florida, but ahead of Texas, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those rankings are subject to change, economists cautioned, as
other states revise their 1999 economic figures to take account of
new data. It was just such a revision that pushed New York's
numbers up so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs numbers could change the political climate in the
state, because the woes of the upstate economy have already become
an issue in the race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Hillary Rodham Clinton said, ``If upstate New
York state were an independent state, it would consistently rank in
the bottom fifth of job growth.'' In 1998, the number of jobs
upstate grew by just 1.7 percent, while nationally jobs grew by 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new 1999 data, upstate would rank about 13th, said
Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki. At a
news conference Wednesday, the governor called the new data ``clear
proof that this state is back.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge divide between upstate and downstate may also be
closing, at least economically. While New York City's job creation
and its suburbs continued at rates not seen since the 1950s, the
city's growth was outpaced last year by much of the Hudson Valley
and by Utica. The number of jobs increased in every major
metropolitan area, and the only city reporting slower growth than
in 1998 was Elmira.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a big dichotomy, but there's more of a
convergence now,'' said Jason Bramm, an economist at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why or how the upstate economy has improved remains
unclear, although Pataki suggested that his administration's tax
cuts and regulatory reductions had played an important role.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing, which is extremely important to cities like
Buffalo and Rochester, continued to decline last year, cutting
almost 19,000 jobs statewide, or 2.1 percent. But service
businesses, whose employees range from computer technicians to
security guards, added 124,000 positions, an increase of 4.4
percent. And construction has been particularly strong, Kagann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge revision _ the department of labor has
increased the job count for last year by about 60,000 from its
preliminary number, released in January _ economists generally
consider jobs data to be fairly reliable. Information is collected
from 18,000 companies around the state, and later replaced with
complete figures culled from records for the unemployment insurance
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest revisions were in upstate cities like Buffalo,
Rochester and Albany, Bramm said. ``Has upstate suddenly staged a
rebound? No,'' he said. ``We suddenly realized upstate has staged a
rebound.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economists are less confident in unemployment figures, which are
based on a far smaller survey and cannot be crosschecked against
tax records. In recent years, the unemployment data have not
tracked the job creation figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, despite the big increase in new jobs last year,
unemployment upstate has not budged from the 4.1 percent level,
adjusted for seasonal factors, reported in January of 1999. In New
York City, by contrast, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1
percent from 7.4 percent during the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, unemployment averaged 4.0 percent in January, down
slightly from 4.3 percent a year ago.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The race for the Republican nomination for
president now enters its most intensive phase. The electoral
calendar is closing in on John McCain, with all the primaries which
really matter compacted into the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's sheer power of organization and his
establishment support should now start to count. Unless McCain wins
California and New York in a week's time, his campaign is all but
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest until now has been a guerrilla campaign
for McCain, as he picked off states one by one in bitter,
close-fought individual state races. The terrain and the style of
campaign favored an insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it becomes a series of vast pitched battles, multi-state
primaries where he will find it far harder to score.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the primaries that are coming up are closed to Democrats
and independents, the constituency he has drawn on so far. The
Democrats will hold their own primaries on the same days, making it
harder to draw party switchers across to the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   And the scale of the campaign _ from the Pacific to the Atlantic
_ favors Bush, who has already built campaign machines in all of
the key states with the millions of dollars that he has spent.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle comes next Tuesday when thirteen states vote
for Republican candidates, including New York and California, two
of the biggest prizes.
</P>
<P>
   In total, about a third of the country's population and the
Republican delegates are at stake. This is the single biggest event
in the electoral calendar.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is ahead in some of the polls in New York, behind in
others: it may be close.
</P>
<P>
   In California he is well behind. And even in New York, where he
may win, the voting system means he would not end up with all of
the delegates, whereas in California, the ``winner takes all''
system is used.
</P>
<P>
   There is more bad news: in California, though Democrats and
independents can vote, their scores do not count towards the choice
of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain could win the largest number of votes and still lose the
primary. This could make the results highly controversial and
perhaps even subject to a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mega Tuesday'' also includes what amounts to a New England
regional primary, where McCain will probably win solidly. It is
possible that he could also make inroads in Ohio and Maryland. If
he won all those states and New York, but loses California, he
would still be trailing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Sky primary, three days later, again seems set to give
Bush solid support as Utah, Colorado and Wyoming vote.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain's home state of Arizona is not far away, the polls
in Colorado, the largest of the three states, show Bush in front.
That could all change with a victory in California, of course,
making the state yet more important.
</P>
<P>
   The following Tuesday, the second big event of the year will
deliver 16 percent of the delegates and it is here that McCain will
have his toughest day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Tuesday'' brings out most of the states in America's
South, which is fertile ground for Bush, as he showed in South
Carolina. Texas is his home state. In Florida the state's governor
is Jeb Bush, Bush's brother.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if McCain has not made some inroads before then, Bush
would almost certainly emerge as the clear winner on March 14 if
not before, with just short of the delegates he needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Only if McCain can win California and capture some other large
states before then is he still in the race.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to count the results, of course. McCain has
proved agile on the campaign trail so far, and the poll gaps
between the candidates are not large in some cases. A victory in
California would give his campaign huge momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of McCain's strategy are becoming clear. His
campaign has shifted ground in the last few days, attacking the
religious right. This will help him in some key areas where
Catholic, Jewish and socially moderate voters may make all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   It will underpin his support in the Northeast and New York, and
it could help in California and possibly Florida. In the South, it
will harden the vote against him, though this is probably lost
ground already.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an uphill fight. The hard arithmetic is that unless
McCain wins California and New York next week, and then takes
Florida the week after, his position looks impossible. &QL;

SKIING: FINDING SOME ADVENTURE WHERE ADVENTURE IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ski and snowboard season heads into spring, it's still
not too late to infuse the waning season with a bit of adventure.
Groomed trails and the steeps are not bad for a steady diet. But
how about Snow-Cat skiing, a weekend clinic, or an overnight
excursion?
</P>
<P>
   One small way to stray from the straight and narrow is by
checking out the new toys available at most mountain rental centers
_ twin-tip skis, for example, or snow bikes. You can also rent a
new pair of high-performance shaped skis for an afternoon. Or you
can take a snowboarding or ski lesson to dust off residual bad
habits.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are up for more extended _ and yes, more expensive _
diversions, here are a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   SNOW-CAT SKIING _ Although helicopter rides into powder fields
are fast and convenient, they are also expensive. But for a much
lower fee, Western ski areas are increasingly adding access by
Snow-Cat to their backcountry areas.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, ordinarily used for downhill grooming, are being
transformed into tank-like taxis for skiers and snowboarders. For
about $100 to $300 a day, these leviathans of the wilderness take
you to places where the powder is virgin and the hills are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Targhee, Wyo., the out-of-bounds terrain covers 1,500
acres of mountainside with a 2,470-foot vertical drop. The
snow-laden slopes cater to about 20 people at a time _ 10 per
Snow-Cat. Last week, Targhee received 41 inches of new snow in a
24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give out snorkels here as souvenirs,'' said Susie
Barnett-Bushong, a spokeswoman for Grand Targhee. ``But the snow
was so light, people actually needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the best in powder conditions _ a day with
so much light and fluffy snow that skiers are said to need a
snorkel. White spray kicks up from downhill skis or snowboards like
a plume of spray _ enough to want that snorkel now and then for
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Other resorts that offer Snow-Cat skiing include:
Northstar-at-Tahoe, Calif.; Ski Cooper, Colo.; Big Mountain, Mont.;
and Deer Valley, Utah. Resort areas in the East usually do not have
deep enough snow or vast enough terrain to support Snow-Cat skiing.
</P>
<P>
   SKI CLINIC _ Tamara McKinney, the U.S. World Cup Alpine champion
who retired in 1989, is still in top form. Having joined forces
with Rossignol, the French ski manufacturer, she now gives
instructional clinics for women. A four-day seminar is being
offered this year from March 23-26 at Squaw Valley, Calif. ``We
want it to be an inspiring clinic where women can come and enjoy
skiing but also get technical advice and expert instruction,'' the
37-year-old McKinney said in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is entitled Spirit of the Mountains. Participants are
being offered reduced room rates at the Resort at Squaw Creek, a
luxury hotel at the base of Squaw Valley's resort area. Rossignol
is making its newest skis and boots available to clinic members as
part of the $525-per-person entry fee (which also includes a
three-day lift pass at Squaw Valley). It will be a ``full-service,
luxury clinic,'' McKinney said. Special room rates start at $127 a
person based on double occupancy. The schedule includes videotaping
of participants during instruction and a subsequent race.
Information: (800) 401-9501.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS-COUNTRY TREK _ A two-day trip on cross-country skis or
snowshoes _ with a lobster dinner served in a canvas-covered yurt
at the end of the day _ is not your average wilderness adventure.
But it is a regular excursion for the Birches, a resort along
Moosehead Lake in Rockwood, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It is situated on an 11,000-acre wooded preserve with 40 miles
of cross-country ski trails. Three yurts _ 12-foot round wood
structures covered with canvas _ are heated by wood-burning stoves.
Each is equipped with gas lights, a cooking stove and sleeping
accommodations (with linens) for four people.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for a two-day trip, including lunch and dinner and an
overnight stay in a yurt is $139 a person. The staff at the Birches
takes the lobster dinner by snowmobile out to the yurt. The resort
also hauls in personal luggage. The length of the season depends on
the level of snow pack on the trails, which this week was at an
ample three feet. For information: (800) 825-9453. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The race for the Republican nomination for
president now enters its most intensive phase. The electoral
calendar is closing in on John McCain, with all the primaries which
really matter compacted into the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's sheer power of organization and his
establishment support should now start to count. Unless McCain wins
California and New York in a week's time, his campaign is all but
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest until now has been a guerrilla campaign
for McCain, as he picked off states one by one in bitter,
close-fought individual state races. The terrain and the style of
campaign favored an insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it becomes a series of vast pitched battles, multi-state
primaries where he will find it far harder to score.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the primaries that are coming up are closed to Democrats
and independents, the constituency he has drawn on so far. The
Democrats will hold their own primaries on the same days, making it
harder to draw party switchers across to the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   And the scale of the campaign _ from the Pacific to the Atlantic
_ favors Bush, who has already built campaign machines in all of
the key states with the millions of dollars that he has spent.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle comes next Tuesday when thirteen states vote
for Republican candidates, including New York and California, two
of the biggest prizes.
</P>
<P>
   In total, about a third of the country's population and the
Republican delegates are at stake. This is the single biggest event
in the electoral calendar.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is ahead in some of the polls in New York, behind in
others: it may be close.
</P>
<P>
   In California he is well behind. And even in New York, where he
may win, the voting system means he would not end up with all of

ON HOCKEY: RESTLESS IN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mark Messier trade rumor is the hockey version of the Elvis
sighting. Wishful discussions on the subject are easy to start,
harder to verify. Having signaled his willingness to leave the
Vancouver Canucks before the March 14 trade deadline, Messier is
the subject of intense gossip. The New York Rangers and the New
Jersey Devils are in the swirl of speculation, and the Buffalo
Sabres were, too, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Regier, Buffalo's general manager, called his Canucks
counterpart, Brian Burke, to ask about the availability of Messier,
a 21-year veteran who might have one more Stanley Cup run left in
his 39-year-old body. Burke told Regier he would not ask Messier to
waive his no-trade clause. That was the official answer. Mike Peca,
Buffalo's captain, has his own theory. ``Messier probably wouldn't
choose Buffalo as one of his destinations,'' Peca said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, that is a shame. Hard by the international
border, housed in a fine new arena, the Sabres are a prime
franchise with a loyal and enthusiastic fan base, the kind of
sub-Canadian team that deserves to convert its good community karma
to good results.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres will sell out 24 of their 41 home games this season,
not bad for a smaller market. But not all of those customers are
expressing happiness. Having watched their team reach the Stanley
Cup finals last June, the fans of Western New York are disappointed
to see the team struggling to make the playoffs this time.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday night's game with the Rangers at Madison
Square Garden, the Sabres ranked ninth in an Eastern Conference
that will send only eight teams to the tournament. They were 1
point behind the eighth-place Rangers, so the game had an added
edge beyond cross-state bragging rights. Regarding the attitude of
the paying public, Peca called the Buffalo fans ``very impatient,
and for good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of high expectations placed on us, by media,
fans and ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for Buffalo's struggles this season. Dominik
Hasek, the superstar goalie, had missed all but 19 of Buffalo's 64
games with injury. Collectively, the Sabres seemed to suffer a
post-playoff lapse, lacking enthusiasm for a long season after a
two-month tournament grind that ended in June with Dallas taking
the sixth and final game in overtime on a disputed goal by Brett
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Peca said he understands the fan frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business now where athletes are being paid multimillion
dollar contracts and the ticket holders feel they can voice their
opinions,'' Peca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a lot of that in Buffalo. But it has been good to
see us play our way out of it the last little while.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday night's game, the Sabres were 8-5-3 in
their previous 16 games and Peca had paced them. In the previous 17
games, he had scored 10 goals. But in the first 47 games, Peca had
only 6 goals.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best performances of the season came last week
against the Rangers at Marine Midland Arena. In the first half of
the game, Peca scored three goals and crunched Brian Leetch, the
Ranger captain, with a punishing body check. But after that, the
Sabres unraveled, losing by 6-3 as Hasek faltered and Petr Nedved
scored a hat trick for New York.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it has gone for the Sabres all year.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from Buffalo's lineup Wednesday night was the rookie
Maxim Afinogenov, an exquisitely talented right wing with advanced
puck-handling skills. Afinogenov has 13 goals, fifth on the team,
in only 48 games, so his absence was curious for a team whose total
of 160 goals ranked 22nd in a 28-team league. Lindy Ruff, the coach
of the Sabres, kept him out of uniform for the second consecutive
game. Afinogenov is healthy, but the coach is not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's slumping, he hasn't done a lot on the road,'' Ruff said.
``Most of his points of late have come at home. The guys who are
playing the best have to play. I can't give Max an extra inch or an
extra game to try to get him going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said his rookie star ``hasn't been creating'' in road games
and has been giving ``individual effort'' instead of working with
his teammates the way he does at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets a lot more attention on the road,'' Ruff said. ``Teams
lean on him more. They get the matchups they want on the road. If
we're trying to get the Peca line against a certain line, I can't
afford to get another change to get Max away from somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in Wednesday night's game, after taking a 1-0 lead, the
Sabres failed to score on two power plays. They are last in the
league on the power play. When a team reaches the month of March
without crossing the .500 mark, the reasons are many.  &QL;

will harden the vote against him, though this is probably lost
ground already.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an uphill fight. The hard arithmetic is that unless
McCain wins California and New York next week, and then takes
Florida the week after, his position looks impossible. &QL;

BREAK UP THE KIWIS: ROUT OF PRADA COMPLETE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ For the first time in the storied
history of the America's Cup, a syndicate outside the United States
has successfully defended the trophy that spent 131 years ensconced
in the halls of the New York Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after a dominating performance in which Team New
Zealand, the representative of the defending Royal New Zealand
Yacht Squadron, closed out the Prada Challenge in a five-race sweep
of the five-of-nine finals, another question has been raised: Will
it be another 130 years before anyone can wrest the cup from the
Kiwis?
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to discuss such matters as history or legacy in the
days leading to Thursday's victory, the Kiwi skipper Russell
Coutts' remarks never varied. Coutts insisted that the New
Zealanders' success was the result of a team effort, and for Race 5
he proved that his words were not empty ones by stepping off the
boat and handing the wheel to his 26-year-old understudy, Dean
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts' actions were all the more magnanimous considering that,
after Wednesday's victory, his record-tying ninth straight in cup
finals, he was in position with a victory Thursday to break the
fabled skipper Charlie Barr's nearly 100-year-old mark for
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   With the veteran tactician Brad Butterworth virtually tattooed
to Barker's side and providing a personal wave-by-wave commentary
on the wind and his strategy, the youthful skipper picked up
exactly where Coutts had left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan for our campaign to work new people in and it's
been a good thing,'' Butterworth said. ``Dean Barker's a great
yachtie. He's done a lot for us. I can't complain about how he
sailed the boat and I don't think anybody can.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barker was the least bit nervous, it didn't show. When Prada
attacked and tried to slip past the Kiwis' transom at the starting
line, Barker spun his bow down and closed out the Italians. Then,
timing his start perfectly, he led the Italians back to the line
and crossed 12 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a fantastic job at the start,'' Butterworth said. ``We
couldn't have planned it better and he couldn't have done it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous four races in this remarkably one-sided
America's Cup regatta, Team New Zealand was in absolute control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an amazing feeling to finish this off in five races,''
Barker said. ``We talked about me coming on board earlier this
week. If we got a good lead, Russell said he was going to give me a
go. So today Russell asked if I wanted to race. How could I turn
down an opportunity like this?''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, to their credit, did not lie down. The Prada
tactician Torben Grael did his best to dictate the action,
initiating a tacking duel with the Kiwis, but their boat, NZL60,
was the stronger vessel in every facet of the match. It had shown
better maneuverability in the pre-start dance, it was quicker
through tacks, and it was simply faster when the two boats legged
out.
</P>
<P>
   At the top mark of the first leg, the defender's lead was 24
seconds. And the Kiwis would never look back.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon carried on, the breeze continued to build,
topping off at well over 20 knots for the first time in what had
mostly been a light-air series. If there was one downside to the
Kiwis' brilliant closing performance, it was that they finished the
series without showing the challengers what they had in the tank in
solid wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat did really well today,'' Butterworth said. ``They're
not easy boats to sail, believe me. They tend to come together a
bit more in a breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kiwis crossed the finish line 48 seconds ahead of Prada
_ under spinnaker, with whitecaps rolling down the gulf and spray
cleaving off the bow of their powerful black sloop _ for the first
time since they started dismantling the Italians more than two
weeks ago, they let loose with a show of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts clambered aboard and was soon joined by the rest of the
sailing team. Champagne followed, and corks were popped on the
Hauraki Gulf. In countless pubs and yacht clubs from Russell to the
north to Invercargill in the south, the scene was repeated
countless times. For the next three years, at least, New Zealand
will remain home to the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep this team together and get better and better
and better, it would be great for this country,'' Butterworth said.
``Sailing has become something very special in New Zealand at this
moment.''

   (UNDATED) _ Rosita Pedro was born in a tree Wednesday as the
brown crocodile-infested floodwaters of Mozambique's Limpopo River
swirled around her and her terrified mother, Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Mozambique's worst floods in living memory, with
death and destruction all around them, Sofia's survival, let alone
her infant's daughter's safe delivery was a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of thousands of other desperate Mozambicans, a
heavily pregnant Sofia climbed a tree to escape the raging flood
waters of the Chokwe region, one of the areas devastated by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
   That was last Sunday. For three days, she hung on not knowing if
or when help would arrive. She was into her fourth agonizing day,
without food or water, when the baby started to come.
</P>
<P>
   Racked by labor pains, she clung to the branches and, without
anesthesia, the infant was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sofia clung on, the lifeline of the umbilical cord keeping her
baby alive. And then suddenly out of nowhere, as if in answer to
her prayers, Sofia heard the clattering blades of a South African
air force helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen helicopters are operating throughout the vast
flooded area. ``We spotted her just in time,'' said an air force
medic named Godfrey, too modest to give his full name. ``I was
lowered onto the tree and helped her give birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Sofia and the baby were hoisted into the
helicopter. ``They were both doing well,'' Godfrey added.
</P>
<P>
   A South African television crew filmed the scene from another
helicopter. ``They winched down a paramedic first and he cut the
umbilical cord and cleaned them up,'' said a TV cameraman Adolf
Spangenberg. ``Then they winched up the baby, followed by the
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pedro, 26, and her baby, wrapped in a little bundle, were
taken to higher ground for medical help. After her ordeal, Mrs.
Pedro still looking dazed, said she was just ``happy'' that she and
her baby were alive.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in the floods disaster is officially 200 but aid
officials believe thousands of corpses may be found when the flood
waters eventually recede.
</P>
<P>
   More than one million have been driven from their homes, with
numerous towns and villages completely submerged by water coursing
from the swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100,000 like Mrs. Pedro were left to cling to roof tops,
the branches of tall trees, floating debris or power pylons.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4,000 other women are expected to give birth over the
coming weeks in difficult circumstances without medical assistance.
The U.N. Wednesday appealed for baby delivery kits to be included
in emergency aid supplies for Mozambique. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Bodne, who with her husband, Ben, fell in love
with the Algonquin Hotel on their honeymoon and later owned it for
41 years, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She
was 93.
</P>
<P>
   She lived at the elegant Midtown hotel, the literary hangout of
the Jazz Age, from 1946 until her death, spending most afternoons
in her lobby armchair greeting regulars.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when the Bodnes, newly married, lunched at the
Algonquin in the early 1920s and sighted Will Rogers, whom they had
seen the night before at the Ziegfeld Follies; Douglas Fairbanks
Sr., Sinclair Lewis, Eddie Cantor, Gertrude Lawrence and Beatrice
Lillie. The bride joked to her husband, an oil distributor in
Charleston, S.C., that after he bought the baseball team he dreamed
about, he should get her the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ben Bodne toyed with buying the Pittsburgh Pirates, he
never bought a ball club. But in 1946 he paid around $1 million for
the 200-room hotel at 59 W. 44th Street, between Fifth Avenue and
the Avenue of the Americas. The couple promptly moved in.
</P>
<P>
   For the former Mary Mazo, the Algonquin was the final address in
an odyssey that began in Odessa, Ukraine, where she was the second
child in a large Jewish family that fled the pogroms when she was
an infant. A family story has it that the baby Mary began to cry in
an attic while Cossacks rampaged below, but that she miraculously
hushed up before it was too late. It is said that Mary Bodne's
later loquaciousness was compensation for that momentary silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Mazo family immigrated to Charleston, where the father,
Elihu, opened the city's first Jewish delicatessen. When George
Gershwin and DuBose Heyward were working on ``Porgy and Bess,''
they were frequent customers. They would also discuss the creation
of the show at dinners in the Mazo family home.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the Mazo tradition of hospitality would continue
at the Algonquin. Bodne cooked chicken soup for an ailing Laurence
Olivier. She baby-sat for Simone Signoret, who called her ``one of
my three truest friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodne had a gift for acquiring house seats for sold-out Broadway
shows for desperate friends. Ella Fitzgerald was so grateful that
she regularly sang to Bodne whenever she stayed at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish writer Brendan Behan was so touched by a courtesy that
he declared, ``Mary, your son will live to be pope,'' even though
Bodne was Jewish and had two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The daughters, Renee Colby Chubet and Barbara Anspach, both live
in Manhattan. Bodne is also survived by four sisters: Annie Rabin
and Celie Weissman, both of Manhattan, and Minnie Meislin and Norma
Mazo, both of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bodnes bought the Algonquin, built in 1902 in the French
Renaissance style, from Frank Case, who had catered to writers and
editors from The New Yorker and other nearby publications. Among
them were Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Franklin P. Adams, Edna
Ferber and Alexander Woollcott. They gathered around several tables
before settling on the round one that became famous, not least
because of Case's knack for publicity.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought the hotel, Ben Bodne, who enjoyed promoting
boxing matches, said he would not attempt to recreate Case's role
as boniface of the literati. But he said he regarded the Algonquin
as an investment and, as such, had no intention of changing its
essential character. So he kept the mahogany panels and deep-pile
carpeting, while adding such amenities as color television and
air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bodnes ended up playing host to a new generation of literary
and show business celebrities, like the writer John Henry Falk when
he was blacklisted and exiled from Hollywood. Alan Jay Lerner and
Frederick Loewe made so much noise working on a musical that the
other guests complained; the show was the hugely successful ``My
Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bodne, who died in 1992, had vowed that he would sell the
charmingly dowager hotel the day it needed self-service elevators.
He sold it in 1987 to Aoki Corp., the Brazilian subsidiary of a
Japanese corporation, which in a 1991 renovation installed
self-service elevators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Aoki sold the hotel to Camberley Hotel Co., which
promptly did its own $4 million renovation, promising no major
changes. In an article in The New York Times, Julie V. Iovine noted
that the newsstand had been sacrificed for space to sell coffee
mugs, and that door numbers had been replaced by plaques featuring
remarks by the famed Algonquin wits. The impression, she wrote, was
``self-consciousness verging on kitsch.''
</P>
<P>
   At a party celebrating the makeover, Mary Bodne sat on the new
velvet chair that had replaced her beloved old sagging one. ``What
I've seen looks very nice, but it will never look like my old
Algonquin now,'' she said. ``No, darling, I know it will never be
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the cat. Each owner of the Algonquin, including the
Bodnes, has kept a lobby cat. The current feline is named Matilda.

   (UNDATED) _ Finally, a major if still barely coordinated relief
effort is under way for Mozambique. But as one of southern Africa's
greatest natural disasters in memory threatens to become even more
overwhelming, several burning questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the aid take so long to be mobilized _ and will it be
enough?
</P>
<P>
   Why were warnings of an imminent disaster misjudged when the
Zambesi and the Kyle Rivers were rising at three centimeters (over
an inch) per hour last week?
</P>
<P>
   And above all, why did the United Nations' quick response unit,
along with two officials from Britain's Department for
International Development, leave Mozambique last week?
</P>
<P>
   Now, at last, as the sheer scale of the flood catastrophe has
sunk home, Britain and other Western countries Wednesday began to
put together the assistance required to save the estimated 100,000
people already trapped and, to cope with as many more facing a
similar plight in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced that Britain was sending two large transport aircraft to
Mozambique, carrying 69 inflatable boats, dozens of rafts and
several four-wheel drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft would be leaving Thursday, Clare Short, the
Secretary of State for International Development, said, promising
that the United Kingdom would ``do all in its power to get whatever
equipment we can get here as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other European countries are also despatching assistance, while
a giant American cargo plane landed at Mozambique's capital,
Maputo, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more U.S. helicopters are also due shortly, to join those
from South Africa and Malawi already working flat out.
</P>
<P>
   The former colonial power Portugal has dispatched Luis Amado,
its top development aid official, to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the flurry of action has not been not enough to mollify the
anger of international aid agencies at what they condemn as yet
another failure of the rich and self-centered West to respond with
sufficient speed to a crisis in a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had happened in the West, the response would have been
entirely different,'' said John O'Shea, director of the Irish
relief agency Goal, who called the effort of the big powers so far
``pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the noble promises of assistance, it was far from
clear how fast help would arrive. Short denied claims by some
newspapers that squabbling between her department and the Ministry
of Defense had held up the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, every sign is that the crisis will worsen
before it gets better. According to Mozambique's President, Joaquim
Chissano, up to one million people are ``in movement'' _ refugees
in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   As some aid agencies admitted, one reason for the delay lay in
their own misjudgement. ``We were caught on the hop,'' Eileen
Maybin, of Christian Aid, admitted.
</P>
<P>
   She and most other observers believed that the worst of the
crisis was over by last weekend. Instead, new surges of flood have
come from inland along the great rivers, while another cyclone is
barrelling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is terrible and going to get worse,'' Short
warned the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   But how to explain the failure to react to earlier warnings _ as
early as Feb. 18 _ when Zimbabwe was warning of imminent overflow
of the Zambesi and the Kyle Rivers?
</P>
<P>
   When the United Nations and the outside world did wake up to the
danger, there were familiar bureaucratic tangles in Europe while,
on the spot, tensions emerged between Mozambique and the U.N. Rapid
Response Unit, as the latter announced a $13 million appeal without
consulting the local government's own disaster agency, INGC.
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel was patched up when both sides launched a far larger
joint appeal for $65 million, but precious time and energy had been
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor has been the failure of Africa itself to respond.
Apart from some help from Malawi, a long tongue of whose territory
extends south into Mozambique, and Botswana, regional assistance
has been virtually limited to seven helicopters from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working around the clock, by Tuesday the helicopters had
rescued barely 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, the continent's other potential ``superpower,'' has
provided nothing, while Zimbabwe, which has more than 30
helicopters, seems to have deployed most of them in the ruinous and
futile civil war in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique itself reportedly has but one functioning helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   None of this explains why logistical support from the massive
U.S. base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean has not been
forthcoming, why the West dithered for a crucial two weeks, and why
its satellites and other assorted resources not detect southern
Africa's calamity-in-the-making.
</P>
<P>
   When the waters subside, and Mozambique is safe again, some very
hard questions will have to be answered. &QL;

AFTER MIDNIGHT IN NEW JERSEY, IT'S POST TIME IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several midnights a month, Hong Kong expatriates _ waiters from
Chinatown, bartenders from Kennedy Airport, factory workers from
Brooklyn and Queens _ head for the horses. After their shifts, they
escape to the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, N.J., where
they bet, cheer and swear as the thoroughbreds run, 13 time zones
ahead. The live simulcasts can last until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night trips are a cure for homesickness for these
transplants from a city obsessed with horse racing, where the Hong
Kong Jockey Club is the center of social life. The club takes in
$10 billion a year, drawing crowds of up to 70,000 people a day,
including wealthy businessmen in private boxes and working-class
families dressed in their finest. It is a bastion of Old World
luxury. It is everything that the early morning Meadowlands, with
its stark lighting, smoky cashier lines and shuttered doughnut
shops, is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are used to basically all the amenities, but we're
on the wrong side of planet Earth at this time,'' said Paul J.Q.
Lee, a consultant for the Meadowlands who arranges for a van that
picks up many of the gamblers at Chatham Square in Manhattan for
$15 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As the 15-seat van headed down the New Jersey Turnpike one
recent frigid night, nobody on board was wearing formal attire _
and there were no women, children or tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a seat near the front, Yui Chuen Ho, 60, a retired Hong Kong
taxi driver, enthusiastically explained his approach to the Sport
of Kings. ``Betting on horses is like the stock market, not like
the casino,'' he said through a translator. ``It doesn't depend on
luck.'' Stabbing the air with his index finger, he said one must
study the horse's face, body and legs as the horse is presented to
the public before the race, and make sure the rear hoof lands in
the print of the front hoof. ``It's got to slip in exactly the same
spot, and if not there's something wrong with it,'' said Ho, who
bought a house in Hong Kong with a window facing the downtown
track. ``How smooth is the tail? Is the hair smooth and shiny? It
must have tight muscles. It must not stumble. The eyes must look
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Several rows in the back, another passenger _ a 35-year-old who
has been in the country 10 years and gave only his first name, Fred
_ scoffed at such handicapping. ``Why don't you just ask a fortune
teller?'' he said. ``I don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The men arrived at the track about 12:15 a.m., and soon rushed
off to take their places in the Meadowlands clubhouse, in chairs
with one television screen each, or in the public viewing areas, to
catch the early-afternoon post time in Hong Kong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some bettors had study books, marked with Post-It notes, showing
each horse's family tree, back to great-grandsires and great-grand
dams. Others held printouts of racing Web pages, in Chinese or
English. They watched attendants in hunting pinks escort horses
around the Asian track before the afternoon races. On this side of
the video screen, people wore jeans, flipped their pens nervously
and sipped sodas.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadowlands started broadcasting races from Hong Kong four
years ago. At the height of the simulcasts' popularity, a couple of
busloads of workers from Chinatown would make the late-night ride,
drawn by Hong Kong entertainers and special events like karaoke and
a dancing dragon.
</P>
<P>
   But the late hours proved to be too much for most gamblers,
organizers said. The food is limited, and the Meadowlands track's
bars close around post time in Hong Kong. The number of customers
has dwindled down to one vanload and another couple of dozen
die-hards who make the trip in their own cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Meadowlands management considers it worthwhile to stay
open for the races, which are broadcast live by satellite from the
Hong Kong club's Happy Valley and Sha Tin racecourses 8,000 miles
away. The Meadowlands pays 3 percent of the total bet on the Hong
Kong races to an intermediary for the Jockey Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the betting standpoint, even though it's early in the
morning, it does comparatively well with races during normal
business hours,'' said Chris McErlean, vice president and general
manager of the Meadowlands racetrack, who had seen other tracks in
California, Vancouver and Toronto attract early-morning crowds with
simulcast races from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always amazed at the amount of money that's bet on it,
given the time frame,'' he said. Last year, 500 to 700 people would
come in between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m., he said, and bet about $60,000
over five or six races. The Meadowlands also broadcasts races from
England, Australia and the West Coast, for a total of 20 hours of
simulcasts a day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One diehard fan, Sammy Chan, 52, aimed binoculars at a
large-screen television for a close-up view of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ear is straight up, that means he's fresh,'' Chan said.
``That detail tells you something.'' He had driven from Kennedy
Airport after finishing work as a bartender and would be driving
home to the Bronx after the races. ``It's a challenge for yourself.
It's good. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans are also adamant about the superiority of Hong Kong's
thoroughbreds. ``American horses look like they are fake,'' said
Kinpint Mui, 35, a gambler who works in a Chinatown factory. ``They
are so slow. There's no excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the horses in Hong Kong are all imports from England,
the United States, Australia and Japan. They are more likely to be
offspring of the best sires, but do not have as fancy a pedigree as
the big winners themselves, said Alan Shuback, the foreign editor
of The Daily Racing Form. If a horse arrives in Hong Kong with an
inauspicious name, he said, it will most likely be changed to
something like Dragon Win, Horse of Healthy or Clement Fortune. Not
to mention Chinese Tea, Tea for Gentlemen and Tea for You.
</P>
<P>
   The track at Happy Valley, in downtown Hong Kong, is triangular,
and made of turf instead of dirt, the common surface in America.
Races usually have 12 or 16 horses, while in the United States,
horses often race in heats of 6 or 7, he said. They run clockwise,
the British way.

 UNDATED: British way.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee, the consultant for the Meadowlands, who has also arranged
trips from Chinatown to Atlantic City, N.J., and the Foxwood
Resorts Casino in Connecticut, has noticed other differences in the
racing cultures. ``We don't have negative stigma about gambling,
like in church, where they say it is a bad thing,'' Lee said. ``In
Hong Kong, it's a family experience.''
</P>
<P>
   People there wager more on horse races, he said, with about $10
billion bet annually in a population of 7 million, compared with
$2.5 billion a year bet among 280 million Americans. Before the
hand-over to China, the Jockey Club was the city's second largest
business _ after Jardine Matheson, the trading house _ and
contributed about 10 percent of the government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the importance of racing in Hong Kong, one gambler
recalled how, before Britain returned the city to China in 1997,
Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, had soothed fears by pledging that
the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club would endure, though in deference
to the new political climate, the century-old club dropped the
``royal'' from its name.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations remain more majestic than Maoist. ``You have
everything from galleries for the masses to the most exquisite
boxes for the elite of Hong Kong,'' Lee said. He described a lofty
scene: boxes with two large buffet tables, serving Cantonese and
Western food, Yung Chow fried rice next to roast beef. Waiters and
waitresses deliver meals to spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exquisite experience,'' he said. ``You're eating the
finest, in very strict, old British style.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for the early-morning Meadowlands, where
some rooms resemble a bus terminal more than a gracious buffet.
Most of the men from Chinatown stayed in the Race World Teletheater
on the grandstand's paddock level. It has two connected rooms with
a black ceiling, 156 seats, most of them empty, each with
television monitors that broadcast several channels, including the
Hong Kong races in both English and Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the men kept to themselves or talked in pairs as they
hung out by the video monitors or drifted near the cashier windows.
Few took advantage of the hot dogs and french fries still for sale.
</P>
<P>
   During each race, the British announcers' excited voices rose up
a steady chromatic scale. The six races, about half an hour apart,
did not evoke much noise from the crowd at the Meadowlands, aside
from the occasional cussing out of a horse. ``Come on, Fly Me
Outside,'' an agitated man yelled at the screens. ``I need the 3,
not the 5. I need the damn 3! I can't win a thing on this track!''
</P>
<P>
   There is an occasional language barrier. Paul Campanelli, a
teller at a betting window, said he once asked a bettor who had
trouble making himself understood to write down the numbers of the
horses he wanted to bet on. The man returned a while later _ with
the numbers written in Chinese characters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The men like to talk about how much can be won by picking the
win, place and show horses in three races, it is theoretically
possible to win $5,000 with a $2 bet. But at 3:30 a.m., when the
van was ready to return to Manhattan, no winners were getting on
board. Yui Chuen Ho, who said he was always prepared to lose $1,000
at the track, had lost $200. Fred said he had lost $80. Nobody was
particularly bothered by the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Gang, who had driven to New Jersey after his shift at a
Brooklyn factory, put it this way: ``It's special to come here. I
just want to have all the trouble to forget about, and feel happy.
I don't mind if I win money or lose money.''

<P>
   The string of victories for George W. Bush in the Republican
primaries on Tuesday has left John McCain, his challenger,
apparently sprawled on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the electoral fat lady has not yet sung. Not until
next week's Super Tuesday _ a bumper crop that includes California,
New York, Massachusetts and nine other states _ do we reach the
generally agreed point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has confounded expectations before. The scale of his
victory in New Hampshire stunned Bush's supporters. He was written
off after his defeat in South Carolina _ and returned from the
political dead in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that Bush won not just Virginia and North
Dakota but also the state of Washington suggests that the era of
McCain excitement may be drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Washington was expected to be close; in reality,
Bush achieved victory by a triumphant 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that U.S. politics is returning to a sense of
steady-as-she-goes. The potential shake-up elements have fallen by
the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Oddball candidates such as the billionaires Steve Forbes and
Donald Trump are gone. On the Democratic side, the outsider Bill
Bradley _ whose remarkable successes made the vice president, Al
Gore, feel uncomfortable in recent months _ now seems out for the
count.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made an all-out bid in Washington state; he was defeated
there by a crushing margin of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the outsider is doomed to remain on the outside.
Even Bradley's spokesman admitted to being ``a little
disappointed'' _ political-speak for ``The end is nigh.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the darkish horses is a pity. It is always fun to
feel that drastic upsets may be on the way. More important, though,
the substantive reasons why Bradley and McCain both seem to have
ended in the out pile must be regretted.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it was (of course) a question of money. George W., son
of George, and Gore, the White House darling, have much larger war
chests to draw on than the outsiders could dream of.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than that. Many voters liked the
tell-it-as-it-is breath of fresh air that McCain, a former prisoner
of war in Vietnam, brought to the campaign _ but too many remained
wary of what he stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, he put an electoral foot wrong when he attacked the
powerful Christian coalition, describing them as ``agents of
intolerance.'' As the description was fair, it is regrettable that
too many Republican voters seem unenthusiastic about such home
truths.
</P>
<P>
   Many important issues, including foreign policy and the death
penalty, have scarcely figured in the campaign so far. Now, the
tragic shooting of a six-year-old child by another six-year-old in
Michigan serves as a reminder of the madness of American gun law _
a laxity that Bush, as governor of Texas, has supported.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hoped that Bush will be partly wrong-footed by the
shooting, though it is too much to hope that further evidence of
gun lunacy will lead to an outbreak of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that America may be coming back to the
number it first thought of _ Gore, who only a few months ago seemed
irrevocably tarred by the scandals of Bill Clinton's White House,
but who is now seen as Mr. Dull, Dependable and Clean.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be exciting. But countries have faced worse problems
than that. &QL;

VAN HORN GETS REVENGE AS NETS TROUNCE NUGGETS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The last time the Nets played in Denver, Antonio
McDyess turned the game into his personal highlight show. He soared
above the rim for resounding dunks and lofted mid-range jump shots
with the soft touch of Patrick Ewing in his prime. Keith Van Horn,
who was supposed to be the Nets' answer at power forward, was
little more than a prop in McDyess' aerial spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn remembered that Denver victory, as well as McDyess's
performance, and set out Wednesday night for revenge. And in one of
his most efficient performances this season, he got it, scoring a
game-high 25 points and leading the Nets to a 94-81 victory at the
sparkling new Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who also had 11 rebounds, wasted no time in washing
away the stain of last season's game. Hitting five of his first
eight shots, he scored 11 points in the first quarter and had 17 at
the close of a first half that had the Nets in front by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, only the Nets' fourth in their last 27 trips to
Denver, improved the Nets' road record to 6-22 and sends them into
Thursday's game at Dallas on a high. Though just 25-31 over all,
the Nuggets are 19-11 at home.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Horn led the way early, Stephon Marbury shut the door
firmly on the Nuggets by scoring 9 of his 20 points in the fourth
period. Marbury, who also had eight assists, seemed to be purposely
exploiting the Denver point guard Nick Van Exel (2 points, 11
assists). Two years ago, while playing with Minnesota, Marbury was
stung by being left off the All-Star team in favor of Van Exel, who
was then a Los Angeles Laker.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Horn was the star, McDyess was not bad. He led the
Nuggets with 22 points and 11 rebounds, but made just nine of his
24 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's excellence helped the Nets grab a 24-21 lead after
one quarter, but it was the team's bench that put the Nets solidly
in control. Coach Don Casey began the second with five reserves,
and after five minutes of play they had pushed the Nets' lead to
33-25. Scott Burrell did the most damage, scoring five consecutive
points by hitting a 22 footer and 3-pointer to turn a 1-point
deficit into a 4-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess got the Nuggets close by scoring six straight points,
but the Nets closed the half with a 15-4 run. Van Horn led the
charge with 6 points, including two scintillating baskets on a
contested driving finger roll and a one-handed windmill dunk on a
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' dominance was so thorough that the fans booed the home
team as it headed for the locker room. The Nuggets never pulled
closer than 11 points in the third quarter. The Nets, on the other
hand, were playing so well and enjoying themselves so much that
with four minutes left in the third, Kendall Gill whipped a
behind-the-back pass to Kerry Kittles for a fast-break layup that
made it 63-47.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between McDyess and Van Horn matched two of the
league's most promising young forwards. The 6-foot-9 McDyess, in
his fifth season out of Alabama, brought averages of 19 points, 8.3
rebounds and 1.94 blocks and a shooting percentage of .509 into
Wednesday's game. Van Horn, who is in his third season, entered
with averages of 18.1 points and 8.3 rebounds but was shooting just
41.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Facing McDyess was the second of four tough nights in store for
Van Horn on this five-game road trip. On Monday, he had the
misfortune of trying to guard Utah's Karl Malone, who abused him
for 35 points, 12 rebounds and 9 assists in Utah's 106-101 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the ostentatious Dennis Rodman awaits in Dallas,
and after a relative reprieve on Saturday in Houston, Van Horn will
have to deal with San Antonio's outstanding Tim Duncan, who is
currently out with a lower abdominal strain but is expected to
return later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a challenge,'' Van Horn said. ``I'm not going
to shy away from it. Hopefully, it'll make me play harder and
better. Hopefully, I'll rise to the occasion and give my best
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he did just that.

   WILKINSBURG, Pa. _ A gunman who set his apartment on fire and
went on a lunchtime shooting spree at two fast-food restaurants was
taken into custody Wednesday after two people were killed and three
were critically wounded in this suburb of Pittsburgh, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, 39-year-old Ronald Taylor, surrendered after holding
police off for about two-and-a-half hours in an office building.
Taylor, who was arraigned Wednesday night, was charged with two
counts of criminal homicide, a charge that includes various degrees
of murder and manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wilbert Young and police officials said they were
investigating whether the shootings with a .22-caliber handgun were
racially motivated. Taylor, who had no criminal history, is black,
while the five shot were white males, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed by one day the shooting death of a first
grader by a 6-year-old gunman in Mount Morris Township, Mich.,
leading President Clinton to urge Congress again to pass stricter
gun-control legislation. Clinton said the violent incidents ``call
on us to recognize the fact that we haven't done everything we can
do to keep these guns away from criminals and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident in this faded working-class suburb of
25,000 began about 11:15 a.m., when the police received a call that
a person had been shot and had been taken to a hospital. Officers
were given the address of the suspected gunman and arrived to find
Taylor's fifth-floor apartment on fire, the Wilkinsburg police
chief, Gerald Brewer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, there were more calls saying that someone had
been shot at a nearby Burger King and three more persons had been
shot at a McDonald's, Brewer said, adding that the callers provided
a description of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as John Kroll, 55, of Cabot, Pa., and
Joseph Healy, 71, of Wilkinsburg. One of the wounded, Richard
Clinger, was shot while sitting in his van at McDonald's, witnesses
said. Healy was a former chaplain at Duquesne University in
Pittsburgh, said a stepson, Jim Alles. Kroll was a maintenance
worker at the apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   A maintenance worker at the apartment building told The
Associated Press that Taylor had become angry that the broken door
to his apartment had not been repaired quickly enough. ``He said,
`You're all white trash, racist pigs,''' the worker, John DeWitt,
told the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said of the standoff: ``I'm very proud of how the
officers responded. They used uncommon restraint in not taking his
life. That can be debated today and tomorrow, but today it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brewer said that the police were investigating a report that
Taylor had walked into a woman's home after he left his apartment,
telling her, ``I'm dead anyway, I just need to hide a couple of
minutes,'' and also saying, ``I'm just out to shoot white people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing things, but we don't have anything factual,''
Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Tuite of the Wilkinsburg police said that he and two
officers had spotted the suspect walking along a street and that he
turned and fired two shots, then went into an office building.
Taylor entered a doctor's office and briefly held two nurses and an
office worker hostage, Tuite said. Taylor then stepped out of the
office and the door closed behind him, allowing the women to
escape. One of the three, Joyce Ambrose, told WTAE in Pittsburgh
that the gunman had said, ``I have one bullet left, which of the
three should I use it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also entered a senior citizens center but took no
hostages, Tuite said, adding that he entered the building and saw
Taylor sitting in the hallway, about 40 feet away, with the handgun
in his mouth. Taylor later pointed the gun at his head, and talked
about killing himself, the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to do that, relax, we'll get through this,''
Tuite said he told Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor pointed his gun at the officers several times but they
did not fire, the lieutenant said, adding that the officers felt
they had him isolated and that they had sufficient cover behind a
cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tuite said that he spoke to Taylor for about 15 minutes, and
that Taylor had asked for a cigarette, adding that when the suspect
was asked if he needed a light, he replied that he had a lighter
and had used it to set his apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team and a negotiator were called in from Pittsburgh, and
about 125 people, including 37 children from a day-care center,
were evacuated from the office building, other police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Fischer of the Pittsburgh police department, who
negotiated with Taylor, told reporters: ``His mood went from anger
to confusion, distraught, fear and remorse. He bantered back and
forth between killing himself and surrendering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, gang activity and violent crime had
been significantly reduced in Wilkinsburg, Brewer said, adding that
his department's records showed no no prior arrests for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Young sounded a similar note Wednesday night saying: ``We are
sad and shocked over this. We're totally surprised.''

   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, March 2: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is not the only American city that has problems with
its police department, but the LAPD seems uniquely hospitable to
rogue cops and uniquely resistant to reform. Only eight years after
the Rodney King episode, the city is suffering a new scandal that
has led to charges of perjury, evidence tampering and attempted
murder, and attracted the attention of the FBI, the United States
attorney and California's attorney general. A report released
Wednesday by the Police Department acknowledged that a
``breakdown'' in supervision had led to the scandal. But the report
perpetuates the myth that the department can police itself.
</P>
<P>
   The department inspired national outrage in 1991 when several
officers were captured on videotape savagely beating King. Soon
afterward a blue-ribbon panel, the Christopher commission, urged a
``major overhaul'' of the police department and urged the
appointment of an independent inspector general who would have
broad powers to investigate abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles has shown little commitment to changing the way
the police department is monitored and run. The first inspector
general, Katherine Mader, resigned after a mere three years in
office, complaining of interference from police officials. The
strong inspector envisioned by the commission has yet to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scandal came to light last September when a former
officer, Rafael Perez, was being prosecuted for stealing several
pounds of cocaine from the department's evidence room.
Investigators pressed Perez to expose other officers who were
involved in the drug trade and were surprised when he gave them a
detailed account of how the LAPD's anti-gang unit went about its
business. He said his colleagues routinely framed innocent gang
members, lied in court, and occasionally shot and planted weapons
on unarmed people. Shockingly, Perez said that officers and
supervisors celebrated shootings by awarding plaques to officers
who wounded or killed people.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the revelations of false evidence have tainted
hundreds of convictions. About 70 officers are said to be under
investigation and 40 cases have been overturned _ with many more
sure to follow _ and the city has prepared itself to pay out $200
million in legal settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County district attorney, Gil Garcetti, has
assembled an impressive task force and says he has the
investigation firmly in hand. The Los Angeles police Chief, Bernard
Parks, made a similar declaration Wednesday, asserting in a
department report that current protocols for handling corruption
complaints were ``generally sufficient'' to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears to be a feud between Garcetti and Parks _ as
well as plummeting public confidence in the police _ have prompted
federal and state authorities to step into the case. Both Garcetti
and Parks have denied the existence of a turf war. But given the
city's mediocre record of policing its own police, federal
intervention may be exactly what is needed to get to the bottom of
a deep, systemic problem.

SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES: MATTINGLY IN YANKEE CAMP, NOW AS A COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was as if Don Mattingly opened a time capsule
Wednesday, breaking into a box of equipment closed years ago, stuff
he had not seen since his last game in 1995. His jersey still fit,
with the No. 23, and so did the baseball shoes and pants.
</P>
<P>
   Only the baseball cap was new, and when Mattingly drew that
down, it was as if he had never retired. The same sloped shoulders,
the thick forearms, the mustache, the easy throwing motion.
Somebody mentioned that the New York Yankees are currently in need
of a left-handed designated hitter. On his first day as the
Yankees' spring training instructor, Mattingly laughed at the
notion.
</P>
<P>
   He had watched Catfish Hunter serve as a coach in spring
training for years, and saw how much fun he had. After Hunter died
last year, it occurred to Mattingly that it was time for him to go
to spring training, the way Hunter had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do what he was doing _ come back, enjoy,
stay in touch with baseball, but then go back to your family and
home,'' said Mattingly, who has returned to Yankee Stadium since
his retirement, including a 1997 ceremony when his number was
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he did not do much more than stand near the batting
cages and watch hitters. But that is typical of Mattingly, who
seems leery of overstepping his bounds. Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, asked him to work alongside Chris Chambliss, the hitting
coach. Mattingly is probably aware of the whispers last year that
he would replace Chambliss. Wednesday, Mattingly stood and chatted
with Chambliss, arms folded, his presence understated.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly has spoken of wanting to manage someday, but coaching
in camp this spring, he said, was just a way to keep in contact
with the game, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they've got a great thing going,'' Mattingly said.
``I feel like I can learn from everybody around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of a managerial job, he said, ``is a good ways down
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired after the 1995 season at age 34, with 2,153 career
hits, but without a World Series ring, because he ``didn't want to
leave home any more.'' Taylor, the oldest of his three children, is
almost 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the World Series the next year, with Tino
Martinez playing first base, and Mattingly acknowledged Wednesday
that it was hard to watch the team win the title without him. But
as time passed and he embraced the precious days he could spend
with his children, Mattingly gained some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest way to explain it to people, you could take three
World Series rings and put them in my right hand,'' said Mattingly,
holding his arms as if they were scales. ``And take that time with
my family _ my kids and watching what they've been through _ in the
other hand. If you're looking at a scale, my left hand is down to
the ground. It's really not comparable. I'm just so thankful. I
felt I did the exact right thing. It was perfect for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave the kids, I wanted to be a part of what
they were doing. If I had kept going, Taylor would've been in high
school and I wouldn't have known him. I know I left some stuff on
the table, base hits and stuff, but you know what? A hundred years
from now, nobody is ever going to think about it. I'm just totally
happy I did it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees are known as a close-knit, unselfish team, and Paul
O'Neill, Bernie Williams and others have attributed that to
Mattingly, saying the current legacy belongs to him. ``If it's my
legacy, then I got it from Willie and Goose and Nettles and
Piniella and guys that were here when I was coming up,'' Mattingly
said, referring to Willie Randolph, Goose Gossage, Graig Nettles
and Lou Piniella. ``It feels good to pass stuff on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly has a small patch of short whiskers beneath his lower
lip _ the stinger, he called it _ and he laughed when asked about
it, knowing the owner George Steinbrenner's rule against facial
hair. ``I came from a beard to a goatee to this,'' he said, ``so I
went a long way. I could do another step. I just have to do it
slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage is here now, and Torre mentioned his extra bushy
mustache. ``There are certain liberties those old guys get,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly will work closely with Nick Johnson, a star Class AAA
first baseman who is being groomed to replace Martinez in 2001, and
Wednesday, Reggie Jackson _ another spring coach _ introduced
Mattingly to Johnson, who seemed somewhat in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 21, recalled that Mattingly was a good defensive first
baseman, a good player. ``I don't remember watching him,'' said
Johnson, adding with no disrespect intended, ``It was before my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in camp know Mattingly much better than Johnson. ``What
can't you learn from him?'' Jeter asked rhetorically. ``If you're
Nick, you should take advantage of it. It's not too often you have
a player of Mattingly's caliber accessible to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez added: ``A lot of guys could learn a lot from him. It's
exciting for the organization and exciting for myself, just to have
him around.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius told teammates on the field about the first time
he ever met Mattingly, while playing for Oakland against the
Yankees, after Brosius reached first base in his rookie season.
Mattingly immediately began speaking to Brosius as if they had been
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Scottie, I've just finished this book, I know you'd love
it,'' Mattingly said, chatting along.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is, in fact, an avid reader. He could not imagine how
Mattingly would know that. He wondered if Mattingly just told
everybody about books he was reading. He wondered if Mattingly was
trying to trick him into getting picked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confused and suspicious,'' Brosius said. ``I was talking
with him, trying not to be rude, but I didn't know what to make of
it. I was like, `What's he trying to do.' I came to find out he's
just a nice guy, and that's the way he is.''

HEALTH SYSTEM CEO PLEADS GUILTY TO MEDICARE FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Richard Michael Abell, former president and
chief executive officer of Carondelet Health, pleaded guilty
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Kansas City to defrauding
Medicare of more than $91,000.
</P>
<P>
   Abell, 60, was fired by Carondelet, which includes St. Joseph
Health Center and St. Mary's Hospital of Blue Springs, Mo., in
October 1998. On Wednesday, he waived indictment and admitted that
he fraudulently had caused St. Joseph Health Center to reimburse
him for more than $361,000 in personal expenses by claiming them as
business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Abell's fraudulent business expenses, in turn, had been
submitted over a period of several years to Medicare, the
government health program for the elderly. Medicare reimbursed St.
Joseph for a portion of that amount _ $91,114.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Abell had committed fraud from about
Jan. 1, 1993, to Oct. 5, 1998. Nothing in the government documents
released Wednesday indicated what Abell had spent the money on,
except to say that it had nothing to do with the business of St.
Joseph Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea represents another step in the federal
government's crackdown against Medicare fraud. Prosecutors saluted
the hospital for its cooperation in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Joseph Health Center demonstrated that hospitals and
federal law enforcement can most effectively fight health care
fraud by building a relationship of cooperation and mutual
support,'' U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Abell and his attorney, Thomas J. Cox, could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abell, who is free on bond, faces a maximum sentence of 10 years
in prison without parole and as much as $250,000 in fines.
Paperwork included in the plea agreement shows he might face 10 to
16 months in prison. But the sentence ultimately will depend on the
findings of a presentence investigation and the final rulings of a
judge. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea represents a dramatic turn for Abell, the 1996
recipient of the Missouri Hospital Association's Distinguished
Service Award.
</P>
<P>
   A health-care administrator for nearly three decades, the
Overland Park, Kan. resident had executive positions at hospitals
in Tennessee and Kentucky before moving to Kansas City in 1986 to
join St. Joseph as its president.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Hill said St. Joseph had negotiated an
agreement with the U.S. attorney's office in September and had
agreed to pay $172,228 to resolve the case. The agreement was
reached without the filing of civil lawsuits, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization terminated the employee, took responsibility
for the financial damage done to a taxpayer-funded program, and
cooperated fully in determining the extent of criminal wrongdoing
that occurred,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Zara, who replaced Abell as Carondelet's president and
chief executive officer in 1999, said in a statement Wednesday that
the Carondelet board was ``confident it took the appropriate action
when releasing Mike Abell in October 1998, after an internal
investigation of his personal expense accounts. A further
investigation after Abell's release showed significant
improprieties on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Zara did not address the specifics of those improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Zara added that Carondelet ``demonstrates no tolerance for
employees who violate the mission and values on which Carondelet is
founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Zara said Carondelet will continue to support and enforce a
corporate responsibility program for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Carondelet spokeswoman Debbie Brinkoetter said that an insurance
carrier had covered the hospital's expenses in the Abell matter and
that the hospital had not sought restitution from the former
executive. Brinkoetter said Carondelet had not filed any lawsuits
against Abell and did not intend to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The crime Abell pleaded guilty to is a Class C felony. The case
was investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Health-care fraud has been the focus of a massive government
crackdown in recent years. In a Medicare kickback case that
attracted national attention, two Johnson County, Kansas physicians
and a former executive from Baptist Medical Center in Kansas City
were sentenced to prison last October.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Wade, a spokesman for the American Hospital
Association in Washington, said Abell's plea illustrates a rare
case of a hospital executive getting caught mixing personal
expenses with the hospital's Medicare allocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's medical ethics or business ethics, they're at the
core of what we do, and there's an important public accountability
and responsibility at stake,'' Wade said.

CASTING A GREAT COMPOSER AS A FICTIONAL HERO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Richard Taruskin is the author of ``Defining Russia Musically'' and
other books.  
 By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The full houses and rapturous critical response that greeted the
Emerson String Quartet's recent Shostakovich cycle at Alice Tully
Hall gave further evidence that Shostakovich, a giant of
20th-century music, may yet be accorded, in the 21st, the
recognition long withheld out of irrelevant geopolitical and
musico-political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Emerson's wonderful performances of all 15 quartets are
available in a Deutsche Grammophon recording, and we are invited as
we listen, and as we await the return of Shostakovich's gripping,
if morally worrisome, ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' to
the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening, to reflect at leisure
on his stature as musician and, alas, as the object of a cult.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``untroubled countries'' of the West, where the arts have
tended (in the sweetly sneering words of Adam Zagajewski, the
exiled Polish poet) to become ``food for a bored handful of
experts,'' Shostakovich's social commitment was held against him.
Virgil Thomson set the tone for two generations of snobbish
raillery when he wrote that the Soviet master's willingness ``to
write down to a real or fictitious psychology of mass consumption''
compromised him ``in a way that may eventually disqualify him for
consideration as a serious composer.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, many musicians revised their opinions about the
degree of Shostakovich's willingness to cater to Soviet norms; but
even if his easily accessible style and often garish content were
regarded as more coerced than willing, they remained unpalatable to
modernist opinion. Shostakovich was written off, in the language of
the time, as a ``middlebrow'' or ``midcult'' composer. A taste for
his music continued to mark one as a philistine.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Their catastrophic loss of prestige since
the 1960s has made it harder for composers of contemporary
classical music to indulge the old canard that serious artists live
only in history, not in society. There is a new impulse to seek
solidarity with listeners, and Shostakovich is suddenly a role
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pact Shostakovich forged with a great audience,'' as
Joseph Horowitz noted in Arts &AMP; Leisure on Feb. 6, is what now
impresses musicians and wins him new admirers. ``His music acutely
resonated with the needs and aspirations of a public traumatized by
autocracy and war,'' Horowitz wrote, and ``performed a therapy.''
Composers left out in the cold by the collapse of the avant-garde
now see that the support system can work both ways.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened in Zagajewski's Poland since the collapse of
communism makes a perfect counterpoint to what has happened in the
``untroubled countries'' since the collapse of dogmatic modernism.
The rise of the Solidarity movement inspired Witold Lutoslawski to
abandon the trappings of avant-gardism (``aleatory'' textures,
12-tone melodies and harmonies) and revert, in a manner that
distressed some of his Western admirers, to a style that spoke to
his fellow Poles in a language familiar to them (and therefore
redolent, to Western ears, of Socialist Realism).
</P>
<P>
   Even earlier, partly out of his religious _ and thus even more
explicitly anti-Communist _ commitments, Krzysztof Penderecki
abruptly turned from the experimental ``sonorist'' style (as it is
called in Poland) that won him his Western following to a frankly
neo-Romantic idiom similar to the retro trends that have caused so
much consternation among critics in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, after the Communist regime had fallen, Penderecki
changed his style again, to one now touted in Poland as a
``dialectical synthesis'' of his two earlier manners. The average
between the avant-garde and the neo-Romantic turns out to be
(drumroll, please) ... neo-Shostakovich, as exemplified by
Penderecki's Second Violin Concerto, which received such a
condescending press in New York when Anne-Sophie Mutter, its
dedicatee, played it last month.
</P>
<P>
   Critics could not fathom how, in post-Communist Poland,
Penderecki could write a kind of music that would have been kosher
under communism. But is it really so hard to understand that a
style of music that had to be resisted when it was enforced by
censorship (and when, therefore, playing chicken with the censor
was the chief engine driving stylistic evolution) could be embraced
when it represented a voluntary reconciliation with public taste?
</P>
<P>
   What Zagajewski feared _ that ``what arose in response to the
dangerous challenge of totalitarianism'' would ``cease to exist on
the same day as the challenge'' _ has not come to pass, at least in
music, and the example of Shostakovich has abetted that heartening
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Let us now give the devil his due and recognize the contribution
of ``Testimony,'' that notorious best seller of 1979, toward the
posthumous reassessment of Shostakovich's musical and moral legacy.
Its subtitle proclaimed the book to be ``The Memoirs of Dmitri
Shostakovich as Related to and Edited by Solomon Volkov,'' a
Russian music journalist who had emigrated to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Many have disputed its authenticity. In the interests of full
disclosure, I had better acknowledge that I am one such, and that I
have received in consequence much abuse from those whose views I am
about to critique.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how one feels about Volkov's methods, one must
feel a certain gratitude for the role his book has played in the
elevation of Shostakovich's stock. It portrayed the composer as
embittered by the mistreatment he had suffered and vengeful toward
the Soviet state, and toward the memory of Stalin in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Both in Volkov's annotations and in the text itself there were
hints that Shostakovich's works contained veiled (or not so veiled)
ironies, even outright messages of protest. One of the most
poignant revelations concerned the autobiographical Eighth Quartet,
which has since become a repertory staple.
</P>
<P>
   This was inspiring stuff. It played not only into Cold War
stereotypes but also into the prejudices of a post-Freudian age
that trades heavily, in the words of the musicologist Douglas
Johnson, ``on the notion that the more profound truth is the one
that is repressed or concealed.''
</P>
<P>
   We take special pleasure, Johnson goes on perceptively to
observe, ``when the repressed truth can be shown to contradict the
apparent truth of the surface.'' No wonder, then, that people began
listening to Shostakovich with new ears and with a new sort of
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, more people began listening to more of
his works. The Fourth and Eighth Symphonies began appearing on as
many concert programs, it seemed, as the Fifth and Seventh. The
quartet cycles began. Recordings proliferated. Pretty much all of
Shostakovich is now available. No critic would dare debunk him now
the way Thomson, for one (and the critic B.H. Haggin, for another),
used to do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even the academy treats him with a respect befitting his huge
achievement and historical importance. No matter how they came
about, these were auspicious developments.
</P>
<P>
   But something still stands in the way. In a survey text called
``Twentieth-Century Chamber Music,'' published as recently as 1996,
the musicologist James McCalla held back from giving the
Shostakovich 15 the full treatment. He ended his brief assessment
of them, shorter than the space accorded Bartok's Third Quartet
alone, on a note of skepticism: ``Whether the current popularity of
Shostakovich's quartets reflects our current situation, or whether
they will achieve the seemingly timeless stature of their only
modern equivalent, Bartok's six, remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Testimony''-inspired enthusiasm, McCalla implies, may
prove ephemeral as the Cold War, and the passions it aroused, fade
into the past. I share the concern, which has been magnified of
late by the emergence of a clamorous cult around the person of the
composer.
</P>
<P>
   For it is not only students of Soviet music or Soviet politics
who ought to view a cult of personality with alarm. Like the one
around Stalin, like any such cult, the one around Shostakovich is
an instrument of thought control. It fosters orthodoxy, enforces
conformism and breeds intolerance of critical thinking. In
surrounding him, it hides the composer from view and flattens
response to his music.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest boost came in 1990, with ``The New Shostakovich'' by
Ian MacDonald, a forceful British writer, who followed up on
Volkov's suggestions by fashioning anti-Stalinist readings, of
astounding blatancy and jejune specificity, for all of
Shostakovich's works.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of explicit symbolism employed in a few pieces like the
Seventh Symphony and the Eighth Quartet was asserted to operate in
every one, reducing them all to a single, endlessly repeated and
paraphrased content _ and turning them collectively into one
colossal bore.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald himself exposed the incompatibility of his method with
an appreciation of music when he dismissed out of hand the two
quartets that followed the Eighth, remarking blandly that ``one can
be forgiven for thinking that we have been over this ground once
too often.'' Having ears only for the paraphrase, he was unable to
distinguish one piece from another or to distinguish his own
monotonous, hectoring voice from Shostakovich's. As music
criticism, his book was altogether worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not music criticism. It was romantic myth-making,
which enabled MacDonald and the many other cultists who now write
album notes and book reviews, and whose outpourings can be sampled
at length (very great length) on many a lively Internet site, to
cast Shostakovich as the Soviet dissident supreme: an omnipotent
anti-Stalin, able at the height of the Stalinist terror to perform
heroic acts of public resistance (absolutely transparent to all his
fellow dissidents but absolutely opaque to those in power) such as
even Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did not hazard until he was living
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   This ``new Shostakovich'' has become for the cultists an alter
ego through which they live a thrilling if childish fantasy life,
reminiscent of a classic New Yorker cartoon by William Steig,
captioned ``Dreams of Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared toward the end of World War II and showed a boy in
chaps and a cowboy hat, cap pistol in hand, taking a surprised
Hitler prisoner in his office. Put the frail, bespectacled composer
in the cowboy suit and Stalin behind the desk, and there is the new
Shostakovich in a nutshell. Such fantasies ludicrously travesty
Soviet reality, but they have become an article of faith to many,
even some American academics who should have known better than to
join a cult.
</P>
<P>
   One is Allan B. Ho, the co-editor of ``Shostakovich
Reconsidered,'' a book that defends Volkov and MacDonald by
mounting a heinous attack on the integrity of their critics,
particularly Laurel E. Fay, whose recent biography of the composer,
``Shostakovich: A Life,'' is an attempt to counter the torrent of
fantasies with a quiet recital of the factual record.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Timothy L. Jackson, has tried to squelch debate by
invoking the Holocaust, identifying the gentile Shostakovich _ and
claiming that Shostakovich identified himself _ as an honorary Jew.
</P>
<P>
   To support their fantasies, the Shostakovich cultists draw on
the writings of post-Soviet historical revisionists who have sought
to counter the old monolithic model of Stalinism by showing that,
yes, people grumbled all through Stalin's reign and even told jokes
about the dictator, and that consequently, dissidence was an option
even in Shostakovich's day. But private grumbling and joking are
not ``dissidence,'' as the term is normally used. Dissidence is
public.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for the grumbling and the joking in books like
Sarah Davies' ``Popular Opinion in Stalin's Russia'' or Sheila
Fitzpatrick's ``Everyday Stalinism'' comes mainly from the newly
opened archives of the KGB. It describes the overheard and reported
kitchen conversations of callow folk who had no idea of the danger
they were in (but who, many of them, found out). Among the callow
was at least one great artist, the poet Osip Mandelstam, who by
actually doing what Shostakovich is now fancied to have done
managed only to commit state-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to quash the fantasy image of Shostakovich as a
dissident, no matter how much it feeds his popularity, because it
dishonors actual dissidents like Solzhenitsyn or Andrei Sakharov,
who took risks and suffered reprisals. Shostakovich did not take
risks. Four of the five poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko that
Shostakovich incorporated into his ``dissident'' 13th Symphony
(including ``Babi Yar,'' the famous protest against anti-Semitism)
had already appeared in the official Soviet press by the time
Shostakovich set them, and the fifth, ``Fears,'' had also been
published there by the time the symphony was first performed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, by which time his international fame offered him a
shield, Shostakovich gave in to pressure and joined the Communist
Party. The autobiographical Eighth Quartet, which places his
musical monogram in conjunction with a famous prison song, was an
act of atonement for this display of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1973, Shostakovich was approached with the demand that
he sign a circular letter denouncing Sakharov, he again gave in,
with disastrous consequences for his reputation among his peers in
the Soviet intelligentsia, including Solzhenitsyn, who despised him
for it. Shostakovich's likely motive in dictating whatever portion
of ``Testimony'' proves to be truly his was exculpation for these
and similar failures of nerve.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yes, forgive the man, by all means. Who are we to judge his
deeds? He faced pressures we cannot imagine, and nobody is required
to be a hero. But do not list him among the heroes. Going along to
be left alone is the response you or I might make to totalitarian
pressure, not the response of a ``moral beacon.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the title Horowitz, in his recent article, conferred on
Shostakovich. It is just another fantasy _ or more precisely, an
opportunistic appropriation. Horowitz is nostalgic for a time when
``the equation of great music with spiritual uplift was a
prevailing article of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Having tried without much success to convince people that Wagner
can serve again as our spiritual uplifter the way he did at the
turn of the last century (if we could just forget that pesky
Holocaust), Horowitz has pinned his hopes on the only figure in
sight through whom a powerful symphonic rhetoric might yet be
reattached to family values.
</P>
<P>
   Another opportunistic appropriation, and an altogether honorable
one, was the audience reaction to Shostakovich's 11th Symphony at
the time of its premiere, in 1957. Officially dedicated to the
memory of the suppressed Russian Revolution of 1905, it was
privately interpreted as a protest against the crushing by the
Soviets of the recent Hungarian revolt. Whenever asked,
Shostakovich denied it; but that made no difference. His audience
never asked.
</P>
<P>
   For them it was enough to be given the opportunity to sit
together in the concert hall and enjoy an otherwise forbidden
solidarity in protest. Like self-styled opera queens, who blithely
and charmingly reinvent familiar plots to maximize their pleasure
in their favorite divas, Soviet audiences were sophisticated
ironists.
</P>
<P>
   But the legend of the 10th Symphony's reception in 1953, by
which Horowitz sets such store _ ``a communal rite,'' he calls it,
``an act of purgation, a national catharsis'' _ is entirely a
post-``Testimony'' fable. It is based on the dubious revelation,
which no one had previously suspected either in Russia or in the
West, that the wild tornado of a second movement was intended as a
portrait of the just-deceased Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the believers in the recent cult of Shostakovich's
personality who naively claim the authority of his intentions. It
is only they who imagine they possess the means of infallible
arbitration between straight speech and irony _ which, of course,
eliminates the irony. As they like to repeat, for anyone ``with
ears to hear'' (read ``who needs to hear''), there are never any
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat with which the cultists denounce doubters belies
their faith. ``Frantic orthodoxy,'' the Protestant theologian
Reinhold Niebuhr once wisely wrote, ``is never rooted in faith but
in doubt; it is when we are not sure that we are doubly sure.'' At
some obscure level the cultists are aware of the untenability of
their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Were the silly claims or rabid denunciations confined to
cyberspace, there would be little need to cry them down, but they
have had some alarming public repercussions in the wake of Fay's
biography. Harlow Robinson, a contributor to ``Shostakovich
Reconsidered,'' writing in The New York Times Book Review, derided
it for its failure to support the myths inspired by ``Testimony,''
as did the reviewer for The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental Horowitz faults the author for being
``inordinately dry-eyed.'' The nadir _ it has to be the nadir _ was
reached in a column by the English music journalist Norman
Lebrecht, which compared Fay's honorable scholarly skepticism with
David Irving's notorious attempts at Holocaust denial.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of hostility and organized slander that Fay has
had to endure is more than a little reminiscent of the atmosphere
in which Soviet dissidents _ and even Shostakovich, at times _ had
to carry on. Innocent bystanders like a recent reviewer of
``Shostakovich Reconsidered,'' who ``cannot see the reason for
starting all the tumult in the first place'' about the authenticity
or veracity of what, after all, is just talk about music, might
find an explanation for it in this painful replay of a horrible
history by those who have not learned from it.
</P>
<P>
   Such, then, is our ``current situation,'' to recall James
McCalla's qualms. If we want Shostakovich's presence in the concert
hall and on records to outlast it, let's begin by returning our
attention from our Cold War bedtime stories to his music and
recognizing that our interpretations, and the purposes they serve,
are ours, not his. Something there is that does not love a cult,
regardless of how we feel about its object. Encasing Shostakovich
in a bubble of dramatic fiction is a fool's game. Bubbles burst.

A LONDON SEASON WITH THE STAMP `MADE IN THE U.S.'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When it comes to theatrical invasions, there is a new
one here worth signaling: the influx of American shows, several of
them in their original productions. Think of it as a long-overdue
attempt to redress what some might call a theatrical imbalance,
because the traffic, of course, generally heads the other way.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, some kind of history was made last spring when
eight English or Irish stagings _ including those of several
American plays, ``The Iceman Cometh'' for starters _ all opened
within 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the British are absent from this Broadway season:
Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' with an American cast, and the
Donmar Warehouse revival of Tom Stoppard's ``Real Thing,'' with its
full West End company, will join the current revival of Peter
Shaffer's ``Amadeus'' on Broadway in the spring. And the Royal
Shakespeare Company returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music with
three productions in May, a revelatory ``Don Carlos'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting, though, that by that time, London will have
been awash in American exports, whether in the razzle-dazzle form
of ``Fosse,'' easily this city's biggest musical opening since
``The Lion King'' (another American show) last October, or in
transfers from New York to London of the plays ``Side Man,''
``Bash'' and ``Wit,'' their American creative teams intact.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Laurie Anderson will bring her multimedia piece ``Songs
and Stories From Moby-Dick'' to the Barbican Center. And in June
arrives ``Stop Kiss,'' Diana Son's play that was well received two
seasons ago at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York. Already
gone, but not forgotten, is the Bush Theater's admirable
presentation of Nicky Silver's ``Maiden's Prayer,'' with an
Anglo-American cast.
</P>
<P>
   Also departed this season, though in homegrown British
productions, were three dramas by Americans, the first two of which
have also been seen in New York: ``Goodnight Children Everywhere''
by Richard Nelson, ``Three Days of Rain'' by Richard Greenberg and
``Rose'' by Martin Sherman (this one-woman show starring Olympia
Dukakis arrives on Broadway later this month in a Lincoln Center
Theater production).
</P>
<P>
   All three plays were nominated for the Olivier Award for best
play, which ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'' went on to win. The
author, Nelson, is one of an increasing number of Americans whose
work is presented first in London; eight of his nine Royal
Shakespeare Company openings to date have been world premieres.
</P>
<P>
   This season, world premieres of new plays by two younger
American writers are being mounted by the newly reopened Royal
Court Theater in its studio-size Jerwood Theater Upstairs:
``Breath, Boom'' by Kia Corthron, 34, and ``Other People'' by
Christopher Shinn, 24. Shinn had great success at the same
theater's young writers' festival in 1998 with his play ``Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham Whybrow, the Royal Court literary manager, recalled a
letter that Shinn had sent to the theater several years ago in
which he and another young American dramatist described themselves
as, Whybrow said, ``talented writers who were having huge
difficulties getting plays on in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So naturally,'' Whybrow continued, ``you wanted to read those
plays overnight.'' Especially when, he added, ``many of the plays
we've responded to most of all are from writers who have not had
much success in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   The better-known American writers can open shows first in
England, as well. Arthur Miller's ``Ride Down Mt. Morgan,''
expected on Broadway later this month, was first seen in a West End
production here in 1991. Two of David Mamet's plays, ``Glengarry
Glen Ross'' and ``The Cryptogram,'' received their world premieres
here in 1983 and 1994, respectively, though it is the Mamet
revivals that have been causing a stir this season.
</P>
<P>
   First out of the gate was the Atlantic Theater Company's staging
of ``American Buffalo,'' starring William H. Macy and Philip Baker
Hall, which ended a sellout run at the Donmar Warehouse on Feb. 26
before setting up shop Off Broadway at the Atlantic, where it is
now in previews.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial Mamet festival here gathers steam later this
month when Patrick Marber, the playwright (``Closer'') and former
stand-up comic, tries on yet another cap as an actor in a West End
revival of ``Speed-the-Plow,'' Mamet's 1988 satire about Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this and other seasons: when Marber heads
out for dinner after his show, he may well find himself rubbing
shoulders with the likes of Kathleen Chalfant, Edie Falco, Jason
Priestley and Matthew Lillard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cross-fertilization is fantastic,'' said Ciaran Hinds, the
Belfast-born actor who made his Broadway debut last March in
``Closer,'' which was then playing across the street from ``Side
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That company, I really, really enjoyed,'' Hinds said of the
American actors in ``Side Man'' who have reteamed for its London
run. ``I was so thrilled they gave Frank Wood that prize'' _ the
Tony Award for best featured actor. ``I thought, `Wow, what
control.'''
</P>
<P>
   An English player more than qualified to assess the shift in
traffic is Eileen Atkins, who has been a frequent presence on
Broadway and off for much of her career. (She is hoping to return
to New York in the fall in Yasmina Reza's play ``The Unexpected
Man.'') ``Thank God, I say,'' said Atkins of the American arrivals.
``I hope there's much more coming from over there. We inundate them
every so often, and the next year they should inundate us.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the good wishes of some British performers, American
productions in London have several major hurdles to surmount:
reviews by many more critics than in New York, a number of which
are sometimes contradictory if not indifferent; a tendency for
audiences to ignore any ballyhoo surrounding productions that
arrive sporting awards; and a reluctance by audiences to attend
shows that do not confirm Britain's worst prejudices about America.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this is that several New York hits have stumbled
in London. Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama about incest,
``How I Learned to Drive,'' played to 43 percent attendance overall
during its 1998 summer run at the Donmar Warehouse, despite a
production by the Irish director John Crowley that in some ways
surpassed the long-running one Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantello, the American director who is making his London
debut here with ``Bash,'' joked that if Vogel's lead character
``had pulled out an Uzi and killed her uncle, perhaps the London
reception would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Donald Margulies' ``Collected Stories,'' about a
writer and her protegee, twice seen Off Broadway, got poor reviews
on the West End last fall, despite the star presence of Helen
Mirren. At one performance not long before the run ended, 186
people were in an auditorium containing 884 seats, according to
staff at the Theater Royal, Haymarket.
</P>
<P>
   Given the risk, why make the journey?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just people backing their judgment,'' said the London
producer Robert Fox, who has worked often _ and to financial reward
_ on Broadway with many of David Hare's plays, among others, but
who suffered a setback at home when his West End version of
Terrence McNally's ``Master Class,'' starring Patti LuPone, flopped
in 1997. ``In the end,'' Fox said, ``people follow their instincts,
or they should.''
</P>
<P>
   But whereas an English play in New York might trade on its very
Englishness _ Pam Gems' ``Stanley'' comes to mind, about that most
quintessentially English painter, Sir Stanley Spencer _ it isn't
always a good idea for American plays to be too American in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culturally specific,'' said Stephen Daldry, the British
theater director, ``in particular, the American porch play that
American writers have cherished and loved for many years in terms
of their new writing, has seemed to have very little relevance to a
much more fast-flowing, abstract, experimental drama that has been
emerging in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   During Daldry's tenure as artistic director of the Royal Court,
plays like Jez Butterworth's ``Mojo'' and Mark Ravenhill's
``Shopping and ...'' had premieres at the theater before being seen
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The porch play,'' Daldry said, referring to the strain of
realistic domestic drama in American writing, ``not to mention that
thing of, `Oops, I wasn't loved enough by my father,' somehow
didn't have the relevance in this country. Like the Jewish play
didn't have the relevance. Like `Rent' didn't quite take off. It's
a matter of politics, ultimately. But it's not about excluding a
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Panter, a London producer and theater owner who incurred
critical scorn more than a decade ago when he attempted a West End
run of McNally's ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,'' said:
``We embrace Americans in music, movies and jeans. Why don't we
embrace them in theater?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Neil LaBute's ``Bash'' and Mamet's ``American
Buffalo'' _ which work hard to be scabrous and unsentimental _ the
reviews have been rather embracing: generally favorable, even if
both productions had their detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with other plays waiting in the wings have their
own rationales for attempting a run here. Daryl Roth, the American
co-producer of ``Wit,'' said she brought over Margaret Edson's play
``because it deals with death and cancer and John Donne.'' Roth is
one of the producers backing a 17-week West End run opening in
April and starring Chalfant in her original role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel like such an American slice of life,'' Roth
said about ``Wit.'' ``I hope people don't look at it as, `Oh, here
comes an American play.' This to me transcends that. It feels right
to me to do `Wit' in London; it feels right to do it anywhere.''

STATE AUDITOR SAYS MISSOURI DIVISION OF AGING `NEEDS SERIOUS
ATTENTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri Auditor Claire McCaskill said the
state's Division of Aging isn't doing its job overseeing nursing
homes, missing about 400 inspections last year and not
investigating complaints quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   An audit by McCaskill's office released Wednesday also found 21
cases in which nursing homes or in-home care providers employed
someone who had abused or neglected the elderly before.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said workers in the division's Kansas City office were
more often late in filing paperwork on complaint investigations
than employees in other regions. Also, Kansas City investigators
declared complaints unsubstantiated in about seven out of 10 cases,
compared with a statewide rate of about four in 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this audit will be a wake-up call to the Legislature
and the policy-makers that this agency needs serious attention. It
needs resources. We need some changes in the law,'' McCaskill said
during a news conference in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill's audit comes after a recent federal investigation
found inadequate state inspections of nursing homes in Missouri and
other states.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill recommended that the division catch up on inspections,
strengthen sanctions against unsafe nursing homes and set minimum
staffing levels in the homes.
</P>
<P>
   The audit uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing by the division,
McCaskill said. She blamed the problems partly on mismanagement,
partly on inadequate laws and partly on the fact that the
division's undersized staff is straining to meet the demands of an
ever-aging population.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dunn, who became director of the Division of Aging last
month, said he appreciates that Gov. Mel Carnahan has asked the
General Assembly for 30 new division positions for nursing-home
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn admitted that his agency has struggled to keep up with the
2,500 required inspections because the 158 field inspectors also
are swamped with investigating, documenting and helping address
complaints and nursing-home violations.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency will catch up on necessary inspections by the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn also defended the work of the Kansas City office, saying
the people there are committed to ensuring the safety of
nursing-home residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put people over paper. So sometimes a situation is
investigated and cleared up, but before the paperwork is done,
they're on to something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said she would like to see tighter requirements on who
can work in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The state maintains a list of people whom nursing homes cannot
employ because they have abused or neglected the elderly before.
</P>
<P>
   But the state also has two other employee disqualification
lists, one for those who can't work with children and another for
those who can't work with the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found more than 1,100 employees at nursing homes or
in-home care companies who had been disqualified from working with
children or the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill wants to prevent nursing homes from employing someone
whose name appears on any of the three lists.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants the Division of Aging to study whether current
sanctions are strong enough to make nursing homes safe.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found one home was cited for 111 deficiencies in its
last four inspections. In more than 200 inspections, homes had at
least 10 deficiencies but no federal or state sanctions were
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, I believe if the Legislature reads this audit
thoroughly, they will want to do the things that we are
recommending,'' McCaskill said. ``I think they will realize this is
a problem we just can't ignore. It's too important.''

 LONDON: it anywhere.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And although ``Side Man'' may focus on a family, it also boasts
the unusual backdrop of jazz, which, said its American co-producer
Ron Kastner, could work on its behalf. ``What I've been told by all
my English friends is that the one thing everybody says Americans
know best is jazz,'' Kastner said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a North American ensemble for the play,
including Falco and Priestley, who is Canadian-born, came about
largely at the insistence of the playwright, Warren Leight. ``It's
fair to say I lobbied very hard for that,'' Leight said. ``It's
partly loyalty to my New York cast and also self-serving; they know
the key the play was written in.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Side Man'' troupe was preceded in London by the three
Americans in the revival of ``American Buffalo'' directed by Neil
Pepe, while LaBute's ``Bash'' involves a stunning American acting
trio, Mary McCormack, Matthew Lillard and Zeljko Ivanek, who did
his drama training in London.
</P>
<P>
   About the three one-acts he has combined under one title, LaBute
said, ``They're terribly American plays about people who are in one
of the few, if only, religions that have sprung up in America.''
The playwright, who, like his characters, is a Mormon, said of his
desire to keep the cast of the play American: ``It just made sense
to start the play with people already at ease with the kind of
language I wrote. That gives it an added ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Daldry seemed to have no doubts on that subject. ``It is
absolutely paramount that shows from America should be seen in
their original productions in this country,'' he said, though when
he was running the Royal Court, it presented British stagings of
Mamet's ``Oleanna'' and John Guare's ``Six Degrees of Separation''
(the latter production did, however, retain its original New York
star, Stockard Channing).
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes, artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse and the
director of both ``Cabaret'' on Broadway and the current film
``American Beauty,'' knows both acting communities well. ``The fact
is,'' Mendes said, ``there is this huge strata of great theater
actors who have a film career but aren't widely known _ Kathleen,
Zeljko, Mary, even Bill Macy, although he does have a bigger film
profile than most. This is a chance for them to be seen in what is
still effectively one of the two theater capitals of the world.
That's very moving.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other considerations can prevail. ``Fosse''
opened with local performers to some enthusiastic notices and a few
real notes of dissent (``So what is all the Fosse about?'' read the
headline over the review in The Evening Standard).
</P>
<P>
   But, said Ann Reinking, the show's co-choreographer and
co-director, ``To have this company that is entirely British _ they
take greater ownership if it's their own company in their own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhat surprisingly, Douglas Carter Beane vetoed a West
End run of his Off Broadway comedy, ``As Bees in Honey Drown,''
that would have happened about now, possibly starring Madonna. The
problem, Beane said, arose when the London producers insisted on
mounting a British version from scratch, directed by an Englishman,
Steven Pimlott, rather than the play's New York director, Mark
Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British press can be pretty rough on American plays,''
Beane said. ``They're not exactly nurturing an interest, whereas an
OK English play is given a chance in America.'' As a consequence,
he said, ``My feeling was and is, if the play was going to happen
in London, then it should get its best shot, which is to say with
the person who guided me through it the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Beane went on: ``It would have been nice to have been part of
this incredibly exciting American explosion on the West End.
They're all my pals. But it's not as if the play has a shelf life
of dairy. It's a good play and it will get done. Though I do regret
it about once a week.''

MCCAIN'S TALK OF `EVIL' RILES BAUER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ John McCain's - criticism of religious leaders
boomeranged Wednesday, March 1, when one of his top conservative
supporters demanded an apology for the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a religious conservative who endorsed McCain last
month after dropping his own presidential bid, said McCain's speech
Monday attacking evangelists and political leaders Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell was out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must in the strongest possible terms repudiate Senator
McCain's - unwarranted, ill-advised and divisive attacks on certain
religious leaders,'' Bauer said in a statement. ``Senator McCain
must not allow his personal differences with any individual to
cloud his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, March 1, McCain defended his speech, saying, ``I
stand by my comment.''
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's national political director, after noting
that Bauer had seen an advance copy of the Monday, Feb. 28, speech
and had even been permitted to suggest some changes, was also
adamant. ``There won't be an apology,'' Weaver declared.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was with McCain on Monday, Feb. 28, when the Arizona
senator criticized Robertson and Falwell. He told reporters after
the speech, ``If this were an attack on Christian conservative
voters, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned in California on Wednesday, March 1, McCain
found himself repeatedly answering questions about statements he
had made on Tuesday, Feb. 29, aboard the Straight Talk Express, his
campaign bus. &QL; 
`FORCES OF EVIL'
</P>
<P>
   McCain had told reporters that Robertson and Falwell exercise an
``evil influence . . . over the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and take on the forces of evil _ that's my job,
and I can't steer the Republican Party if those two individuals
have the influence that they have on the party today,'' McCain was
reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Wednesday, March 1, that his remarks were a part of
his ongoing imagery from the movie Star Wars and ``a lighthearted
attempt at humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not say or mean to say they are evil,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters on his campaign bus Wednesday, March 1,
that he was not worried about getting bogged down in the religious
strife that sometimes seems to have engulfed the campaign. ``This
is about the heart and soul, the direction of the party,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also shot down earlier reports that national communications
director Dan Schnur had quit over disagreements on the handling of
Thursday's, March 2, GOP debate in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about our campaign is that people get to
disagree,'' McCain said. ``Sometimes, they even shout at each
other. . . We have a very freewheeling, very participatory
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCain campaigned throughout Southern California, it became
clear that his forces believe victory could come in one of two
ways: As an all-out win of the state's delegates, something that
polls indicate is increasingly unlikely, or by capturing a majority
of the state's popular vote, which would include Independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the majority of Republican votes in California will
take away 162 delegates of the 1,034 required to win the
nomination. Unlike many of the earlier states McCain has competed
in, if he puts together a majority with the help of Independents
and Democrats but lacks a Republican majority, he will receive no
delegates at all.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how he defines victory, it is clear that McCain,
who has targeted California for more than a year, knows he must
emerge from that delegate-rich state with something to show for his
efforts. &QL; 
`BEAUTY CONTEST'
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters in Riverside on Wednesday, March 1, that
he believes he can come away with victories both in the ``beauty
contest,'' or popular vote, and in the battle for GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   With his victories in Washington, North Dakota and Virginia on
Tuesday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush now holds 170 delegates to
McCain's 105 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who lost overwhelmingly among women in Virginia, also
seemed to step up his efforts to win the female vote by coming
close to saying he would pick a female vice presidential running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very logical to have a woman vice president,''
McCain said on Wednesday, March 1. ``And perhaps, in the next
cycle, a woman president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later said he wasn't promising a woman on his ticket, but
he pointed to New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd Whitman and Arizona
Gov. Jane Hull, both Bush allies, as qualified women.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Times poll released Wednesday, March 1, Bush
led McCain 47 percent to 26 percent, with Alan Keyes at 6 percent. &QL;
