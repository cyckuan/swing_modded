<HEADLINE> Six Baltic Defense Ministers to Meet This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The German Defense Ministry said today
that defense chiefs from six Baltic states would meet this week in
the Danish port city of Skagen to discuss regional security and
NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that defense ministers from
Germany, Denmark and Poland would meet Tuesday and would be joined
by their counterparts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on May
7-8.
</P>
<P>
Focus of the Tuesday talks "will be preparation for the summit
of NATO leaders in Madrid this July," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) is due to announce which countries among the Eastern
European applicants will be first admitted to the 16-member
alliance in 1999. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are
considered top candidates.
</P>
<P>
Baltic Sea stability and security will dominate the May 7-8
talks of the six defense ministers, who will discuss the building
of a joint naval mine-clearing squadron comprising two
mine-clearing units respectively from Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, according to the German Defense Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that Germany agreed last October to help organize the
"Baltic Squadron" (BALTRON) in efforts to boost mine-clearance
capacity in the Baltic Sea. The squadron is also expected to serve
as a Baltic contribution to international missions.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic nations are not likely to become NATO members
in the near future due to Russia's opposition to NATO's inclusion
of former Soviet Union member republics.
</P>
<P>
In another statement, the German Defense Ministry said that
Romanian Defense Minister Victor Babiuc were holding talks with
German defense chief Volker Ruehe today in Bonn, seeking Germany's
support for its admission into NATO.
</P>
<P>
As Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are considered the
most likely new NATO members in 1999, Romania and Slovenia are
also regarded as having good chances.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Jordan's Crown Prince to Attend Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan will attend Tuesday
a memorial service for the seven Israeli schoolgirls killed by
a Jordanian soldier.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Hassan will unveil a memorial at the murder
site of Naharayim, near the border in northern Jordan Valley.
On March 13.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian border guard fired his automatic rifle at a group
of Israeli teenage girls on a school outing there, killing seven
of them and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will announce plans to build a peace park
in Naharayim in memory of the seven girls. The families of the
victims will also attend the ceremony to lay flowers and
plant trees.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident was the first along the relative calm
Israeli-Jordanian border since the two countries made peace in
1994. It further soured the already tense relations between
Israel and Jordan, which severely criticized the Jewish state for
stalling the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by expanding
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed Jordanian King Hussein for leading to the
tragedy because he wrote a harsh letter to Netanyahu days ahead
of the shooting incident to criticize Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
To repair the damage and avoid further deterioration in
bilateral ties, King Hussein paid a condolence visit four days
later to the bereaved families in Israel. Last month, Netanyahu
and King Hussein also held a summit when they were both
visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Hassan are expected to hold discussions on
bilateral cooperation and the current situation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, in which Jordan has been
playing an active mediating role.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said today that
the two leaders would discuss some joint projects which could
benefit both sides, including the building of Eilat-Aqaba
airport, water projects and Dead Sea joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Champs Win Men's Doubles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Kong
Linghui and Liu Guoliang won China's eighth world doubles
championship as they beat the Swedish pair of Jan-Ove Waldner and
Jorgen Persson in a cliff-hanging final here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The set scores were 19-21, 21-15, 18-21, 21-13, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese duo took the deciding set as Liu created chances to
kill with wickedly deceptive serves.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu had snatched five points in a row to lead 20-15
before Liu got the match point with a merciless forehand smash.
</P>
<P>
The first set had been a close game until Liu netted a return
and Kong played a wayward counter-attack on Waldner's top forehand
to go one set down.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players had jumped to a 9-5 lead with strong
attacks before the Swedes closed the gap to 11-9.
</P>
<P>
With the serve advantage, the Chinese clinched five points in a
row to nose ahead 16-9, detroying the Swedes' confidence to make
it one-all.
</P>
<P>
The third set virtually went point for point until the Swedes
got three straight points to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair led all the way with barrages of flatshots and
topspin forehands, easily taking the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
French pair Jean-Philippe Gatien/Damien Eloi and Japanese duo
Koji Matsushita/Hiroshi Shibutani finished joint third.

<HEADLINE> 32 PS Members Defect to Greek Main Opposition ND </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 32 Greek Political Spring
Party (PS) members today defected to the country's main
opposition, the New Democracy (ND), which is led by Costas
Karamanlis.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the group responded to ND leader Karamanlis'
public call on PS members to work with the ND, said a press
release by the ND today.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the PS in 1992 by former ND Foreign
Minister Antonis Samaras, a number of MPs from the then ruling ND
left the party and rejoined the new party, leading directly to the
loss of the Mitsotakis government's majority in the Greek
Parliament and the calling of general elections.
</P>
<P>
The PS obtained 4.87 percent of the votes in the subsequent
elections and held 10 seats in parliament but failed to surpass
the 3.0 percent threshold in last year's elections which would
have given it representation in parliament.

ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan President Farooq Leghari
today reiterated Pakistan's firm commitment to a peaceful solution
to the Kashmir problem in accordance with United Nations
resolutions and the wishes of the people of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a visiting delegation of European Parliament,
Leghari said that Pakistan was committed to resolving all
outstanding issues with India including "the core issue" of Jammu
and Kashmir to maintain peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the delegation, which came here for the third
Europe-Pakistan Interparliamentary Meeting, Leghari said that the
Kashmir issue was not a border dispute but its origin lay in the
genesis of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the situation in Afghanistan, Leghari said that the
situation there continues to be volatile. No other country had a
greater vested interest in the restoration of durable peace and
stability in that war-ravaged country than Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan fully supports efforts of the United Nations for
bringing about peace in Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation in Pakistan, Leghari said that
Pakistan has a resilient and vibrant economy with a strong
agricultural base.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Ready to Accept Hamas Leader: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam al Majali said today Jordan is ready to receive Hamas leader
Abu Marzouk, whom Washington wants to deport, reports reaching
here from Doha said.
</P>
<P>
Majali, however, said that Marzouk would be accepted only as a
guest like others. "Jordan cannot accept him unless Washington
asks him to leave...., and at that time (after he is deported) we
will receive him as a guest like others," Majali was quoted as
saying by Qatar's Gulf news agency.
</P>
<P>
Majali, currently on a three-day official visit to the Gulf
country, made the remarks at a press conference held in the
Qatari capital of Doha this morning.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzouk, 46, was apprehended by New York immigration
officials in 1995 after his trip to the Middle East region on the
grounds that he violated immigration laws by not declaring
affiliation with the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). He
obtained a U.S. residency permit in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been involved in efforts to help secure the
release of the Hamas leader who is facing extradition from the
U.S. to Israel, a country which terms Hamas members as
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that the Hamas leader will be sent to
Jordan instead of Israel as a compromise to avoid possible
violence by his supporters that could further deteriorate ties
between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Not Interested in Salvaging Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that the current
Israeli government does not want to save the stalled peace
process, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from Egypt, where he
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier today,
Arafat also accused the Israeli government of continued violation
of the Interim Agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his talks with Israeli President Ezer Weizman,
Arafat said that despite Weizman's good intentions, the Israeli
government "is not interested in salvaging the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Weizman and Arafat are due to meet Tuesday evening at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip, in an effort
to resume peace negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, expressed his hope that the meeting between
Weizman and Arafat would achieve an understanding that the two
sides agree to meet at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Political contacts and security cooperation between Israel
and the PNA have been suspended since March when Israel started
building a controversial new Jewish neighborhood in Har Homa
(Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the outskirts of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today in Cairo, Arafat warned Israel's continued
settlement-building activity is the main cause for the present
deadlocked peace process, which United States and European
mediators are trying to revive.
</P>
<P>
"The Judaization of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) is a dangerous crime,
as is continued land expropriation and settlement building,
especially in Jabal Abu Ghneim, " Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"This is our main difference, in addition to the improper
implementation of what was agreed between us, whether in
reference to the initial peace accord, or the second and third
ones signed in Washington and Cairo," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Bar-Ilan repeated today in an interview with Israel
Radio that the Israeli government's decision to build settlement
at Har Homa would not be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to another main Palestinian complain, Bar-Ilan
stressed that the further redeployment of Israeli troops in the
West Bank has been considered an Israeli decision, not a subject
to negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israeli Settlement Policy Hinders Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that the current peace crisis cannot be solved unless
Israel gives up its settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement to reporters following the talks
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat earlier today, which he
described as "cordial as usual."
</P>
<P>
"There is a general feeling of the dangerous and very critical
situation which could not be solved except through tackling the
issue of settlement, notably in East Jerusalem and in the whole
occupied Arab lands," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discuss the ongoing efforts to remove the
obstacles facing the peace process, especially the coming
diplomatic swing of the U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis
Ross in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross is set to embark on a mission in the Middle East this week
to breathe new life into the seven-week peace deadlock caused by
Israel's construction of a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt is following the situation and that any
peace drive should take into account the gravity and adverse
impact of the settlements policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
While criticizing Israel's rejection of any European role in
the peace process, he praised the EU's stance in the U.N. Security
Council and General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"Activities of any party should not be limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has banned the sale of land through unauthorized
agents in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in order to counter
Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to rebuild confidence, Israel has set a
high-level meeting with the Palestinians and promised a more
even-handed policy with Arabs and Jews, including launching
within two weeks a housing project for Arabs near the Har Homa
Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday
in an effort to revive the deadlocked peace talks, the second
meeting of theirs since last September.
</P>
<P>
Amid intensified peace efforts in Cairo, EU Special Envoy to
the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is shuttling in the
region, discussed the peace process with Moussa and Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid today.

<HEADLINE> German FM Visits Egypt Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
will arrive here tomorrow to discuss with the Egyptian leadership
the stalled Mideast peace process and boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
His visit precedes Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's to
Germany later this month, Aad el-Shazli, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa's assistant for European Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace march will top the agenda of talks Kinkel
will have with Mubarak and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides will discuss ways to enhance
cooperation at bilateral level and within the context of the
Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Kinkel's visit to Egypt derives special importance," Shazli
said, in view of Germany's special international standing as a
nominee for the permanent UN Security Council seat and a European
country that has traditional ties with Mideast nations.
</P>
<P>
Describing German-Egyptian relations as close and solid, he
added that Germany has fostered longstanding ties with all parties
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is also concerned about the plans of the EU and
NATO, of which Germany is a major member, to expand their
membership.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries traditionally favor a European participation in
the Mideast peace talks to balance the role of the U.S., a key
mediator in the region.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun: Hearing on Africa's Forests Begin in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Camerounian Minister of
Environment and Forests has said for Camerounian forests to be
sustainably managed, the involvement of everybody in the country
is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mbede, the Minister of the Environment and Forests was
speaking today at the Yaounde Hilton Hotel while presiding over
the opening ceremony of the public hearing for the African region
aimed at developing a better understanding of how forests could
be sustainably and more equitably managed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said managing the forests is an immense task
which demands huge financial and technological means. It is in
this light that he called for aid from the developed countries
who are also the big consumers of timber and forest products.
</P>
<P>
Close to 300 eminent personalities from around the world
attended the hearing. They will for two days examine problems
relating to forest conservation in west Africa, arid zones of
Sahel Africa as well as Savannah regions of central and south
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Yaounde hearing is the fourth in a series organized by the
World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development which
aimed at building confidence between the north and the south on
forests matters with the emphasis on international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development
was created in 1994 by an inter-action council comprising about
25 former heads of state and government.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Mend Relations With European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government has
promised to mend the country's tense relations with the European
Union (EU) and is likely to sign the Social Chapter on worker
rights in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said, "We want to draw a line under the fruitless,
sterile confrontation of the past."
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we are going to get a better deal for
Britain if we work together with other European states rather than
fighting them as enemies," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On the Social Chapter, which is set up to regulate working
conditions in the EU but met with fierce criticism from the
previous Conservative government, Cook reaffirmed Labor's promise
of signing the key EU document by saying there was nothing to fear
in the Social Chapter.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing it because it is good for Britain and because we
are committed to achieving a skilled, flexible workforce. And the
key to a competitive Britain is to make sure we have that
committed workforce," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
But the new foreign secretary stressed that Britain's veto on
social security issues would be retained and that Labor wanted to
ensure the protection of Britain's external border controls.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Prime Minister Tony Blair has reportedly invited
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, whose country is holding the current
rotating EU presidency, to visit Britain later this week to
exchange views on various EU issues.

<HEADLINE> Harmonization of African Traffic Laws Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Ministry today called for the harmonization of the continent's
traffic laws and regulations to reduce unnecessary documentation
and delays.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Permanent Secretary of Zimbabwe's
Transport and Energy Ministry Paul Kodzwa when he opened a
week-long road transport seminar in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
He said the harmonization of traffic regulations in Africa's
sub-regions will go a long way towards preventing the "wanton
violation" of traffic rules and regulations and encourage road
safety at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The number of motor vehicles in Africa has increased
considerably, probably due to the economic growth, but there has
been a corresponding increase in road accidents, injuries and
fatalities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kodzwa warned that this fatal trend "will continue if we do
not try to put in place legislation that will encourage safe
driving habits as well."
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union
in Zimbabwe Farai Makanda said the seminar's main objective was
to come up with an appropriate strategy that would see the
strengthening of labor unions that represented transport
operators in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by over 30 participants from 15 African
countries, was sponsored by the International Transport Workers
Federation and the Finnish Trade Union Movement.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Charged of Working for Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli businessman today was
indicted on the charges of helping Israel's enemy Iran and
supplying Iran means of making chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
In the Tel Aviv District Court today, Naham Manbar, a former
basketball player, was accused of the offenses of "assisting an
enemy in its war against Israel."
</P>
<P>
Manbar was also charged of "passing on information to an
enemy with intent to harm State security, attempting to assist
an enemy in its war against Israel, perverting the course of
justice, and breach of a no publicity order."
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, between 1990 and 1994, Manbar
supplied Iran with the means of manufacturing chemical agents
for offensive purposes, in exchange for 16 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"He thus provided assistance to an enemy in its war with
Israel," claimed in the charge preferred today against Manbar
in the Tel Aviv District Court.
</P>
<P>
The prosecuting attorney Devora Hen, head of the criminal
department for special matters at the State Attorney's Office,
claimed that, during 1990, Manbar made contact with Iran, via
an Iranian go-between known as Hashemi.
</P>
<P>
He then contacted with Majid Abasfur, who was then head
of Iran's chemical weapons project, a department in the
Iranian Defense Ministry, and technical and industrial adviser
to the president of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Abasfur requested Manbar to sell Iran the means of
manufacturing chemical agents, which included, source materials
for manufacturing chemical agents, equipment for setting up
plants for manufacturing chemical agents, assembling equipment in
these plants, and training operating crews for these plants.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution says that at the end of 1990 a contract was
signed between Manbar and Abasfur, under which Manbar undertook
to fulfill Abasfur's request to supply means of manufacturing
chemical agents.
</P>
<P>
The parties used code names with the aim of concealing the
substance of the communications between them.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1993 Manbar met Abasfur on a number of
occasions in Europe, during which he reported on progress with
the projects, and received a list of demands relating to
shortcomings in the execution of the projects.
</P>
<P>
Manbar has been in detention since the end of March when he
returned to Israel from his current home in Switzerland to watch
a basketball match of Hapoel Jerusalem which he owns.
</P>
<P>
The second charge states that, during the 40 day period of his
arrest, Manbar abused the trust the police officer placed in him
and secretly passed a note to a woman living in England who was
connected with Manbar in carrying out the chemical agent deals
with Iran. On the note were instructions which were intended to
mislead the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Manbar's attorney Amnon Zihroni, said that his client denies
the charges and claims that they amount to a plot and
conspiracy against him.

<HEADLINE> UK Investment Trusts Head for Oblivion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The UK's investment trust industry is
on the verge of sliding into obscurity, a report carried in
Trading Week said.
</P>
<P>
Poor returns from investment trusts, growing competition from
unit trusts, tax-efficient investments such as PEPs, Tessas and
venture capital trusts and a lack of dynamism in the sector as a
whole are combining to slash investor interest.
</P>
<P>
In its annual assessment of the investment trust market, Credit
Lyonnais Laing warned the sector will have to radically change the
way it operates or face losing ever more business.
</P>
<P>
Among the most shocking revelations for the investment trust
industry is that, since 1994, investors would have fared better if
they had put their money in a building society rather than an
investment trust.
</P>
<P>
Over this period investment trust prices have underperformed
the UK market by 15 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"If discounts widen in a bull market, then what on earth will
happen to ratings during a market correction or a bear market?"
Trading Week quoted an analyst as saying.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that the trusts' managers have herd
mentality and few are prepared not to follow the crowd. As a
result, their investments are often unadventurous, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The sector has also overreacted to fears of a correction in the
US market and missed out on recent gains there, while many trusts
were heavily invested in Japan as the market slumped over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
"The result of this is that the sector discount has widened
from 4.1 percent in 1994 to 11 percent today," the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
"If the sector is to avoid a death of a thousand cuts, positive
action is urgently required," he added.

<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has to date
contributed 70.5 million U.S. Dollars to finance 85 regional
training programs in human resource development in the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of a Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Masters
of Science/Postgraduate Course in Harare today, EU head of
delegation to Zimbabwe Michael Laidler said a further 14 million
U.S. Dollars has been set aside from this year until the end of
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the need to stimulate intra-regional
education capacity, the European Commission attached great
importance not only to tsetse control but to the effective
development of human resources.
</P>
<P>
As part of the re-examination of the whole series of
development arrangements set up under the Lome Conventions which
expire in the year 2000, the commission had produced a green
paper which reflected on past experiences and suggested a number
of options as part of the exercise, he added.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has lodged a
protest with the United Nations against nuisance created by the
U.S. warships and aircraft deployed in the Persian Gulf and the
Oman Sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency reported today that the protest was
 submitted by Iran's permanent mission in the United Nations,
which was circulated as the document of the UN Security Council
on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iran protested to the UN against
violation of Iranian territory by the U.S. military forces in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, 1996 at 13:39 hours, the report said, a
U.S. warship at the position of n2827 and e5006 locked radar
over Iranian battleship "Khadang" at the position of n2836 and
e4955.
</P>
<P>
On the same day at 13:50 hours, at the direction of 60 degrees
north and a distance of seven miles from the Frouzan oil
platform, a U.S. warship locked radar over the Iranian battleship
of "Khadang".
</P>
<P>
The document said that Iran protested the illegal activities
of the government of the United States and called for an
end to such actions.
</P>
<P>
This is the first protest by Iran against the United
States for violation of Iranian territory this year. Last year,
Iran lodged three same protests against the U.S. military forces
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States is still accusing Iran of sponsoring
terrorism in the world, especially of involvement in bombing a
U.S. air force complex in Saudi Arabia last year.
</P>
<P>
There is a U.S. force of about 15,000 in the
Persian Gulf, including 6,200 in Saudi Arabia, an armored

LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Conservative chairman Brian
Mawhinney, whose party suffered a crashing defeat in the general
election, said here today that a new Conservative party leader is
likely to be chosen before July.
</P>
<P>
Mawhinney was quoted by the BBC television as saying today, "I
would expect the new leader to be in office, with a new team,
certainly before the end of June."
</P>
<P>
Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major has made it clear
after the humiliating defeat that he would resign his position as
party leader.
</P>
<P>
Mawhinney expressed his hope that the coming party leader
contest would not widen internal splits over the country's
European Union policy.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope that it isn't going to polarize (the
situation). We had a very bad result last Thursday night. We need
to reflect on that. We need to analyze why to ensure that there
are changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, a leading
pro-European, and right-wing Eurosceptic Peter Lilley, also a
former cabinet minister, have thrown their hats into the ring to
compete for the position.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges US, Israel to Abide by International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot official today called on
the U.S. and Israel to abide by international law to inform to
the Cypriot authorities of any plans to conduct joint military
maneuvers with Turkey over Cypriot air space.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the remarks at
his daily press briefing while commenting on reports that Turkey,
the U.S. and Israel intend to carry out military exercises in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have conducted joint exercises in the
Eastern Mediterranean since they signed a defense cooperation
accord last year.
</P>
<P>
"If a friendly country like Israel decides to exercise its
sovereign rights to conduct joint military maneuvers with
Turkey, we expect Israel to inform the competent authorities of
the Republic about these plans," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Turkey's joint exercises with Israel are
provocative, Christofides said "they are provocative when one
takes into account the number and their frequency and when the
authorities of the Republic are not duly informed about them."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, however, Israel has assured the Cypriot
government that its defense cooperation agreement with Turkey
will not affect in any way the country's friendly ties with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Christofides called on Turkey to stop violating the Cypriot
air space as a good-will measure to facilitate the U.N. efforts
to find a solution to the Cyprus problem, which has remained
unsolved despite the U.N. and international community's peace
efforts for the past 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops seized the northern
third of the island following a short-lived coup seeking union
with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> US Wants Peaceful Transition in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration said
today that Washington wished for a transitional process with a
cease-fire leading to an election in war-ripped Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The United States supports "a transitional process that will
lead to free and fair elections," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said. "The important question is how to carry that out in
an environment of safety for the civilian population."
</P>
<P>
Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko held talks with rebel leader
Laurent Kibila Sunday under the auspices of South African
President Nelson Mandela for a possible cease-fire. They agreed to
nothing but another meeting some 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu has indicated that he would relinquish power but only to
a transitional authority that would organize national elections.
But rebel leader Kabila insisted that power be handed over to him
directly. He vowed to press his military campaign against Mobutu's
government.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the United States did not support "one side or the
other" but encouraged "both sides to have dialogue that will
resolve their differences and lead to an end to the fighting."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Bill Richardson is in Zaire to try to
arrange for a "soft landing" without bloodshed by rebels when they
enter the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of my urgent mission is to prepare a soft
landing for Mr Kabila's rebels when they reach Kinshasa, a landing
that avoids bloodshed and chaos," Richardson, U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, told reporters after his talks with Kabila in
the second largest city of Zaire, Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
Troops from the United States, Belgium, France and Britain are
waiting in Congo, across the river from Kinshasa, to evacuate
their nationals from Zaire's capital in the event of trouble.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchanges (LIFFE) traded its busiest April
ever, trading a record 16,016,123 futures and options contracts
during April 1997, 45 percent up on April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 728,006 futures and options
contracts, representing an average daily nominal turnover of 151
billion pounds (241.6 billion US dollars), the LIFFE announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Year to date, the LIFFE's cumulative volume has totaled
67,349,585 futures and options contracts, 16 percent up on the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, the LIFFE traded
51,333,462 futures and options contracts, the first time in the
exchange's history that it has traded over 50 million contracts in
a quarter year.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE Chief Executive Daniel Hodson said, "The continuing
growth in volume demonstrates the market's confidence in the
exchange's ability to provide an efficient and cost-effective way
for the world's financial institutions to manage their exposure to
interest rate and other financial risk, in the run up to Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU)."
</P>
<P>
The LIFFE launched the first Euro contract in March 1997. The
March 1999 delivery month for the ECU was listed, and if EMU takes
place on schedule in 1999, this will convert to a Euro contract.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1982, the LIFFE has experienced
spectacular growth to attain and then consolidate its position as
the leading futures and options exchange in Europe and the largest
outside Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes to Improve Ties With Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali said today that Jordan hoped to improve its ties
with the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference in the Qatari capital
Doha this morning before concluding his three-day official visit to
the Gulf country, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
While describing relations between Jordan and most of the Gulf
countries as " very good", Al Majali said that Jordan and the Gulf
states should put their eyes on the future and overcome effects
of the 1991 Gulf war until they could further improve their
bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, an Arab country, has been at odds with the Gulf states
mainly because of its support to Iraq during the Gulf War. During
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Jordan stood at the Iraqi side and
the move has greatly angered the Gulf states, which include
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties, the Jordanian official
said that the relations is "good" and there are signs for
remedying the state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hoped the bilateral relations between the two
countries could return to what it has been before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has tried to improve its relations with the Gulf
states after the 1991 Gulf War and King Hussein of Jordan
has visited these countries except Kuwait in the past
years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cuts Crude Export to Protect Oil Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to protect its oil resources
by cutting crude oil export and exporting more petroleum
products, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said here today.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Iran should strive to protect its energy
resources in view of the staggering demand for energy across the
world and the status quo of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Iran should diminish its dependence on the
export of crude oil and plan for exporting oil derivatives with
high value added.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest oil exporter and the fourth largest
producer in the world, pumps out 3.6 million barrels per day and
exports 2.5 million barrels per day in accordance with the OPEC
quota.
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 19.5 billion U.S. dollars
through oil exports in 1996. The oil export revenue made up
about 70 percent of the total export of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister claimed that 7.5 percent of the
world's oil deposits and 15 percent of its natural gas
reserves belong to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's macro political principles, especially
those concerning oil and the related industries, were based on
national security policies aimed at durable economic and
environmental development.
</P>
<P>
He added that the focus of attention was based on the
preservation of interests of future generations, particularly a
decrease in consumption and prevention of oil wast.
</P>
<P>
Iran planned to raise its offshore oil production capacity
up to 4 million barrels daily and its onshore oil output up
to 1 million barrels daily by the end of the Second Five-Year
Economic Development Plan by 1999.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- With flags flying at
half-mast, candles lighting and sirens sounding, Israel marked
this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which was devoted to
remembering the 1.5 million children perished in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
The whole Jewish nation stood at still when sirens sounded
at 10 a.m. for two minutes. Workers stopped their work and
traffic halted across the country as everyone standing in
silence to remember the 6 million Jewish Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
Following the silence-observance, President Ezer Weizman, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Dan
Tichon and other public figures, survivors' organizations and
school children attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Warsaw
Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem, or Holocaust Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
Participants attending various ceremonies held across the
country then began reciting the names of children died in
the Holocaust, as part of the "Every Person Has a Name"
project which begun in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The main ceremony was held late at the Knesset, where six
candles were lit in memory of the 6 million Holocaust
victims. Weizman, Netanyahu and Tichon and their wives, along
with the chief Rabbis and other public officials, read out
the names of the perished children.
</P>
<P>

<P>
In fact, the Holocaust Remembrance Day began from Sunday
night, when Weizman, Netanyahu and other leaders and Holocaust
survivors attended the opening ceremony at the Yad Vashem. Six
representatives of the children who survived the Holocaust lit
six candles in memory of the 1.5 million children perished
in the war.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the one-hour ceremony held in an intermittent
rain, speeches, musical interludes and film clips brought people
back to the tragic past, during which the Jews died in
hunger, torture and mass execution by the German Nazis.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, Weizman and Netanyahu stressed both the
suffering of the past and the hope for the future represented by
a strong Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said the ceremony was not just commemoration and
memory, "but also one of identification and empathy with the
survivors living among us." He issued a "warm, sincere and
heartfelt call from homeland" to all the Jews living abroad
to return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised that "we shall dedicate our lives to
ensure that the danger of annihilation never hovers over our
children's heads."
</P>
<P>
"Today, we vow that we will maintain a strong Israel,
that we shall achieve peace for our people and that we
shall give our children and grandchildren security and hope,"

MANCHESTER, England, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish veteran Jan-Ove
Waldner won the world men's singles title after a hiatus of eight
years as China dominated six events at the 44th World Table Tennis
Championships which ended here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China has showed its depth in this championships by sweeping
two team titles and four individual top honors.
</P>
<P>
As the most successful male player of the modern era, Waldner
crushed Vladimir Samsonov in a lopsided final to show who is the
best.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Swede, who clinched the singles title in the
1989 Worlds, used his variation of speed and spin to beat the
21-year-old rival 21-12, 21-17, 21-13.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who hasn't lost a set in his singles campaign, didn't
give a chance to world No. 4 Samsonov, who fell apart under the
strong attacks by Waldner from both wings.
</P>
<P>
Waldner collapsed to the floor more in relief than in
celebration after taking the match point with topspin forehand.
</P>
<P>
"I did extremely well in service and that created many chances
to make killing shots," said Waldner.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who suffered a 6-21, 7-21 humiliation by the
Belarussian in a team match, said the loss didn't affect his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would have better chance because I had beaten
Samsonov in the Qatar Open," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, four-time Olympic champion Deng Yaping beat
fellow Chinese Wang Nan in four sets to grab the women's singles
event.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, quick on her feet and with a powerful
right-handed attacking game, triumphed 12-21, 21-8, 21-11, 21-10
to become the first Chinese to win three world championship
singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who plays a left-handed topspin game in the handshake
grip, noneplussed the world No. 1 player as she created wide
angles with backhand to release a devastating forehand at the
opening set.
</P>
<P>
Deng, whose forehand requires a split-second timing, made it
one-all through powerful smashes and an excellant block defence.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Wang, who had beaten her rival in a domestic
competition last year, fell to the superior reflexes and power of
Deng, losing the ensuing two sets.
</P>
<P>
Deng also took the women's doubles event on Monday as she
paired with Yang Ying to beat Li Ju and Wang Nan in the
all-Chinese final.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang lifted
the men's doubles title after a five-set clash with the Swedish
combination of Waldner and Jorgen Persson.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese duo of Liu Guoliang and Wu Na snatched the mixed
doubles event on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> France to Develop Global Partnership With China: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that France will seek to develop a global
partnership with China in the political, economic and cultural
fields.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the forthcoming visit by President Jacques
Chirac to China will mark a new advance of cooperation between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "China of Today and Tomorrow" held in
Paris, de Charette noted that President Chirac's visit to China on
May 14-18 will be his longest trip to one single foreign country
since he became president two years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit will "mark the highest point of the
spectacular advance in the high-level political dialogue" with
China over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"Today, our reciprocal friendship and our common will to
cooperate can be seen in the unprecedentedly numerous exchange of
visits at ministerial level in the two countries, as well as the
increase of non-governmental relations between our two countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is essential for Europe and France to maintain
regular, intensive and constructive dialogue with China, both
inside and outside the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Like France, China wishes that the world of tomorrow will be
one which respects the diversity of cultures and languages, and
rejects the dominance by one single cultural model, one single
type of music, art and movie," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France will seek to develop a more regular
and diversified exchange with China in the economic field, and
that the French products exhibition which will be inaugurated by
President Chirac on May 17 in Shanghai "will testify the quality
of our offer."
</P>
<P>
"The disputes are behind us, and a global partnership, which
embraces the political, economic and cultural fields, is waiting
for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former French Prime Minister Pierre Messmer, and former
Minister of Culture Alain Peyrefitte also attended today's seminar
with 200 French scholars, businessmen and representatives of big
companies.

<HEADLINE> African Economic Ministers Meet in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd session of the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and 23rd meeting of the
Conference of Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social
Development and Planning opened here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Opening the session, Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Kassu
Ilala said the debt overhang, despite some of the positive steps
that have been taken by the international community, still
remains the most difficult challenge for sustainable development
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, we need to continue, individually as well
as collectively, to call for ever more effective and a much more
swifter means of reducing the debt burden and the debt-servicing
obligations faced by African countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to join hands in economic
cooperation and economic integration, saying that "is is only by
making our economies competitive and by working jointly that we
can overcome the economic challenges we face".
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, K.Y. Amoako, UN under secretary
general and ECA executive secretary, said the prospects for
development in Africa are much brighter now than they have been
in the past several years and in nearly half of the countries of
the region economic growth has outpaced population growth for two
years in a row.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that over the last two decades, Africa
has steadily lost world export market shares for its principal
exports which, in turn, have seen their relative importance in
world trade steadily declining.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to enhance their international
competitiveness in the world markets and pledged ECA's support
for promotion of trade and investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Vijay S. Makhan, assistant secretary general of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Economic
Community (AEC), stressed the important role of peace for
economic development in his statement.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remind ourselves constantly that investment and
meaningful trade cannot take place in situations of conflict. the
need for a quick and effective solution to all conflicts in the
continent is imperative," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Vice-president of the African Development Bank
Ferhat Lounes called upon African countries to face the
challenges they are facing now.
</P>
<P>
A message from UN Secretary General Kofi Anann read at the
opening session said the African continent today is at a
crossroad.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for development appear in many ways brighter than
they have been for some time," the message said, adding that "at
the same time, there remain many conflicts and great emergencies
of tragic proportions."
</P>
<P>
The theme of the four-day ministerial meeting is "accelerating
trade and investment in Africa".

<HEADLINE> Greek Official on Return of Parthenon Marbles From UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Culture Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said today that the return of the Parthenon Marbles from
Britain was a standing and basic axis of Greece's cultural policy.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while commenting on the refusal by the new
British Heritage Secretary Chris Smith to return the Parthenon
Marbles, also known in the West as the Elgin Marbles, which were
looted from the Greek capital in 1803 and currently housed in the
British Museum.
</P>
<P>
Smith said Sunday that Britain would not return the marbles to
Greece because that could "encourage other countries to demand the
return of their treasures, thereby unleasing a worldwide swapping
system of precious at works."
</P>
<P>
Venizelos said that it was Greece's desire in the framework of
relevant recommendations by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that this issue be
brought up at a bilateral level as it had on occasion in the past
with talks between his British counterpart and the British
ambassador in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that he would soon send the new British
government a letter, written with the assistance of the British
Committee for the Return of the Marbles.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to meet with his British counterpart in
Luxembourg on June 30 to discuss the marbles issue in the
framework of the European Union (EU) Council of Culture Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Greek demand was first put to the British government by
late actress and Culture Minister Melina Mercouri and was met with
sympathy by the Labor Party, then in opposition.
</P>
<P>
The last promise by the Labor Party was made last October via
British Labor Eurodeputy Alfred Lomas, who submitted a relevant
request to the European Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Azerbaijan Sign Declaration on Strategic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Azerbaijan today signed a
declaration on strategic cooperation in a bid to further make
cooperation in various fields between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Declaration on the Deepened Strategic Cooperation" was
inked here by Turkish President Suleymen Demirel and his
Azerbaijani counterpart Geidar Aliyev, who arrived here this
morning for a four-day official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stated that the two countries will establish
the necessary mechanisms for developing this strategic
cooperation along economic and social lines as well.
</P>
<P>
"The sides will help each other within the context of their
strategic partnership and using methods foreseen by the United
Nations, in the event that their sovereignty, territorial
integrity, the inviolability of their borders are endangered",
the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration came after reports that Armenia has bought
Russian-produced missiles and signed an agreement with Moscow
concerning the presence of Russian military bases on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and visiting Azerbaijani high-ranking officials also
signed an accord on the settlement to the border incidents and
conflicts, a marine agreement and a security cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Several supplementary protocols on the cooperation in the
field of youth and sport, air transportation and the development of
small and medium-sized industry enterprises were also signed
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey has put forward a proposal of
transporting the Caspian Sea oil from Azerbaijan, along the
planned Baku-Ceyhan (southern Turkey) route, to the world
markets. But this tentative idea has not been approved by
Azerbaijan so far.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev will also travel to Aegean city of Izmir and Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, after staying here for two days.

<HEADLINE> Trial Opens in Death of "Megan's Law" Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial is underway in New
Jersey, the United States, of the convicted sex offender accused
of killing seven-year-old Megan Kanka, whose death resulted in
controversial community notification laws.
</P>
<P>
Kanka's slaying nearly three years ago spurred New Jersey and
other states, as well as the federal government, to enact laws
requiring sex offenders to register with police upon release from
prison so neighbors could be notified.
</P>
<P>
The law is currently under appeal in several jurisdictions,
including the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Defendant Jesse Timmendequas had two prior convictions for
sexual offenses when he was arrested in the July 1994 slaying.
</P>
<P>
According to First Assistant Prosecutor Katherine Flicker,
36-year-old Timmendequas lured Kanka into his house, which was
across the street from Kanka's Hamilton Township home, then
assaulted her and strangled her with a belt, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The parents of Kanka began their campaign for community
notification shortly after her death.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabia Reiterates Opposition Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today reiterated
its opposition against Israeli settlement policy and expressed its
continued support to international efforts to save the Middle East
peace process from collapse.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Bin Abdel-Salam Bin Mohammed
Faresi made the remarks in a statement to the official Saudi
Press Agency following a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saudi King Fahd said that Saudi Arabia would
continue to support any efforts aimed at ensuring a fair and
lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Fahd reiterated his country's support to the Palestinian
people for establishing their independent state with East Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd also stressed the importance of full commitment to
the principle of the 1991 Madrid Peace conference, the
"land-for-peace" formula and relevant U.N. resolutions related to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has vowed to press
ahead with the construction of a settlement project in East
Jerusalem in defiance of the world-wide criticism.
</P>
<P>
In April, Saudi Arabia condemned the Israeli practices and
asserted that Tel Aviv's settlement policy violated the Middle
East peace process, launched in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd condemned the Israeli plans and described the
Israeli policy in East Jerusalem "is tantamount to abrogation of
international conventions and U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, a powerhouse in the Arab world, does not maintain
any official relations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iran Discuss Ties, Islamic Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati expressed the hope today that ties with Egypt can be
tightened through more contacts.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, upon arrival at the airport on his first visit to
Egypt in three years, said that he will hand over a message to
President Hosni Mubarak from Iranian President Ali Hashemi
Rafsanjani inviting him to attend the 8th Islamic Summit in Tehran
in December.
</P>
<P>
In light of the significant developments facing the entire
world, the summit will be an important gathering for Islamic
leaders to exchange views, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt, besides the rest of Islamic states, can play an
essential role within the context of cooperation to resolve
problems facing the Islamic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa opened talks
this evening on the Islamic solidarity and bilateral ties, as well
as a number of international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that his visit to Egypt is an opportunity to
exchange views with Moussa regarding bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Egyptian-Iranian ties, Velayati said that their
relations were "progressing continuously in the past."
</P>
<P>
But due to the "diversification of point of views and relations
of the two sides," it is normal that there will be multiple
difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that intensified contacts between the two
sides can help create positive and more appropriate conditions.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, refuting charges that Iran sponsors terrorism, said
that it has never supported terrorism or backed any terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran broke diplomatic ties after Iran's Islamic
revolution in 1979, although they opened interest sections in each
other's country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has accused Tehran of stirring up trouble in Egypt, where
Muslim militants are waging violent campaign to overthrow the
secular government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said today that overall volumes
of foreign direct investment (FDI) for Africa accounted 4.5
billion US dollars in 1996 and this remained low compared with
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing on African investment at the United Nations
confernece center here, Jagdish Saigal, head of international
trade division of UNCTAD, said between 1991 and 1995 Africa
attracted only two percent of world FDI flows and five percent of
the total FDI flows to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Saigal continued to say, FDI in Africa remains concentrated in
only a handful of countries, such as Nigeria and Egypt accounted
for over half of FDI into Africa during the first half of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
He said, western European investors still dominate FDI in
Africa and the U.S. accounts for approximately 20 percent of
inflows from developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Saigal is here to attend the 4-day 32nd session of the
Economic Commission for Africa and 23rd meeting of the Confernece
of Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social Development and
Planning which opens here this afternoon. he said, "The World
Investment Directory : Volume V. Africa" is launched in Addis

<HEADLINE> Blair Vows to Make Britain Leading Player in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Prime Minister Tony Blair
has outlined in a German news magazine the new Labor government's
program on European policies, vowing to make Britain a leading
player in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In an article contributed to the Monday issue of the German
news magazine Focus, Blair noted that there were three European
policy options for Britain: withdrawal from the EU; to remain a EU
member, but without influence; and being a EU member with leading
position.
</P>
<P>
He described the first option as "disastrous" for Britain,
noting that 60 percent of Britain's exports went to EU countries.
A withdrawal from the EU would cost the country 3.5 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Britain's domestic investment would be slowed down
and its influence on the formulation of international trade
agreements be impaired. "In short, our status in the world would
change dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
The second option, to remain in the EU but with little
influence, which was the policy of his predecessor John Major's
government, was "the worst," Blair said. With this option, Britain
was powerless and was forced to accept decisions made by others,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We want Britain to take on a leading role in the EU," Blair
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who was elected Britain's new prime minister in a
landslide victory over Major's Conservative Party in the general
election Friday, also stressed that his government wanted "a
Europe, in which the national identities would not be lost and in
which countries cooperate with each other."
</P>
<P>
Britain did not want a "gigantic, vast European superstate
which is controlled from the center," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
On further development of the EU, Blair said that his
government wanted the June EU summit in Amsterdam to reach
agreement first of all in five areas:
</P>
<P>
-- abolishing customs barriers within the EU, particularly in
those areas, where Britain is successful: aviation,
telecommunications, energy and financial services;
</P>
<P>
-- eastern expansion of the EU. To ease that process, Britain
supports an expansion of the majority decision-making mechanism of
the EU if the larger countries, like Britain, could enjoy the
power of veto when necessary;
</P>
<P>
-- the reform of the common European agricultural policy;
</P>
<P>
-- combating unemployment and bringing more flexibility into
the job markets; and
</P>
<P>
-- closer cooperation in foreign policies. The EU needs the
U.S. support also in the future, but it also needs to show its
capability to act independently.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult issue for the EU, according to Blair, was
the realization of the European Monetary Union (EMU) planned for
1999.
</P>
<P>
"There are still too many difficulties for Britain to make the
first wave to join the EMU, especially since Britain is now in a
different stage of economic cycles as compared with the rest of
Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
But whether Britain joined in or not, the EMU would affect the
country anyhow, Blair said, adding that Britain would lose any
influence on the process if it categorically ruled out the
possibility of joining the EMU.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we would leave the question of a participation
open.... We'll do nothing until the British people give us the
authorization to take this step in a referendum," Blair said.

ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece named tonight two professors

</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey last week agreed to appoint a Committee of

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heads for Mexico on Latin America Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
leaving here for Mexico today to start a week-long Latin America
trip designed to strengthen U.S. relations with the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first U.S. president to visit Mexico City
since Jimmy Carter in 1979. He was due to arrive in the Mexican
capital later this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also participate in a Central American summit in
Costa Rica and a Caribbean summit in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
On top of the agenda of his trip to Mexico will be issues
ranging from illegal immigration and drug smuggling to trade.
</P>
<P>
With the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), trade
between the U.S. and Mexico reached a record 140 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, new U.S. measures to crack down on illegal migrants
have upset Mexico, which was also annoyed by Washington's
accusation that Mexico has not made enough efforts in fighting
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton intends to use his visit to better relations with its
neighbor. But analysts say differences would be hard to bridge
because of the U.S. "leadership" foreign policy or power
politics.

<HEADLINE> African First Ladies Begin Discussion on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 African first ladies and
representatives of their counterparts in almost all other African
countries gathered here today for a three-day summit on peace and
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the first ever of its kind organized by the
Nigerian government in collaboration with the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the UN Economic Commission for Africa,
will dwell on critical issues affecting the continent such as
armed conflicts, instability and the health and other problems of
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the summit also includes discussions on
political, economic and social empowerment of women as well as
their health, gender and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The summit was declared open by Nigeria's head of state,
General Sani Abacha, while his wife, Maryam Abacha, OAU
Secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim and the representative of the
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also addressed the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In her keynote speech, the Nigerian first lady said that it is
imperative the attainment of peace in Africa must continue to
remain topmost priority.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace, there can be no stability and meaningful
development in my country," she said, adding that Africa is
facing what is perhaps the most destructive crisis in the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has left millions of Rwandan and Burundian people
as refugees, while thousands of Zairean refugees are seeking
shelter in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly six million refugees in Africa, more than 70
percent are women and children, who also account for about the
same percentage of the over 15 million displaced persons, she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to her, thousands of children have been recruited
into fighting forces as soldiers. Nearly two million children
have been killed in armed conflicts in the past 10 years while
three times the number have been seriously injured or permanently
disabled.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, thousands of homes, schools, hospitals and
clinics have been destroyed, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is under this background, the African first ladies summit
is aimed at finding practical ways and means of supporting and
complementing the efforts of the UN, OAU and other international
agencies to bring peace and stability to the entire continent,
according to the Nigerian first lady.
</P>
<P>
"We must take practical steps and adopt practical solutions in
our program of actions as we search for peace in our continent,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the first African first ladies summit was first
mooted at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing,
China, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was finally endorsed by the 65th ordinary session of the
OAU Council of Ministers in Tripoli, Libya in February after
Nigeria offered to host the event.
</P>
<P>
An Abuja Declaration and Program of Action is scheduled to be
adopted at the end of the summit on May 7.

<HEADLINE> US Computer Giant Plans Big Change in PC Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Compaq Computer Corporation in
the United States, the world's largest personal computer maker, is
planning a big change in its PC sales by overhauling the way it
makes and distributes its machines.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy, called build-to-order system, is aimed at
slowing the tremendous momentum of smaller but faster-growing PC
makers that enjoy a cost advantage because they ship directly to
customers while Compaq sells through dealers. In their most recent
quarters, the gap widened even further with smaller PC maker Dell'
revenues growing 57 percent and Compaq's only 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the New York Times today, the new
system is far more efficient because it reduces the number of
parts Compaq must stock, limiting the risk that the company will
be saddled with outmoded parts and allowing it to introduce
cheaper new components more quickly.
</P>
<P>
If its new strategy succeeds, the company could lower prices
more than 15 percent on some of its desktop computers. As a
result, it would present a serious challenge to rival PC makers,
which would be forced to lower their prices as well.
</P>
<P>
But, the report noted, Compaq's moves are risky because they
threaten the company's relations with the tens of thousands of
large and small dealers around the world that distributes its
computers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Compaq has set a goal of 40 billion U.S. dollars in
sales by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, Zambia, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Zambia today vowed
to bring closer their bilateral relations, to further cooperate
in international affairs and take practical measures to promote
two-way trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
In the talks between visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the two leaders shared
wide-range of views in both international and regional issues
while highly valuing the traditional friendship between the two
countries and the two peoples and their effective cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 70-minute talks began with President Chiluba extending a
warm welcome to Li Peng, saying that the Zambian government and
its people have been honored to host "the most respected Chinese
guest since Zambia won its independence."
</P>
<P>
The friendship between Zambia and China had stood the test of
history and the two countries had become "all-weather friends",
Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba believed Chinese premier's Zambia trip would usher in
a new phase in the bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's regards to
President Chiluba and said that the increase in the exchange of
visits between leaders of the two countries had helped accelerate
the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Despite great changes in international situation since the two
countries forged diplomatic ties in 1964, the relations between
them have been developing well and the two countries have become
mutually trusted friends.
</P>
<P>
Economically, Li Peng said the two countries have had the
tradition of helping each other and China wishes to expand
two-way trade and economic ties with Zambia on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit in the new international situation
and to pioneer new ways of cooperation in enterprises
transformation, mineral exploitation and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises of the two countries should also be encouraged
to establish direct links, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba spoke highly of Zambian-Chinese economic and trade
relations. China had offered a great amount of selfless aid to
Zambia, he said, citing the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. China's
drive to build up socialist market economy with Chinese
characteristics would open up new channels in trade and economic
cooperation, such as textile, telecommunications, personnel
training.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing direct aid to African countries,
China has also helped African people in building up their ability
and confidence of self-reliance, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia wishes to further strengthen and expand its trade and
economic ties with China and welcomes Chinese enterpreneurs to
involve themselves in Zambian development and bring into full
play their role to this effect by making the best use of the
opportunities provided by Zambia, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba extended his congratulations to the Chinese government
on its forthcoming resumption of exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong. He said he believes that along with the returning of
Hong Kong and Macao to the embrace of China, China would finally
realize its goal of reunification. Chiluba also reaffirmed
Zambia's stand of upholding the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
On African and international situation, Li Peng said China has
unswervingly supported the African people in their just struggle
to fight against colonialism and racism and strive for national
independence.
</P>
<P>
China stands for settling regional and international disputes
through peaceful negotiations, Li Peng said. China is happy to
note that Angola has realized its national reconciliation and
hopes that the conflict in Zaire will be resolved as early as
possible and that the African continent will enjoy peace,
stability, prosperity and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba spoke highly of China's active and positive role in
safeguarding the common interests of developing countries in
international affairs. Under the new international situation,
China's position is increasingly important and it is the
expectation of the African countries that China should exert
greater influence internationally.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the world is developing towards
multipolarization, which he believed would benefit the world
people's efforts to seek peace and development. All countries,
big or small, strong or weak, and rich or poor, should be equal
members in participating in international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China hopes that regional groupings in
Africa will play a greater role in this aspect, adding that China
thanks the Zambian government for its support to China in
international forums.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng and Chiluba shared the view that the two countries
should enhance consultation and cooperation in the affairs of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li Peng and Chiluba oversaw the signing of an
agreement between the Chinese and the Zambian governments on
economic and technical cooperation and an agreement on China
providing special-purpose loans to the Zambian and the Tanzanian
governments for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway.

<HEADLINE> German Mobile Phone Operator Offers International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- German mobile phone operator T-Mobil
today said it is beginning offering "international roaming"
services in China from Tuesday.
</P>

within China and about 11 marks (6.39 dollars) to Germany per
minute.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Largest Phone Service Provider to Cut Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- At&AMP;T, the largest provider of
long-distance service in the United States, is taking lead on a
plan to cut long-distance costs by cutting residential rates by
500 million in the year beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
The rate reductions are made over several weeks in negotiations
between the AT&AMP;T Corporation and the Federal Communications
Commission. This is the first substantial cut in long-distance
charges in the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
The 500 million U.S. dollar cut translates into reductions in
residential long-distance bills of 5 percent to 15 percent, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
Sprint and MCI Communications, the two other major
long-distance carriers, are expected to follow, F.C.C. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times in a recent report quoted Reed Hundt,
F.C.C.chairman as describing it "a huge breakthrough." "We have
been in a firefight with AT&AMP;T behind closed doors," he said. Over
the next five years, after major carriers reduced their rates, 85
percent of households would see their phone bills go down and that
rates for the other 15 percent would remain about where they are
today.
</P>
<P>
The rate reductions by AT&AMP;T will apply to households that do
not subscribe to discount packages for long-distance usage,
roughly half of AT&AMP;T 75 million customers.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Reiterates Claims on Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Georgia today reiterated its claim on
part of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and said it hopes to
have a say in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on dividing
the fleet, said a report from Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
As one of the countries which had taken part in the creation of
the fleet and appropriated money for the fleet's three bases
within its territory, Georgia has every reason for the claim,
Georgian presidential press secretary Vakhtang Abashidze told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said what Georgia claims for some 20 ships which were
originally deployed at the country's military port Poti and
withdrawn without consent from the Georgian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major part of the former Soviet Union's
naval force, is based on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia
and Ukraine both claimed the fleet after the disintegration of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reached a tentative agreement on
dividing the fleet, but disputes remain over the status of
Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Georgia first announced in 1996 its claim on the fleet and said
the claim was limited to patrol boats for protecting its coast.
</P>
<P>
And today, Abashidze voiced regret that the Russian leadership
offered no response to the message passed by the Georgian
authorities a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Ukraine has showed some understanding and
backed Georgia's demand.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Satisfied With Turkey's Explanation on Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today Egypt was satisfied with Turkey's explanation that the
three-nation war games involving Turkey, the United states and
Israel were not directed at Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, the minister, who has been
demanding a Turkish explanation for the planned joint military
exercises, said that "we felt satisfied when Turkey denied the
(anti-Arab nature) of holding such war games."
</P>
<P>
Moussa, however, said that "(if) the U.S.-Israeli-Turkish
military maneuvers meant to be a direct message to the Arabs or to
others, then they would be a source of concern."
</P>
<P>
If the war games with such a character were held, they would
back fire and we would discuss what were their objectives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Ikbal said
that its anti-terrorist cooperation with Israel was not directed
against any country in the region and that the agreement it had
signed with the Jewish state is like those signed with other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to comment on Turkish Defense Minister
Turhan Tayan's assertion that the agreement is targeted against
Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel's English newspaper, Jerusalem Post, reported today that
the U.S., Israel and Turkey finalized their plan to hold a joint,
three-way naval exercises in the Mediterranean this summer.
</P>
<P>
In order not to disturb its Arab neighbors, the Israeli Defense
Ministry has claimed that the joint maneuvers will "be of human
nature and focus on search-and-rescue scenario," and are not aimed
at the two traditional Israeli foes, Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The frequent visits between senior Turkish and Israeli
officials in recent months have caused grave concern from the Arab
world, including Egypt, which obviously fears the establishment of
a Tel Aviv-Ankara alliance.
</P>
<P>
A string of senior Turkish officials, most of them from the
military, have successively visited Israel in a bid to further
expand its cooperation with Israelis in the defense and military
field.
</P>
<P>
These visits, including that of General Ismail Hakki Karadayi,
Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, were termed by the
Turkish press as a military check of the pro-Islamic diplomatic
policy pursued by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister's remarks came a week after
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel postponed his imminent visit to
Egypt, just hours before the projected visit was scheduled to take
place.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government had reportedly expected an explanation
on Ankara's recent warming contact with Israel during Demirel's
visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Ambassador to Egypt Bashir Yakbes had attributed the
aborted summit between Demirel and his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak to an over-spilling agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government is also quick to play down the
suspicions around the last-minute cancellation, which coincided
with an upcoming visit by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Before Mordechai's trip to Turkey, Israel's Foreign Minister
David Levy paid a two-day visit to Ankara in early April. Levy
asserted that ties between the two countries had grown closer
despite a frosty reception from Necmettin Erbakan, who strongly
opposed developing ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but
ties remain cool. Stalled peace process currently added tensions
to the strained ties.

BUDAPEST, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentarian or a
businessman? Some Hungarians now have to consider the question
carefully and make a decision on either option.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations approved by the National Assembly

Most assemblymen have resigned their posts in enterprises
except former Minister of Industry and Commerce Pal Lasilo, who
chosed to act as the chairman of a petroleum company, news media

The new regulations required legislators to register their

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Committee to Discuss Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The five-nation ceasefire committee
monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border is to
hold a meeting at the south Lebanese town of Naqoura Wednesday
afternoon to discuss an Israeli complain against Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Radio Lebanon reported today that
representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States will discuss a complaint filed by Israel to the
ceasefire monitoring committee over a Monday attack by Lebanese
guerrillas on a patrol of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God,
detonated a roadside bomb in the eastern sector of Israel's south
Lebanon occupation zone, wounding two elements of the surrogate
SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
Four civilians in a car behind the patrol were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Israel accused Lebanese guerrillas of
violating a ceasefire understanding reached between the Jewish
state and Lebanon on April 26, 1996, which demanded the fighting
sides in south Lebanon to keep civilians away from military
operations.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south
Lebanon to oust the Israeli occupation forces out of the Lebanese
land, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Monday attack added to five killed and 18 wounded the
casualties of the SLA militia since this year.
</P>
<P>
Senior Lebanese officials said that David Greenlec,
U.S. chairman of the cease-fire monitoring committee, had handed
over a copy of the Israeli complaint to the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry, and informed the Lebanese delegates that the committee
will meet in the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon at 2:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the tenth meeting of the committee since this
year and the 28th since the five-state group was established in
August, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory actions by
the Israeli forces and the SLA militia constitute a daily scene
on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer strip and
named it the "security zone" in 1985 to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Association Chairman: Handover Opens New Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Far from diminishing the
territory's luster, Hong Kong's return to its motherland "opens up
a new era of opportunity," Chairman of the Hong Kong Hotels
Association Thomas Axmacher said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of Asia's premier food and
hospitality event, HOFEX 97, Axmacher described the handover as
"the start of a whole new chapter in one of the great ongoing
sagas of our time."
</P>
<P>
And the trade show itself, which notched up new records in both
size and scope, signified "our collective confidence in Hong
Kong's future," said Axmacher, who is also general manager of
Regent Hotel.
</P>
<P>
"Sadly," he pointed out, "the international press has been too
prone to represent this milestone as an ending rather than a
beginning."
</P>
<P>
"This has given rise to the impression overseas that all of
those many special qualities that have attracted visitors to our
shores over the past century and a half are either threatened or
in decline," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "nothing could be further from the truth or
could do Hong Kong a greater disservice."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has, in a way, become a kind of global "theme park"
dedicated to "the theme of dynamic prosperity through diligent
perseverance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
And nothing will change after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will still be managing our own affairs, and, if anything,
faring even better" through closer linkage with the interior areas
of China, the world's fastest growing economy.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to get that message across to the world at large,
to undo the damage that has been done by commentators too intent
on finding bad news rather than reporting positive trends," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Hotels Association, which lists 76 member hotels
providing a total of 34,000 rooms, is preparing to cope with the
greatly increased visitor capacity of the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok, due to open in less than a year's time, has been designed to
serve, he said.
</P>
<P>
More hotels are expected to be built in the next 10 years,
mainly in the three- and four-star categories, he added.

<HEADLINE> Parties to Chemical Weapons Convention Hold First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The state parties to the Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC) gathered here for the first time Tuesday
to ensure that the pact will rid the world of a whole category of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 representatives from the 165 countries and some
international and non-governmental organizations attended the
first session of the Conference of the CWC State Parties, which
was opened by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
A body to oversee the pact's implementation -- the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, will be created at this
session. It will be based in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which entered into force on April 29, bans the use,
production, stockpiling of chemical weapons and provides for the
start of their destruction.
</P>
<P>
It requires the state parties to destroy their chemical weapons
stockpiles and production facilities within a fixed period of
time. The goal is to eliminate such weapons by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The pact came 82 years after a fateful day in European history,
April 22, 1915, when troops on the battlefield of Ypres in Belgium
fell victim of the first poison gas attack.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Annan described the meeting, which will
last three weeks as a "historic event."
</P>
<P>
"It is not merely a great step in the cause of disarmament and
non-proliferation...It is much more. It is a momentous act of
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the convention will ensure that civilian
chemical industries were not adversely affected by its provisions.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that the key to the effective implementation of
the convention lies in its universal adoption. He urged all 185
U.N. members to join it.
</P>
<P>
To date, 89 countries have ratified the pact.
</P>
<P>
China has ratified the convention last December and submitted
the letter of ratification to the U.N. on April 25 to become the
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Making Progress in Restructuring Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Haoruo, the executive
vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy, said at a press conference here today that China has made
smooth progress and positive achievements in reforming its
economic system in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has gained some useful experience in
reorganizing state assets, reviving small state-owned enterprises,
continuing reforms of the state assets management system, and
industrializing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Pilot reforms in a small number of state enterprises have
spread to the entire national economy, and the state strategy is
to focus on key enterprises and giving more autonomy to small
ones, and it will help 1,000 major enterprises become more
profitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the state-owned small enterprises were
restructured by the end of last year, with more than half of them
being turned into stock companies, which are showing good economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
Reorganizing state assets has helped state enterprises adapt to
a market economy, and the ratio of assets to liabilities in state
enterprises in Shanghai, China's largest industrial center,
dropped from 80 percent in 1994 to 67 percent last year, and is
expected to fall to around 60 percent by the end of this year. The
city has found new jobs for 890,000 of its 1.09 million laid-off
workers, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that progress has been made in issuing shares in state
enterprises. 9,200 state companies had been turned into
stock-issuing ones by the end of 1996, with total share funds of
600 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of China's social security system have also made
headway, he said, adding that at present, 22 provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities have worked out plans for old-age
pension reforms, and the number of pilot cities for medical
insurance reforms has gone from two to more than 50.
</P>
<P>
The state macro-management reforms have also improved,
especially in the fields of finance and banking, the Vice-Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in rural areas, the contract household
responsibility system will remain unchanged, but various areas are
exploring ways to integrate trade, industry, and agriculture in an
effort to help farmers enter the market.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that a number of deep-seated
contradictions and problems still exist in China's economic
performance, and that some of them are even getting worse. These
problems can only be solved by continuing the reforms, he
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels appealed today to
government troops in the capital Kinshasa to surrender to
approaching rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to all government soldiers in Kinshasa to leave
and present themselves to alliance commanders and troops," a
report reaching here today quoted the appeal broadcast from
rebel Voice of the People Radio in Lubumbashi in the name of the
rebel military high command as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A surrender is important because it will avoid bloodshed in
Kinshasa," said the appeal in French.
</P>
<P>
"Troops can present themsevles to alliance commanders at
Kenge (200 km to the east of the capital) or at bases inside
Kinshasa," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report said rebels have set up surrender centers and
will not harm soldiers willing to turn themselves in.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the rebels of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire led by
Laurent Kabila are closing in on the capital and could be there
in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
The report said Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko will leave
Kinshasa for Congolese capital Libreville tomorrow to attend a
regional summit and he will return on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report quoted western diplomats as saying "the
trip was apparently part of a deal to allow Kabila to take power."
</P>
<P>
Mobutu and Kabila held talks on the Zaire crisi on a South
African Navy ship moored off the west African coast on Sunday.
The two men did not reach an agreement on the terms of Mobutu's
departure.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu said he would hand over power to an elected president
but Kabila insisted that Mobutu must hand over power directly to
the rebel alliance.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu asked Kabila to give him eight days to consider his
resignment and Kabila agreed.
</P>
<P>
But Kabila stressed his rebel forces will not stop advancing
on to the capital while Mobuto is considering his resignment.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Claim 7,500 Lives Each Year in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- About 7,500 people have been killed
each year on Italy's roads and highways and another 187,500 people
injured in automobile accidents, of which one third were left with
permanent disabilities, Italy's Red Cross reported today.
</P>
<P>
Totally 120,000 people have been killed and another three
million injured in road accidents in Italy in the past 16 years,
the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of all emergency treatments provided in
hospital outpatient departments were for motor accident victims
and 11 percent of all Red Cross interventions, 800,000 per year,
were for highway accidents, Mariapia Garavaglia, special
commissioner of the Italian Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
The data on the toll claimed by motor vehicles were made public
today at a press conference during preparations for the week of
"Highway Accidents, Prevention and First Aid," sponsored by the
Red Cross which celebrates the organization's own "World Day" on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the need for prevention, Garavaglia referred to the
nation's "Saturday night massacres" which regularly claim
fatalities over weekends from among young people intent on a mix
of partying, disco dancing through the night, often with the aid
of drugs, and driving.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner reported that in the first four months of the
year, these weekend road deaths rose to 445, from 338 in the same
period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures provided by Red Cross health care director
Nicola Marinosci showed that highway deaths and injuries have
declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Marinosci cited the 1976 toll of 9,511 dead and 229,898 people
injured in 272,710 accidents compared with 182,761 accidents
reported in 1995, which resulted in 6,512 deaths and 259,571
injuries.
</P>
<P>
A field study showed that 48 percent of the nation's automobile
accidents occurred in the north, 32 percent in the central regions
and 20 percent in the south.
</P>
<P>
As to causes of the accidents, Marinosci pointed out that
speeding was blamed for 1,481 deaths in 1995, followed by
distraction of the drivers, which claimed another 923
lives. Driving under the influence of alcohol was named as the
cause of 110 deaths in 2,207 accidents in the same year.

<HEADLINE> China's Road-Building Open To More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China will open up road-building to
overseas investors, encouraging them to build highways, bridges,
and tunnels through joint ventures or solely overseas-owned
ventures, using international practices, according to a senior
Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
China is moving cautiously in using overseas funds for building
roads until it gets the requisite amount of experience at which
time it will launch more projects.
</P>
<P>
Li Juchang, Vice-Minister of Communications, who spoke at the
opening of two-day seminar today, sponsored by the Communications
Ministry and the World Bank, where Chinese and overseas experts
will discuss developing highway networks in China.
</P>
<P>
Li told the participants that by the end of 1996 China had 1.18
million km of highways, 3,400 km of which are expressways. He
attributes China's achievements in road-construction to the huge
amount of financial assistance from overseas, especially from the
World Bank. He thanked the international financial institution for
its consistent support to the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of last year, China had about 4.2
billion US dollars in loans from the World Bank for 27 road,
river, and port projects, with nine highway projects completed or
near completion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that World Bank loans have helped some 1,300 km of
freeways and several thousand km of rural roads, and that China
plans to use more overseas funds for building roads in backward
areas. The country's policy of combining road-construction with
poverty-eradication is in line with the World Bank's policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the meeting, Chief of the World
Bank Mission to China Pieter P. Bottelier said that the bank is
willing to assist China in its infrastructure, and that because
all World Bank-funded projects are bid publicly, China's
infrastructure construction departments have learned to be more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
He showed his satisfaction with the long-time cooperation and
said that all World Bank-financed road projects have been
successful.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), the nation's biggest bank, has promised more
financial support to another 50 key state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank signed an agreement with the 50 state firms on
providing more loans and preferential treatment in loans for
operating funds.

This is an indication that cooperation between the
ICBC and state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises has
increased, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The bank signed similar agreement with 272 State
Council-designated enterprises last year to ensure adequate funds
for the state enterprise reforms.

In the second half of last year, the bank loaned the 272 firms
a total of 27.83 billion yuan for operational funds.

President of ICBC, Liu Tinghuan, said his bank has always given
priority to state-owned key enterprises, and vowed to develop new
banking services to allow his bank to support the state sector.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton arrived in Mexico City on his first
visit to a Latin American country since taking
office. U.A. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 10
agreements would be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
-- A member of a group that claims Texas is an independent
nation was shot dead in a gun battle with the authorities, but his
accomplice was still at large.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Zaire's rebel leader Laurent Kabila said on Monday that his
forces could be in the capital of Kinshasa in the next "two or
three days" and were already within 56 kilometers of Kinshasa's
airport.
</P>
<P>
-- The Dow Johns shot up 143.29 points and closed at 7214.49 on
Monday, a record high in a broad-based rally that surprised
skeptics who just a month ago thought the time had come for a
long-dreaded, sustained downturn.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. food companies are starving for new ideas. After the
1980s round of mergers, food-research departments shrank and food
patents filed in U.S. by foreign companies began to eclipse those
of domestic rivals. The U.S. food industry is going stale.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. automaker Fords said light-vehicle sales fell 4.3
percent in April, capping a tepid sales month for the Big Three,
while their Japanese rivals benefited from the strong dollar and
popular models.

<HEADLINE> 2 People Killed in Bomb Explosions in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians were killed and two
others wounded in two bomb explosions on the outskirts of the
south Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh this morning, the state-run Radio
Lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at 11:25 a.m. (0825 GMT) two roadside
bombs exploded on the Nabih Berri Road east of Nabatiyeh,
overthrowing a pickup and killing the two men inside.
</P>
<P>
Other two civilians were injured when their car was badly
damaged in the explosion, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army troops blockaded the area shortly after the
blast and found a third bomb at the same place and defused it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes hovered over the area following the incident
and broke sound barrier in two rounds, security sources were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that experts from the army found splinters of
bombs at the site of explosion and identified some Hebrew words
engraved on them.
</P>
<P>
The two blasts came just before a five-nation group monitoring a
limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border is to hold a meeting
at the south Lebanese town of Naqoura Wednesday afternoon at
Israel's request.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States will discuss a complaint filed by Israel to the
cease-fire monitoring committee over a Monday attack by Lebanese
guerrillas on a patrol of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
detonated a roadside bomb in the eastern sector of Israel's south
Lebanon occupation zone, wounding two elements of the surrogate
SLA militia. Four civilians in a car behind the patrol were also
wounded.

<HEADLINE> New Malaysian Navy Vessel Commissioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today commissioned a
new navy vessel for deep-sea surveying and open-sea search and
rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The ship "KD Perantau" was commissioned at the Hong Leong
Lurssen shipyard, Butterworth, about 370 kilometers northwest from
here, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Forces Chief Gen. Ismail Omar and Royal
Malaysian Navy chief Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor were present on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted as saying the ship
built with German technology at a cost of 100 million ringgit
(about 40 million U.S. dollars) is fitted with Navigation Command
and Control System and Mapping System to carry out deep-sea
surveying as well as search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is also equipped with "Multibeam", "Digital Slide
Scan Sonar" and "Under Water Camera" which could produce
three-dimension data on deep-sea conditions, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ship which will hit the ocean next year replaced
another ship, a mine sweeper bought from Britain, bearing the same
name which was decommissioned in 1990.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Red Cross Official on Inter-Korean Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Red Cross spokesman for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said that South Korea
is responsible for the failure of an agreement at the meeting
between Red Cross officials of the North and the South in Beijing
on May 3-5.
</P>
<P>
No agreement was reached at the working-level contact between
the North-South Red Cross delegates due to the South side's
attitude on its non-governmental offering of food and other relief
goods to the North, the spokesman for the Central Committee of the
Red Cross Society of the DPRK said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the DPRK's Korean Central News Agency
(KCNA), the spokesman said that the DPRK expected a good result in
the contact between Red Cross officials, which the South side
proposed on April 18 to discuss the offering of food and other
relief goods to the North, taking into account the fact that the
Red Cross organizations of the North and the South helped each
other in the past with compatriotic and humanitarian feelings.
</P>
<P>
However, it was "really unreasonable" for the South side to
insist on the discussion of the procedures and method of the
offering in the contact, not making clear what and when they will
offer to the North, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that when the North side asked the South side about
the quantity of goods and the time of the offering, the South side
said it could give no details, making it hard to understand the
real purpose of the South side-proposed contact.
</P>
<P>
It is an empty talk and a sheer waste of time to discuss the
procedures and method of the offering with the South side's
position remaining unclear, the KCNA quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The North side will meet with the South side any time when it
notifies the North side of the date of the contact after preparing
the relief goods in a responsible manner, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Market Continues Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market continued
its strong rebound today after Monday's big climb, but analysts
still doubt if the rising trend can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
After the composite index jumped 130.77 points, or more than 5
percent, to 2,736.42 Monday, it climbed by 40.11 points to
2,776.53 today.
</P>
<P>
Reports of better-than-expected inflation rate for the month of
April, which was down to 4.6 percent from 4.8 percent in March,
made the market rebound after it suffered sharp declines to a two
year low last week.
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect a technical rebound this big, but I say that
this has to be sustained for at least a week before we can say
with conviction that there has been a reversal," said Heden
Alvarez, research director at All-Asia Securities.
</P>
<P>
Poor corporate earnings, coupled with fears of a
property-related financial crisis in the country, were attributed
to last week's market crash.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good breather. But we have to wait and see if it can
be sustained before we can say that the trend has indeed been
reversed," said Poch Zamora, a dealer at Peregrine Securities
Philis. Inc.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Central Bank of the Philippines hiked its
overnight borrowing rate for the second time in less than a week
from 11 percent to 11.5 percent to quell speculative attacks on
the peso.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Italy Drops to 1.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The inflation in Italy dropped to 1.7
percent in April from 2.2 percent in March, the Italian national
statistics bureau ISTAT said today.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index inched up only 0.1 percent last month
over March, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in April was the lowest in 28 years and it was
also lower than the average 3.1 percent over the past twelve
months, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that the
trend will continue in the year and put Italy in a better position
at the end of 1998 than the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Italy for 1998 will average out at 2 percent, the
same as that of Germany and less than the average 2.3 percent of
the G-7 industrialized nations, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1988, Italy's inflation was over 12 percent, twice
that of the G-7's average 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yasushi Akashi Makes Inspection Tour of Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs, Yasushi Akashi, left Baghdad Monday for two
other northern Iraqi cities of Irbil and Sulaymaniyah to inspect
how the oil-for-food deal is being executed there.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official source in Baghdad announced today that after
his return from northern Iraq to Baghdad, Akashi will meet Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and a number of Iraqi
officials before leaving Iraq on May 9.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit to Iraq, Akashi has had a series of
talks with some Iraqi officials and visited a Baghdad infant
hospital.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in Baghdad three days ago, Akashi told reporters
that the U.N. wants to accelerate importing food supplies and
medicines and distributing them to Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
Akashi added that his current visit to Iraq is to inspect how
far the oil-for-food deal signed by the U.N. with Iraq has been
implemented, as well as how big the suffering of the Iraqi people
is.
</P>
<P>
A source in the office of the U.N. Humanitarian Affairs
Coordinator in Baghdad also declared today that the U.N. Security
Council Sanctions Committee has approved contracts signed by Iraq
for importing 79,000 tonnes of sugar from France. Some quantities
of tea from Jordan, Indonesia and China have been arriving in Iraq
since late last month.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal concluded last year by Iraq with the
U.N. allows Baghdad to sell 1.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over six months to purchase the badly needed food and
medicine.

<HEADLINE> China to Provide Computer Training Program For College Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's State Education Commission
(SEC) today started a nation-wide computer training program for
college teachers to improve computer teaching in its institutes of
higher learning.
</P>
<P>
It will train 700 college teachers, in two groups, this year.
</P>
<P>
The first trainees from thirty polytechnic colleges gathered
today at Beijing's Qinghua University to begin the ten-day program
on modern software applications.
</P>
<P>
An official from SEC said at an opening ceremony that computer
teaching in Chinese colleges lags far behind the
rapidly-developing information technology, and to improve computer
ability among students, especially non-computer majors, the SEC is
considering changing computer curricula of colleges and compiling
new teaching materials for non-computer majors.
</P>
<P>
It considers teacher training an effective way to improve
computer education and plans to set up regular training bases
nationwide, said the official.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Government Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown today ordered an increase in base rates to
6.25 percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that he was giving the Bank of England, the
central bank, operational independence to set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to set a national inflation
target and the central bank would have responsibility for setting
interest rates to meet the target, the Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
The moves came after Brown's first meeting with Eddie Georte,
governor of the Bank of England, this morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to take the tough decisions we need for the
long-term interests and prosperity of the country," Brown told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain "must break from the short-termism of the
past and the economic instability that has characterized the
British economy, not just in recent years but for most of the
century."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the growing concerns over the country's rapid
growth of consumer spending and fears that the robust consumer
demand and the poor export performance would make the economy
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
Britain's consumer spending growth is set to hit 5 percent this
autumn and economic overall growth is expected to climb to 3.5
percent in the second half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Cote d'Ivoire President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, in a
meeting here this afternoon with Cote d'Ivoire President Henri
Konan Bedie, said the Chinese government attaches great importance
to the visit, and expressed the conviction that it will push
bilateral friendly co-operation forward.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, there has been
good momentum in the two countries' co-operation in various fields
through concerted efforts and with the backing of their leaders,
Zhu said, and the two have supported and sympathized and
cooperated with each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates Cote d'Ivoire's support on
the human rights issue and its principled stand on the "One China"
policy and on not making official contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire has kept its commitments since the establishing
of diplomatic ties and is willing to develop long-term and stable
relations cooperation with China, Bedie said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zhu said, economic and trade co-operation
between the two countries has made rapid progress and involved
joint ventures, which have provided experience for multi-tier and
multi-channel cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for China's support for Cote
d'Ivoire's economic development, Bedie said that his country and
China are economically complementary and that he hopes more
Chinese entrepreneurs can take part in that economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said the world should develop in a coordinated and peaceful
way and that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence are the
basis of world peace, democracy, and human rights, which should be
safeguarded, and should not be detached from a country's
development level and actual conditions, and are not something
that should be imposed by others.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the most pressing problem for developing
countries is the right of subsistence and of development, which
should be a priority for the international community, and that as
developing countries China and Cote d'Ivoire oppose the political
pressure applied by some countries under the name of human rights.

</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Culture Liu Zhongde, who arrived here today

in culture and science has been strengthened, Liu said.

Sino-Mongolian agreement on cultural cooperation during Chinese
Premier Li Peng's 1994 visit to Mongolia, as well as the
endorsement of a plan for cultural cooperation and exchange
between the two governments in the year of 1996-97. Those
documents are significant to the development of bilateral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu also briefed the Mongolians on the situation of China's
reform of its cultural system.

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce Law for Energy Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government plans to
enact an energy conservation law before the year-end to make
energy audit mandatory for large consumers of various energy
sources and bring in the concept of energy label for
power-intensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, industries and other large consumers would
be required to carry out audits on their energy consumption levels
and make efforts to optimize the use, Bhasker Natarajan, director
of the Energy Management Center under the Indian Ministry of
Power, said today at a national workshop on energy conservation
and environmental protection in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in
southern India.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, manufacturers of power-intensive products such as
refrigerators, air-conditioners and industrial machinery would be
asked to stick a label on the product indicating its energy
consumption level as against a benchmark standard.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would not confine itself to electricity, but
cover all other energy sources including the non-conventional
sources, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The need for such a law was felt both at government and
industry levels as a lack of a facilitative mechanism had helped
evaders continue with energy-inefficient systems, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official Meets With Portugal Parliament President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, in a meeting with the President of the Portuguese
Parliament Almeida Santos in Beijing today, spoke about the
hand-over of Macao, which is only two years away.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that China and Portugal will handle
problems that crop up during the Macao transition in a proper way
to guarantee a smooth hand-over and the long-term stability and
prosperity of the region. Both sides should increase co-operation
and rely on past experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Handling the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan issues under the "one
country, two systems" policy is the great creation of the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, which has been well-received by the
world community and the citizens of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy will help ensure the long-term
stability and prosperity of these regions and will benefit the
reforms, opening up, and economic construction of the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is determined to carry out this policy
proceeding which is in the interest of the Chinese people,
including the people of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since Portugal and China established diplomatic
ties, bilateral relations have been sound, and in recent years
high-level exchanges of visits have been frequent, and
co-operation in politics, the economy, and other areas have
expanded. The Chinese government is pleased with the smooth
progress, he added.
</P>
<P>
Santos noted that the idea of "one country, two systems" is a
model for settling issues left over from the past, and a
reflection of the wisdom of the Chinese people, and expressed the
hope that with the Hong Kong and Macao transition, the Taiwan
issue will be properly handled to realize the reunification of the
country.
</P>
<P>
High-level contacts between the two countries are helpful for
bilateral ties, Santos said and he is looking forward to Li's
visit to Portugal late this May, and hopes the two countries will
increase co-operation in various sectors.

CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is expecting to attract 10 million tourists in
1997 and earn 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from them, local newspaper
Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish Tourism Minister Bahattin Yucel as
saying that during 1996, 8.6 million tourists visited Turkey and
the country earned 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tourists in 1996 were mostly from Germany,
Britain and Russia and it would probably remain so this year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government will launch a new
revenue-raising package next week with a target of 10 billion
U.S. dollars, the local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government singles out the life insurance market as a top
potential for increased revenue.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials as saying they aim to expand the
market from the current size of 100 million dollars to about 15
billion dollars in the several years to come through the
introduction of new regulations designed to foster the industry.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 500,000 people have bought life insurance in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The yawning trade deficit of Egypt has soared by 10.1
percent to 5.48 billion U.S. dollars on the previous year due to a
faster growth in imports over exports.
</P>
<P>
An increase in exports by 8 percent to 2.279 billion dollars
was dwarfed by a 9.5 percent growth in imports to record 7.767
billion dollars, the latest report of the Central Bank of Egypt on
the national economy for the first six months of 1996-97 fiscal
year starting July showed.
</P>

Most of the increase in exports came from about 25 percent jump
in oil exports from 1 million to 1.3 million dollars on higher
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports accounted for 56.7 percent of total exports up from
48.9 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Among other commodities, cotton yarn exports declined by 26
percent from 119 million to 88 million dollars, while raw cotton
exports came down by 13 percent from 23 million to 20 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Potato exports were down by one million to 5 million
dollars. Citrus exports were flat, while rice exports jumped by
46.6 percent from 15 million to 22 million dollars.

KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait would do its best to keep oil prices in
the world market at their current levels or even to see them go
up, Kuwait's Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazidi said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with official Kuwaiti News Agency in Manama,
Bahrain, the minister said "we would like to maintain these
prices," adding that oil prices had reached their highest in
several years since last summer until the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said no one could project what prices would be like in the
future as there were "certain circumstances and factors what we
do not control," but Kuwait would play its role to keep the
prices stable.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a question whether Kuwait
would request a hike in its current quota of 2 million barrels
per day (bpd) during the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) meeting to be held soon.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait exports 3 percent of world combined oil exports and has
a current oil production capacity of 2.4 million bpd. It has
decided to raise the oil production capacity to 3 million bpd by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices in the international market have fallen from
24 U.S. dollars a barrel at the start of this year to below 18
dollars this month because of an increase in crude oil output by
non-OPEC states, quota busting by some OPEC countries, weaker
international oil demand, higher Iraqi flows and increased
reserves, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi expressed belief that "oil prices would go up"
again.

<HEADLINE> Record High Quarterly Net Sales for HK's Unit Trust Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Gross sales and net sales of unit
trusts in the first quarter of 1997 were the highest on record,
according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Gross sales in the quarter amounted to 1,914.39 million U.S.
dollars, up by about 56 percent over the corresponding period in
1996, and almost doubled the total inflows in the fourth quarter
of 1996, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Net investment also scored a record high of 666.73 million U.S.
dollars. This compared with net outflows of 181.63 million U.S.
dollars in the final quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The second highest net inflows on record was registered in the
fourth quarter of 1993, at 556.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Strong inflows were consistently recorded in all the three
months. It was the first time for the industry to record gross
inflows of over 600 million U.S. dollars for such a long period,
the HKIFA said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the strong inflows came from larger institutional
investors and not solely from individual investors.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the record high inflows was attributable to the
popularity of Hong Kong equity and single Asian country (region)
funds of Hong Kong and Japan. These two sectors accounted for
74.2 percent of the industry's net inflows and 44.4 percent of
gross sales in the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia's leading food service and
hospitality event, HOFEX 97, was opened at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center here today.
</P>
<P>
The biennial event showcased a comprehensive range of products,
equipment, supplies and services for the food service, hotels,
restaurants and catering industries.
</P>
<P>
It embraced five specialist shows -- the Asian International
Seafood Show 97, HOTEX Asia 97, Bakery and Confectionery Asia 97,
Wine and Spirits 97, and Hospitality Interiors and Tableware 97.
Each of them is rich in content and large enough to effectively be
a stand-alone event.
</P>
<P>
The seafood show, which attracted companies from renowned
seafood producing countries such as the United States, Norway,
Ireland and New Zealand, and HOTEX Asia, which featured products
specially designed to enhance service standards and management in
hotels and restaurants, were included in the ten-year-old HOFEX
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The four-day extravaganza attracted a record high number of
over 1,300 exhibitors from 47 countries and regions, according to
Hong Kong Exhibition Services (HKEC), organizer of the event.
</P>
<P>
"The industry's response to this year's HOFEX has been
overwhelming. We already occupy three levels of the exhibition
center and many would-be exhibitors are still on the waiting list,
but we cannot expand due to space limitations," HKEC General
Manager Shaun Goh told the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A record high attendance of 23,000 visitors has been projected
for the show.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is well-known for its good food and hospitality
services, part and parcel of a successful tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, over 1,000 restaurants and hotels have
been set up in Hong Kong, while in 1996, tourist spending in Hong
Kong amounted to 85 billion HK dollars (10.9 billion US dollars)
or over 7 percent of Gross Domestic Product.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The consumption of most fuels in Macao
dropped more than 10 percent in the last quarter of 1996, latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that except petroleum gas, the consumption of other fuels all
declined compared with the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Macao consumed 23.7 percent less electricity, 11.6 percent less
heavy oil, and 10.3 percent less gasoline in the last three months
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of oil gas, however, rose 19.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But when compared with the same period in 1995, the consumption
of heavy oil climbed 15.6 percent, gasoline 8.9 percent,
electricity 6.3 percent and oil gas 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop in fuel consumption is believed to be a result of a
sluggish economy, which saw less than one percent growth last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, price of fuels rose considerably in between October
and December last year, compared with the previous quarter. The
price of heavy oil, for instance, rose 15.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Mubarak to Attend Islamic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
accepted an invitation to take part in the Islamic Summit in
Tehran in December, visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati extended the invitation at a lengthy meeting this
morning with Mubarak, which he described as "constructive and
frank."
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said whether the
president would attend the summit or not is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too soon to reply to such a question or even to
speak about the formation of the Egyptian delegation to the
summit," said Moussa after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told reporters that his talks with Mubarak covered
various issues in the Islamic world, especially the Palestinian
cause, which is a major and complicated issue at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support for the Palestinians, Velayati voiced
belief that Islamic states should work and cooperate together to
solve such major problems.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Iran should cooperate in their capacity as two major
Islamic states, to help settle crises facing the Islamic nation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the Tehran summit will tackle several issues,
especially difficulties facing the Islamic world, the Palestinian
cause, the recent dramatic changes in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He cited in this respect continued catastrophes in Afghanistan
and Somalia, and difficulties faced by Muslims in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian top diplomat also radically rejected reports on
Egyptian accusations leveled at Iran for its support of extremist
groups and its involvement in the attempt on the life of Mubarak
in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"I repeat that such accusations are groundless," said Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Asked on whether Velayati's visit to Egypt would help better
their relations, Moussa said it has good results and will
contribute to speeding up restoration of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"The visit afforded a good opportunity for exchanging views and
discussing the situation in the region frankly and this
constitutes a positive step," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said he cannot say whether there would be
exchange of visits between Egypt and Iran in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The present phase between the two countries is one of frank
discussion," he said, adding that the issue of the disputed
islands between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was also
tackled during today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
A dispute has existed since early 1970s between Iran and the UAE
over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, which
are strategically situated at the mouth of the Hormuz Strait, the
gate way to the oil-rich Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Calling Iran a major Islamic country, Moussa said cooperation
between Cairo and Tehran took place within the context of the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
On the effect of the restoration of Egyptian-Iranian ties,
Moussa noted that taking any steps in any direction is a decision
to be adopted by both Egypt and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a mutual wish to take such a decision," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran broke diplomatic ties after the Islamic
revolution in Iran in 1979, although they opened interests
sections in each other's country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has accused Tehran of stirring up trouble in Egypt,
where Muslim militants have been waging a violent campaign
attempting to overthrow the secular government.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ramos Actively Pushes Economic Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- One month after a successful tour to
South Asia and the Middle East, Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today embarked on a three-nation America trip to continue his
long-pursued economic diplomacy thrust.
</P>
<P>
"I am the Philippines' No. 1 salesman, not No. 1 tourist,"
Ramos said at a press briefing one day before his departure,
defending the economic diplomacy he has been pushing since taking
office four and half years ago.
</P>
<P>
The current trip, which will take Ramos to the United States,
Mexico and Panama, is expected to clinch nearly 3 billion U.S.
dollars' worth of trade and investments, according to Trade and
Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a large group of leading Filipino businessmen,
Ramos is also expected to bring back 28 trade and economic
cooperation agreements from the tour, the president's second
large- scale diplomatic activity this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic diplomacy has been widely viewed as a cornerstone of
the Ramos administration's overall strategy for economic
development since it was launched by the administration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 when Ramos took over from former President Corazon
Aquino, the Philippines was bogged down in economic chaos, with
its economy growing by only 0.6 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Raging insurgency by the leftists and the Muslims in the late
part of the era of former President Ferdinand Marcos and seven
military coups during the Aquino term had frightened away most
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
To lure back foreign investors, Ramos has actively pressed
ahead with his economic diplomacy abroad while implementing a
series of reform measures to rejuvenate the ailing economy at
home.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Ramos has traveled to more than 30
countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and America to rebuild
foreign investors' confidence in the Philippines, whose domestic
situation has been getting stable.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' foreign trips have generated more than 20 billion
dollars in foreign investment and created 450,000 to 500,000 jobs
in the country, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' economic diplomacy reached its peak last November when
leaders of the 18 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members
gathered in Subic, the northern Philippines, for an informal
meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the APEC meeting, over 5 billion dollars' worth of
business deals, which covered at least 20 projects, were struck
between Philippine companies and their counterparts from other
APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ramos administration took the opportunity to
showcase its booming economy and even projected an image of an
"economic tiger cub" to foreign media.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, at least six countries, including the United
States, Australia and Canada, sent trade missions to the country
to explore investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a sustained high economic growth rate, analysts here
said, both Ramos and his successors will have to continue the
current economic diplomacy in the future.
</P>
<P>
A report issued earlier by the Asian Development Bank predicted
that the Philippines needs at least 28 billion dollars to finance
its infrastructure development in the next five years, which is
far beyond Manila's own financial means.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, more foreign capital is needed to improve the
country's still backward infrastructure, especially in the
southern Philippines whose economy had been battered by decades of
Muslim separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
Peace returned to most parts of the southern Philippines after
the government forged a peace deal with the mainstream Moro
National Liberation Front last September, paving the way for
developing the long-neglected region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippines needs to tap more markets for its
products to reduce its widening trade deficit, which economists
warned will slow down the country's robust economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To curb the swelling trade deficit and reduce the country's
dependence on the traditional markets of the United States and
Japan, the Ramos government has planned to open up new markets in
Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
For these purposes, Ramos still has to doggedly pursue his
economic diplomacy during the remaining one year of his term of
office.

<HEADLINE> 40 Feared Dead in Worst-Ever Floods in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 villagers are feared
to have drowned in the worst-ever floods in eastern Kenya,
the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonal Kafuloni River, located in Kilifi District, burst
its banks and flooded a village in Jilore on Saturday night,
sweeping away dozens of sleeping villagers and their head of
cattle, sheep and goats, a local officer said.
</P>
<P>
"It happened so fast that within minutes, the people found
themselves surrounded by water," the officer was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven villagers managed to climb trees to escape the
floods, but one of the trees they climbed gave in to the floods
and toppled over, leaving three of them drowned.
</P>
<P>
The area has been cut off by floods which have made roads
impassable, making the efforts to reach the area fruitless.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenya News Agency, an estimated 700 families
in Kilifi Town have been left homeless and property worth
millions of Shillings destroyed when their houses were washed out
by the floods caused by heavy rains over the past three days.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Use Highly Electrified Border Fence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The electrified fence on South
Africa's northern and eastern borders could soon be switched back
to "lethal mode" in a bid to stop illegal immigrants and other
cross-border violations.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Joe Modise said increasing the voltage of the
electrified fence would have to be considered if the borders with
Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique continued to be crossed
illegally.
</P>
<P>
The electrified fence, built in the apartheid era in 1986 as a
means of securing the border against the then African National
Congress and Pan Africanist Congress members, has been at
"non-lethal detection mode" since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The threat we are facing is not a military one at this stage,
but an internal crime threat which is threatening to destabilize
the country," said Modise after being briefed on the border
situation by top military officers.
</P>
<P>
Increasing crime was a definite deterrent to foreign
investment, which the country very much needed, said Modise.
</P>
<P>
Between 2.5 to five million illegal immigrants are currently
living in South Africa, posing a serious threat to stability of
the country, said government officials.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- United States peace envoy Bill
Richardson arrived in northern Botswana's Kasane city today for
talks with visiting African leaders on the crisis in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association said Richardson was
expected to hold closed-door talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, a heavy-weight that could exert influence on Zaire's
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was also expected to join
Richardson and Museveni for talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Richardson met Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila
in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city, in a bid to avoid
rebels' military takeover of capital Kinshasa, the last
stronghold still controlled by the government troops of President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
His mission was to avoid "bloodshed and chaos", said the U.S.
envoy.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Museveni, Mugabe and possibly
Richardson would leave Botswana later today heading for Cape
Town, South Africa for further talks with South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, mediator of the Zairean crisis.

<HEADLINE> 600 Rebels Killed in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) have been killed in Kasese District, western
Uganda since last November, a senior officer said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Peter Kerim, the Commander of the Second Division, added
that his troops lost 70 men in the same period in their fightings
against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties on the government troops occurred
on the first days of the invasion of the Zaire-based ADF
rebels into western Uganda in mid-November last year, ''the
Crusader'' today quoted Kerim as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commander put the number of the remnants of the ADF at less
than 500.
</P>
<P>
The ADF had over 1,200 members when it invaded into
western Uganda last November, and many of them have been killed,
captured or escaped. But it abducted some zaireans. ADF rebels
''deceived them that they would give them 500 US Dollars each and
vehicles,'' the commander said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said some defeated Zairean government soldiers
joined ADF rebels with their arms and amunitions.
</P>
<P>
Kerim said 13 of the 14 ADF rebels who surrendered last month
to the Ugandan army were Zaireans. ''I think we shall hand those
ones to the Red Cross,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Down in April, but Remains Post-war High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The unemployed in Germany fell to 4.36
million in April, or 11.3 percent of the labor force, down from
the 11.7 percent in March for seasonal reasons, said the Federal
Labour Office in Nuremberg today.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which remains the postwar record high for the
month, runs 379,800 higher than that in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Office chief Bernhard Jagoda attributed the monthly drop in
unemployment to seasonal factors that revived such job areas as
construction, transportation, farming and forestry.
</P>
<P>
He described economic impulses as "too weak to produce a
turn-around on the job market."

<HEADLINE> 90 Cattle Rustlers Killed in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- About 90 armed cattle rustlers were
killed or drowned during a two-day battle with Kenyan security
forces in Marakwet District, northern Kenya, the Daily Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Marakwet District Commissioner Mohamed Rashid
as saying yesterday that the fighting started on Thursday
afternoon after more than 100 armed raiders surrounded the
General Service Unit (GSU) camp near Chesegon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the raiders were repulsed by a combined force of
50 GSU personnel, regular and administrative policemen.
</P>
<P>
The raiders, the commissioner said, were cornered after all
escape routes were sealed by the security forces, leaving the swollen
and fast-flowing Kerio River as the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
Most of the raiders fell into the river when the security
force personel were fired at them, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, there were no casualties on the side of
the security force.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Jackson Kalweo, Minister in charge of
Internal Security and Provincial Administration, said that he was
concerned about the insecurity in the area and the government had
posted more security personnel there.
</P>
<P>
The Eldoret Catholic Bishop Carnelius Korir warned that the
fighting would revive the ethnic violence of 1992 when the first
multi-party general election was held unless urgent steps were
taken to contain the situation.

<HEADLINE> Salim Urges Better Image for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Africa must endeavor to erase its
image as a continent of conflicts, Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first summit of African first ladies on peace,
held in Nigeria's capital of Abuja, Salim said it was difficult
for the continent to forge ahead with confidence towards a new
millennium with so many wars and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continent has no other alternative for growth
but to assume its own responsibility in facing the challenges of
peace in the broadest term.
</P>
<P>
The continent must find solutions for its six million refugees
and 20 million displaced persons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim emphasized that the search for peace and stability on the
continent must be guided by struggles for democracy, economic
emancipation, development and security.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the roles of African leaders in managing
and resolving armed conflicts in Africa, the secretary general
enjoined them to rely on "indigenous African peacemaking
capabilities principally", supported by the international
community.

-- As a gesture to the European Union, the new British
government of Tony Blair has confirmed its will to sign the

JERUSALEM -- Israel, Turkey and the United States have
finalized their plan to hold a joint, three-way naval exercises in
the Mediterranean most likely this summer, according to Jerusalem
Post.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Israeli Defense Ministry stressed that the
joint maneuvers will be "of a humanitarian nature and focus on
search-and-rescue scenario," dismissing reports that they were
aimed at Iran and Syria, the alleged long-time foes of Israel.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The yawning trade deficit of Egypt has soared by 10.1
percent to 5.48 billion U.S. dollars on the previous year due to a
faster growth in imports over exports.
</P>
<P>
An increase in exports by 8 percent to 2.279 billion dollars
was dwarfed by a 9.5 percent growth in imports to record 7.767
billion dollars, the latest report of the Central Bank of Egypt on
the national economy for the first six months of 1996-97 fiscal
year starting July showed.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today that China
and Zambia should further consolidate and develop their
traditional friendly cooperation under the new world situation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should probe new ways of expanding trade and
economic cooperation which should be based on equality and mutual
benefit, Li Peng said, adding that such a cooperation would be
conducive to common development.
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA -- A total of 114 Sudanese prisoners of war (POWs) have
been transferred to Uganda's capital Kampala, waiting for ruling,
a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, state minister for defense, was quoted by
Tuesday's newspaper the New Vision as saying that Uganda is
planning to exchange Sudanese POWs for captured Ugandan soldiers
and officers.
</P>
<P>
WELLINGTON -- New Zealand has been portrayed as one of the
countries which is "awash with guns," local press reports said
Tuesday. A U.N. study, to be released in Vienna today, shows that
NZ has the third highest rate of gun ownership, with 309 guns for
every 1,000 people, only after the United States and Finland.
</P>
<P>
BUCHAREST -- Italy firmly supports Romania's bids to be among
the first countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), and to join the European Union (EU) as soon as possible,
visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Prodi, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
told a news conference that Romania and Italy would cooperate in
fighting organized transnational crime. Romania was very
interested in Italy's experience in this field.
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK -- The Defense Ministry of Thailand is expected to
strike a deal with the United States soon, in which Thailand will
use its satellite orbital slots to exchange for the use of six
transponders on a US satellite.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, the Thai military will spend only 15
billion baht (600 million US dollars) for leasing capacity and the
purchase of ground station facilities, much less than the 28
billion baht (1.12 billion dollars) the Thai Defense Ministry
initially planned to spend on two military satellites under a
"star of Siam" project.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. State Department said on Monday that
U.S. envoy Bill Richardson is in central Africa trying his best to
secure a ceasefire between the Zairian government and rebel forces
while some other U.S. officials said the rebels led by Laurent
Kabila might take over Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, in one or
two days.

CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks here this morning with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati and his accompanying team on enhancing Islamic
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Velayati has said earlier that he will hand over a message to
Mubarak from Iranian President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani, which
invites the Egyptian president to attend the 8th Islamic Summit
due in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who met Velayati Monday,
was also present at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Velayati, upon arrival at the airport on his
first visit to Egypt in three years, said that the Tehran-Cairo
relations were "progressing continuously in the past," but
"diversification of points of views and relations of the two
sides" have lead to "multiple difficulties." But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that intensified contacts between the
two sides can help create positive and more appropriate conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed Egypt's influence on the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran broke diplomatic ties after the Islamic
revolution in Iran in 1979, although they opened interests
sections in each other's country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has accused Tehran of stirring up trouble in Egypt,
where Muslim militants have been waging a violent campaign
attempting to overthrow the secular government.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Input Yearly in Poverty Alleviation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has decided
to increase the annual input to help rural poor people become
more prosperous, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng told the 25th Session of the
Standing Committee that starting from this year, the central
government will add 1.5 billion yuan every year to the national
drive to help people in the poorest provinces and regions improve
agricultural construction, build rural roads, get clean drink
water, and train farmers with advanced techniques.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government will also increase another three
billion yuan in loans for farmers each year to support
high-efficiency farming, animal raising, and processing projects
that can bring more people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In his report on poverty relief, Chen called on local
governments to increase input to poverty alleviation by 30 to 50
percent of the central government's total in accordance with the
economic development and financial status of the respective
areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese government has gradually increased its
input for poverty relief and launched a nationwide campaign to
reduce the number of people who suffer from poverty in the past
two decades when poverty has worsened globally and the number of
poor people in the world have gone up by 25 million each
year.

<P>
According to the State Councilor, the number of people who do
not have enough food and clothes in China's vast countryside had
been reduced from 250 million in 1978 to 58 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has shifted from simple relief to poverty alleviation
through development in the past years, he said, adding that farmers
in the poor areas are encouraged to get out of poverty by their
own efforts, along with the help from the State in exploiting
local natural resources, and starting commodity production, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future of China's poverty alleviation, Chen
said it will be harder for China's poverty elimination although
great achievements have been made as 50 percent of the people
under poverty line live in extreme poverty and lack the basic
living and productive conditions. Many of them live in harsh
mountainous areas in northwest and southwest China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said China has more than 20 million people
whose income is very low and are likely to go back to poverty
whenever natural disaster or accident occurs.
</P>
<P>
He said China has to help 12 million to 14 million people out
of poverty each year in the next four years to achieve its goal to
eliminate poverty by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China has been active in international cooperation
and exchanges to eliminate poverty in past years. Several poverty
alleviation projects with loans totaling 550 million US dollars by
the World Bank have been, or will be, put into operation in
southwest, northwest, and west China.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Work for Stable Oil Prices: Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would do its best to
keep oil prices in the world market at their current levels or
even to see them go up, Kuwait's Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazidi
said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with official Kuwait News Agency in Manama,
Bahrain, the minister said "we would like to maintain these
prices," adding that oil prices had reached their highest in
several years since last summer until the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said no one could project what prices would be like in the
future as there were "certain circumstances and factors what we
do not control," but Kuwait would play its role to keep the
prices stable.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a question whether Kuwait
would request a hike in its current quota of 2 million barrels
per day during the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) meeting to be held soon.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait exports 3 percent of world combined oil exports and
has a current oil production capacity of 2.4 million barrels per
day. It has decided to raise the oil production capacity to
3 million barrels per day by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi stated in April that Kuwait would remain committed
to its output quota of 2 million barrels per day allocated
by the 11-nation OPEC.
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC produces about 27 million barrels of oil a day
while its official daily ceiling is 25.03 million barrels
because some members are exceeding their quotas in a way that
hurts the interests of OPEC and the members which hold to their
quota, Al-Mazidi said.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices in the international market have fallen from
24 U.S. dollars a barrel at the start of this year to below 18
dollars this month because of an increase in crude oil output by
non-OPEC states, quota busting by some OPEC countries, weaker
international oil demand, higher Iraqi flows and increased
reserves, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi expressed belief that "oil prices would go up"
again.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said Kuwait Oil Company, the production arm
of the state-owned conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
would carry out an operation to drill 649 new oil wells within
the government's four-year program.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi is on a visit to Bahrain to launch the new units in
the steel industry of the Gulf Industrial Investment Company
owned by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

<HEADLINE> New Textbooks Draw Widely Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 education workers
recently attended a seminar here to discuss reforms for teaching
materials in primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
"Compiling new textbooks is an important part of China's
education reforms," said delegates, adding that some contents
which have lost currency in modern society might well be left out,
while new information might be added.
</P>
<P>
China began to rewrite textbooks of Chinese, English, and math
in 1993, under the guidance of the principles of ability training
and intellectual resources development.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) reported that the number
of primary schools which use the new kind teaching materials
increased from the initial ten to the present 66 in 12 provinces
and cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey indicated that teachers, students, and parents mostly
were satisfied with the newly-finished textbooks, which teach
Chinese, English, and math in an easily-understood way.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, vice-minister of the SEC, said that the pioneering
work in textbook compilation will greatly benefit China's
education reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Calm has returned to Mozambique's
central port city of Beira today following an unauthorized "peace
demonstration" which led to clashes between protesters and police
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four protesters were injured while 14 others were arrested by
the police during the demonstration, organized by the largest
opposition party, National Resistance of Mozambique (RENAMO)
protesting against rise of living expenses and government
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's Police of Rapid Intervention started to fire tear
gas, plastic bullets and clubs as demonstrators were trying to
install road obstacles in a bid to paralyse the city's transport
system and daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the restoration of stability in Beira,
capital city of the central Sofala Province, the provincial
government issued a statement warning citizens against putting up
any acts that is anti-government or tries to sabotage public
order.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, similar demonstration was
also held in Quelimane, capital of the northern Zambezia
Province, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
A RENAMO spokesman said they will continue to stage further
"peace protests" until their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Local elections are scheduled to be held in November this
year, and RENAMO has been urging an expansion of polling stations
to areas where the opposition is more influential, a demand
over-ruled by the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party
(FRELIMO).

<HEADLINE> Colombian Head Urges to Ensure Habitat in Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian President
Ernesto Samper has urged the developing countries to join hands
in efforts to ensure the Nairobi-based U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) remains in the third world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environment Program and the Habitat are the only U.N.
agencies with headquarters in the developing world, hence "must
be maintained and sufficient finance ensured," said Samper, also
the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
"The center must be defended at all costs," he claimed
following meeting with delegates attending the 16th Session of
the U.N. Commission on Human Settlements on Monday. The session
started on April 28 and will end tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference should focus on seeking ways on which
the center could best survive in the changing economic world and
on finding solutions to social problems facing the U.N. bodies.
</P>
<P>
Samper stressed any change in the 58-member commission should
not be translated into budget reduction for social programs.
</P>
<P>
"This is like killing the patient to cure an infected arm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. funds for women, education, housing and other social
programs are cut drastically while budgets for peace-keeping
operations have multiplied, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts and confrontations could be solved with increased
social investments. This is much more profitable than preventing
it through military operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on governments to put in place proper
measures to protect the shelter right of the poor both in the
rural and urban areas from unjust land policies and misuse of
public land by private developers.
</P>
<P>
Samper left here Monday after ending his three-day visit to
the eastern African country. enditem

<P>
TOKYO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A 12-car Shinkansen bullet train
overran a sidetrack through a bumper and crossed a road early
today in Okayama, western Japan, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of injuries and only the front

Co. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 2:05 a.m. local time while the train
operator was switching to the sidetrack at 25 kilometers per

breaks, the train crashed through a metal fence and derailed
before smashing into a telephone pole 150 meters from the track's
end point, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The crash caused a power outage at a nearby operations center,
but power was restored soon, causing no delay in Shinkansen
operations, the report added.

enterprises with annual export volume totalling 10 million US
dollars, can set up their subsidiaries in Pudong.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Check Import of Sub-Standard Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is scheduled
to tighten its surveillance mechanisms to lock sub-standard
imports out of the local market.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily Nation today quoted Minister for
Commerce and industry Joshua Angatia as saying that some
businessmen had taken advantage of trade liberalization to import
cheap and sub-standard goods.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister, opening "Project Africa '97" exhibition
in Nairobi on Tuesday, criticized the unfair trade practices of
some western countries such as export subsidies and imposition of
quotas which he said continued to blur the benefits of
liberalization to many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya will continue to pursue trade and economic engagements
that will not cause undue harm to local manufacturers in the face
of this scenario," the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kenya would link up with quality inspection bodies in other
countries to ascertain quality products destined to Kenya and
reject sub-standard goods at source, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We shall also not hesitate to impose some duty on any
subsidized products to protect our domestic industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's industrial target by the year 2000 could only be
achieved if the country guarded against being turned into a
dumping ground, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Discusses Election of New Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislature today
began to examine proposals concerning the number of deputies to be
elected to the Ninth National People's Congress, and related
election methods.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were submitted to the 25th meeting of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposals involve the number of deputies from minority ethnic
groups, the election method for deputies from Taiwan Province,
and the number of deputies at the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the stipulation that deputies from minority
ethnic groups should account for about 12 percent of all deputies
across the country, 360 deputies should be elected from China's 55
minority ethnic groups, said Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC
Standing Committee while explaining the proposals at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xinjiang where there
are more ethnic groups but fewer people, there will be a total of
35 additional deputies in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 35 minority ethnic groups which has a small
population will have one deputy, to ensure that every minority
ethnic group has at least one deputy, Cao Zhi said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Taiwan deputies will be elected through consultations
among representatives chosen from more than 33,000 Taiwanese
compatriots in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
It is decided that 120 such representatives will attend the
consultations, which will be held for seven days in Beijing in
next January.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with related election law, the NPC Standing
Committee will give the concrete number of deputies elected to
provincial people's congresses. Because of the lack of detailed
restrictions, the number of deputies to provincial people's
congresses is too big in some places, Cao Zhi said.
</P>
<P>
To limit the number of deputies will better embody the
implementation of the principle of openness and fairness and help
improve the quality of deputies and work efficiency of state power
bodies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Discovery Turns Out to Be Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- It has been claimed as the gold find
of the century. Now it is likely to go down in history as the
biggest mining fraud of all time.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Calgary-based Bre-X Mineral Ltd. has acknowledged
publicly that its much-touted Busang gold discovery in the
Indonesian jungle may hold no gold at all.
</P>
<P>
"We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others
that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be
there," Bre-X President David Walsh said in a brief statement
published today in Canadian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The statement came along with the release of an independent
audit report late Sunday, which concluded that the Busang project
holds no mineable gold and has been the product of a massive
campaign of deceit and fakery.
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we
believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values
at Busang is of a scale and over a period of time and with a
precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the
history of mining anywhere in the world," the report stated.
</P>
<P>
Samples from the property on the Indonesian island of Borneo
contain only "trace amounts of gold," with no samples producing
"gold values of economic interest," said the report, which was
done by Strathcona Minerals, a Toronto-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
Today's report vindicated Free-port McMoRan Copper &AMP; Gold Inc.,
Bre-X's U.S. partner, which announced on March 26 that it had
found only "insignificant" amount of gold at the Busang gold
project.
</P>
<P>
Freeport's announcement sent Bre-X shares skidding to 2.5
Canadian dollars from around 15 in panic sell-off and prompted
Bre-X to hire Strathcona to conduct an independent audit.
</P>
<P>
Trading on Bre-X stocks was halted today at the Toronto,
Alberta, Montreal and Nasdaq stock markets. The stock closed
Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 3.23 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Bre-X has been a household name of Canada. As the
onetime penny stock soared as high as 284.5 dollars last
September, thousands of small Canadian investors were lured by
stories of instant riches into the market and leveraged heavily to
buy the Bre-X stock.
</P>
<P>
To add to the glory of the fairy tale, Bre-X company claimed as
late as February this year that its Busang deposit is the richest
find of the century, holding 71 million ounces of gold, worth
about 18 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yet today, as the myth turned out to be a fraud, hundreds of
Canadian investors found their life savings wiped out altogether
and some are about to lose their homes.
</P>
<P>
Canadian investors felt bitter and betrayed. They want to know
how such a massive fraud could have happened, and how the salting
of samples could go on for so long without anyone sensing
something was going wrong.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have responsibility here," said one angry
Edmonton investor.
</P>
<P>
The mining industry and financial institutions were left
reeling, not knowing what has really happened and how to cope with
this disastrous scenario.
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of things that went wrong here," said a
Canadian mining expert here.
</P>
<P>
"The whole Bre-X situation has already taken a toll on junior
mining stocks, but now the effect will be devastating," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Canadian stock exchanges today, some junior mining
companies, particularly those exploring gold in Indonesia, lost
more than a third of their value.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it's a black eye for the Canadian industry," added a
mining analyst from Vancouver, where junior mining stocks are
heavily listed on the local stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the Bre-X fiasco could be widespread and
lasting long.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed today that its
commercial crime unit is studying the Strathcona report and will
then decide "what direction to take."
</P>
<P>
Freeport, the New Orleans-based Bre-X partner, announced that
it has withdrawn from the now worthless Busang gold project.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian partner, Nusamba, is also pulling out.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Indonesian government is reported to say that
it will prosecute those responsible for the unprecedented
multinational scam.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Teaching of Arabic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- As ties between China and Arab
countries become are becoming increasingly closer, teaching Arabic
has become a focal point in Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
At least seven Chinese universities, including the prestigious
Beijing University, have opened Arabic courses and given academic
degrees to students, sources with the State Education Commission
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic speciality has produced some 3,000 graduates in the
past 50 years, many now with diplomatic careers.
</P>
<P>
Universities are now serving as major think tanks for the
government by creating a number of institutes engaged in the study
of Islamic culture, the Arabic economy and Middle East strategic
issues, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Koran, Muslim's holy book, was translated into Chinese by a
professor from Beijing University in 1981. So far, 100,000 copies
of the book have been sold and the version has become the most
influential Chinese translation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The teaching of Arabic and the research into Islam culture are
aided by Arab countries. For examples, the United Arab Emirates
poured 1.3 million US dollars in 1995 to build a modern teaching
building in the Beijing Foreign Languages University, and Saudi
Arabia set up a language laboratory in the Beijing University in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, China has sent students to learn Arabic in
Arab countries. It also receives young Arabians who want to learn
Chinese. Many of the Arabian students have become Chinese
insiders; the current Palestine ambassador to China got his
doctorate from the International Politics Department of Beijing
University.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Haikou Airport in south China's
island province of Hainan handled over 2.96 million passengers in
1996, making the airport the eighth busiest one in China.
</P>
<P>
By now, Haikou Airport has been cited by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) as one of the ten busiest airports
of the country for the fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the passenger and cargo flow and the number of landing
and take-off respectively rose by 5.5, 17.6, and 9 percent in the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Hainan provincial authorities attribute the boom to the
constant expansion of the airport and greater numbers of tourists
and investors flocking to this new province which is also China's
largest special economic zone.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu-Hassan Meeting Canceled Due to Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan for today has been canceled due to a water dispute,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came after Israel released Monday details
about the Netanyahu-Hassan meeting which was supposed to be held
in the border area of Naharayim in northern Jordan Valley, where
seven Israeli schoolgirls were killed by a Jordanian soldier on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the released schedule, the two leaders were to
attend a memorial ceremony for the victims before holding
diplomatic discussions on bilateral ties and current situation in
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, a Jordanian official said late Monday that the crown
prince would not attend the ceremony and meet with Netanyahu,
adding that a low-level Jordanian would take part instead.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dedication of a hill of flowers in memory of
the girls by their families, Jordan and Israel are expected to
announce the establishment of a joint peace park to be built in
Naharayim, known as the Island of Peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan
and new Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Oded Eran as saying that it
was the dispute on sharing water from the Jordan River that led to
cancellation of the Netanyahu-Hassan meeting.
</P>
<P>
Eran said that there was disenchantment in Jordan over the
three-year-old Israeli-Jordanian peace accord and expectations of
"more tangible" economic results from the peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli-Jordanian peace must develop in order to
show the public and the Arab world that it pays to have ties with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I think that unless all people in the region, both Israel and
the Arab side, see the fruits of peace which will increase
security and prosperity, it is difficult to continue the peace
process. We must have support not only from the government, but
also from the people," Eran said.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute indicated the increasingly tension between
Israel and the Arab world at a time when the peace process is
deadlocked. Jordan, which is the second Arab country to make peace
with Israel, is regarded as Israel's best friend among the
increasingly hostile Arab world.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan always complains about the lack of economic
dividends from the peace with Israel. The Naharayim tragedy
further soured bilateral ties, despite Jordanian King Hussein
paid a high-profile condolence visit to Israel days later and
held another summit with Netanyahu last month in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Substandard Products Being Dumped in Bangladesh: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has imported a number of
products which are substandard or not allowed to be sold on
domestic markets of the exporting countries, revealed a study on
the impact of the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement on this country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The report, formulated by a four-member expert team led by
former director of the World Trade Organization Vinod Rege, quoted
local industries to have attributed such imports to liberalization
and relaxation of controls.
</P>
<P>
The industries which are particularly affected by such imports
that are either dumped or substandard include detergents,
ceramics, glass, bicycle and electrical products, said the report
submitted recently to the government.
</P>
<P>
Not mentioning the names of the exporting countries, the report
said many of these products are exported by developing countries
in the region, they are able to sell such products at cheap rates
either because their cost is low, getting subsidies or dumping the
goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved the third annual loan of about 14 million
U.S. dollars under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) to back Sierra Leone's 1997 economic program.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, which saw five years of conflict between the
Revolutionary United Front and successive governments from
1991-1996, has undertaken macro-economic and structural reforms to
hasten post-conflict economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 program, real GDP growth is targeted for about
10 percent and the rate of inflation is to be contained at 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country joined the IMF in September 1962. Its quota is
about 105 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of
IMF financing currently has totaled some 163 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved an augmented second annual loan for Sierra
Leone under the ESAF, raising the total three-year ESAF loan to
about 139 million dollars from the original about 121 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is IMF's concessional facility for assisting
developing countries that are undertaking economic reform
programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Electoral Commission has
restructured the electoral process for the coming general
elections in a bid to eliminate double registration errors and
speed up the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Justice Zaccheaus Chesoni was quoted as
saying on Tuesday that the voter register would be computerized
and the registration forms scan-read to guard against double
registration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of registration centers would double
from 6,000 to 12,500 throughout the country and the names of the
centers would be published this week.
</P>
<P>
Chesoni noted that three clerks would be posted to
registration centers and not five as used in the last election.
</P>
<P>
In a consultative meeting held yesterday between the
commission and eight registered political parties, he said that
voter registers would be available to various political parties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, he told local reporters that "in view of
the fact that not every Kenyan has the second generation identity
card, old cards should be considered valid."
</P>
<P>
Asked when the registration would begin, he said, "we are soon
fixing the date and we shall make an official announcement."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of the Kenya
National Congress, the Social Democratic Party, the Kenya
Social Congress, the Kenya National Democratic Alliance,
FORD-Kenya, FORD-Asili, Party of Independent Candidates of
Kenya and the Labour Party Democracy.

BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand told Myanmar Monday that it
would continue to build an embankment along the Moei River, which
forms the border between the two countries, according to a report
today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said the construction does not encroach on Myanmar
territory. It was the second time Thailand responded to Myanmar's
protests about construction along the river.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted Suvit Maenmoen, Chairman of Thailand's
local Thai-Myanmar border committee, as saying that the embankment
aimed to prevent riverbank erosion which could damage houses and
government offices.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar said that the concrete embankment will destroy a new
island in the Moei River, which was formed after a channel was dug
in the waterway.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's Myawaddy Province sent a letter of protest to Thai
authorities last week, and another letter on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Turkey, US Plan Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel, Turkey and the United
States have finalized their plan to hold a joint, three-way naval
exercises in the Mediterranean most likely this summer, according
to today's Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The plan was finalized by officers from the Israeli Army,
Turkey and the U.S. at a meeting in Tel Aviv early this week in a
series of strategic dialog between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Israeli Defense Ministry stressed that the
joint maneuvers will be "of a humanitarian nature and focus on
search-and-rescue scenario," dismissing reports that they were
aimed at Iran and Syria, the alleged long-time foes of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation attending the strategic dialog, headed
by Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff Chevik Bir, consisted of 23
military officers, including intelligence officers, arrived here
at the beginning of this week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, second of this kind between the two countries,
reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and, for the first time,
a possible reference to threats from Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Last November, an Israeli delegation led by David Ivry,
special adviser to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, went to
Turkey for the first session of the dialog.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who initiated the joint exercises, told the Turkish
officers that he has no doubt that the cooperation will
strengthen the stability of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wants to increase and deepen the links, so that
the defense establishments of Israel and Turkey can be aided by
each other's experience.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Turkish army leader told Mordechai that
Turkey wants to promote and widen the strategic cooperation, and
that he looks forward to the naval exercises, adding they are
open to any other nations that wanted to participate.
</P>
<P>
Bir's visit came after a series of visits to the Jewish state
by senior Turkish officials in the last few weeks, including
tours by Turkish Chief of Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi and
Defense Minister Turhan Tayan, as the military cooperation
between the two countries is developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently upgrading 54 F-4 fighters for the Turkish
Air Force in a deal worth over 600 million U.S. dollars. And both
sides are discussing the possibility of another deal to upgrade
Turkey's F-5 fighters in a deal worth over 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also reportedly competing with other countries for
a deal to upgrade Turkey's M-60 tanks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company Recommends Using Headsets to Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli mobile phone company
Cellcom is advising its clients to use headsets so to avoid the
suspected health damage from cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
Cellcom spokesman Ilan Bachar said that his company was
closely following scientific research on cellular phones around
the world. But there have been differences of opinion among the
scientific community over the potential health risks from using
cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, research studies have shown no danger to
health. However, if anyone is still concerned about alleged
health risks, they can distance themselves from the phone by
using a personal speaker system," Bachar said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended two personal speaker systems, one for Eriksson
Models and another for Nokia models, which will cost separately
about 76 U.S. dollars and 99 U.S. dollars. Such systems allow
the phone use while keeping it in one's pocket or bag.
</P>
<P>
Bachar was commenting on media report about what some experts
called "the first serious piece of lab research" to link
electronmagnetic radiation from cellular phones with cancer in
mice.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was conducted by Dr. Michael Repacholi at
the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia and published in
Radiation Research, found that exposure to functioning cellular
phones doubled the risk of lymphatic cancer in mice.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian government issued a statement to allay
fears of a link between cancer and cellular phone use. "Based on
current knowledge, any risk attached to their use is minimal
compared with the everyday risks faced from, for example,
sunlight (meaning skin cancer) or driving our cars," a
government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the report caused great concern in cellular phone
companies and impelled Health Ministry officials to call health
authorities in Australia, Britain and the United States for more
details.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 1 million cellular phone users
among Israel's 5.7 million population, who spent far more time
than others in foreign countries in talking to the mobile
phones.

DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh had earned 964.48 million
U.S. dollars during the first nine months of the 1996-97 fiscal
year beginning from last July through remittances of its nationals
working abroad.
</P>
<P>
The remittances were 764.50 million dollars in the

according to sources close to the Ministry of Labor and Manpower.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,70,827 Bangladeshi nationals went abroad with

1,31,179 in the corresponding period of 1995-96. The increase of
employment abroad was by 29.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export of manpower in 1996-97 included skilled, semiskilled
and unskilled people. The largest number of Bangladeshi nationals
were employed in Saudi Arabia while Malaysia employed the second
largest number.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, initiatives have been taken both in the government
and in the private sector of finding out new opportunities for
employment of Bangladesh nationals in view of the decreasing
demands for employment in the Middle East countries, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The countries, where there are prospects of Bangladeshi
nationals for employment are South Korea, Brunei, Russia, Algeria,
Sweden and Guyana, the sources added.

<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The yawning trade deficit of Egypt has
soared by 10.1 percent to 5.48 billion U.S. dollars on the
previous year due to a faster growth in imports over exports.
</P>
<P>
An increase in exports by 8 percent to 2.279 billion dollars
was dwarfed by a 9.5 percent growth in imports to record 7.767
billion dollars, the latest report of the Central Bank of Egypt on
the national economy for the first six months of 1996-97 fiscal
year starting July showed.
</P>
<P>
Europe continues to be the leading buyer of Egyptian products
with an estimated import bill of 841 million dollars, up from 818
million dollars a year earlier, followed by the U.S., Africa and
Asia as a block, and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Eastern Europe declined by 20.9 percent to 129
million dollars, while exports to Russia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States declined by 21.2 percent to 33 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the increase in exports came from about 25 percent jump
in oil exports from 1 million to 1.3 million dollars on higher
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports accounted for 56.7 percent of total exports up from
48.9 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Among other commodities, cotton yarn exports declined by 26
percent from 119 million to 88 million dollars, while raw cotton
exports came down by 13 percent from 23 million to 20 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Potato exports were down by one million to 5 million
dollars. Citrus exports were flat, while rice exports jumped by

Services surplus rose by 26.4 percent to 3.739 billion dollars

<HEADLINE> Rare Monkeys Survive in Artificial Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Three snub-nosed monkeys have been born
and lived in the Beijing breeding center for endangered animals
since the beginning of this year, bringing the total of number of
such monkeys in the center to 33.
</P>
<P>
The monkeys are all Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys, one of the
rarest of endangered species that originally lived in the
southwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The center, which specializes in the rescue and protection of
endangered rare animals, has brought 11 Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys
from Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces for artificial breeding since
1987. The group of 11 has since expanded to 22.
</P>
<P>
Among the 22, two were the grandchildren of those coming from
wild environment, showing that snub-nosed monkeys born in an
artificial environment have the ability to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
The survival rate of snub-nosed monkeys is usually extremely
low in an artificial environment. And experts say the survival of
the 22 Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys makes the center the first to
succeed in moving the monkeys from its original habitat.
</P>
<P>
The technique is an emergency measure to save highly endangered
wild animals from extinction, zoologist Qi Hanjun of the center
said, adding that the center is now raising one third of the total
number of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys living in artificial
environment in China.
</P>
<P>
China has three types of snub-nosed monkeys: the Sichuan, the
Yunnan, and the Guizhou.

<P>
Brigadier General Abdulali Pourshasb replaced Dadbin and became
acting commander of the Ground Forces, the paper said without
giving any reason.
</P>
<P>
This is second removal of the top brass in Iran within three
months. On February 15, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
removed Reza Seifollahi from the commander of the Security
Forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the report didn't give any background about the new
acting commander of the Ground Forces. It said that Pourshasb was
appointed the new acting commander in a ceremony Monday in
the presence of General Ali Shahbazi, the Chief of Staff of the
Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi said that General Pourshasb had a bright background
in different operational, training and administrative fields
especially during the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Pourshasb who is a religious and an experienced officer
possesses a great capacity and a remarkable commitment in
undertaking his duties," Shahbazi added.
</P>
<P>
He said that one unique characteristic of General Pourshasb's
was his full-fledged obedience of Velayate Faqih (religious
supreme jurisprudence) held by Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, outgoing Commander Dadbin and his deputy were
appointed as advisers to Gen. Shahbazi, who appreciated the
services rendered by General Dadbin during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the removal of Dadbin is part of the
major reshuffle by Khamenei in a bid to further consolidate his
position as the supreme leader in the country.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Khamenei hinted in his Friday prayer sermon
that he would remove those who were not qualified in the
country. In other words, he would remove those who have any
doubt about Velayate Faqih.
</P>
<P>
There has been a controversial debate on the issue of Velayate
Faqih held Khamenei in the Iranian society, including the
army.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party holds Council Amidst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami (people's)
League (AL) will open its two-day National Council here this
afternoon while the opposition enforced a dawn-to-dusk strike in
the second largest city of Chittagong and its adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and AL President Sheikh Hasina is expected to
inaugurate the 15th triennial council of the party being held
since its inception in 1949, the first of its kind since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, whose party won the last June general polls, is
expected to be re-elected party chief as there is no aspirant for
the post in the council, to be participated by about 6,000
councilors and party delegates.
</P>
<P>
However, there is likely to be a new general secretary from
non-minister leaders of the party, party sources indicated, adding
that the present General Secretary Zillur Rahman, who is also the
Local Government Minister, are overburdened with the affairs of
the state.
</P>

Meanwhile, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
launched a strike in the southern Chittagong division to protest
the ruling party's "terrorism" and its other "anti-people"
activities.
</P>
<P>
It was the second strike program called by the central BNP
against the 11-month-old AL government. The party, led by former
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, enforced a nationwide half-day strike
on March 23 protesting the government's policies in various
fields.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Finnish ski jumping head

struggling United States ski jumping team.
</P>
<P>
Ylianttila, whose athletes earned 14 medals in the Olympics or

A 1980 Olympic jumper, Ylianttila spent 12 years on
Finland's national coaching staff before resigning after the
1994 Lillehammer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
With Ylianttila as head coach, Finns won all three gold medals
at the 1998 Olympics in Calgary and bagged home four medals,
including two golds, at the 1989 World Championships in Lahti,
Finland.
</P>
<P>
No American jumpers were sent to the World Championships in

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Central Bank to Restrict Money Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's central bank will try to
restrict growth of money supply to promote sustained economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said on Monday that money supply
growth in 1997 would be restricted to no more than 25 percent,
compared with a record high of 31 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the central bank could fail to achieve the
money growth target, just as it did during 1996 when it failed to
meet a target of growth in money supply at 22 percent. Instead,
the growth reached 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the first two months of this year have
already witnessed a resurgence in money supply growth, which rose
to 36 percent in February compared to 23.9 percent the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank warned that money supply growth rates in
excess of 30 percent were not compatible with anticipated level
of economic activity this year, nor were they consistent with the
envisaged inflation target of 19 to 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Legislature to Review Laws on Supervision, Blood Donation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
convened its four-day 25th session today to examine 12 laws,
international conventions, and treaties.
</P>
<P>
The draft laws on administrative supervision and blood donation
were tabled by lawmakers after preliminary reviews and revisions.
</P>
<P>
According to today's agenda, the two draft laws will be voted
upon at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
today's opening meeting and explained the draft Law on
Administrative Supervision.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of the NPC Standing Committee expressed
different views on the name of this law in the previous two
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Some preferred the name of "the law on administrative
supervision" while others believed it is better to call it "the
Law on Supervision," he added.
</P>
<P>
After careful deliberations, the chairmen's conference of the
NPC Standing Committee decided that both names are all right, and
do not contradict with each other in principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the draft was named "the Law on Administrative
Supervision" when submitted by the State Council, the conference
suggests it be passed with this name, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cai Cheng, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee, explained
new changes made to the draft Law on Blood Donation.
</P>
<P>
To encourage citizens to take the lead in donating blood
voluntarily for the introduction of a free blood donation system,
the latest draft law stipulates that "the state encourages state
functionaries, servicemen, and students in higher education
institutions to take the lead in donating blood gratis, and to
set an example for the formation of a new social trend."

URUMQI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Traditional costumes, pottery, and
other daily goods used by local minority people in Northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are attracting domestic
and foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Traditional goods have become a major source of income for
local people. Currently, Xinjiang turns out 450 million yuan worth
of these goods a year.
</P>
<P>
Half of them are sold to visitors from other parts of the
country and overseas.

According to local officials, the manufacture of traditional
goods for Uygur and other ethnic minorities reached a low point for
some time, when the local minorities gravitated towards western
patterns in wears and wares.
</P>
<P>
But, the industry has revived thanks to the booming of tourism
sector and government assistance to local people producing these
souvenirs.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Agricultural Development
Bank (ADB), a state-owned policy-oriented bank, provides strong
backing for the farming sector, a senior bank official said here.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1994, the ADB's incremental loans
stood at more than 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion US dollars)
each year, according to Hu Chushou, deputy bank president.
</P>
<P>
The bank has set up a branch network covering all provinces,
autonomous regions, municipalities, and major cities, he said,
adding that the bank's outstanding loans had totaled nearly 631.8
billion yuan by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has played a special role in supplying funds for the
procurement of farm produce and for poverty relief, thus helping
ease the pressure on the central bank to issue more money.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the bank's outstanding loans for
procurement of farm and sideline products had amounted to 536.6
billion yuan, about 85 percent of the bank's total loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank's undue loans for poverty reduction and rural
development had reached 50.3 billion yuan by the end of last year,
according to Hu.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea output last year

increase of 5 percent compared with the figures in 1995, according
to the latest figures from the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambican Economy Recovers Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Recent years have witnessed a steady
economic growth, declining inflation rates, a stabilizing currency and
increasing commodities and investment in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
All these show that the war-torn economy of the country has
been experiencing a gradual recovery since the political
stability was procured in the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Mozambique grew at an
average rate of four percent annually during 1994-95. And in
1996, the growth rate increased to six percent, promoting the GDP
to 1.6 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate dropped to 16.6 percent last
year from the previous year's 54.9 percent, and Mozambique's
currency Meticais, which used to depreciate sharply in the
previous years, began to stabilize and even appreciate a little
from mid-last year.
</P>
<P>
The markets in Mozambique has begun to see more and more
varieties of goods and stable prices. The number of foreign
businessmen and investors in the country is also increasing.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in Mozambique was another scene just
before 1992. The national economy was severely damaged in the
16-year civil war after Mozambique won independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The war has plunged the southern African country with an area
of 800,000 square kilometers into abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
It could not produce enough food to feed its 17 million
people and about half of its financial budget depended on
donations from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, peace was finally realized in Mozambique
in 1992 and general elections were held two years later. The
Mozambican government elected has since taken a series of
measures to consolidate national unity and political stability.
</P>
<P>
Under such a favorable political climate, which has
contributed greatly to the recovery of its economy so far, some
effective measures were also adopted to reconstruct the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
As 80 percent of its population are rural residents and 40
percent of its GDP comes from the agricultural sector, the
Mozambican government listed agriculture as one of its top
priorities in its current five-year plan adopted early 1995. It
has not only increased investment to the sector, but also
raised the prices of farming produce.
</P>
<P>
Then, the agriculture-oriented policy led to a bumper harvest
in agriculture in 1996, during which the output of grain
increased by 22 percent from the previous year to 1.37 million
tons, a record high in recent eight years.

To recover its backward economy, the Mozambican government has
also speeded up its pace in attracting foreign capital, by
adopting laws on foreign investment in the country, simplifying
examination and approvement procedures of investment and cutting
down import duties and business taxes.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that foreign capital flowing into Mozambique
reached 450 million US Dollars last year, compared with a total
of 1,500 million US Dollars in the 10 years before March last year.
</P>
<P>
To devote great efforts to developing tourism is another
strategy of the government to restore its economy. In recent
years, the government has approved 48 tourism investment projects
and set short-, medium- and long-term programs for tourism
development.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors arriving in Mozambique is increasing at
a surprising speed. The country received 75,000 foreign visitors
last year, as against 7,500 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
For further development, the Mozambican government also
started the Maputo Development Corridor Program in February last
year.
</P>
<P>
The program, which needs a total of about one billion US
Dollars in investment, will upgrade links between Maputo, the
Mozambican capital, with South Africa by railway, highway and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the implementation of the program will push
industrial, agricultural and tourist development along the Maputo
Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The government has also planned to build the Beira Development
Corridor in central Mozambique and the Nacala Development
Corridor in northern Mozambique, where some big projects
producing oil, natural gas, coal, and iron and steel, among
others, will be built.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that as these programs and projects are carried
out and put into operation, the economy will gain more momentum
for its recovery and further development.
</P>
<P>
However, there also exist some factors which are hindering
Mozambique's economic development, such as 5.5-billion-US-Dollar
foreign debts, worsening public security, mismanagemen of
enterprises, low-skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
With these problems unsolved, it is hard for Mozambique to
achieve a health and sound economy.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Attacks Hanson's Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canberra, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard stepped
up his government's attack today on Independent MP Pauline Hanson,
criticizing her for her "simplistic nostrum" ideas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a national radio program, Howard said he could
understand why some people might be attracted to some of her
"simplistic nostrum" ideas in the current political and economic
climate.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Hanson for her failure to put forward a
solution to the problems facing Australia, saying he had not heard
her articulate one intelligent policy.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would continue to attack her views, especially
where they damage the national interest. During the past few
months, the prime minister has come under increasing pressure
because of his refusal to confront Hanson directly and nip the
"simplistic ideas" in the bud.
</P>
<P>
With much tougher wording, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander
Downer made it clear last week that it was crucial to "fight and
destroy" Hanson's intolerant views.
</P>
<P>
Hanson's policies of banning foreign investment and
implementing a racially discriminatory immigration policy would
"cripple Australia" in its attempt to engage in the Asian region,
he warned.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Rules Out U.S.-Central American Free Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Emilio
Alvarez Montalvan ruled out today any free trade agreement between
the United States and Central America in near future due to the
U.S. congress's disapproval.
</P>
<P>
There is enormous resistance in the Republican-controlled
U.S. congress to a free trade agreement with Central America,
Alvarez said on television.
</P>
<P>
The decision is beyond U.S. President Bill Clinton's powers
since his rivals controlled congress, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president will meet his Central American counterparts
in San Jose, capital of Costa Rica, on Thursday to discuss the
negotiation of a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Republican legislators) don't want the door to be
opened too wide," declared the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said that it is difficult for Central America to obtain
a free trade agreement with the United States because
U.S. manufacturers would be at a disadvantage with Central America
where costs, especially labor ones, are lower.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Clinton's visit to Central America, the first
one to the region since he became the U.S. president, is "of great
importance."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit Central America under special circumstances,
such as "a region completely different from the one with which the
United States had relations during the Cold War," Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
The region now has a project of integration, a new circumstance
and great potential for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Each region has its agenda; the U.S. has one agenda and
Central America has another. The challenge is how to merge the two
agendas to produce a common attitude to confront the challenges
they face," he added.

<P>
BUCHAREST, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy firmly supports Romania's
bids to be among the first countries to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), and to join the European Union (EU) as
soon as possible, visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was on his first official visit to Romania today, and the
first visit to Romania by an Italian prime minister in nearly 20
years.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Prodi, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
told a news conference that Romania and Italy would cooperate in
fighting organized transnational crime. Romania was very
interested in Italy's experience in this field.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea,
Prodi thanked the Romanian government for sending troops to take
part in the multi-national peace mission in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told Ciorbea that his government would encourage Italian
companies to invest in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said Italy was the first west European country to sign
friendship and cooperation treaty with Romania after 1989, and the
statement of partnership signed recently during Italian foreign
minister's visit defined the two countries' partnership.
</P>
<P>
Their trade volume reached 3.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
and Italy is the fourth largest contributor among foreign
investors in Romania.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Police have made special security
arrangements for the upcoming local elections in some areas of
West Nepal, where a guerrilla movement has vowed to boycott the
polls, a senior police official here said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 policemen will be mobilized in more than 2,200
polling stations in West Nepal to ensure security during the first
phase of the local elections on May 17, Deputy Inspector General
of Police Krishna Shrestha was quoted by the official daily the
Rising Nepal as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the police will deploy more than usual
personnel in polling stations in some western districts like
Rolpa, Rukum and Jarjakot, where an underground guerrilla group
launched armed struggle last year and has caused security
troubles.
</P>
<P>
A quick reaction army squad will also be deployed in every
constituency to handle uncontrollable situations while helicopters
will be put on alert in case of rescue operations and medical aid,
the police official added.
</P>
<P>
The local elections at village and municipality levels will be
conducted in two phases mainly due to the lack of security forces
available in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase elections in Central and East Nepal are
scheduled for May 26 before the elections at the district level on
June 1 across the country.
</P>
<P>
Leaderships of more than 4,000 local administration bodies
throughout the country are to be changed through the elections.

ruling Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) all
committed campaign violations.

<P>
TIRANA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Both Albanian President Sali Berisha
and Prime Minister Bashkim Fino have said political compromise was
critical to the upcoming parliamentary election when meeting a
delegation from the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Peter Scheider, head of the delegation from the Council of
Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, said the upcoming Albanian
parliamentary election is very important not only for Albania
itself, but also for the international community.
</P>
<P>
The delegation told a news conference that it was very
difficult for Albania's political parties to reach consensus over
the issue of election.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha told the delegation that
political compromise was the best choice to tide over the present
crisis, adding that he was determined to set the date for the
election as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Salvation Committee in the south was the
major blockade toward the election.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, who heads the nine-party
interim government that was formed on March 9, also told the
delegation that stability was out of the question without
political compromise.
</P>
<P>
He said proportional representation was appropriate for the
election in light of Albania's actual conditions, adding that all
parties should reach consensus over this issue.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Salvation Committee in southern Albania came
into being during a time when local governments could not
function. It will be automatically disbanded after local
governments resume power.
</P>
<P>
The delegation told Fino it would do its utmost to support the
interim government.

<P>
CARACAS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Security forces in Caracas were sent
off this morning to check out all foundries where the stolen
statue of Simon Boliver, the man revered by Venezuelans as "The
Liberator", might be melted down.
</P>
<P>
The statue, rider and horse weighing about 30 kilograms, and an
old battle flag raised during Venezuelans' war of independence
were stolen from Boliver"s birthplace.
</P>
<P>
In their search, security forces also made raids in the city
and detained about 60 people who trade in gold and bronze. They
were questioned about what they knew of the theft.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera himself ordered an
exhaustive investigation to determine whether police chiefs were
guilty of negligence since they ordered the withdrawal of
vigilance over Simon Bolivar's house in downtown Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The statue was presented to Venezuela by the United States
government 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The theft has caused concern among Venezuelans since security
authorities in Caracas look after high-ranking leaders, government
residences, political parties, the congress, cemeteries and even
bars and gaming houses.
</P>
<P>
But it didn't occur to anyone to keep a watch over the house
where things owned by the Father of Venezuela are kept.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Pledges to Demolish All Missile Silos Within 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has pledged to destroy all its
remaining missile silos within 1997, Ukrainian Defense Minister
Alexander Kuzmuk told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief, who returned from a U.S. visit three days
ago, said an extra 47 million U.S. dollars funding from Washington
would enable Ukraine to finish the job as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A member of the former Soviet Union before gaining independence
in 1991, Ukraine used to have 176 silos for storing long-range
missiles with the capabilities of carrying nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
However, to turn itself into a nuclear-free nation under a pact
with Russia and the United States, Ukraine finished removing all
of its 1,269 nuclear warheads to Russia in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the funding for the silo destruction, Ukraine
would like to get 291.7 million dollars promised by the United
States for upgrading its military forces, Kuzmuk said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian minister visited the United States from April 27
to May 2, and met with U.S. officials to discuss his country's
needs for financial assistances in the military area.

VIENNA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima
said today that NATO's efforts at eastwards expansion would not
put a "time pressure" on the European Union's neutral nations.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with his Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, Klima
told reporters that the Austrian government will present a report
on whether Austria's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) would be in the next few months or the first
quarter of 1998.

<P>
The government might start talks on the report before this
summer, the Austrian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Klima clearly expressed support for the Czech Republic's effort
to take part in the European Union (EU). It was important for the
creation of a common Europe to admit the Czech Republic to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Austria was willing to exchange experiences on its
participation in the union with the Czech Republic, Klima
said. Klaus said his country wanted to learn from the experience
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two prime ministers exchanged views on
possible influences over transit after Austria fully joins the
Schengen Accord which eases travel barriers, in October.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Palestine Question Should Back UN Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hopes the Asian seminar and non-governmental
organization (NGO) symposium on the question of Palestine being
held in Jakarta will back the U.N. peace efforts in the middle
east.
</P>
<P>
Annan's hope was voiced by Assistant Secretary-General for
Political Affairs M. Alvaro de Soto at the first day session of
the three-day symposium here Monday, officials at the seminar said
today.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the seminar and symposium were not only to promote
greater knowledge of the relevant issues involving Palestine, but
also to provide a useful forum for dialogue and mutual
understanding among the peoples in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, this meeting will also contribute to an atmosphere
supportive of the peace effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the Secretary-General said the development in
the peace process had opened major opportunities for supportive
action by the U.N., even though the organization as such was not
involved in the bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said, since 1979, the General Assembly had annually
requested the Secretary-General to ensure the organization of
seminar and NGO meetings on the Palestine issue in various
regions.
</P>
<P>
"One of the first seminars, in 1983, was held in Jakarta, and
was instrumental in publicizing the works of the U.N. in trying to
solve the Palestine question and in recommending ways to promote
cooperation in the search for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other seminars and NGO meetings for the Asian region, he said,
had been held in Sri Lanka, China, India, Malaysia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which is being attended by about 200
representatives from the host government, the United Nations as
well as representatives from diplomatic missions accredited in
Jakarta, was opened Monday by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, a number of prominent speakers,
parliamentarians and Mideast experts from Asia and other regions
will present papers on various issues surrounding the protracted
conflict, with particular emphasis on the most recent developments
in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Trade Orbital Slots for Use of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Ministry of Thailand is
expected to strike a deal with the United States soon, in which
Thailand will use its satellite orbital slots to exchange for the
use of six transponders on a US satellite.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum to the effect, signed by Lt. Gen. Aran Chomphisal,
director of the Defense Space Center, has been submitted to the US
Defense Department late last week and General Aran is waiting for
the U.S. to sign and return the papers.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, the Thai military will spend only 15
billion baht (600 million US dollars) for leasing capacity and the
purchase of ground station facilities, much less than the 28
billion baht (1.12 billion dollars) the Thai Defense Ministry
initially planned to spend on two military satellites under a
"star of Siam" project.
</P>
<P>
The deal will benefit both the Thai defense and geographical
surveys, according to Aran.
</P>
<P>
The "star of Siam" military satellite project was shelved after
it faced strong opposition last year over unclear budget
allocation and acquisition procedures, and also because of the
present government's belt-tightening policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province will
intensify cooperation with Hong Kong, and Macao as the two regions
return to the motherland, according to provincial Governor Chen
Mingyi.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao have always been important partners of
Fujian in the province's economic construction and reforms, Chen
said. Of the overseas investment that Fujian has brought in, more
than 60 percent comes from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
As China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong
this July and Macao in 1999, Fujian faces unprecedented
development opportunities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must emancipate our minds, come up with new ideas, and push
the cooperation of the three areas to a new height," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will strive to make a breakthrough in the management of
capital in Hong Kong, which is an international financial center,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The province is considering the channeling of more funds, which
have been accumulated from the development of key energy and
transportation projects, into its enterprises in Hong Kong, to
help these enterprises be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,
he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Fujian will also conduct industrial cooperation
with Hong Kong and Macao. The province will select a group of
projects, and hold fairs and seminars to lure Hong Kong and Macao
investors to set up businesses and make the industries in the
three areas complement each other.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen said, the provincial government will provide
strong leadership and favorable policies to foster Fujian's
enterprises in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province will invite noted figures from Hong Kong
and Macao to give lectures, and will send delegations to financial
institutions and enterprises in the two regions to draw on their
successful experiences.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Has First Trade Surplus with Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand had a trade surplus with
Cambodia for the first time last year, according to a trade
official in Trat province, eastern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's exports to Cambodia were estimated at
1,452.91 million baht (58 million US dollars) compared with
imports worth 1,214.08 million baht (48.5 million US dollars). The
trade surplus was 238.83 million baht (9.5 million dollars),
Thaweesak Chiwasutho, the trade official, said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus resulted from Cambodia's order banning the delivery
of logs from its soil. Logs used to be a major part of Thailand's
imports from Cambodia, Thaweesak was quoted today by local press
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Thai exports to Cambodia, (70 percent) are consumer
products followed by motorcycle parts, cars, construction
materials and electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
Most Thai imports from Cambodia, (96.49 percent) are processed
wood, followed by charcoal, rattan, coral and sea fish.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's trade surplus is forecast to increase this year
because battles have ended in Cambodia and the Cambodian people
now demand more consumer products, construction materials and fuel
oil from Thailand to rebuild their country, Thaweesak said.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Sticks to "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia will stick to the "one
China" policy, Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Pavol Hamzik
said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement during an interview with
China's Xinhua News Agency before his official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia regarded China, which was playing an increasingly
important role in the world arena, as a world power of major
importance, Hamzik said. Slovakia would further its over-all
cooperation of mutual benefit with China.
</P>
<P>
"Slovak adheres firmly to the `one China' policy, with no
official ties of any kind with Taiwan authorities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hamzik said that on the economic front, bilateral ties were now
enjoying a healthy development, with high-level contacts between
the two nations, governments and parliaments going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation was rapidly rising, with the
bilateral trade volume reaching US$120 million in 1996, a 68.5
percent increase over 1995, Hamzik said.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and China shared a traditional friendship, with no
unresolved problems between them. Slovakia treated its relations
with China as a priority objective in its foreign policy, and
regarded China as a major partner in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Hamzik left today for China. The visit, scheduled from May 7 to
11, will be the first one by a Slovakian foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> China's First Idle Equipment Market Faces Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first surplus equipment
market is now sluggish due to its inability to compete in a free
market.
</P>
<P>
The market was founded in 1992 by the Shenyang City Bureau of
the Machinery Industry. In its peak year, the market saw its
annual business volume exceed 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
As more companies set up to buy and sell idle equipment, the
market virtually went out of business in 1995, as it reduced its
staff from 22 to three.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Gongfu, an official with the City Bureau of the Machinery
Industry, said, "As a market run by the government, we used to
have the authority to set the price of equipment, leaving
customers no room to bargain. However, the bureaucratic measures
became invalid when companies, which have the right of
self-management, joined in the competition."
</P>
<P>
Currently, over 200 such companies are engaged in the brokering
surplus equipment.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang is one of the major industrial cities in Northeast
China. A survey of 449 manufacturers at the end of last year
showed that they had 3,420 sets of idle equipment, valued at 442
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Brief News About Mercosur (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are brief news
about Mercosur in Latin American countries:
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- On May 1 the Brazilian government adopted new
measures to restrict imports in order to contribute to a reduction
in the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguayan Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Perez
del Castillo and his Bolivian counterpart Jaime Apar0icio
reaffirmed April 29 in La Paz their pledge to conclude the
negotiations underway for the signing of an agreement between the
Andean Community and the Mercosur before 1998.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- On April 29 Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso said in Brasilia that "there is no foreign policy" for
Brazilians "without the Mercosur".
</P>
<P>
"We are heading towards hemispherical integration and the
strategic alliance is the Mercosur," he said.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian Minister of Finance Pedro Malan
warned that the proposal to create a single currency for the
Mercosur, put forward by his Argentine counterpart Roque
Fernandez, will require broad consensus and much time.
</P>
<P>
He said this is not an issue for tomorrow and reminded that
the European Union took whole decades to reach a consensus on that
matter.
</P>
<P>
GINEBRA -- On May 1 the World Trade Organization (WTO) examined
the Mercosur trade regime for the third time but several trade
partners expressed their concern over the lack of clarity of the
tariffs applied by the four countries of that regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
They argued that it would be worrisome for the WTO if the
Mercosur were to charge higher tariffs than it promised to
maintain and pointed out that several countries believe that that
pledge has not been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The WTO committee of regional trade agreements asked for more
information about the tariffs that are being applied by the
Mercosur internally and about those applied to other countries.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Negotiations between Chile and Bolivia for the
bilateral complementary economic agreement that should have been
carried out May 1 and 2 were postponed until June, said Juan
Gabriel Valdes, the director of International Economic Relations
Department of Chile's Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Deny Reunion With Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A major Muslim rebel group in the
southern Philippines has denied any reunion with its rival group,
which had already struck a peace deal with the government, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), was quoted as denying Monday earlier newspaper
reports that the MILF and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), a former rebel group, had begun talks on their
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, is not interested in
reuniting with the MNLF, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the two groups have "differences in
principle" which cannot be reconciled, Murad noted that they are
"cordial" to each other because members of one group usually have
relatives in the other group.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force in the
country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the extremist Muslim Abu Sayyaf are the only two
Muslim rebel groups still fighting the Philippine government. Both
groups are opposed to the peace deal forged between Manila and the
MNLF last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began its own peace talks with the government in
January this year. But Abu Sayyaf has shunned peace talks with the
government.

and changes of the international situation.
</P>
<P>
"It performs as a model to relations between states of
different social systems, and proves to be all-weathered," the
Chinese General said.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Mohe, a small town in the
northeastern part of China's Heilongjiang Province, has recovered
from a tremendous forest fire that levelled it a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
As many as 201 people were killed by the fire, and 266 injured,
as the result of an accident. During the month-long disaster,
870,000 hectares of forests and 6.6 million kg of grain were
destroyed and 50,000 people left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Although there are no signs of the fire remaining in the
county, except for the barren mountains around the town, a group
of large fire-proof bulletin boards that can be found everywhere
in Mohe, serve as reminders of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Along the town's streets people can see the serenity and
cleanliness of the city, a distinctive feature of small border
towns, and an ice-blocked river runs through it. The hub of the
town is to the south. Schools, department stores, cinemas, and
residential quarters stand along a cross street.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Public Sector Posts Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a 4.8 billion
pesos (183 million U.S. dollars) consolidated public sector
surplus at the end of 1996, the local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report released Monday by the Finance Department, the
reports said this final figure is much higher than the 2.1 billion
pesos preliminary level announced in February this year.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Acting Finance Secretary Milwida Guevara said
this is the first time that the country posted a surplus position
since the government started monitoring the public sector in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected a balanced public sector
financial position for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The public sector includes the national and local government
units, government pension funds, government financial
institutions, government-owned-and-controlled corporations, and
the Philippine Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Guevara said a main reason for the public sector surplus was
the higher-than-expected income of government financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government financial institutions registered 8.4 billion
pesos (320.6 million dollars) income in 1996, compared to an
earlier estimate of 6.6 billion pesos (252 million dollars).

He notes that forestry is still the county's backbone industry,

timber processing industry, farm product processing, border trade,
and tourism have also become pillar industry for the local economy.

The Mohe Forestry Department has spent more than 200 million
yuan restoring more than 280,000 ha of forest resources, with a
tree survival rate of 83 percent. Trees planted after the
conflagration are now more than two meters high.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the new trees from being destroyed by fire again,
the county government has given top priority to fire
prevention. The fire prevention season comes to Mohe in April. In
Mohe, "no smoking" and "no fires" signs can be seen everywhere.
Vehicles going in and out of the forests are subjected to
fire-prevention inspections and fire-prevention licenses are
required.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengfu, deputy director of the Mohe Fire-Prevention
Center, says that the fire has enhanced residents' fire-prevention
awareness.
</P>
<P>
A series of fire-prevention regulations have been formulated,
fire-prevention forces increased, and two observation stations and
four parking lots for smaller aircraft built.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the town has not suffered from fires
over the past decade. "With the safe environment, we will
certainly a brighter future," says Zhang.

CARACAS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Colombia's joint
chiefs of staff of armed forces will review a series of procedures
for handling issues along the two countries' common border.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Adolfo Leon Campos of Venezuela and Harold Bedoya
Pizarro of Colombia are scheduled to meet soon and discuss the
Current Operating Procedures manual, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The manual, known as the POV in Spanish, is the first military
instrument signed by the two countries to solve border issues.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Campos and Pizarro will study the results
of the POV, which calls for the two armed forces to exchange
intelligence information and create new communications links.
</P>
<P>
The document will result in a joint database about crimes along
the border, the flow of people between the two countries, and the
population and conditions of residents in the region.
</P>
<P>
The POV was signed six months ago and put into practice last
December by the defense ministers of the two neighboring countries
at a summit meeting held in Cartagena, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a bilateral border commission was named then to
carry out a follow-up on the manual of procedures.

<HEADLINE> Doherty Wins World Snooker Championship Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ken Doherty ended the five-year reign
of Stephen Hendry as world snooker number one by winning the world
championship title in Sheffield, England, tonight.
</P>
<P>
Doherty became the first player from the Republic of Ireland to
win the title following his 18-12 victory, which ended world No 1
Hendry's 29-match winning streak and stopped his bid to win six
straight world crowns.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old, world No. 7 Doherty additionally became the
first world amateur champion to go on and take the professional
crown, succeeding where six-times runner-up Jimmy White just
failed.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Hendry never quite found his form during the final and
could do little to stop Doherty winning the 210,000 pounds (about
340,000 dollars) first prize.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (65-66) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (65-66) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong be a separate customs territory? Will
tariffs be imposed there after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 116 of the Basic Law stipulates, "The Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall be a separate customs
territory."
</P>
<P>
Also according to the law, the Hong Kong SAR may, using the
name "Hong Kong, China," participate in relevant international
organizations and international trade agreements (including
preferential trade arrangements), such as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The rights and interests of the Hong Kong SAR as a separate
customs territory will be fully protected. Export quotas, tariff
preferences and other similar arrangements, which are obtained or
made by the Hong Kong SAR or which were obtained or made and
remain valid, will be enjoyed exclusively by the region.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the question of whether tariffs will be imposed
in Hong Kong after 1997, Article 114 of the Basic Law stipulates,
"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall maintain the
status of a free port and shall not impose any tariffs unless
otherwise prescribed by law."
</P>
<P>
This means that most commodities will not be subject to customs
duties, with the exception of alcoholic drinks, tobacco products,
methyl alcohol, hydrocarbon oils, some alcohol-free beverages and
cosmetics that are subject to a customs duty in accordance with
existing laws, or those otherwise prescribed by laws of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Question: What trade policies will the Hong Kong SAR implement?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Article 115 of the Basic Law, the Hong
Kong SAR will pursue the policy of free trade and safeguard the
free movement of goods, intangible assets and capital.
</P>
<P>
A policy of free trade simply means that the government will
not interfere in foreign trade activities and will allow
commodities to freely compete on both domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The government will neither offer special privileges and
preferences for the exportation of domestic goods nor impose
prejudicial policies or restrictions on the importation of foreign
goods.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a free port and, as such, has implemented a free
trade policy. For the import and export of goods, with the
exception of a limited number of "controlled goods," it has
exercised no controls and imposed no strict rules or limitations,
nor are there any customs duties and customs barriers.
</P>
<P>
All internationally legal trade can be done freely in Hong
Kong. In foreign trade, the government mainly play the role of
formulating free trade laws and regulations, expanding foreign
trade channels and improving the foreign trade environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's free trade policies and
operational mechanisms for foreign trade will continue and further
improve after 1997.

<HEADLINE> China, Zambia to Further Develop Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, Zambia, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and Zambia should further consolidate and
develop their traditional friendly cooperation under the new world
situation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks at the banquet in his honor by Zambian
President Chiluba here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in trade and economic ties, the two sides should
probe new ways of expanding trade and economic cooperation which
should be based on equality and mutual benefit, Li Peng said,
adding that such a cooperation would be conducive to common
development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and the African people had sympathized with and
supported each other in their struggle for national independence
and emancipation. At the moment, they all devote to economic
construction and have been conducting cooperation in various
fields, Li Peng said. There is no conflict of fundamental
interests between China and Africa and between China and
Zambia. Instead they have friendship, understanding and
sympathy. No matter what changes in international affairs and in
their respective domestic situations, the Sino-African friendship
would last forever, Li Peng stressed.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa have been treating each other equally and
sincerely, they respect each other's sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity, respect each other's national
characteristics, religious belief and cultural tradition, respect
each other's decision to choose political system and development
road in line with their own conditions and oppose foreign
interference,.
</P>
<P>
China did give some aid to Zambia, Li Peng said. However,
Zambia had also given China strong support in international arena,
Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
On the current world situation, Li Peng said the general trend
of the world situation is developing towards peace after the end
of the cold war, but instability remains. Therefore, peace and
development are still the major tasks of the current world. The
evident orientation of multipolarization would be conducive to
safeguarding world peace. The existence of various contraditions
and conflicts coupling with the widening of gap between the South
and the North "made us believe that the establishment of new
political and economic orders is necessary."
</P>
<P>
China would continue to stand firmly on the side of the African
people to contribute its share to global peace, stability,
prosperity and progress.
</P>
<P>
Present at the banquet were State Councillor Li Tieyan and
other members of the Chinese delegation, senior Zambian ministers
and foriegn diplomatic enboys in the capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province ranks
second only to Guangdong in China's household appliances
production.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has been developing the industry into a leading
industrial sector since the 1970s. And more than 18 billion yuan
in output value and nearly 1.7 billion yuan in pre-tax profits
were generated in the sector in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province has been focusing on the export-oriented economy
for the industry since the 80's and has exported its name-brand
household appliances, including air conditioners, washing
machines, refrigerators, deep-freezers, fans, and dust collectors,
to more than 20 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The province has also set up a large number of foreign-funded
enterprises with output value beyond 100 million yuan each.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Utilizes Renewable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHSA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- People going to the Degyi Township of
the Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region will find
abundant solar stoves and wind-driven generators around the houses
of natives.
</P>
<P>
Local residents use them for cooking and lighting. The only
energy form in the area used to be the excrement of sheep and
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is trying to develop new energy
sources, because of the lack of coal and oil in this area, said
Gyamco, vice-chairman of the Tibet regional people's government.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1990, the regional government has stepped up the use of
clean energy so as to boost the local economy and protect the
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
By carrying out a "sunlight plan," Tibet is leading the country
in exploiting solar energy. By the year 2000, about 100,000 solar
stoves will be set up in Tibet to accommodate a population of
2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy will also be used to generate electricity for
receiving television programs, postal and telecommunication
services, and lighting.
</P>
<P>
Tibet abounds in forest resources, but the regional government
has taken tough measures to put tree-felling under control. In the
dense forest area of Nyingchi in the southeastern part of Tibet,
less than 200,000 cubic meters of trees are cut each year.
</P>
<P>
Forest departments spent 13 million yuan (1.57 million US
dollars) each year in planting trees.
</P>
<P>
Along the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, a tree
belt has extended to dozens of kilometers since it was started
eight years ago, playing an effective role in checking the spread
of sand dunes and preserving soil.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, technological upgradings have been
aimed at reducing energy consumption and pollution so as to
preserve the good environment of Tibet, Gyamco said.
</P>
<P>
"Relatively speaking, the economy in Tibet lags behind
(other areas of China), but development will not be sought at the
expense of the environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Moving into Services Areas in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
flows to African countries are moving into service industries,
particularly in the finance and insurance sectors, and
manufacturing, leaving behind a traditional concentration on the
region's primary commodities, the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in its new study.
</P>
<P>
The 462-page report, The World Investment Directory on Africa,
is just released by UNCTAD and widely believed to be the most
complete and authoritative source of data on investment trends and
statistics in existence. It surveys 53 African countries, covering
data available up to March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey states that the liberalization of investment and
trade regimes are responsible for a new phenomenon: the emergence
of the African transnational corporation. These corporations are
mainly based in South Africa, Morocco and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In seven African countries, the share of foreign direct
investment in capital formation is higher than that in the United
Kingdom, and in eight countries it outperformed France, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with other parts of the world, current
overall volumes of foreign direct investment for African nations
remain low, and thus still a source of concern.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreign direct investment in Africa remains
concentrated in only a small number of countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambian-China Economic Ties on New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that the economic ties between Zambia and China
have scaled to a new stage, namely the stage of cooperation
between enterprises of the two countries, featured by equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held jointly with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba at the Presidential Palace here this afternoon,
Li Peng added that the Chinese government encourages domestic
firms to invest in Zambia, particularly in the copper and
agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Li Peng's view in this aspect, Chiluba said the
Zambian-Chinese economic cooperation promises bright prospect.
The cooperation could be conducted at various levels, either
between corporate groups, individuals or between the two
governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba condemned the practice by certain countries
to impose their own values on other countries, saying that it has
brought new problems in the post-cold war era.
</P>
<P>
Under the new international situation, African countries
should coordinate their actions in world affairs through the
Organization of African Unity and strengthen cooperation with
countries in other regions through the Non-Alignment Movement,
the host president appealed.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Hails Chinese Premier's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, Zambia, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba valued Chinese Premier Li Peng's trip to his country as
the "most significant" and "historic" mission in his speech made
at the banquet he hosted in honor of Li Peng tonight.
</P>
<P>
Although Zambia and China have been regularly exchanging
visits at various levels of the two governments, political
parties and peoples, "your official goodwill visit is most
significant as it does not only open a new chapter in
Zambia-China relations but it is also historic being the first
visit by one of the most high ranking Chinese government leaders
to this country since our independence in 1964," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng's visit to Zambia, and indeed to the sub-region,
clearly demonstrates the significance and the steadfastness of
China's commitment to the conduct of its bilateral, as well as
international relations," Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and China share a common desire to further enhance the
bonds of friendship and partnership in development, and "China's
development assistance rendered to Zambia has been to us a source
of inspiration and motivation in our development effort, more so
that the aid is always devoid of conditionalities," the president
stated.
</P>
<P>
On global issues, Chiluba said China's contribution to the
promotion and maintenance of international peace and security is
a matter of public record and is appreciated by all peace-loving
people the world over.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy in Zaire Trying to Secure Ceasefire in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said on
Monday that U.S. envoy Bill Richardson is in central Africa trying
his best to secure a ceasefire between the Zairian government and
rebel forces while some other U.S. officials said the rebels led
by Laurent Kabila might take over Kinshasa, the Zairian capital,
in one or two days.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters that
Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is traveling
several central African countries "to reinforce the South African
peace initiative and to press the parties to the conflict to end
hostilities without further violence and agree to an inclusive
transitional government lead-in to elections."
</P>
<P>
"Events are obviously moving very quickly in central Africa.
Ambassador Richardson is in the region. His itinerary is very
flexible," Dinger said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said, however, Kabila-led rebels are now
60-100 km from Kinshasa -- only "a day or two" if Kabila decided
to invade the capital. "He'll be coming. There's no doubt about
it," they said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said Washington wished a transitional
process in Zaire with a ceasefire leading to elections in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The United States supports "a transitional process that will
lead to free and fair elections," White House press secretary Mike
McCurry said. "The important question is how to carry that out in
an environment of safety for the civilian population."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States encouraged "both sides to have
dialogue that will resolve their differences and lead to an end to
the fighting."
</P>
<P>
Kabila met on Sunday with Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko on
a South African navy ship. They agreed nothing but another meeting
in some eight or ten days.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu was said to indicate that he would relinquish power but
only to a transitional authority that would organize national
elections. But kabila insisted that power be handed over to him
directly. He vowed to press his military campaign against Mobutu's
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Richardson met Kabila in Zaire's second largest city,
Lubumbashi, for a possible ceasefire. After the meeting, he said:
"The objective of my urgent mission is to prepare a soft landing
for Mr Kabila's rebels when they reach Kinshasa, a landing that
avoids bloodshed and chaos."
</P>
<P>
Troops from the United States, Belgium, France and Britain are
waiting in Congo, across the river from Kinshasa, to evacuate
their citizens from Zaire's capital in case there is troubles when
the rebels invade the city.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Host APEC Trade Ministers Meeting This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada will host a meeting of Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministers responsible for
trade in Montreal from May 8 to 10, the Canadian government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first in a series of ministerial meetings that
Canada will host to advance preparations for the APEC Leaders'
Meeting in Vancouver in November.
</P>
<P>
Canada proposed that trade ministers meet to focus on, among
other areas, facilitating trade by reducing the costs of doing
business in the region, according to a news release from the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Trade ministers will also focus on their individual and
collective plans for trade and investment liberalization and begin
to identify possible sectors for early, voluntary liberalization,"
the release said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministers will explore how APEC can offer
further support to the ongoing work of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
WTO Director General Renatto Ruggiero will join these
discussions, the release said.
</P>
<P>
APEC ministers responsible for trade have met jointly with
foreign affairs ministers once annually since November 1989.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, ministers have begun meeting semi-annually to
sustain the momentum toward APEC's goal of free and open trade and
investment in the region and to support the work of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
APEC, grouping 18 member economies, is the key agenda-setting
body in the region, dedicated to the liberalization and
facilitation of trade and investment as well as to economic and
technical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Ends Exemption from EU Social Chapter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's newly appointed Minister
for Europe, Doug Henderson, formally announced here today the end
of Britain's exemption from the European Union's Social Chapter,
set up to regulate working conditions throughout the 15-nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Henderson made the announcement at a meeting of the
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on the revision of the
Maastricht Treaty held in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British government would put an end to its exemption from
the Social Chapter annexed to the EU's Maastricht Treaty, Mr.
Henderson affirmed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Social Chapter, in its present form,
represented a good balance between social responsibility and
economic efficiency, according to the text of his speech made
before the representatives of the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mr. Henderson indicated London's hope of seeing a
chapter on employment in the revised Treaty, which is going to be
discussed and adopted at a summit attended by heads of state and
government of the 15 EU member countries on June 16 and 17 in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
However, the new minister rejected the idea of flexibility in
the EU's common foreign and security policy, which has allowed
some countries to go ahead in advance in this field without
waiting for others.
</P>
<P>
"We will tell our European partners that we want the rights and
benefits of the Social Chapter to extend to the people of
Britain," British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting opens a new chapter in Britain's relations
with Europe," Cook said. "It marks a fresh start in Europe for
Britain, working with other member states as a partner, not as an
opponent."
</P>
<P>
In comments signaling a desire to improve relations with
Europe, Cook said that Britain would shun xenophobia. But he also
said Britain was still unlikely to join the planned European
single currency in the first wave in 1999.

LUSAKA, Zambia, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to provide a 50 million Yuan (about 6 million U.S.
Dollars) interest-free loan to the Tanzania-Zambia Railway
project in addition to a donation of 30 million Yuan (about 3.6
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng made public the loan and the
donation today when he and Zambian President Chiluba met with
correspondents after they held formal talks. Prior to their
meeting with correspondents, the agreement on providing the loan
and the donation was signed.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-Zambia Railway was built with the help of China
in late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on Sino-Zambian trade and economic
relations, Li Peng said the bilateral economic ties have scaled
to a new stage, namely the stage of cooperation between
enterprises of the two countries, featured by equality and mutual
benefit. The Chinese government encourages domestic firms to
invest in Zambia, particularly in the copper and agricultural

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says DPRK Agrees to Meet MIAs Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Monday disclosed that family member of American soldiers missing
from the Korean War will meet officials of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), who are now holding talks with U.S.
officials in New York regarding soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK delegation has agreed to a meeting on Friday... with
family members of Korean MIAs," spokesman John Dinger told
reporters at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to point out that this is the first time that the
North Koreans have ever agreed to such a meeting, and we view this
as a positive sign of North Korea's interest in making progress on
this humanitarian issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation started talks over the Korean MIAs with the
United States on Sunday and the talks are still continuing.
</P>
<P>
"The first round would up on Sunday night with an agreement to
continue," Pentagon spokeswoman Joan Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
The current talks are a resumption of the ones held last May,
which led to an agreement for joint recovery of the remains of
some 8,100 American soldiers missing from the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The United States has paid 2 million dollars to cover the cost
of last year's search operation. But it later asked the DPRK to
stop returning remains of suspected American soldiers until
further joint searches can be set up in order to make
identifications easier.
</P>
<P>
According to Dinger, there are three broad subject areas that
the U.S-DPRK talks in New York are addressing.
</P>
<P>
One is the reported sightings of alleged Americans currently
living in the DPRK. Another is access to military archives to
recover DPRK's data about Americans held as POWs during the war.
And the final is the establishment of a schedule for resuming
joint excavations to recover American remains buried in DPRK's
cemeteries and at specific loss sites.
</P>
<P>
Dinger reaffirmed that the talks over the MIAs are not linked
with talks that also took place in New York two weeks ago
between DPRK officials and U.S. and South Korean officials about
a proposal of four-party peace talks on the Korean Peninsula.
