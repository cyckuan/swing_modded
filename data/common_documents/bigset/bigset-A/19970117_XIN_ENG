<HEADLINE> China Generates 1,075 Billion KWHs of Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China generated 1,075 billion
kilowatt hours (kwhs) of electricity last year, a rise of 6.8
percent over 1995, according to a national power meeting that
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power plants - coal and gas fired - produced 875.7
billion kwhs of electricity, up 8.5 percent over 1995 level, and
hydroelectric power stations produced 185 billion kwhs of
electricity, matching the previous year's level. Nuclear power
stations generated 14.3 billion kwhs of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, minister of China's Power Industry, said that last
year the tension between supply and demand in the country's power
industry eased up, coupled with a completion of pre-set goals for
power industrial production and capital construction, which has
effectively ensured a sustained, fast and healthy development of
the country's national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the country finished the
construction of power stations with a combined generating capacity
of 12.8 million kilowatts in the past year. China also added 5,477
kilometers of power transmission lines in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Construction has started on the installation of two nuclear
power generating units for the second stage of China's
self-designed and built Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in east
China's Zhejiang Province, each with a generating capacity of
600,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, 93.03 billion yuan (one U.S. dollar equals to
8.3 Chinese yuan) was spent on the construction of major power
projects in China, including 36.55 billion yuan of investment from
the state and 10.68 billion yuan from overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The number of provinces and autonomous regions where
electricity is now available in every village reaches 12, said the
minister, adding that China will realize the goal of bringing
electricity within the reach of 95 percent of the country's rural
families and making electricity available in every county by the
year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Professor Zhou Guangzhao described
the Sino-U.S. scientific meeting as "very successful, very
important."
</P>
<P>
"The talks between us covered major issues faced by the two
countries and the world as a whole, including the changed
scientific and technological environment, sustainable development,
enhancing the partnership between scientists of the two countries,
particularly the contacts between young scientists -- the future
scientific leaders of the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Xinhua, Dr. Alberts said that it is essential for
the future and for humanity that the scientists of the two
countries work together closely on their common goal.
</P>
<P>
"The future of the world depends on the intelligent use of
science and technology and the expanse of population," he said,
"It is clear that in the next century, China and U.S. will be the
leading countries of the world."
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting between the top leaders of the two
academies, we discoved that we have the same goals, and have both
the need and ability to work together closely," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. academy has limited financial resources to use for
our international affairs. But we intend to devote most of those
resources in the coming years to facilitating our activities with
Chinese scientists," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus will be the programs that brings together the most
outstanding young scientists of our two countries, who represent
the future leaders in science and technology in China and the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We view this as important investment for the future of science
as well as for the future of a friendly and cooperative
relationship between our two countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Announced in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The General Confederation of
Workers of Greece (GSEE) announced today a nationwide 24-hour
strike for next Thursday in support of demands for "democratic
fiscal reform."
</P>
<P>
The labor organization's main demands consist in the
index-linking of tax brackets to inflation and an increase to 2
million drachmas (about 8,300 U.S. dollars) of the tax-free limit
for the minimum wages of an unskilled worker.
</P>
<P>
According to the GSEE, the government's refusal to index-link
tax brackets will cost workers being paid under the national
general labor agreement between 25,000 and 130,000 drachmas
(between 104 and 542 dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The GSEE has criticized the government's new tax law, charging
that it left intact provocative tax breaks for capital while
abolishing breaks which had been given to salary-earners instead
of pay increases.
</P>
<P>
"This direction is unjust and cannot be accepted by the trade
union movement," said the GSEE.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Hotel Profits Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The profit of Israeli hotels
dropped by 10 to 15 percent in 1996 compared to the previous year
due to "a combination of geopolitical factors.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Avi Rosental, director of the
Israeli Hotel Association, as saying that last year hotels showed
a 1.2-billion-US-dollar turnover, with 600 million dollars of
that coming from tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourism from abroad witnessed a decrease of six
percent compared to 1995, with up to 20 percent fewer tourists
staying in Israel during the later part of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed to the sharp increase in the number of
nights spent by Israelis in local hotels, which jumped by 12
percent in comparison with 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is a proof that Israeli hotels succeeded in
competing with all the vacation packages being offered in the area
because of our competitive price and our aggressive marketing, as
well as the fact that this winter, weather in Israel has been far
better than anywhere else in Europe," Rosental said.
</P>
<P>
Rosental noted that despite the slump last year, about 20,000
hotel rooms were either in the planning or building stage,
bringing the total up to about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
"Investors have to be optimistic and make long-term
forecasts, since it takes four or five years from the planning
stage to the opening of a hotel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The optimism, he said, was based on expectations for waves of
incoming tourists to mark Israel's 50th anniversary in 1998 and
the jubilee of Christianity in 2000 as a result of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that even 50,000 rooms would not be enough if
millions come for the Christian event, but he added that there
were many examples around the world of hotel rooms built for a
specific event, which could not be filled later.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor: Citizens Optimistic About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Hebron Municipality
Mostafa al-Natsha said today that citizens in Hebron are upbeat
following the initial of the accord on Israeli troop redeployment
in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arab radio, the
mayor said contacts are underway between the Palestinian and
Israeli sides for putting this accord into effect.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Palestinian supervision over the Ibrahimi Mosque,
which had been a sticking point in previous rounds of talks,
remains unsolved and it will be discussed later on, the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord which was initialed Wednesday morning
after a summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel should withdraw
from 80 percent of Hebron within ten days after the signing and
the remaining 20 percent will be negotiated in the future, he
added.
</P>
<P>
About 450 Jewish settlers live among 200,000 Palestinians in
the last West Bank city still under Israeli occupation
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Oslo II accords signed by the previous Israeli
Labor government, the Israeli troops pullback from Hebron should
have been completed by the end of March in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the withdrawal was postponed following a series of suicide
bombings in Israel between February and March in 1996 that killed
over 60 people, and Netanyahu further delayed the pullback on
security reason.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Outline for Relics Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's impressive Summer
Palace, home of the Qing Dynasty Emperors, heads a list of
cultural relics which China wants to be officially listed as world
heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
China is to ask UNESCO to include another 20 of its historical
sites on the World Cultural Heritage List by 2010, including the
Summer Palace, and a unique ancient town affected by a strong
earthquake in Yunnan Province last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an outline plan for the protection of relics and
museum construction for the coming 15 years, issued today in
Beijing by the State Cultural Relics Bureau, the move is a part of
an ambitious program to preserve the country's 5,000-year-old
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The outline states that in early next century, China will have
2,500 museums, and a huge network to connect thousands of famous
historical sites will be created.
</P>
<P>
"All the historical sites will be protected and utilized in a
scientific, effective and reasonable way," said Zhang Wenbin, head
of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that by the year 2000, the central government will
pour an additional 20 million yuan (2.3 million US Dollars) to
protect cultural relics each year, compared with amount allocated
over past five years.
</P>
<P>
Massive investigations will be launched to find out how many
myths still remain in the country, and some 100,000 historical
sites under special protection will be recognized, the outline
reveals.
</P>
<P>
Some key sites will be put under emergency protection, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Archeological work is expected to be stepped up, which will
lead to the conclusion of how Chinese civilization was born, using
high technology to aid the research.
</P>
<P>
The outline revealed that China will send archeologists to do
field work abroad if conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
It urged cultural workers to prevent precious relics from being
shipped abroad, and adopt measures to return smuggled relics to
China.
</P>
<P>
The outline also stressed the importance of museum security and
noted that the country prohibits the auctioning of many rare and
valuable relics.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has always attached great importance to
relics protection and museum construction, because relics are the
symbol of a nation," said Culture Minister Liu Zhongde.
</P>
<P>
The official added that relics protection can help carry
forward the fine tradition of Chinese culture, and spread the
education of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
In China funds for relics protection come from the central
budget.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Concerted Efforts to Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Concerted efforts are being
made in Zimbabwe to minimize air and water pollution in urban
areas by encouraging industrialists to put in place environmental
auditing mechanisms at their factories.
</P>
<P>
This crusade is being spearheaded by the National Cleaner
Production Center (NCPC), which was set up two years ago to fight
industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
Harare's NCPC Managing Director Lewin Mombemuriwo today said
the idea behind this exercise is to build Zimbabwe's capacity and
improve efficiency in dealing with industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we are looking at technologies which will minimize
the generation of industrial wastes."
</P>
<P>
He added, "the center trains people in companies to do
environmental audits which enable companies which generate waste
to aim for cleaner production."
</P>
<P>
Figures released by UN environment agencies show that in 1995
industrial process emission of carbon dioxide in Zimbabwe reached
16,983 tons, ranking the country seventh largest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's major contributors to environmental problems
include textile and cotton ginning factories, chemical plants,
petroleum enterprises, paper mills, printing and publishing
houses.

<HEADLINE> FM: Turkey Respects Territorial Integrity of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey
respects territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks after her meeting with Iraqi
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani, who
arrived here today for the exchange of views with Turkish
officials on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister said that the parties living in
northern Iraq should enjoy their democratic rights and live in
peace, adding that Turkey had launched necessary initiatives to
provide peace in the region after the latest crisis in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) will soon preserve a ceasefire
declared between Talabani and Iraqi Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) head Massoud Barzani on October 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued in Ankara Wednesday at the end of
the third round of the talks on the issue of northern Iraq said
that the PMF is likely to be deployed next month.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Talabani said: "We all need democracy but it is
especially necessary for Turkmens and Kurds who suffered a lot
from Iraqi dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
He said that his people did not accept the existence of the
terrorists groups which use the region to stage raids against
Turkey, adding: "we will try to keep Turkey's borders secure as
it is Turkish people's rights to call for border security."
</P>
<P>
The Iran-backed PUK fought with the KDP, supported by
President Saddam Hussein, in late August of last year, which led
to U.S. air strike against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two rival parties signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996
under mediation by the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rebels since
the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones after the
KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Progress Made in Control of S. American Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The transmission of Chagas
disease has been virtually under full control in Brazil, the World
Health Organization (WHO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This important success is a result of control activities
undertaken in the framework of the initiative of the southern cone
countries," said WHO in a press release based on information
provided by the Brazilian national control program. An independent
commission is expected to carry out the ratification of the
interruption of vectorial and transfusional transmission.
</P>
<P>
Chagas disease exists only in the American continent and Brazil
is the biggest endemic country, accounting for over 40 percent of
prevalence of the disease, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chagas disease is a chronic and incurable parasitic disease
which can cause disability and even death. It is estimated that 16
to 18 million Latin Americans have been infected and that 2 to 3
million may have already developed chronic complications.
</P>
<P>
The incurable lesions of Chagas disease develop some 10 to 20
years after the initial acute phase in one-third of those
infected. They include chronic cardiopathy, as well as chronic
digestive lesions and neurological disorders, WHO explained in its
press release.

<P>
In 1991, the health ministers of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay launched the Southern Cone Initiative
for the Elimination of Transmission of Chagas Disease.
</P>
<P>
Current data on control activities indicate that certification
of the interruption of transmission will be achieved in Chile in
1997, in Brazil in 1998 and in Argentina in 1999. The transmission
was interrupted in Uruguay in 1996. Control activities are
progressing as scheduled in Bolivia and Paraguay, but at this
stage it is not possible to estimate a date for the achievement of
interruption of transmission in those two countries, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, only 1,800 insects, which transmit the Chagas disease,
were found by Brazilian national control program field workers in
709,012 homes surveyed, which gives an average of 2.5 insects in
every 1,000 houses, a house infestation rate far below the minimum
threshold necessary to ensure transmission of the parasite to the
dwellers by the vector, WHO said.

<HEADLINE> Two Explosions Blasts at Clinic Building in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Two explosions blasted in
and out of a clinic building in Atlanta today, leading to some
injuries, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The first blast occurred at 9:30 a.m. (1430 GMT) at the Atlanta
Northside Family Planning Services, located on the ground floor of
a five-story building that also houses offices of lawyers,
dentists and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered glass of the building, sending debris
to a large area outside the building. No injuries were reported in
that explosion, which appeared to come from the first floor.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, another explosion blasted from a trash container
outside the building. Some injuries were reported including an
agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who was
investigating the first blast, but no one was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Two cars near the trash container were badly damaged in the
second explosion.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a mass explosion erupted in the Centennial
Olympic Park in Atlanta when the Olympic Games were being held in
the city. The blast killed two people, and injuring more than 100
others.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency to Remain Stable: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African
currency Rand should remain steady in 1997 after nose-diving last
year, the local Standar Bank predicted today.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike last year, an environment characterized by more
positive than negative environmental factors can be expected to
impact on the Rand in 1997," the bank said in a paper.
</P>
<P>
The Rand would depreciate against the U.S. Dollar, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Rand dropped 29 percent last year, from R3.65 against a dollar
last mid-February to around R4.70 at the end of last December.
The local unit was trading at R4.655 this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the increased competitiveness of the economy,
due to the fall in the Rand last year, and a reduction in imports
would result in significant improvement in the nation's balance
of payments, and ultimately the level of its foreign reserves.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Falls to 2.5 Pct in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's annual rate of
inflation fell bigger than expected to 2.5 percent in December, a
drop of 0.2 percent on the previous month, according to figures
released today by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected the headline rate of inflation in
December to fall from 2.7 percent to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The underlying annual rate of inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, fell to 3.1 percent last month from
November's 3.3 percent, its first fall since May last year.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that lower motoring costs and food prices were
mainly responsible for the fall in the annual inflation rate while
higher housing costs and rise in the price of alcohol put upwards
pressures for the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Both figures were better than economists' forecasts and were
key factors in the government's decision Wednesday not to raise
base interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The figures eased fears about inflationary pressures in
Britain's economy.
</P>
<P>
"These figures show that subdued cost pressures and a stronger
pound are feeding through to lower inflation," Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said in a statement after the release of
the data.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Calls for Optimum Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today said the government's land redistribution exercise
will be meaningless if the land is not put to good use.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a field day held at a farm near Harare, Mugabe
said he wants to see more blacks diversifying into other sectors
of agriculture besides maize farming.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see more blacks going into other sectors of
agriculture such as tobacco, tea, coffee instead of just growing
maize. Why not horticulture and even green beans?" asked Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "people should learn to be self-reliant, innovative
and hard-working if they are to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Land should be devoted to farming the best suitable crop if
black farmers are to derive the best possible results, Mugabe
noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed young children in schools should be taught
agriculture as part of their practical subjects to enable them to
appreciate agriculture and know how different crops are grown.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "agriculture is the mainstay of the Zimbabwean
economy and farmers should be more thorough if they are to cause
economic growth to rise."
</P>
<P>
He said last year Zimbabwe recorded a 7.8 percent growth rate
and hoped to go further this year by another seven or eight
percent.

<HEADLINE> Bailey-Johnson Showdown to Take Place in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The SkyDome of Toronto, Canada,
has been officially declared today the site of the biggest track
showdown of the century, the race between the world's fastest-ever
runners.
</P>
<P>
The announcement that Toronto will host the 150-meter race
between Donovan Bailey of Canada and Michael Johnson of the U.S.
was made today in Canada's largest city of Toronto by Giselle
Briden, the promoter of the One to One Challenge of Champions
meet.
</P>
<P>
"By putting the fastest men ever to run on the same track... we
are creating an event that's going to rock Toronto around the
world," said Briden, president of the Ottawa-based Magellan
Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great event for track and I'm ready now to confirm
the title of the world's fastest human," said Michael Johnson,
world record holder for the 200 meters and 400 meters, and U.S.
Athlete of the Year for 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Get ready for take-off in Toronto," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Donovan Bailey, world record holder for the 100 meters and
Canada's Athlete of the Year for 1996, said that he wanted this
race at home in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I've said the race would be run on my terms -- the time I
wanted, the location I wanted, and the lane I wanted -- and that's
how it's going to be," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bailey-Johnson 2-million-dollar race will highlight a
three-hour extravaganza at SkyDome, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Showcased will be world-class athletic and entertainment
events, including competition between athletes who currently rank
as the world's best in their events.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Bailey set the world record and won the gold medal in
the 100 meters at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, while
Johnson became the first male Olympian to win both the 200- and
400-meter races.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the games, there has been a controversy as to who is
really "the world's fastest man."
</P>
<P>
The Canadians say the title should go to Bailey, while the
Americans insist that Johnson has every reason to be the world's
fastest man.
</P>
<P>
The spring race, dubbed The Challenge of Champions, will be
over 150 meters on a curved track, midway between Bailey's
100-meter event and Johnson's 200.
</P>
<P>
Both men will receive appearance fees of 500,000 dollars, with
the winner taking home another 1 million.
</P>
<P>
"It's really the only way to put two guys together who are
different specialists and make it fair," Johnson said when the
race was announced last November.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great opportunity for track and field.... I
think it's a great opportunity for both of us and I look forward
to it," he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
Bailey also welcomed the challenge. "I'm here now, its going to
happen in May so I'm really looking forward to taking on my man
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Briden confirmed today that final negotiations with corporate
sponsors and broadcast partners are nearing completion, with
announcement to be made in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Corporate interest in the race is extremely strong and global
in scope," Briden said.
</P>
<P>
"Magellan expects that public demand for tickets will be just
as strong as the interest in sponsorship and broadcast rights,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that tickets will be priced so that anyone who wants
to go will have an opportunity to enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime
event live.

<HEADLINE> Swans Land in Northern Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nature treated local people in
Nevrokopi, Drama and surrounding villages in northern Greece to a
rare sight this morning when they awoke to find that dozens of
swans had landed for a rest after migrating from countries of
northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The country's forestry officials held that the swans, who
appeared to be hungry and exhausted, had migrated from the north,
possibly Russia, where temperatures are below freezing.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the swans from unscrupulous hunters, the
local forestry department issued an announcement "advising"
people not to harm the birds.
</P>
<P>
If the cold weather continued in northern Europe, more swans
and other rare birds could be expected in Greece, said the
forestry officials.

<HEADLINE> Official: US Opposes Cypriot-Russian Missile Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official said here today
the United States was opposed to the decision made by the Cyprus
government to purchase S-300 Russian-made missiles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department official Carey Cavanaugh told reporters
at a press conference that the Cyprus' decision to buy the
surface-to-air missiles with a range of 150 kilometers was a
"mistake", adding that this was not the path towards working on a
peaceful settlement for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon following his
visit to Cyprus and Greece, said that the U.S. is concerned that
this is definitely a setback to international efforts to advance
a settlement to the issue of the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is able to get the commitment of both the leaders of
the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities to move
quickly ahead with the implementation of the U.N. package of
proposals to improve the security and safety situation along the
ceasefire lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposals include adoption of military code of
conduct, extension of the unmanning of army posts along the
demarcation line, removal of land mines and unloading weapons
from the posts near the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh held the three-hour talks with Turkish Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen on the missiles crisis in
Cyprus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' arms deal with Russia to purchase the anti-aircraft
missiles worth of 250 million U.S. dollars has drawn strong
opposition from the Turkish government and military.
</P>
<P>
On January 10, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Tansu Ciller threatened Cyprus that Turkey is ready to
strike at Cyprus if its government goes ahead with the arms deal
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail
Hakki Karadayi paid a two-day visit to northern Cyprus between
January 13 and 14 to show Turkey's determination to oppose
Cyprus' deployment of the missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has promised not to deploy
the missiles in the next 16 months
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since the Turkish troops landed
on the island in 1974 and seized the northern third of the
island following a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece by
some Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots on the east Mediterranean
island.

<HEADLINE> More Than 10,000 Swiss Companies Go Bankrupt in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 companies in
Switzerland declared bankruptcy in 1996, 4.4 percent more than
those in 1995, said the Swiss Credit-Reform Union Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,192 companies went into bankruptcy in 1996 while
27,071 new companies registered in the same year, 2.7 percent more
than those in 1995. Of all the new companies, 50 percent are in
the service sector, 22.5 percent in wholesale business and 20
percent in construction, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, annexation and transaction of companies were active. A
total of 345 companies were involved. Two chemical plants, Chiba
and Sandoz, were merged into Novartis, a new international
enterprise said to be the biggest in the chemical world. Several
Swiss companies were purchased by foreign companies like Germany's
Siemens and the U.S. Baxter.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss companies also bought a dozen of foreign
companies in 1996. The Swiss Reassurances bought Mercantile and
GeneralRe for 3.015 billion Swiss francs (about 2.2 billion U.S.
dollars), becoming the world's largest reassurances company.
Switzerland's ABB acquired 10 foreign companies.

<HEADLINE>   Cyprus, Russia to Sign Economic Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Cyprus government official
announced here today that Cyprus and Russia will sign an
agreement on mutual promotion and protection of investments in
the Caucasian region of Krasnodar.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou made the
announcement after a meeting with Russian Ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Muratov on furthering bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister will visit Russia in April to hold talks
with Russian officials and sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said preparations have already been made for
the signing of the agreement, adding that the European Bank of
Development and Reconstruction will cooperate on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador noted that cooperation between Cyprus
and Russia on trade and economic matters is progressing "very
positively" with possibilities for further cooperation, covering
not only the Aegean, but the Black Sea region as well which is
historically and culturally linked to Hellenism.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' acquisition of Russian S-300
surface-to-air missiles, the Russian ambassador said the contract
for their sale will be kept, but avoided commenting on
U.S. official Carey Cavanaugh's statement made Wednesday that the
missiles will not finally be installed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' deal to buy Russian missiles with a range of 150
kilometers, which was signed on January 4, has triggered
criticism from the United States. And Turkey has threatened to
strike at the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cyprus government has vowed to go ahead with the
deal despite the Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has purchased some advanced tanks and armoured vehicles
from Russia for the past few years despite opposition from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since the Turkish troops landed on
the island in 1974 and seized the northern third of the island
following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots on the east Mediterranean

<HEADLINE> Britain's Clarke Leaves Base Rates on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke left interest rates on hold today
following his monthly monetary meeting Wednesday with Bank of
England governor Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
City economists had expected Clarke to leave base rates at
their current level of 6 percent, which was reached at the end of
last October when they rose one quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
Britain's central bank, the Bank of England, has recently kept
on pressing for an increase in interest rates on fear of the
economy's overheating.
</P>
<P>
However, Clarke said that although the strong pound distorted
Britain's trade with other countries, it helped to counter
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
"The big thing at the moment is the pound is very strong and
that is very anti-inflationary," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the pound had risen 15 percent in the last year
overall, and was up 20 percent versus the mark.
</P>
<P>
The stock market welcomed the news, with the FTSE 100 resuming
its recent record run, and by mid-afternoon it was more than 30
points up at 4,191.7.

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Outbreak Claims 17th Life in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A 17th person has died in the
E-coli food poisoning outbreak in Scotland, taking the total death
toll to 17, according to Scottish health officials.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was an elderly woman who was a resident of
Bankview nursing home near Edinburgh and she had been ill since
the outbreak started last November.
</P>
<P>
She is also the sixth person to die in the Forth Valley Health
Board area and the fourth person at the nursing home to have
succumbed to the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that almost 400 people have reported symptoms
of the food poisoning, which can cause kidney failure in
vulnerable people such as the elderly and young children.
</P>
<P>
The British government, which ordered emergency research into
the causes of E-coli Wednesday, said that it would check whether
food handling and licensing laws needed tightening.
</P>
<P>
According to medical experts, E-coli is a bacteria normally
found in the guts of cattle, sheep and people. It is usually
harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be passed to
human via manure or improper slaughtering.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides arrived here this evening for an important visit in which
he will discuss the latest development on the Cyprus issue with
Greek leadership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his arrival at the Athens airport, Clerides said,
"There is no issue of not installing the Russian S-300 missiles on
the territory of the Cyprus Republic. They will be installed when
their construction is completed, as foreseen by the relevant
agreement signed by Cyprus and Russia."
</P>
<P>
The agreement to buy the missile system was signed on January 4
and it triggered repeated threats from Turkey that it would strike
the Greek Cypriot-controlled area if the Cyprus government went
ahead with the development of such system.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question concerning a moratorium of military
flights over Cyprus, Clerides said, "There is no such issue at the
moment, but it has been brought up by the Americans."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Has Nothing to Do With Sudan's Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- President Negasso Gidada
said today Ethiopia is not responsible for the political problem
in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the president said
Ethiopia has nothing to do with Sudan's political problem when
talking with outgoing ambassador of Lesotho J.T. Mestings here.
</P>
<P>
President Negasso said the instability in Sudan is the
creation of the Sudanese government which failed to pay due
attention to efforts being exerted by member countries of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) including
Ethiopia to peacefully solve the problem in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army which took up arms against
Khartoum since 1983, seized two border towns recently in an
offensive which is now continuing.
</P>
<P>
Gidada charged that Sudan is engaged in disrupting peace in
neighboring countries including Ethiopia, at a time when Ethiopia
is striving to do everything in her capacity to defuse the
conflict in that country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry issued a statement here on
Tuesday in connection of the Sudanese government's accusation of
Ethiopian forces shelling two border towns of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It denied shelling Sudan's border towns but criticized
Khartoum for externalizing its internal conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Fears Mounting Israeli Pressure on Lebanon and Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
repeated here today a fear that Israel would exert more pressure
on both Lebanon and Syria after reaching an agreement with the
Palestinian leadership on a redeployment in the West Bank town
of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency(LNNA) reported
that the president expressed the fear in meetings with
parliamentary deputies in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"President Elias Hrawi reiterated his fear of mounting
Israeli pressures on Lebanon and Syria, in the wake of the
Hebron agreement," the official LNNA said in its evening news
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The president "expressed apprehensions that Israel could
utilize security incidents taking place in various areas in
Lebanon, but he ruled out a large-scale (Israeli) military
operation reaching the degree of devastation," according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which the Israelis and the Palestinians
initialed earlier Wednesday, Israel will hand over most of
Hebron to the Palistinians, in the first concrete move in the
peace process since Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
took power in June.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting, the president said that the
agreement "does not necessarily mean Israel has changed its
negative stance on the peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
He urged the country's security forces to "keep eyes wide
open and carry out full responsibility within the law in order
to safeguard public security throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
received in his office this afternoon Ron Schlycher, charge
d'affairs of the United States in Beirut, and discussed with
him the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-and-half-a-hour meeting, the
U.S. diplomat announced that he conveyed to the Lebanese foreign
minister the U.S. hope that the agreement would draw "more
progresses not only on the Israeli-Palestinian track, but also
on both the Lebanese and Syrian tracks."
</P>
<P>
Schlycher underlined that the Washington administration would
continue to follow the policy in the Middle East which is "aimed
at the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,"
and he ruled out the eruption of a war in the region.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks of Syria and Lebanon with the Jewish state has
deadlocked since last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's
special envoy for Cyprus Han sung Joo will be here soon in a bid to
start direct negotiations between the two rival Greek and Turkish
communities on the island, a U.N. official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides in
Presidential Palace, U.N. Secretary-General's resident
representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel said Han's week-long
visit at the end of this month aims at "trying to move the process
forward in a year described as good for Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of U.N. intensified effort to prepare
the ground for direct talks as soon as possible, Feissel said,
adding that there are "time restraints" in the U.N. effort,
such as the presidential elections in February next year and
Cyprus' accession negotiations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing military dialogue between the
National guard and the Turkish forces, Feissel appeared optimistic
that an agreement on the U.N. measures is imminent.
</P>
<P>
"I hope as discussions continue in the coming days and
week that we are going to see some dramatic change in what
we hear on both sides," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. has made it clear to both that
agreement must be reached on the entire package of measures
and not just on one of the three proposals under discussion,
which include the extension of the unmanning to cover the
length of the demarcation line, the removal of loaded weapons
and a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., he added, has also warned both sides that if
they continue to insist on agreement on a specific item, this
would be tantamount to a rejection of the measures and refusal
to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Han' upcoming visit follows a
tension on the island after Cyprus' acquisition of Russian-made
S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and seized the northern third of the island following
a pro-Athens coup.

WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
thanked King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt for their support in reaching an agreement between the
Israelis and Palestinians on the Israeli troops' pullback from the
West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser-designated Samuel Berger revealed in
an interview with network radio reporters that the thank was given
through morning phone calls.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the Hebron accord would not have been possible
without the intervention of King Hussein and the support of
President Mubarak. Last weekend, King Hussein put forward a
compromise proposal concerning Israeli redeployment in the West
Bank rural areas, which finally rescued negotiations between the
Israelis and Palestinians from collapse, and helped conclude the
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Netanyahu, Arafat, King Hussein and Mubarak are all
expected to visit Washington separately in the coming months, but
said no summit was planned.

"This is not a big summit. This will be a series of meetings,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Six Injured in Explosions in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Six people were injured in
two explosions in and out of a clinic building in Atlanta today,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The first blast occurred at 9:30 a.m. (1430 GMT) at the Atlanta
Northside Family Planning Services, located on the ground floor of
a five-story building that also houses offices of lawyers,
dentists and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered windows across the street and sent
debris to a large area outside the building. No injuries were
reported in that explosion.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, another explosion blasted from a trash container
outside the building. Six people were injured, including an agent
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who was
investigating the first blast. Four of them were hospitalized,
but were in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Two cars near the trash container were badly damaged in the
second explosion.
</P>
<P>
After the explosions, police evacuated everyone within 500
meters of the building.
</P>
<P>
Investigation were under way, but police said that it appeared
that the abortion clinic was the target of the explosion. A half
hour after the second explosion, the Piedmont Clinic, another
abortion center in the city, was evacuated after receiving a bomb
threat.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a mass explosion erupted in the Centennial
Olympic Park in Atlanta when the Olympic Games were being held in
the city. The blast killed two people, and injured more than 100
others.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Leaves for Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Athens for talks with his Greek
counterpart Costis Stephanopoulos and Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which will also be attended by the
foreign and defense ministers of the two countries, the Cyprus
problem as well as the joint defense pact, agreed upon by
the governments of Cyprus and Greece in November 1993, will be
discussed, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before his departure from Larnaca
Airport, President Clerides reffered to Cyprus' deal to buy
Russian missiles, saying that the 16-month period between the
purchase and the installation of the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles gives ample time to the U.S. to launch their
initiative to assist efforts for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
concerning the U.S.-proposed moratorium on overflights of Greek
and Turkish military aircraft in Cyprus, President Clerides said
the issue will also be discussed during his meetings in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
He said that overflights of Greek aircraft are part of
the defense agreement concluded between Cyprus and Greece and
therefore a decision on the moratorium should be "a decision
of both governments".
</P>
<P>
"During a period of political detente, as for example when
negotiations are in progress, we could refrain from scheduling
overflights," the President said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the process of the ongoing military dialogue
between the National Guard and the Turkish forces under U.N.
auspices, President Clerides reaffirmed the government's readiness
to discuss all issues proposed by U.N. Security Council
resolution 1092, adopted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
These include the adoption of a code of conduct,
prohibiting loaded weapons along the ceasefire lines and extension
of the 1989 unmanning agreement to other areas where the two
sides remain in close proximity to each other.
</P>
<P>
Early today, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said
that President Clerides' talks in Athens will be conducted on
the basis of a document prepared by high ranking Greek
government officials with a paper President Clerides had already
prepared on the current situation.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the actual talks and the exchange
of views and ideas about future moves in the efforts for a
political settlement in Cyprus," the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides' current visit to Greece follows a tension
on this east Mediterranean island after Cyprus government's
decision to buy Russian-made surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The deal to buy the missiles with a range of 150
kilometers, signed on January 4, has triggered criticism from
the United States and some other countries. And Turkey has
threatened to strike at the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized 37 per cent of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the Greek Cypriot-controlled southern part
of the island would mean war between the two countries.

deal with a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in light of an upcoming
conference of the European and Mediterranean countries on
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Poos pointed out that his mission in the Middle East, which
started in a "pessimistic" atmosphere, has "changed and
improved" after the signature of the Hebron agreement between
the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>

The agreement, under which Israel will hand over most of
Hebron to the Palestinian National Authority of Yasir Arafat, is
the first concrete step taken by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin

highly of Europe's concern over the situations in the region in
general and in Lebanon in particular.
</P>

LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A High Court judge in Dublin
heard the first divorce case to come before the Irish courts
Wednesday, according to a report from the Irish capital today.
</P>
<P>
Divorce in Ireland was approved in a referendum in November
1995, but the new Divorce Act does not come into effect until
February 27.
</P>
<P>
The case was brought by a man in his 50s who is terminally ill
and wishes to marry again before he dies.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held in secret to protect the identities of the
man, his wife and the woman with whom he has lived for several
years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that his wife did not oppose the declaration.
And the man also asked for the three months' notice for an
intended marriage to be waived.
</P>
<P>
The divorce referendum in Ireland divided the Irish Republic.
Following a 0.56 percent margin of victory for the "Yes" camp,
there were legal challenges in the Irish High Court and Supreme
Court.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Forced to sell planes, Close Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bahrain-based Gulf Air
has decided to sell six Boeing-767 aircraft and close routes in a
bid to save itself from falling into a debt trap, the official
Bahraini News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a recent meeting by the Board of
the airline, which is equally owned by Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the executive chairman of the
Gulf Air Sheikh Ahammed bin Suaef al Nahyan said in a statement
to the Bahraini News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The regional carrier will sell six planes during the period
from February to July and close some uneconomic routes to help
reduce its debt burden and realize profits, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The routes which will be closed include its flights to and
from New York, Geneva and Johanesburg.
</P>
<P>
The carrier has mapped out measures to prevent travelers from
being affected, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Air's debts are estimated at some 2 billion
U.S. dollars, mostly in bank loans. The debts resulted from a
flurry of buying new aircraft in the late 1980s and opening
uneconomic routes.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden carrier currently has 32 aircraft, said to be
far more than its needs to fly a handful of its profitable routes.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the airline recorded its worst annual loss of 159
million dollars, the biggest since the Gulf crisis in
1990.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Government tourism
sectors of East African Cooperation (EAC) states have endorsed a
proposal on a study to liberalize the tourism industry toward
establishing a single market in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement was reached at a two-day EAC meeting, attended

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Makes Phone Call to Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad made a phone call today to his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak, according to Well-informed Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents discussed the latest developments in the
Middle East, the recent international changes, the future prospects
of the peace process as well as the difficulties posed by Israel's
intransigent and extremist policies.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in
negotiations with Israel and the Hebron accord initialed Wednesday
morning by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents exchanged views on the U.S. accusations
leveled against Syria with regard to the purchase of military
electronic systems from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here indicate that the phone call by Assad
to Mubarak after the initialing of the Hebron accord aims at
winning Egypt's continued support of non-separation of the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks in future negotiations and for persuading the
U.S. administration to amend its pro-Israeli policy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regulators to Study Boeing-McDonnell Douglas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) --The U.S Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) is going to study the big merger between Boeing
Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., Attorney General Janet Reno said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Both the FTC and the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust
division have jurisdiction to review mergers.
</P>
<P>
Seattle-based Boeing said last month it would pay 13.34 billion
U.S. dollars in stock for McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The merger would produce a civilian- and military-aircraft
giant with projected annual revenues of 48 billion dollars, and
hence the world's largest aerospace company. It would be able to
grab 65 percent of the world jetliner market, almost double the
share of its only rival, Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium.
</P>
<P>
European Union antitrust regulators also have announced they
intend to review the Boeing-MD merger to ensure it in line with
the 15-member trade bloc's rules.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said today the Hebron deal initialed by
the Palestinians and the Israelis Wednesday was "the first step
along the road of fostering aspiration for confidence."
</P>
<P>
In a press release here, the AL chief urged follow-up steps to
build on the momentum and confidence inspired by the Hebron deal .
</P>
<P>
The accord should be followed by urgent steps on other
negotiation tracks so as to achieve full Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied Arab territories in accordance with the international
laws, U.N. resolutions and the land for peace principle, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said in the press release the efforts of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan for reaching
the accord fall within the resolutions of the Pan-Arab summit held
here in June which underlined that just and comprehensive peace is
the strategic option of the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States and the European Union to resume
diplomatic efforts to boost the peace process along all tracks
until just and comprehensive peace is realized in the Middle

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang People Fight Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six people have been
killed and 18 others have been seriously injured by a heavy snow
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Four people are still missing. Since an unprecedented snowstorm
hit Xinjiang in late December, the number of people affected by
the snow has surpassed 320,000, mostly with people cut off or
trapped.
</P>
<P>
The snow has also damaged 183,800 houses belonging to herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Twenty three counties in seven prefectures in the region have
been stricken by the worst snowfall for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The snow is up to two meters deep in the mountain areas and 40
centimeters deep in the plain areas. Successive snowstorms and
avalanches have killed people, blocked roads and cut off
telecommunications lines and power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Direct economic losses caused by the disaster have reached 247
million yuan (about 29.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
People in the region, led by the Chinese Communist Party and
the local government have worked all out in a massive relief
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang regional government has organized emergency relief
operations. By January 16, helicopters had flown 34 sorties,
rescuing 310 herdsmen, geological surveyors, gold miners and
border guards.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 tons of food and medicine have been air dropped to
snow trapped herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Military Area Command has sent 1,000 tons of
materials to grasslands in southern part of the region by road,
saving 12,000 herdsmen and 337,000 farm animals from hunger.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also extended 16 million yuan in
loans and granted three million yuan's worth of relief funding for
the resumption of industrial production in the snow-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Relief funding of 14 million yuan and 2,500 tons of firewood
and fuel have also been sent to the victims.
</P>
<P>
So far tens of thousands of people have joined the relief
teams. Aid materials are pouring into the disaster-stricken
areas. About 23 million kg of fodder and 250 million kg of feeding
grass have already arrived in the snow-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 snow trapped people, 540 automobiles and
200,000 farm animals have been rescued and transferred to safe
areas.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Expected to Flow Into Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi oil may soon flow into the
Philippine market as the two countries are expected to enter a
deal under the United Nations (UN) scheme of oil for food,
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Siazon made this remark after attending a 30-minute meeting in
the Presidential Palace between President Fidel Ramos and visiting
Speaker Saadoun Hamadi of the National Assembly of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the six-member parliamentarian delegation from Iraq are
in the country to sell oil, which would be used to purchase
Philippine food and medicines for Iraqi nationals, particularly
women and children.
</P>
<P>
The expected inflow of Iraqi oil will probably cushion the
impact of the on-going oil price increases in the Philippines,
which today witnessed another 3.3 percent hike for oil price per
liter, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hamadi also relayed President Saddam
Hussein's appreciation for the participation of the Philippines in
the UN scheme which will enable Iraq to import foods and medicines
in exchange for Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
The export of local food products, medicines, and
pharmaceuticals to Iraq will be undertaken by the Philippine
International Trading Corporation, which is targeting 20-30
percent of the two-billion U.S. worth of oil Iraq is allowed to
export every six months.
</P>
<P>
The UN imposed the trade embargo on Iraq following the
country's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. It allowed Iraq to begin
selling oil for food last year.

<HEADLINE> ADB, Donors to Replenish Soft Loan Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and donors have agreed to replenish the bank's soft loan fund, the
Asian Development Fund (ADF), with 6.3 billion U.S. dollars, the
Manila-based bank announced today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that the agreement was reached at
the seventh and the final donors' meeting which concluded in Tokyo
today, with the donors agreeing that the ADF should remain as a
single fund.
</P>
<P>
The ADF loans are provided on concessionary terms to the
poorest of the ADB's developing members. The typically
interest-free loans have repayment periods of at least 30 years
and carry a service charge of one percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The previous replenishment was 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the donors agreed to contribute up to 3
billion dollars while the ADB, for the first time, would provide
more than half of the replenishment, which will cover a four-year
period from 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Japan remains the largest contributor with
1.019 billion dollars, followed by the United States and the
European donors.
</P>
<P>
Another major achievement of the Tokyo meeting was that donor
countries in the Asia Pacific region have agreed to increase their
share of contributions to 50 percent of the fund, the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Fugitive Lawmaker Finally Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A fugitive congressman was
finally captured today after 23 days of hiding in the country.
</P>
<P>
Remeo Jalosjos, a representative from Zamboanga del Norte
province, was arrested this afternoon by the Presidential Security
Group (PSG) and the 250th Air Force Wing on an Island off Bagac,
Bataan province in the west of Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the long-awaited news, Philippine President Fidel
Ramos commended the PSG for "a job well done".
</P>
<P>
Jalosjos, who is wanted for raping an 11 year old girl, was
cornered by a 100-man operatives of the PSG and National Bureau of
Investigation, which used six helicopters and several cars in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
A wife of one of Jalosjos' henchmen tipped the PSG on the
whereabouts of Jalosjos, who did not resist capture and was
brought immediately to the PSG headquarters in the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation said that Jalosjos was planning to flee
the country by flying to Cebu before proceeding to Tawi-Tawi where
he would take a high speed pumpboat to Labuan, Malaysia. From
Labuan, he would fly to London apparently under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Trial Court of Makati in Metro Manila issued a
warrant last December 26 for the arrest of Jalosjos for two
counts of statutory rape and 12 counts of acts of lasciviousness.
</P>
<P>
However, the police failed to find him at his several
residences. A nationwide manhunt was immediately launched for his
capture. In fact the manhunt extended up to Indonesia following
reports that Jalosjos fled to that country.

ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Gendarme soldiers have
seized 71.2 kilograms of heroin and 88.6 kilograms of hashish in
recent anti-drug trafficking operations in southeastern Turkey and
arrested seven people in the connection.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that the
heroin was found in raids on two heroin workshops in Baskaletown
of Van province bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say exactly when the operations were

Five people suspected of involvement in drug trafficking were
arrested for questioning, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the agency said that the gendarmes
seized 88.6 kilograms of hashish and detained two suspected drug
smugglers in Lice town of Diyarbakir, center of southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police seized 3 tonnes of heroin in 1996, accounting
for 22 percent of the world's total haul, and 7 tonnes of hashish
in the same year, according to latest official figures.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Output in 1996 Exceeds 14 Billion Kwh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear power output
reached 14.3 billion kilowatt hours (kwh) in 1996, a 12 percent
rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang
Province generated 2.23 billion kwh, while the Daya Bay Plant in
southern Guangdong Province produced 12.11 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
A conference of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC),
which concluded in Beijing today, was told by a company official
that last year the utilization rate of generating units at the
Qinshan and Daya Bay plants reached 86.4 percent and 72.6 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The rates were described as good compared to the average rate
of 81.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's output of nuclear power accounted for just one
percent of the country's total power output.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China's nuclear power sector should
increase its proportion of the country's power structure, in which
thermal power accounts for 75 percent and hydropower, 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said burning of coal for the development of thermal power
will further burden the country's transport system and continue to
worsen the environment.
</P>
<P>
China's hydroelectrical resources, however, are mainly
distributed in southwest, restricting the development of
hydropower.
</P>
<P>
In the longer perspective, the official said, "China must boost
nuclear power for its economic construction."
</P>
<P>
China plans to build four new nuclear power plants with a total
generating capacity of 6.9 million kilowatts in Lianyungang,
Qinshan and Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that China's nuclear industry will not
take off until the next century. The country's nuclear generating
capacity will rise from current 2.1 million kw to 20 million kw by
2010.

<P>
HELSINKI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven in every 25 people in
Finland now have a mobile phone, giving the country the highest
density of cellular phones per person in the world.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of mobile phones in Finland has reached more
than 1.5 million and new subscribers are still increasing at a
rate of 50,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that some 500,000 new mobile phones were sold
in Finland last year, and the country is expected to see around
600,000 new subscribers this year.
</P>
<P>
Finland was one of the first countries to set up national
mobile phone networks in the 1970s. It also participated in the
establishment of the first international mobile phone network
among Nordic countries in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
As the most advanced digital GSM network has been introduced to
the country since 1990, Finland saw a boost in mobile phone sales,
which were further pushed by the invention of more exquisite
phones and continuously declining prices.

MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today hosted the ceremonial inauguration of 10 Japan-funded
bridges constructed in Mindanao in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony held in the Presidential Palace here, Ramos
said the bridges would significantly boost trade, commerce,
transportation, travel and tourism in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The bridges, constructed with a Japanese grant worth 873
million pesos (33 million U.S. dollars), were part of the 234
bridges to be built under a five-year program aided by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the bridges would help promote the economic
development in Mindanao, where a peace agreement was signed
between the Moro National Liberation Front and the government last
September ending a 24-year-old war.
</P>
<P>
The bridges would also facilitate the further integration of
the heretofore isolated communities in Mindanao with the rest part
of the country, said Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Tory Lawmaker's Death Raises Doubts Over Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The death of a Tory backbencher
on Thursday pushed the Conservative government into a minority in
the British parliament, raising doubts over whether Prime Minister
John Major could have the general election in May as planned.
</P>
<P>
The death of Iain Mills leaves the Tories with 322
parliamentary seats and the combined Opposition parties with 323,
excluding the Speaker and her three deputies, who usually do not
vote.
</P>
<P>
Labor has been seeking to unite the opposition parties since
late last year to secure passage of a no-confidence vote against
the government, which could force Major to call an early election.
</P>
<P>
Under the British law, the prime minister could choose the date
of the polls, which must be be held by May 22.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor Party said it could hardly win the
tug-of-war because the Ulster Unionists, who hold the linchpin
votes in the House of Commons, do not seem to be considering
stopping support for Major.
</P>
<P>
To get a vote of censure through the parliament, Labor would
have to secure all the votes of the opposition, including all its
MPs and every member of the other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists said they had no plan to withdraw their
support for the ruling party, which allows a Conservative majority
in all legislative committees.
</P>
<P>
A senior Labor official said the death of Mills is little more
than a psychological blow to the Tories and would not make much
difference in the election timetable.
</P>
<P>
Although Tories said that May was still the favored option for
the election, there are signs of a quickened pace of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The sudden burst of activity included the rescheduling of the
Welsh conference and a new arrangement of political broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Tory headquarters said that this is just an effort of the Major
government to focus attention on the main election issues, such as
tax.

<HEADLINE> EU, France Deny Report on Common Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Thursday
denied a British report that some countries led by Germany and
France were planning to impose a common income tax in the
single-currency countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the European Commission (EC) were quoted as saying
that the EU treaties leave income tax exclusive under the control
of the countries' treasuries, giving Brussels a say merely over
certain indirect taxes like value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French European Affairs Minister Michel Barnier
dismissed the report by the London-based newspaper "The
Independent" as a reflection of Britain's pre-electoral worry over
the European policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had "never heard of" anything about common
income tax during negotiations on the European monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Effective Help for People in Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's vice premier Wu Bangguo
today urged government officials to take effective measures to
help urban families suffering difficulties in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
At a national telephone conference, Wu said that it was
essential to make concerted efforts to tackle the problems as the
traditional Spring Festival celebration draws near.
</P>
<P>
"Life problems have a major bearing on people's interests, not
only as an economic problem but also a political one," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, a number of state-owned enterprises suffered
losses and defaulted on workers' wages. This in turn led to
difficulties for some workers in their day to day lives, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Life was also hard for some retired workers, the elderly and
disabled, as China still lacked a comprehensive social security
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have attached great importance to the
issue, and worked out a series of policies and measures to deal
with the situation, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at various levels should carry out the
policies and measures in earnest, and help in practical ways
people without adequate food, clothing, housing and medical care,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and enterprises should make sure the jobless
and pensioners get basic wages or pensions to ensure a normal
daily life in the festive season, the vice premier stressed.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Drug Crimes Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's nationwide crackdown on
drug crime proved fruitful last year, with the country's police
cracking 87,000 drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
Officers confiscated 4,000 kilograms of heroin, 1,700 kg of
opium, and 1,000 kg of "ice", worth millions of yuan at street
prices.
</P>
<P>
About 110,000 people were found to be involved in drug related
crimes, according to sources at a national conference of the State
Anti-Narcotics Committee held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the results provided a good springboard for the
country's anti-narcotics work in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal drug users in China has continued to
increase in recent years, and drug-related crime has done great
harm to the country's social stability.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference urged governments and CPC party
committees at all levels to do their best in the country's
anti-narcotics campaigns, and to impose compulsory rehabilitation
programs on illegal drug users.
</P>
<P>
China's public security organs were also urged to take more
effective steps to combat drug crime at the conference, and for
tough sentences to be handed out to drug traffickers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governments at all levels should also take measures
to improve rules and regulations, and management of narcotics, and
make precautionary measures to improve social order.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon: Hebron Agreement Not End to Talks Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz warned here today against considering an agreement on
Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron as an
end to the peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Hebron agreement should not be considered as tantamount
to an end of the Palestinian track in order to conceal
other rights of the Palestinians," Boueiz said in a press
conference held jointly with visiting Foreign Minister of
Luxemburg Jacques Poos.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Parliament voted Thursday and approved the agreement
on Hebron, which was initialed by the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators Wednesday, thereby giving the green light for Israeli
soldiers to pull out of 80 percent of the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister maintained that the Hebron
accord failed to give the Palestinians their full rights, noting that
the area obtained by the Palestinians in the agreement "is less
than all the Hebron area."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, the authority to be exercised by the Palestinians
in Hebron is less than the authority which the Palestinians
should exercise," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, Israel preserves its presence (in Hebron), the
principle of joint patrols and the principle of chasing
Palestinians in the area," the Lebanese minister added.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will not hand over 20 percent
of Hebron, where some 400 Jewish settlers are allowed to
live.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this agreement will not actually conceal
rights of the Palestinians as we have seen," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the agreement "will not be the last and
final pay for what we consider rights of the Palestinians, the
most basical of which are the right of self-determination and the
right of establishing an independent state," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
"All the information we have got until now forced us to say
that this agreement should not be considered an end of the
Palestinian file," he said, "because we are afraid that the
Israeli government would believe what it has given now is enough
and constitutes a last pay for the Palestinian rights."
</P>
<P>
Poos said that his talks with Boueiz dealt with the last
developments of the Middle East peace process, the general
situation in the region as well as the relations between
Syria and Lebanon on one hand and Israel on the other.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Hebron agreement should be considered
as a "step forward in a process which will be long and in
which there are still other issues yet to be solved and
more difficult than the problem of the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
Poos said that the agreement constituted a "stage which
should be followed by other stages" rather than a final
point in the peace talks between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Luxemburg foreign minister arrived in Beirut from Damascus
Thursday evening. Today, he also held meetings with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Volcano Erupts, Thousands Evacuated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's most active volcano
Mt. Merapi erupted twice this morning while thousands of residents
were evacuated, the Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first eruption occurred around 10:35 a.m. local time (0335
GMT), and the second one followed three minutes later, said an
official of the Volcanology Office's observatory in Kaliurang,
located at the slope of Mt. Merapi.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported as authorities evacuated thousands
of villagers away from the declared danger zones of Turgo, Tritis
and Kaliurang towns.
</P>
<P>
The eruption emitted hot lava that flowed six kilometers down
towards Boyong, Krasak and Bebeng rivers.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Merapi, measuring 2,968 meters high and one of the 127
volcanoes in the country, is situated in Central Java, the most
densely populated region on Java island.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's activities could be seen from Yogyakarta, some 25
kilometers south of the volcano. Thousands of people in the city
came out on the streets to watch the scene, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The danger level of the Mt. Merapi has been raised to "alert"
-- the highest warning level in Indonesia for volcanic activities.
</P>
<P>
The last eruption of Mt. Merapi was on November 22, 1994, when
it spewed hot lava and rained six kilometers of volcanic ashes,
killing more than 60 people and injuring dozens.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is classified as one of the most active volcanoes in the
world.

November 1996, Eurostat, the EU's statistical office said today.
</P>
<P>
In the month, about 18 million people were out of work in EU

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Labor Earns More In Third Quarter of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The average earnings of Hong
Kong labor increased by three percent in real terms in the third
quarter of 1996 over a year earlier, as shown by the latest
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The average labor earnings in all major sectors, as measured by
payroll per person engaged, rose by 8.6 percent in nominal terms,
the Census and Statistics Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Payroll in the wholesale, retail, import and export trade,
restaurant and hotel sectors recorded the fastest real growth of
5.2 percent in the third quarter of 1996 compared with the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Workers in services, finance, insurance, real estate,
transport, storage and telecommunications sectors also earned more
money after discounting the inflation effect, while the real
incomes of workers in manufacturing sectors declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
The overall wage index for September 1996 rose by 6.4 percent
in nominal terms or 1.2 percent in real terms over a year earlier.
The faster increase in earnings over wages was due to more
overtime pay and the issue of irregular payments, said a
government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Average payroll includes wages and all other irregular
receipts, such as bonuses and overtime payments. Statistics on
average payroll tend to show larger quarter-to-quarter changes,
affected by the length of working hours and the timing of payment
of bonuses and back-pay.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Dragonair has
 ordered an additional A330-300 aircraft from Airbus Industrie,
bringing its total commitments to the advanced widebody twinjets
to six, a press release said today.
</P>
<P>
The new A330, to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 1998,
will join an existing all-Airbus Industrie fleet serving
Dragonair's regional route network, which now includes 24
destinations in the Chinese mainland and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
Dragonair currently operates a fleet of seven single-aisle
A320s and four A330s, and announced in October 1996 that it had
ordered two additional A320s, with options on five more. The
airline also confirmed the lease of another A330, which will enter
its fleet in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft will enable Dragonair to increase capacity on
existing routes and to open new routes.
</P>
<P>
The airline's Chief Operating Officer, Philip Chen, said,
"Dragonair operates one of the youngest and most advanced aircraft

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Guangdong Agree On Boundary of Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) concerning the Boundary of Administration between Hong Kong
and south China's Guangdong Province was initialed today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement defines a clear boundary of administration for
all sectors -- the land boundary between the New Territory in
northern Hong Kong and Shenzhen, the boundary in Deep Bay and Mirs
Bay, and the sea boundary to the west, south and east of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
John Ashton, deputy political adviser to the Hong Kong British
government, and Xiao Jinzhe, deputy director general of the
Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial government,
initialed the agreement in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the outcome of 13 rounds of talks between Hong
Kong and Guangdong, which began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Hong Kong this afternoon,
Ashton described the agreement as a good outcome for Hong Kong.
"The boundary between Hong Kong and Guangdong is one of the
busiest in the world. Millions of people cross it every month, as
do large numbers of cars, lorries, ships and boats, carrying a
formidable and growing amount of cross-border trade."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong official acknowledged that management of such a
boundary poses a special challenge to all the agencies involved on
each side, from police and customs authorities to those
responsible for flood control and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"The task is clearly easier if both sides know and agree upon
exactly where the boundary runs at every point. It is good news
for every one concerned with policing the boundary and managing
cross-border activities." said Ashton.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Hero On Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A film which tells the story of
one man's fight against lawless hunters of China's threatened
wildlife has won an award.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Forestry today conferred the first
"Forestry Culture Award" to the newly-made film on the Tibetan who
devoted his life to the protection of rare animals.
</P>
<P>
"Gyalsang Soinam Daje" is the name of the film based on a true
story. Gyalsang, 40, died in a fierce gun fight with 18 illegal
hunters in an unpopulated area in west China's Qinghai Province on
January 18, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The zone, 5,300 meters above sea level, and with the lowest
temperatures reaching minus 50 degrees Centigrade, is home to a
large number of rare animals, such as the Tibetan Antelope and
argali sheep.
</P>
<P>
It also attracts many hunters who show no concern for the laws
protecting wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Gyalsang, deputy secretary of the Zhiduo county committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, had been to the zone 12 times,
traveling over 60,000 kilometers in a drive to crack down on the
law breakers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry and the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection conferred on the brave official the title "Environment
Guard".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the World Commission on Environment and
Development extended heartfelt condolences at the time of
Gyalsang's death.
</P>
<P>
"The film is the best way to commemorate this heroic man," said
Xu Youfang, Minister of Forestry at today's premiere of the film.
</P>
<P>
"Gyalsang proved that protecting wild animals is a hard course,
paying with his blood and life, but at the same time he has
aroused the public's attention to the work," commented Xu.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on society to take action to help in the
protection of rare wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
China has set up 574 natural reserves, with 69 designated by
the State Council as state-level reserves, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry has launched rescue projects to save
animals on the verge of extinction, such as the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The "Forestry Culture Award" was established to encourage
artists to contribute to protection work, he explained.
</P>
<P>
To finish the film, the production group visited the hinterland
of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau three times, carrying their equipment
to places over 4,000 meters above sea level, and spending over 120
days in the poverty-stricken area, according to starring actor Guo
Bichuan, who plays Gyalsang.

BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Police in China have solved
more than 189,000 criminal cases, uncovered 23,000 criminal gangs
and arrested 9,998 suspects since the start of the winter.
</P>
<P>
Police in China's capital of Beijing have focused on bicycle

</P>
<P>
By December 15, Beijing police officers had caught 1,900

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank Praised for Notable Contribution to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) was praised today for making remarkable contributions to
agricultural reform, the government's anti-inflation efforts, and
the restructuring of rural banking.
</P>
<P>
The accolade came from People's Bank of China (PBC) Governor
Dai Xianglong at a meeting with a group of ABC officials in
Beijing today. PBC is China's central bank.
</P>
<P>
ABC has been a major financial supporter of the country's rural
areas, where the current national economic reform was initiated,
said Dai. He stressed that rural reforms have activated reform in
cities, and the increasing income of farmers has helped in the the
development of cities and industries.
</P>
<P>
China, as an agriculture-based country, uses farm products to
account for more than half of the 300 items selected in preparing
the country's price index. This means that inflation is closely
linked to agricultural production, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that efforts by the bank to meet the financial
requirements of the countryside have been a key factor in the
bumper grain harvests over the past three successive years, which
has been helpful in the successful control of inflation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The top banker also spoke highly of the contribution made by
the bank in the ongoing restructuring of the country's rural
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the bank will further reinforce its
internal management and administration, as well as internal
reforms, and try to become an efficient, standardized state-owned
commercial undertaking with a strong ability to counter risks.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the end of last year, ABC had
894.3 billion yuan in bank deposits and 776.9 billion yuan in
outstanding loans, up 28.9 percent and 18.4 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> US B-24 Bomber Remains Head for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The crew of an American wartime
bomber were making the journey to their final resting place today
after a poignant ceremony at Beijing's Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the crew were handed over to the US, closing
another chapter in the history of World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The B-24 bomber disappeared without trace after a bombing raid
more than 50 years ago. The crew of ten were all killed and their
bodies, along with the wrecked aircraft had remained undisturbed
on a Chinese mountainside until recently.
</P>
<P>
Two farmers, searching for medicinal herbs in a thick forest
discovered the crashed aircraft in Xing'an County in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The mystery which has cast a shadow for the relatives of the
missing airmen for over half a century has now entered its final
phase with the remains of the victims homeward bound..
</P>
<P>
Mei Ping, Chinese Foreign Ministry official in charge of the
Department of Affairs of the Americas and Oceania, handed over three
black cases containing the remains of the dead airmen, and the
wrecked bomber to James Sasser, U.S ambassador to
China.
</P>
<P>
The cases were then taken by U.S army men to three grey caskets
draped with the American flag, the Stars and Stripes. The caskets
were solemnly carried to a C141 U.S cargo plane which had landed
nearby.
</P>
<P>
To the sounds of 'Taps', the gathering paid tribute to the 10
airmen who died 52 years ago in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 pm on August 31, 1944, the B-24 Bomber which belonged
to US No.375 bomber squadron, a subordinate of the "Flying
Tigers," took off from an air force base in Liuzhou in Guangxi to
bomb Japanese fleets berthed at a port in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since the home base of the bomber had been attacked by Japanese
troops, the B-24 had to divert to Guilin airport. On its way to
Guilin, the plane with its crew of young airmen aged from 19 to
26 disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Crashing on the edge of a cliff, 1,828 meters above sea level,
the bomber wreckage was scattered across a five-meter-broad and
500-meter-high crack.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was first spotted on October 2, 1996, by two
farmers, who were looking for medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage, including a piece indicating the number of the
bomber - 40783 - and remains of the US servicemen, were moved from
the site of the crash, over 90 kilometers from the Xing'an county
seat. The work took two months and 500-man hours of efforts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin informed US President Bill
Clinton of the discovery of the wreckage in Xing'an county when
they attended an APEC meeting last November.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, who is also vice-chairman
of the Central Military Commission and state councillor,
passed on some of the victims' belongings to US Secretary of
Defense William Perry when he visited the United States at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member team headed by Alan Liotta, deputy director of
the US Defense Department POW/MIA Office, arrived on January 13 in
Xing'an county, Guangxi, to start the task of verification and
identification of the B-24 bomber.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day preliminary investigation, five 'dog' tags were
found with some remains of the victims on board.
</P>
<P>
At the handing-over ceremony, Mei Ping said, "We are gratified
that through concerted efforts of both sides, the remains of the
U.S airmen will now be repatriated to their homeland where they
may finally rest in peace."
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the Second World War, China and the United
States fought shoulder to shoulder as allies against the
Fascists. In those long and difficult days, countless heroic
people, including the American airmen, gave their lives to
the just cause of mankind.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S have every reason now to continue to work for
peace, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Mei, the handing over of the wreckage remains is
one of the concrete steps China is taking to cooperate with the U.S
in finding those missing in action during the Second World War, the
Korean War, and the Viet Nam war.
</P>
<P>
"This is important not only to the American people, but also
for the Chinese to cooperate in this field, " he said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after the ceremony, Mr Liotta expressed
deep appreciation for China's help and cooperation in finding the
remains of U.S soldiers lost in war.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the U.S share a working relationship on this
issue. In 1994, U.S recovered the remains of American
World War Two airmen from Tibet, with the help of similiar notification
and efforts by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"We will also cooperate in a search to learn the fate of men
missing from both Viet Nam and Korea, " he said, adding that the
U.S is looking forward to strengthening the necessary cooperation
to fulfill our efforts on this humanitarian issue.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 U.S planes were lost during the Second World War while
flying missions into China, Mr Liotta revealed. So far only two
have been recovered.

<HEADLINE> Four Overseas Scientists Win Science Cooperation Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Four overseas scientists have
won the 1996 China International Science and Technology
Cooperation Awards established by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The '96 award winners include American-Chinese physicist Samuel
C.C.Ting, aerodynamics expert G.S. Bisigensi from the former
Soviet Union, German biologist Uli Schwarz and American-Chinese
Architect Ieoh Ming Pei.
</P>
<P>
An official of the State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC) said at today's news conference that China is to publicize
their major achievements both at home and abroad, in an effort to
attract more outstanding scientists to contribute to China's
science and technology development.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wanhu, deputy head of the international cooperation
department of the SSTC, said China will begin this year to promote
its science and technology cooperation with foreign consortiums
and big companies, in addition to strengthening ties with foreign
governments and research organs.
</P>
<P>
He said China is also to launch Sino-foreign cooperation in
China's research and development of the information highway, new
material, high-speed trains, electronic vehicles and other major
high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
Sun added that some departments are drafting regulations that
will allow the establishment of Sino-foreign cooperative and
jointly run research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Samuel C.C. Ting, 61, is an internationally-known physicist and
the 1976 winner of the Nobel Prize. Thanks to his suggestion to
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1977, 10 Chinese physicists went
to Hamburg, Germany in 1978 to participate in an experiment Ting
was conducting there.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Chinese scientists were involved
with their foreign colleagues in developed countries to carry out
important science research.
</P>
<P>
He also helped foster more than 100 Chinese physicists and post
graduate students in foreign labs that he headed.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Institute of Electronic Engineering, led by Ting,
and the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology participated
in the ALPHA Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) magnet project -- the
first man-made magnet sent to space to conduct experiments.
</P>
<P>
G.S. Bisigensi, 81, was once engaged in the research of
aircraft aerodynamics and stability in the Central
Aerohydrodynamics Research Institute of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He has provided extensive assistance to China's design of
supersonic aircraft, and helped train China's first group of
aircraft designers.
</P>
<P>
Bisigensi also arranged for Russian experts to launch a
research program with their Chinese colleagues to design the

<HEADLINE> 1997 Rome Marathon to Promote City's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Rome's 1997 marathon was presented
by Mayor Francesco Rutelli on Thursday as a chance for the city to
publicise its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Sechudled to begin at the Coliseum on the morning of March 16,
the marathon route runs through the heart of the city, past world
famous architectural landmark such as the Spanish Steps, Piazza
Navona, the Caraclla Baths and Villa Borghese.
</P>
<P>
Presenting Rome's third marathon to the press, Rutelli said
this was a crucial moment for the Italian capital's Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
The mayor soothed fears that had been awakened last week
following comments by International Olympic Committee (IOC) member
Primo Nebiolo, saying Nebiolo was "simply saying we shouldn't take
anything for granted."
</P>
<P>
Also present, Nebiolo underlined the positive light an event
such as the city marathon could shed on Rome's chances of being
chosen as host city for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC is scheduled on March 5 to meet in Lausanne to draw up
a shortlist of five cities, prior to choosing the winner in
September.
</P>
<P>
Also president of the world track and field ruling body IAAF,
Nebiolo said Rome had presented a serious Olympic project and
would certainly be able to organise "excellent" Games.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to be elected, which is why we will have to work
very hard," reminded Nebiolo.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Tutu Suffers from Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Doctors have discovered cancer
in South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu's prostate gland, the South
African Press Assoiciation (SAPA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It would take some weeks to determine how serious it is and whether
it has spread, Tutu's spokesman John Allen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the lastest announcement, urologists did a simple biopsy
for Tutu on Wednesday. A statement issued on Thursday night indicated
no malignancy had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, a well-known black social activist in South Africa, is
Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The commission is a special organization authorized by the
government to investigate human rights violations during the
apartheid era. enditem

<HEADLINE> Communication Bank Praised for Commercialization Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Communications Bank has
set a good example for domestic state banks on their way to
becoming commercialized and operating in line with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Those were the views expressed in Beijing today by Dai
Xianglong, governor of People's Bank of China, the central bank,
during a meeting with a group of local bankers.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the bank has been fruitful in preventing risks by
attaching greater importance to the quality of loans, instead of
blindly giving out more loans and setting up more branches.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has much smaller assets compared with the four
largest state-owned banks in the country, generated nearly 5.4
billion yuan in profits, ranking third among all banks in China,
according to the governor.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by the end of last year, the bank
had 227.7 billion yuan in deposits and 148.7 billion yuan in
outstanding loans, up 24.8 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively,
over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Persistent Toxic Pollutants on Human Health to Be Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Persistent organic pollutants
are expected to be on a list of dangerous substances at a meeting
scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
"The recent scientific discoveries concerning the effects of
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on human health are
worrying," says Lars Nordberg, deputy director of the Environment
Division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(ECE).
</P>
<P>
An ECE press release issued today said that a study by the
U.S. Academy of Sciences has shown that POPs are responsible for
more than 20,000 cases of cancer in the United States. Recent
research at the University of South Carolina Medical School proves
that industrial pollution could be responsible for falling sperm
counts.
</P>
<P>
Parties to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air
Pollution signed in 1979 will hold formal talks on January 20-24
within the Working Group on Strategies to decide an initial list
of POPs.
</P>
<P>
POPs, including DDT, toxaphene, chlordane, aldrin, PCBs and
dioxin, can generate cancer and damage the human reproductive
system as well as the endocrine glands and the immune system, with
a detrimental effect on physical development.
</P>
<P>
Another two sessions are scheduled for June 16-20 and autumn
respectively and negotiations on a protocol on persistent organic
pollutants are expected to conclude early 1998.

ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pisa mayor Thursday led a
demonstration to demand government action on the protection of the
famous Leaning Tower.
</P>
<P>
The tower has been closed for the past seven years since it
became shaky.
</P>
<P>
Experts kept on arguing about how to stabilize it but so far no
actual work has been carried out.
</P>
<P>
About 500 people joined Thursday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary for cultural affairs, Alberto La Volpe, told
local television on the same day that the Senate Education
Committee has just approved a bill adding 12 billion lire (7.75
million U.S. dollars) to the 34 billion lire (22 million dollars)
fund for the tower.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Piero Floriani seemed unimpressed by the promise.
</P>
<P>
"We will not feel safe until the bill has been approved by the
Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament) too," he said.

"However, we recognize that this is an important step," the

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economy Hampered by Lack of Investment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth has
been severely hampered due to the lack of investments in roads,
telecommunications and water supply, according to a World Bank
official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic symposium here on Thursday, the bank's
Country Director for Kenya Harold Wackman said that power
shortage, poor road conditions and lack of communication
facilities had led to higher production costs, less market and
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The bank official noted that all sectors of the economy had
suffered from the current 10 percent electricity shortage and the
poor conditions of the country's roads, of which 34 percent were
in a "very poor condition".
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 75 percent of urban dwellers have
access to clean water while the percentage stands at 50 percent
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
All these factors have significantly lowered the growth in
economic value, said Wackman, adding that in real terms, the GDP
growth rate of the east African country was only four
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kenya needs to invest a minimum five
billion U.S. Dollars over the next five years to rehabilitate its
power, telecommunications and water infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The official said that it is necessary for a combination of
the Kenyan government, private sector and donors to provide
investments under sound policies on which the World Bank's
assistance will focus.

<HEADLINE> State, Private Firms Equal on Loan-Borrowing: Top Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, Governor of
People's Bank of China, today called for equal treatment to be
given to both state-owned enterprises and private companies when
loans are being considered.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis for banks, he said, should be on giving high
priority to the quality of loan granting.
</P>
<P>
Dai made the call in Beijing during a meeting with leading
officials of the Agricultural Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"I dislike such terms as 'state-owned' or 'private' while
talking about giving loans," he told the officials, "The top
concern should not be the nature of an enterprise, but the quality
of loaning."
</P>
<P>
He urged state banks to give loans in line with regulations and
the situation, but he confessed that normally there are bigger
risks for banks when granting loans to smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
"It is more safe for banks to give loans to private enterprises
that are operating well, while banks should not lend to
enterprises that are on the brink of bankruptcy, no matter whether
they are state-owned or private," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Tolerance for Loss-Making Bank Officials: Top Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the People's
Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, said here today that state-owned
banks should not tolerate officials who are responsible for heavy
losses and that the bank heads must be punished for their
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong took the position at a meeting in Beijing with
leading officials of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC).
</P>
<P>
The country's top banker said that state banks should focus on
the primary tasks of standardizing operations and reducing
financial risks. He stressed the importance of selecting qualified
leading officials to work in banks.
</P>
<P>
He urged state banks to investigate important cases involving
large amounts of money, and to punish officials causing the
losses, in accordance with the nature of their wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese bankers were asked to understand the significance of
the current banking reforms and the opportunities they bring.
</P>
<P>
Dai said state banks are no longer government institutions,
rather they are enterprises in the real sense. He noted that banks
must attach greater importance to the quality of the loaning
procedures, while research should be conducted to fully understand
the market.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, some ABC officials expressed their hopes
that the government will provide a more clear definition of
state-owned commercial banks in China and create a more relaxed
environment for their development.

NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- India has promised to help
the Geneva-based European Council on Nuclear Research (CERN)
construct a two-billion-U.S.-dollar hadron collider, the world's
largest accelerator, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported

</P>

the project in the form of accelerator hardware, such as
correcting magnet and other equipment, valued at 25 million U.S.
dollars in the international market.
</P>
<P>
"Detectors, which pick up all important signals of experiments,
are expected to cost a total of 1 billion U.S. dollars and India
has already been involved in a big way in building detectors,"

<HEADLINE> China Faces Heavy Task of Relics Protection in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China will have to step up its
relics protection work in 1997 -- a year full of historic,
political and economic events.
</P>
<P>
The State Cultural Relics Bureau has warned that a dam which is
scheduled to block the Yangtze River this year will force
archeologists to hastily complete work at hundreds of sites which
will be flooded by the new Three Gorge reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The bureau cautioned that state key projects may damage other
relics, and urged its workers to accelerate excavation and repair
work.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will require cooperation between relics
departments, which will be hosting grand exhibitions in Beijing
and Hong Kong to recall the territory's past.
</P>
<P>
And relics will play a part in promoting socialist cultural and
ethical progress as part of a campaign launched by the Party last
year. Thousands of historical sites will be recognized this year
and become "Patriotism Bases" that recount stories of China's
5,000-year-old civilization and the modern revolutionary tradition.
</P>
<P>
Students can visit these sites free of charge, the bureau
announced at its annual work meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Many archeological activities have been arranged for 1997 --
the year of ox according to the Chinese calendar -- which will be
carried out both from the air and underwater. The repair work of
some 30 major palaces, temples and caves will be completed this
year, and 100 sites will be included on a list to receive
emergency protection.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the protection of relics in China's border areas
and ethnic minority regions will be increased beginning in 1997,
the bureau decided. And a massive program will be launched to
study underground treasures in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Another complex and important task this year is to crack down
on relics thievery, including grave robbing, thefts from museums
and relics smuggling.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen laws and regulations will be drafted and put
into effect in 1997. Additionally, cadres under age 45 are asked
to become computer literate.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature Vows to Fulfill Goals in its Term of Office (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature vowed
today to attain all the goals set for its current five-year term
in its remaining year in office.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), made the pledge in Beijing while
addressing a reception attended by deputies to the NPC,
celebrating the upcoming traditional Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"This year will be crucial for the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee. They will have to reach all the goals mapped out for
the five-year term of office, since we still have much complicated
and heavy work to to in the remaining year," he told the NPC
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The top legislature examined 31 laws and decisions on Chinese
law in 1996, approving 22 measures during the year.
</P>
<P>
"Our legislation pace was markedly quickened, and our
legislation plan to pass enough laws to basically facilitate the
establishment of a market economy in the country is expected to
be realized," Cao claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to its legislation program of more than 100 laws and
decisions, the lawmakers still have around 30 laws and decisions
that need to be formulated, examined and adopted before March of
1998 when the current NPC ends.
</P>
<P>
The 30 laws to be formulated will be more complicated and
difficult, because they involve issues with no experiences to
draw on, or are still under dispute. They include new laws on
supervision, securities and contracts.
</P>
<P>
Cao promised that the NPC and its Standing Committee will work
harder to ensure that all laws made are of high quality.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement has been the Achilles' heel of China. To make
up for the shortcomings, the top legislature has started to beef
up the efforts of supervision according to the Chinese
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee organized 21 inspection tours last
year to 21 provinces, cities and autonomous regions to see how the
environmental, educational, labor, agricultural laws and the law
on public order were being observed and implemented.
</P>
<P>
Eight vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee participated
in the inspection tours, which is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
Similar supervisory efforts will be further reinforced this
year, especially the checking of the work of the State Council and
relative departments, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, Cao said.

NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Deve Gowda
today called on the Indian people to work for national harmony and
fight against divisive and disruptive forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function after giving the 1994 harmony award here,
the prime minister said that India's pluralistic society was
undergoing social transition, which has given rise at times to
certain frictions in the name of religion, region or caste.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people professing different faiths, speaking
different languages and belonging to different castes have been
living in the country in harmony for thousands of years and it was
only in the later part of this century that such differences were
exploited to create rifts between the people. He warned that such
frictions should not be allowed to be capitalized by divisive
forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
He exhorted non-governmental organizations to supplement
efforts of the government to maintain communal harmony.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will help Iraq
in securing the support of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) for an early lifting of the UN trade embargo on
Iraq, President Fidel Ramos said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is ready to discuss Iraq's request
with ASEAN's six other members, Ramos told visiting Chairman of
the Iraqi National Assembly Saadoun Hamadi during a 30-minute
meeting at the Presidential Palace here.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines, as a member of ASEAN and as a sovereign
country, would like to be of utmost assistance to Iraq. But,
perhaps, an ASEAN team effort would be more effective," said
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said that he believes the Philippines, being a prominent
member of ASEAN, can play a role in convincing the UN Security
Council to lift the sanction.
</P>
<P>
He told Ramos that Iraq is willing and prepared to implement
the agreements reached with the UN to enable itself to participate
in global trade.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi conveyed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's appreciation
for the participation of the Philippines in the UN-initiated
oil-for-food countertrade arrangement allowing Iraq to export oil
in exchange for food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine International Trading Corporation will undertake
the export of food products, medicines, and pharmaceuticals to
Iraq while targeting 20 to 30 percent of the 2 billion US dollars
worth of oil that Iraq is allowed to export every six months.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said that Iraq wants to establish a long-term
relationship with the Philippines based on "mutual benefit,
complementarity of interests and mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official and his delegation arrived here on Thursday
after visiting Malaysia and Indonesia, where Hamadi brought up the
same subject of drawing ASEAN's support for lifting the UN
embargo.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regards EC's Anti-dumping Duty as Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistan official said
today that the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties by
the European Community (EC) against textile imports was a
conspiracy against the country's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Akber Sheikh, convenor of a special committee on the World
Trade Organization (WTO) of All Pakistan Textile Mills
Association, made the remarks in Lahore, the capital of Punjab
province, according to a APP report today.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh said that the EC's decision is a political step of
importing countries to protect their local textile and allied
industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO, the importing countries have to remove the quota
restrictions by 2005.
</P>
<P>
These countries want to provide special protection to their
local industries so that they could achieve maximum economic
strength and viability by the time when these restrictions will be
lifted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such an attitude is negative and a
conspiracy against the developing countries, especially for the
countries like Pakistan which mainly depend on its cotton and
textile exports for their foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Pakistan's exports are textile related.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the recently imposed provisional duties
on Pakistani cotton grey cloth by the EC is biased as 30 percent
duty has been imposed on Pakistani exporters whereas other
countries have been assessed at about 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hospitals to Adopt Blue Cross As Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's hospitals, clinics and
other medical institutes will adopt a blue cross as a symbol of
identification beginning in May, according to a decision made by
the Ministry of Public Health (MPH).
</P>
<P>
The ministry introduced the new sign in an attempt to stop the
illegal use of the internationally-recognized Red Cross logo,
which has been used by some medical institutes which are not
members of the Red Cross Society, said Yi Mei, a MPH official
responsible for management in the health sector.
</P>
<P>
"We have to unify the use of the hospitals' symbol in order to
ensure no infringements are made upon the Red Cross sign," Yi told
Xinhua News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The blue-and-white sign will be placed at either the entrance
or on top of hospital buildings, and should be easily visible from
many directions and from a certain distance, according to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The blue cross should be able to be seen at the entrance of
emergency wards at night. Medical workers must wear lab coats and
name tags bearing the sign, and it will also be painted on
ambulances.
</P>
<P>
"The unified use of the sign is designed to make it more
convenient for people to locate medical care facilities," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
Currently in China, many people mistakenly think the red cross
indicates a hospital due to wrong use of the sign, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Red Cross Society and the Methods Concerning the
Use of the Red Cross Sign have forbidden non-society members from
adopting the sign in China.
</P>
<P>
"However, many of them ignore the laws and use the red cross
everywhere. That confuses people," Yi said.

JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Extradition Amendment
Act, aimed at streamlining extradition procedures in South
Africa, came into effect today, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela earlier accepted a
recommendation from Justice Minister Dullah Omar in this regard.
</P>

The new act is another
important step towards curtailing money laundering, drug trafficking
and corruption, Omar said in an earlier statement.

"It will enable South Africa to play a meaningful role in the fight
against these social evils," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new law provides for the designation of states to which
extradition may be affected in the absence of formal agreement,
making the surrender of individuals to other countries possible
without the consent of the president.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the issuing of warrants of arrest of suspects
and their further detention.
</P>
<P>
The act further regulates the procedures for an appeal by an
individual against whom an order for extradition has been issued.

<HEADLINE> Saddam: Iraq Not Defeated in Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said here today Iraq was not defeated in the Gulf war, the
official Iraqi news agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address today marking the 6th anniversary of the
start of the Gulf War in 1991, the president said Iraq's enemies
destroyed the weapons and supplies of the Iraqi army and the
country's national industry, but the Iraqis were not defeated,
according to the INA.
</P>
<P>
Apparently commenting on the current United Nations sanctions
against Iraq, Saddam claimed that the U.S.-led allies failed to
achieve their basic strategic objectives despite the joint
military actions six years ago, so they had to resort to prolonged
embargoes to kill more Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has maintained sanctions against Iraq since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Iraqi president also urged the people of
other Arab states not to follow some of their rulers who set "the
bad examples" for them. He did not elaborate, however.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Saddam strongly criticized some of the other
Arab leaders for bowing to the will of the West and following the
U.S. orders to harm Iraq. But he did not specify by name.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- People who want to change jobs
in China are not allowed to reveal state secrets or leave key
projects they are involved in, according to a regulation recently
adopted by Shanghai's municipal legislature, which is intended to
impart some order to the movement of labor in the city.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also says that those who want to leave their
work units cannot infringe on employers' intellectual property
rights or reveal business secrets.
</P>
<P>
Those who are in charge of key engineering or research projects
cannot move to other locations without permission of their work
units, before the projects' completion.
</P>
<P>
With China's reforms and opening-up, greater numbers of people
have taken to changing their work, but some leave without a word,
making off with valuable data and causing considerable problems
for their employers.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, employees must notify the employer
a certain amount of time in advance if they want to resign or
break a contract with a work unit, and in some cases must pay a
certain amount of compensation to the employer.
</P>
<P>
When a work unit receives a written application for
resignation, it also must make a decision within a certain period
of time.
</P>
<P>
Businesses are not allowed to offer services of the flow of
talents without permission of the municipal labor department,
according to the regulation, and disputes can be submitted to
labor departments or courts for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will take effect on April 1.

ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the Council
for Defense and National Security (CDNS) has sparked a series of
controversies in Pakistan's political arena.
</P>
<P>
CDNS, formed just a little more than a week ago and termed as
"a purely advisory body" by President Farooq Leghari, has become
one of the major focuses in Pakistan especially within the context
of the current political imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member council was set up on January 6, less than a
month before the February 3 general elections, with its envisaged
role to aid and advise the government on key national issues
including declaration of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The new advisory body, headed by President Leghari, who is also
supreme commander of the armed forces, comprises the prime
minister, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, the
army, the navy and the air force chiefs and ministers of defense,
foreign affairs and interior.
</P>
<P>
In the highly-charged political situation in the country and
against the background of a general hostile response to its very
creation, CDNS had its first meeting the following day of its
setup with a special reference to the holding of forthcoming
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the formation of the council has generated heated
arguments and counter-arguments with certain sections defending
and others vehemently opposing it.
</P>
<P>
The major thrust of the objections against CDNS is that the
creation, in effect, would clip the wings of democracy by
involving the armed forces in political decision making.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the council by the two-month-old caretaker
government came no less than a "surprising move" to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
It has certainly created a strong suspicion despite the claims
that the council has only recommendatory status to advise the
government, and "it would not be supra-constitutional,
supra-parliamentary or supra-governmental body."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that an intriguing function of CDNS would
be the "definition of the task of armed forces of Pakistan in
accordance with the national strategy."
</P>
<P>
CDNS will have no limits or parameters for its "advisory"
functions. It can make recommendations covering "practically
everything relating to internal security, proclamations of
emergency and any other matter of national importance referred to
the Council... by the President or Prime Minister."
</P>
<P>
President Leghari has said that the formation of the council is
not a prelude to martial law or presidential system. And General
Jehangir Karamat, Chief of Army Staff, has said that as far as the
Army is concerned CDNS is an "interim arrangement" and not a
permanent body.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, since the lifting of Martial Law in 1985, this
will be the first time that the armed forces will formally
participate in political proceedings of the country.
</P>
<P>
Even though the council is said to be an advisory body, it is
widely believed here that it will have all the political clout and
would be in a position to dictate its recommendations to the
political leadership.
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the plan say that the formation of CDNS will
dilute parliamentary system and aggravate tensions between the
Army and the government owing to restrictions on the latter's
role.
</P>
<P>
They said that in its 50 years of existence, Pakistan has been
ruled directly by the armed forces for 25 years. The military has
remained a very powerful factor in the political affairs of the
country even after the death of General Zia-ul-Haq.
</P>
<P>
The direct involvement of the Army through three martial laws
did not help resolve the country's problems. On the contrary, its
direct and indirect interventions further added to the problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who favor it have argued that the council will
lead to much better coordination and reduce tensions between the
so-called "troika" -- the Army, the President and the Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
They said the involvement of the Army in economic issues of the
country cannot be criticized because it is linked with defending
the nation's borders. A country's security today is not just its
borders but also the economic health of the country, they argued.
</P>
<P>
CDNS, as said in an article carried by the major English daily
"The News", is to "restrain the unbridled financial and political
ambitions of our elected representatives and their friends and
relations which were proving detrimental to the security of the
nation and the well being of the poor masses."
</P>
<P>
And observers here believe that it will also help ensure the
continuity of the next government in office for the full length of
its term, something that had become impossible in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with the formation of CDNS, the members will, at
least, sit face to face arguing their differences and discussing
the best possible way to act in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
It is most possible that the general elections are to be held
on February 3 as repeatedly assured by the government, now the
question remains as what is the haste in creating such a council
merely less than a month before the polls?
</P>
<P>
CDNS, in any case, has sparked a lot of controversies in this
country which is facing enormous economic problems, and it will be
quite some time before a consensus can be found.

<HEADLINE> China Sets New Oil and Gas Production Goals on Land for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to verify 530
million tons of geological oil reserves, and produce 142 million
tons of crude oil and 17 billion cu. m. of natural gas on land
this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national oil meeting, Zhou Yongkang, general
manager of the China Oil and Gas Corporation, said today that the
land oil industrial sector will take measures to stabilize oil
production in the eastern areas and explore the western areas,
while placing equal emphasis on oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
Oil prospecting will be given top priority this year in a move
to sustain increases in oil reserves and oil output. Existing
oilfields in the eastern areas of China will set out to maintain
their present oil production level, and the western areas will
work even harder to increase oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the production plans of three leading oilfields in
east China, Zhou said that Daqing Oilfield, China's oil giant,
will expand its oil production scale, speed up oil prospecting in
new areas and ensure that the oilfield's output will remain at 56
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Shengli Oilfield in east China's Shandong Province will
actively intensify oil prospecting this year and attempt to slow
down decreases in production to maintain the oil output at 28
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Liaohe Oilfield in northeast China will also work diligently to
keep its oil output at 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Oilfield will enlarge oil production capacity and plans
to produce 3.8 million tons of crude oil, while Huabei, Dagang,
Zhongyuan and Jidong oilfields will take extra steps to find new
oil reserves and make sure that oil production will be stable or
growing.
</P>
<P>
The general manager pinned high hopes on oil prospecting and
development in the western areas of China. Zhou said he believes
that the western areas abound in oil and natural gas resources
that are easy to prospect and these areas will become important
oil production bases for future oil development and production.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang and Changqing oilfields in west China will accelerate
prospecting and increase oil reserves this year, and will produce
8.7 million tons and 3.2 million tons of oil, respectively. Tarim
Oilfield is expected to produce 4.4 million tons of oil, up 1.3
million tons over 1996 level. Turpan-Hami Oilfield is likely to
find new oil reserves and will produce three million tons of oil
this year, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
This year's natural gas prospecting and development focus will
be in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu provinces and Ningxia Hui and
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
This year will see rapid developments of the first-phase
construction of the gas oilfield in northern Shaanxi Province,
with a production capacity of 1.5 billion cu m, and the building
of another gas oilfield with a production capacity of two billion
cu m in southwest China's Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Monority Radio, TV Programs Prosperous in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A large number of radio and TV
stations in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are
broadcasting their programs in at least two languages, according
to the regional government.
</P>
<P>
An audio and visual transmitting network in ethnic languages,
with China Central Television (CCTV) and the regional radio and TV
stations as the main body, has gone into use.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Regional People's Radio Station is the first of
its kind in China to broadcast in four ethnic minority languages
in addition to the standard Chinese, and the regional TV station
is the first in the country to broadcast in three languages via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
Some autonomous prefectures also have their programs
broadcasted in local languages, said Dong Sen, deputy-secretary
general of the Ethnic Minority Radio and TV Society.
</P>
<P>
The regional radio, TV and film department has set up a TV
program translation center to provide TV programs in local
languages. Some prefectures have found their own translation
departments, Dong noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 1,000 TV programs were broadcast in ethnic
minority languages, winning widespread support from the public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of local reporters and editors have become
the backbone of regional radio and TV circles. Ethnic minority
people account for over two thirds of the total staff at the
Xinjiang Regional People's Radio Station.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ethnic minority reporters and editors have become
more competent over recent years. One ethnic minority reporter won
a state-level journalist prize in 1994, and another ethnic mority
editors won another journalist prize the following year.

<HEADLINE> Economic Panel Held Meeting in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The 8th session of the Economic
Panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) concluded today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, members listened to briefings given
by officials from the British Hong Kong government as well as
leading members of the Kowloon-Guangzhou Railway Corporation and the
Mass Transit Railway Corporation, which dealt with the lastest
project of the Western Corridor Railway and the plan to build a
subway branch line at Tseung Kwan O. The group also held
discussions on these matters.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the British Hong Kong government issued a project to
revise the building plan for the Western Corridor Railway, and
made numerous adjustments on the previous plan.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the British Hong Kong government and the
leading members of the Kowloon-Guangzhou Railway Corporation gave
detailed explanations of the changes, and those from the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation agreed with the need to build the
subway branch line.
</P>
<P>
They said further study will be conducted on the two projects,
and final decisions will be made next year.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Economic Panel said they have always maintained
a positive attitude on the construction of Hong Kong's
infrastructure, because it will play an important role in
improving Hong Kong's traffic and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The study of the two projects should be actively carried
out. But as construction will not begin until July 1, 1997, the
future SAR government should make the final decisions on the
plans, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted the British side should continue to negotiate with
the Chinese side on major issues concerning the two projects, via
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and before the establishment
of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side will listen to and respect the opinions of the
Chief Executive during the negotiation, they added.
</P>
<P>
Members also discussed issues of the development of Hong Kong's
manufacturing industry and how Hong Kong will participate in the
exploration of the central and western areas, and suggested
turning over the relevant opinions to the SAR government for
reference.

<HEADLINE> Health Care for People in Guangxi Greatly Improving: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy of
the residents in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has been raised to 71.4 years as a result of improved
healthcare services and living standards.
</P>
<P>
The figure, compared with the record of 47 years before the
founding of New China in 1949, is now 1.4 years higher than the
state's average level, according to statistics released by the
Regional Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The department is preparing for a regional conference next week
to outline local healthcare work for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, Guangxi had established more than 1,700 hospitals with
about 80,000 beds and nearly 120,000 medics, which means that two
beds and three medical workers are available for every 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
China's health departments often use such statistics to
partially measure the level of medical care work.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of infectious diseases has dropped by 93.8
percent since the 1950s, from 2,459 people per 100,000, to 153
people per 100,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death rate of patients suffering from infectious
diseases has fallen from 135 per million to 4.7 per million.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi leads the country in successfully eliminating smallpox,
snail fever and filariasis in the past decades, as well as
leprosy, polio and malaria.
</P>
<P>
The region has set up 103 institutes in charge of maternal and
infant health care and 149 baby-friendly hospitals, where
breast-feeding is encouraged.

<P>
NANNING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China used more than one billion US dollars in

The region used only 237 million US dollars in 1992 and one
million in 1993.

According to Yang Linhai, director of the regional bureau of

In addition to increasing the number of overseas-funded
tertiary projects, overseas businessmen have put 130 million US

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' trade deficit
in the first 11 month of last year swelled to 10.95 billion U.S.
dollars from 8.14 billion dollars posted in the same period of
1995, up by 34.5 percent, the National Statistics Office said
today.
</P>

imported goods grew by 23.5 percent to 29.61 billion dollars
during the period while receipts from exports improved by 17.9
percent to 18.66 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The balance of trade in goods was in deficit and went up by

SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Whirly-bird tours of China's

The package, offered by the China General Aviation Corporation,

<HEADLINE> Israel Completes Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Early this morning, Israeli
army completed its long-awaited redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron, less than eight hours after the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) approved the pullback agreement.
</P>
<P>
At around 6:15 a.m. local time (0415 GMT) this morning, the
Israeli army command in Hebron handed over the military
building in the city to his Palestinian counterpart, a formal
action completing the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army later announced the conclusion of the
redeployment in a statement issued shortly before 7:00 a.m. local
time (0500 GMT), with a Palestinian flag that had been hung and
flying over the military building.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of cheering local Palestinians, gathered around the
military building throughout the night, were pouring into the
courtyard of the building to celebrate the ending of 30-year
Israeli rule of the city.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
forces in the West Bank, said that he had been in the building
for five times as an Israeli prisoner, and now he came to take
control.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub, a Hebron native, said that the Palestinians would
try to fulfill their commitments reached in the Hebron accord,
and he hoped that the Israelis would do the same.
</P>
<P>
With Palestinian policemen taking over observation positions
close to the Jewish neighborhood, the residents in Hebron, Jews
and Palestinians alike, have started a new era, in which they
will live side-by-side, hopefully in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the Knesset ratified the Hebron accord,
in an 87 to 17 vote with one abstention, giving the
green light to the Israeli army to redeploy its troops in the
West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The accord was initialed Wednesday morning at the end of a
summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat, held at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of Thursday morning, the Israeli cabinet,
after nearly 12 hours of deliberation, approved the
agreement by an 11 to 7 vote, followed immediately by the
dramatic resignation of diehard opponent Science Minister Ze'ev
Begin.

<P>
YANGZHOU, China, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The 29th men's and 10th
women's Asian Weightlifting Championships, the largest of the kind
ever in the continent, will be held in Yangzhou, China from July 5
through 15.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here on Friday, the organizing committee
of the AWC said the championships will feature 10 categories for
men and nine for women. A total of 240 weightlifters are expected
to enter the competition.
</P>
<P>
The championships, which had been decided to be staged in
Thailand after an Asian Weightlifting Congress meeting in 1995,
had to be shifted to China's Yangzhou because this year's World
Weightlifting Championships will be hosted by Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee, women's weightlifting
has been concluded officially in the program of the Sydney
Olympics in 2000.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that five gold medals will be added in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
China is the strongest nation in the women's weightlifting,
holding 26 world records.
</P>
<P>
China won two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympic Games in the
men's weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
At the last Asian Weightlifting Championships in Japan in 1995,
China finished first overall both in the men's and women's
competitions.

<HEADLINE> CPP, Funcinpec Leadership Meet for Boosting Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The compromising committee
of Cambodia's coalition parties met on Thursday night to discuss
ways to boost consultations and avoid rifts ahead in the
forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
About 20 senior officials from the ruling parties, the
Funcinpec Party and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) attended
the three-hour dinner meeting presided over by Co-Deputy Prime
Ministers Sar Kheng and Ing Kiet.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first this year, followed a previous session
one month ago which helped to a bridge political rift between
coalition partners when tension was growing.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng told reporters after the meeting that decisions on
some measures to boost cooperation between the two parties were
made, and better mutual understanding have been achieved at the
meeting which was to benefit the country's stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
Both sides promised to make more efforts to ensure stability of
the nation and to ease tension between the two parties, and agreed
that any troop movement ordered by a party should be halted and
the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces should act under the command of
the headquarters of the joint general staff, Sar Kheng said.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the participants also voiced their backing for
the local and national elections set respectively for 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng also said that participants reviewed the
implementation of the accord of alliance between the two parties
and agreed with the assessment that much had bee achieved in
carrying out the accord, although a number of problems had to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
They also upheld the system of co-prime ministers making
regular reports to the King every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to create an ad hoc-group to completely review
the accord, and make amendments and additions to it in light of
current situations.
</P>
<P>
According to Sar Kheng, the ad-hoc group would submit a joint
report to the top leaders of the two parties after finishing their
assignments.
</P>
<P>
In order for the timely exchange of information and to tackle
rifts arising, Sar Kheng said a decision was reached at the
meeting to set up a permanent office of the compromising
committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation warned on Friday that players and officials will be
punished severely should they are caught of stimulating corruption
and violence.
</P>
<P>
"Asian football is on the move. We cannot afford to let
corruption in the guise of match-fixing or basically corrupt
players and officials impede this march towards progress," said
AFC secretary Peter Velappan in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued at the time when a Malaysian businessman
and three English soccer players are on trial in England on
charges of match fixing.
</P>
<P>
Former Liverpool and Southampton goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar
and former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers are accused of playing
fake games for money from gambling syndicates in Indonesia and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Heng Suan Lim acted as the British contact for the
syndicates and former Wimbledon striker John Fashanu handed over
the money. All the defendants have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
Velappan warned that his warning "should be taken seriously by
all those involved in football in Asia, and we will not be lenient
towards anyone found guilty of corrupt activities in Asian
football."

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Rules Out Deal With Laotian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen has ruled out a deal to allow the Laotian rebels to take
refuge in Cambodia in exchange for their promise to help undermine
the Khmer Rouge, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a school inauguration ceremony in Preah Vihear
province Thursday, Hun Sen said that "the Laotians who once
cooperated with the Khmer Rouge" promised to "help us fight the
Khmer Rouge and destroy their weapon warehouses," if "we agree to
provide them with an asylum at the border of the provinces of
Preah Vihear and Stung Treng."
</P>
<P>
The Laotians also promised to give 500,000 U.S. dollars in
medical supplies in exchange for areas to train their troops armed
with tanks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not accept the deal because it violates the sovereignty
of Laos," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the idea as "scandalous," he said the rebel group
might seek a Cambodian ally who would "use these Laotians, and the
Khmer Rouge, as a weapon."
</P>
<P>
He also accused some Cambodian generals and colonels of keeping
company of the Laotian rebels and giving them Cambodian military
uniforms and even taking them to vacations on the coast.
</P>
<P>
Warning them to stop the acts that "jeopardize our friendship
with Laos," he said "I made the revelations because I am afraid
someone else might agree to the deal although I have rejected it."

TOKYO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
approved today an additional spending to tighten security at its
diplomatic establishments abroad, the Kyodo news service reported.

<HEADLINE> 9th Five-Year Plan Approved by NDC in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Development
Council (NDC) of India has approved the approach document
envisaging 7 percent accelerated growth in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1998-2002).
</P>
<P>
A resolution to this effect was passed unanimously at the end
of the council's day-long meeting here on Thursday with a call
from Prime Minister Deve Gowda for collective efforts by the
center and states to raise resources to the tune of 8,750 billion
rupees (246.5 billion US dollars) for implementing the plan.
</P>
<P>
The NDC meeting also approved the investment rate of 28.6
percent, the savings rate of 26.2 percent and the expected
incremental capital output ratio of 4.08.
</P>
<P>
Virtually every chief minister favored a seven percent growth
rate for the ninth Five-Year plan, rejecting suggestions that a
lower growth rate may be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
They said that this was needed to meet the paramount objectives
of expanding productive employment, removing poverty and
generating adequate public resources to meet the basic social
needs of the growing population.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that seven percent growth rate will not happen
by itself. It requires higher rates of investment, higher savings
rate from both domestic and foreign sources and greater efficiency
and productivity from the investments made.
</P>
<P>
Endorsing the approach document, chief ministers of various
states and heads of union territories, however, demanded
decentralization of powers of the central government and
revolution of financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The National Development Council is composed of the chief
ministers of various states and heads of union territories with
the prime minister as its chairman.

<HEADLINE> Official Criticizes Human Rights Watch for Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the China Society
for the Study of Human Rights said in an interview with Xinhua
today that the Chapter on China of the "World Report 1997"
released by Human Rights Watch on December 4 last year contains
malicious and slanderous attacks against China's human rights
situation and is frivolous and unjust.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the report makes groundless accusations
and intentionally fabricates 10 to 20 so-called individual cases
in order to frame up charges on criminal violations of human
rights against China and vilify the country.
</P>
<P>
For example, he noted, the report describes Guo Haifeng, a
convicted rapist, as a "political prisoner", and says that Guo's
1996 imprisonment was the result of his "helping a third dissident
leader escape to the United States".
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation report, on January 25, 1991, Guo
was sentenced to four years in prison with a one-year deprival of
his political rights because of his law-violating offences. After
his parole in 1993, Guo was sent to work at the Jianchang
Machinery Plant in Xiangfan City, Hubei Province, in accordance
with his own wish.
</P>
<P>
However, Guo kept staying in Anyang City, Henan Province, where
he later raped six women, married or unmarried, in defiance of
laws, by tempting them with the ways of talking about love affairs
or buying houses, which constituted hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
Guo has confessed to all his crimes, which have been proven by
the evidence and testimony of many people.
</P>
<P>
On November 21, 1996, the Beiguan District Court in Anyang
City, Henan Province, sentenced Guo to five years in prison, after
hearing the case and in accordance with Clause one of Article 160
and Article 61 of the "Criminal Law of People's Republic of
China."
</P>
<P>
Guo received sentencing entirely because of hooliganism he had
committed and the story of his allegedly helping a dissident
escape to the United States is sheer fabrication, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Another example included in the report states, "Xiao Biguang, a
scholar from Beijing, was involved in unofficial labor and church
activities." And he was given "the maximum three-year labor
reeducation term in 1996."
</P>
<P>
The actual situation is: Xiao, with only a junior-school
educational background, was formerly a farmer in Dabu Village,
Shazhouba Township, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province. In 1987, he
went to Beijing University to attended classes and audited courses
in the history of ancient Chinese literature.

<P>
But Xiao passed himself off as "an associate professor and a
Ph.D from the Comparative Literature Institute of Beijing
University". He had namecards printed that read "Deputy Director,
Beijing Marginal Science and Technology New Products Manufacturing
Institute; Assistant to the General Manager, Beijing Ante Business
Development Corporation", and he openly swindled the public with
the phony titles and engaged in unlawful activities.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, 1994, Xiao was sentenced to three years education
through forced labor, with the approval of the Beijing Municipal
Administrative Committee of Reform-Through-Labor,
</P>
<P>
The report, which also calls Swindler Xiao a political prisoner,
does not speak the truth.
</P>
<P>
The report terms those criminals who have been convicted of
crimes such as hooliganism, swindling, bribery and embezzlement
and endangering the state security as "dissidents" and "political
prisoners." Furthermore, in the name of human rights, it openly
voices grievances for those criminals who were punished as part of
the "Strike Hard Campaign" for committing murder and robbery, and
for involvement in trafficking of narcotics, arms and even women
and children. This cannot but make the readers suspicious of its
true intentions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
What's worse, the official said, the report's chapter on China
ignores the fact that Tibet is an inseparable part of the Chinese
territory -- a truth that has been recognized by all countries in
the world -- by titling the chapter "China and Tibet" and thereby
purposefully implying a division exists between the two. This is
clearly disrespectful of China's state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and fully exposes the actual intention of the Human
Rights Watch to split China under the disguise of human
rights. Whether the Human Rights Watch is genuinely caring for
human rights, -- this itself very much merits our "watch".
</P>
<P>
The official noted that it is no accident that Human Rights
Watch neglected to observe rudimental professional ethics, and
wilfully distorted and frame so-called individual cases to make
unreasonable accusations against China.

<P>
Human Rights Watch was established during the period of the
Cold War to cater to the needs of the West in carrying out its
Cold War activities, and from the very beginning, it harbored a
deep-rooted political bias against socialist China, the official
said, adding that the West, particularly after the end of the Cold
War, has directed the target of attack on the human right issue
towards China.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch has become the most aggressive vanguard of
the anti-China force. In a coordinated move in January 1996,
Western nations raised an anti-China bill at the UN Human Rights
Commission, in which they had meticulously fabricated a report
that lied about a Chinese welfare institute maltreating and
killing orphanage, stirring up a Anti-China sinister wave.
</P>
<P>
In the report, they once again published lengthy accusations
against China. It is not strange to hurl charges at China, he
noted, because the starting point of the Human Rights Watch is not
based on the true conditions with China's human rights but the
political needs of the West.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Human Rights Watchers, as long as China remains
a socialist country, it will continue to be a "human
rights-violating state," no matter how much its economy has
developed, how much its society has progressed, how much the
living standards of its people has been raised, or how many
achievements it has scored in the country's democracy, legal
system and cultural and ethical progress been made.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report, the Human Rights Watch claims China has
become a country with a human rights situation that deteriorates
year by year, no matter how it has developed as far its human
rights are concerned. It has once again given the testimony of the
common saying: prejudice goes farther away from truth than
innocence.

At present, there are still confrontation and disputes in
international human rights sector, but the momentum of cooperation
and dialogues has also somewhat risen. Some far-sighted people in
the West have also held that the exerting pressure and antagonism
will have no way-out with regard to the issue of human rights in
China.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that Human Rights Watch, which is bent on
Cold War thinking, does not want to recognize the healthy
development of the international human rights cause and has spared
no effort in encircling and blocking China on the issue of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Such words and deeds cannot but be said as a "discordant voice"
that goes against the tide of our times. If Human Rights Watch
persists in acting as the instigator and troublemaker in creating
conflicts over the issue of human rights, it will certainly become
the hinder and stumbling block in the development of the world
human rights cause, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed his hope that Human Rights Watch will
seriously introspect its conduct and cease to play its inglorious
part in the area of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Withdraw From Hebron Army Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers left their
army headquarters in the West Bank city of Hebron before dawn
today, ending 30 years of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli news media reported that a convoy of Israeli army
jeeps drove out of the hilltop base toward the central part of
Hebron that Israel is to keep under a self-rule accord signed with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officers entered the headquarters, symbol of
Israel's rule over the city since the 1967 Middle East War, after
the Israeli soldiers left it.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal was included in an agreement on Israeli
troop redeployment in Hebron initialed by Israel and the
Palestinians Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Canada's Births Drop for Fifth Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Registered live births in Canada
fell by 1.8 percent to 378,011 in 1995, capping the fifth straight
year of dropping, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The fall reflects both the aging of the baby boomers and the
decline in the fertility rates among women under the age of 30,
the federal fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
The natural increase of the population, calculated by
subtracting the number of deaths from births, continued to drop in
1995. It decreased by six percent from the previous year to
167,278.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate, the average number of baby births per woman
in the country fell to 1.64 in 1995 from 1.66 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Canadian mothers were getting older, the agency
said. The average age of women who gave birth in 1995 was 28.8,
compared with 28.6 in 1994 and 26.0 in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Women aged 30 and over accounted for 42.6 percent of all births
in 1995, up from 27.9 percent in 1985 and 19.2 percent in 1975,
the agency added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today condemned the explosions at an abortion clinic in
Atlanta as a "vile and malevolent crime" and vowed the
perpetrators would be severly punished.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who brings violence against a woman trying to exercise
her constitutional rights is committing an act of terror. It is
always wrong. And it should be punished severely," Clinton said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has a right to use violence in America to advance their
own convictions over the rights of others." he said, adding "We
will get to the bottom of this, and we will punish those
responsible to the fullest extent the law provides."

Two explosions erupted inside and outside a building housing

abortion center in the city was evacuated after receiving a bomb
threat.

public-sector jute and textile mills and search for a remedy,

The committee was formed at a meeting held Thursday with Prime

<P>
The state-run jute and textile mills, once the cornerstone of
this country's economy, had been disinvested earlier but were
closed down later due to the huge losses they had run up over the

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Approves New Security Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament today
approved a "National Security Doctrine," whose fundamental
principle is Ukraine's entry into all international security
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Chernoshenko, vice-chairman the Ukrainian State Committee
on Security and Defense, today praised parliament for passing the
doctrine, calling it an important step in standardizing national
laws.
</P>
<P>
The doctrine clearly sets out the jurisdiction of all
departments involved in national security and methods of
democratic and civil supervision of the military.
</P>
<P>
It gives human rights top priority in the protection of the
national security and promises to eliminate real and potential
threats against Ukraine's security.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has spent five years drafting the security doctrine.
Work began in 1991 when the state gained independence. Parliament
carried out the first reading of the doctrine in May 1995 and sent
it back for revision in accordance with the Ukraine Constitution.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to open South Asian
markets to Thai products, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Pitak
Intrawithayanunt is arranging a trip to the region to pave the way
for visits by other leading Thai figures.
</P>
<P>
The trip, which is to take place in early March, will take him
to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, according to a Foreign
Ministry source today.
</P>
<P>
Pitak's trip is likely to be followed by visits by the
government's special adviser on economic and foreign affairs and
former Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and even by Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh himself.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Chatichai and Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn stressed opening up markets in the subcontinent for
Thailand's sluggish export sector.
</P>
<P>
South Asia has not been Thailand's traditional export markets.
Thailand's major trading partners are ASEAN nations, the United
States, Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The three South Asian countries, with a total population of
about 1.1 billion, have great potentials for Thailand's exports
and investments, the source noted.

NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mauritanian
President Maaouya Ahmed Taya said here today that his country
will, as always, continue developing friendly cooperative
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania has enjoyed a stable political situation in recent
years, and is striving to develop its economy and improve its
people's living standards, Taya told Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Qian arrived here this afternoon for
a 24-hour official visit.
</P>
<P>
Taya said his country stuck to a foreign policy of
independence, peace and neutrality, and had resolutely and
patiently resisted external pressure over past years.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who paid his first visit to the African nation in 1993,
said that China and Mauritania have developed effective friendly
cooperative ties in politics, economy, trade and culture, since
diplomatic relations were set up in 1965.
</P>
<P>
China attached importance to developing ties with Mauritania,
and was willing, together with the African nation, to consolidate
and develop bilateral friendly cooperation, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Both countries belonged to the developing world, and shared
similar or identical views on many major international issues, he
noted. He added that the two had cooperated closely in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that all nations, big or small, strong or weak,
were equal members of the international community, and had the
right to participate in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
World nations should support each other so as to achieve common
development, and intervention in other countries' internal affairs
should be opposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
China was willing, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,
to strengthen and develop cooperation with Mauritania in various
fields, said the Chinese vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Qian visited Niger, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe,

<HEADLINE> 1997 Modest Economic Growth Expected in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy is expected to
grow by 2.9 percent this year as a result of lower interest rates,
a private think tank said today.
</P>
<P>
"The stronger outlook for 1997 reflects the impact of lower
interest rates on residential investment and business plant and
equipment spending," the Conference Board of Canada said in its
latest Canadian Outlook.
</P>
<P>
It also forecasts the Canadian economy will grow 2.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the board noted that the positive effects of lower
interest rates are being undermined by extremely high household
debt, weak job creation and deep public sector spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians remain concerned about high household debt, job
security and income prospects," said Jim Frank, the board's vice
president and chief economist.
</P>
<P>
With domestic demand growth less than 2 percent, an output gap
exceeding 4 percent, and severe government cutbacks, a further 25
basis point easing in Canadian short-term rates is anticipated by
mid-1997, the board added.
</P>
<P>
The board also expects further appreciation of the Canadian
dollar, saying the currency is forecast to reach 76.5 U.S. cents
by the end of 1998. It is now trading at 75 U.S. cents. Some
analysts believe the currency could go as high as 78 cents this
year.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Considers U.S. Sanction Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentinian President
Carlos Menem has labelled "unjust" the United States' decision to
withdraw 50 percent of Argentina's duty-free privileges in the
America's market.
</P>
<P>
"It is a completely unfair sanction which does not agree with
reality," President Menem said today on state television.
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced
her government's decision Wednesday to put higher tariffs on 260
million U.S. dollars worth of trade with Argentina, but to suspend
it until March 1, giving both countries time to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
United States pharmaceutical companies complained that their
products were not being protected by Argentina's current copyright
laws and demanded the Clinton government sanction Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The Argentinian Congress has approved a bill, at the call of
Cilfa (the organization representing Argentinian laboratories),
which permits the country's pharmaceutical industry to copy
foreign companies' patents over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Despite of his regret, President Menem said the U.S. measure
would not damage bilateral relations and Argentina would seek to
settle the dispute through dialogue.

Chirac said he supported Hungary's efforts to join NATO and the
European Union (EU) as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Talking about national border issues and conflicts between
minority nationalities in Europe, Chirac said these historical
problems must be solved before they develop into full-scale
conflicts as they are connected with the security of Europe as a
whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac praised Hungary's attempts to secure peace with its
neighbors. Hungary has signed agreements with several European
neighbors including Slovakia and Romania.

OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy rose slightly to
new highs for men and women in Canada in 1995, while the gap
between the sexes narrowed, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy was 81.3 years for females and 75.3 for males,
representing a gain of 0.1 years for women and 0.2 years for men
over 1994, the federal fact-gathering agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the gap in life expectancy between Canadian men
and women, which was 6.0 years in 1995, had narrowed considerably
over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, life expectancy was 7.0 years longer for women than
for men. The gap peaked at 7.5 years in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, life expectancy had gone from 69.7 to
75.3 for Canadian men, and from 76.8 to 81.3 years for Canadian
women. For both sexes combined, it rose from 73.1 years to 78.3,
an average annual gain of 0.22 years.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Japan had the highest life expectancy in 1995,
82.8 for females and 76.4 for males.
</P>
<P>
Among Canada's 10 provinces, British Columbia had the highest
life expectancy, 79.0 years for both sexes combined, while
Newfoundland had the lowest at 77.3.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in the two territories was well below that of
the province, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the infant mortality rate in Canada was down slightly,
to 6.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births from 6.3 in 1994.

WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- American balloonist Steve
Fossett was on his way to complete the Atlantic crossing for a
non-stop around-the-world adventure, according to his spokesman on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Fossett was 460 kms east of the Azores,
approaching the coast of Africa at a speed of 170 kms per hour,
said Ivory Akande.
</P>
<P>
Fossett flew his balloon "Solo Spirit" at an altitude of 8,000
meters, hoping to become the first person to travel around the
world non-stop in a balloon.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the American was seven hours from Gibraltar and he
would arrive in Morocco by Friday, said Akande.
</P>
<P>
After crossing Morocco, Fossett will fly over Algeria and Libya
or change course over Nigeria and Chad should Libya turn down the
request.
</P>
<P>
A Chicago stockbroker, Fossett, 52, had a distance record in a
hot-air balloon. In February 1995, he traveled 8,700 kilometers
from Seoul to Saskatchewan, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two other teams of balloonists failed in their
attempts to fly around the world starting from Morocco and
Switzerland.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- HIV virus carriers now number
2,105 people in Russia, of which, nearly half were infected last
year with the virus that leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Public Health Ministry announced this at a
press conference today. They attributed it mainly to more and
more drug addicts being infected by the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Drug-takers usually shared syringes when they got intravenous
injections, making it very possible to spread the virus, they said.
</P>
<P>
Drug addicts infected with the virus increased from three in
the first six months of last year to 600 in the last six months of
the year, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that about 100,000 people in Russia would be
infected with the virus by the end of this year, and the figure
would soar to 500,000 next year.

QUITO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Social Christian Party
presidential candidate Jaime Nebot filed a court suit today before
the Supreme Court of Justice against President Abdala Bucaram,
alleging offense.
</P>

A week ago President Bucaram charged Nebot with "stealing" five
million U.S.dollars during the construction of the thoroughfare
around Guayaquil. Nebot was a former governor of the state of
Guayas.
</P>
<P>
Nebot said: "I am not going to fall into Bucaram's trap by
occupying my time to comment on his outrages and offenses, and
abandoning my responsibility of defending the people's interests,
now seriously affected by the stringent measures of this
government."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Controls on New Department Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has decided
to watch new department store construction closer to avoid
overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the city, which has some 11 million people,
will delay or halt construction of some new department stores in
keeping with its macro-economic readjustment principles.
</P>
<P>
The city has 65 large department stores of over 10,000 square
meters each, 17 of which opened just last year. Another 110 stores
are planned or under construction in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1990, the number had grown to only eight. Experts
note that the current department store boom is characterized by
redundant construction, too rapid growth, and poorly-chosen
locations, all of which have led to lower profits or big losses in
some stores, or even the closing down of a commercial complex,
like the one on Xidan Street.
</P>
<P>
To find better locations, coordinate development, and avoid
overlapping stores, the municipal government will impose stricter
controls on new department store applications and offer assistance
to low-profit communities.
</P>
<P>
A popular pastime for local residents has been going shopping
at the big new department stores over the weekend, but that
pleasurable activity is becoming more difficult when it comes to
choosing where to go because of the large number of new stores.
</P>
<P>
But department stores still mean big business and big profits
in China and a lot more people want to open big department stores
in many other Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Renews Call for Formation of New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's ruling Socialist Party
(SP) today called on outgoing President Zheliu Zhelev to fulfill
his constitutional duty by authorizing the SP to form a new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The party, which is under heavy pressure from the opposition
and the president to call an early general election, hoped to get
the right to form a new government headed by SP candidate Nikolai
Dobrev, party chairman Georgi Parvanov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the SP was prepared to negotiate with other parties
over early parliamentary elections. He said the SP had agreed to
hold elections at the end of this year, but that an interim
government to rule until then must be led by Dobrev.
</P>
<P>
The SP was ready to negotiate with the United Democratic Front,
the main opposition party, and other political forces over a
national crisis plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with SP leaders Wednesday, President-elect Petar
Stoianov, who will take office next Wednesday, said that from a
legal point of view, the SP should have the right to form the new
government and called on political forces to compromise on basic
issues.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis in Bulgaria was sparked last month when
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned amid criticism over the
country's economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The SP, which leads the coalition government and is only half
way through its four-year term, nominated Interior Minister
Nikolai Dobrev as new prime minister on January 8.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, however, did not want another SP-led government
and demanded early parliamentary elections and organized protest
rallies to back their demands.
</P>
<P>
Street protests have been a daily event in the country since
the new year and on January 10, demonstrators descended on the
parliament building, clashing with police. Schools, hospitals and
factories have held a range of protests and students have also
taken to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is facing a severe economic crisis. In the first two
weeks of this month alone, the inflation rate reached 30.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to 500
million U.S. dollars, but the country needs to pay back 1.3
billion dollars in loans this year. The International Monetary
Fund is waiting to start negotiations with the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that no single party in Bulgaria can handle the
crisis alone, which could only be overcome through joint efforts
by an alliance of various forces.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mount Merapi's Activity Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The activity of Mount Merapi,
Indonesia's most active volcano, decreased Thursday but residents
in nearby villages were asked to remain alert for possible
eruptions, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 2,911-meter-high volcano, located on the Central Java and
Yogjakarta border, still gushed burning lava and spewed hot ash
into the air but with less intensity than Wednesday, said
officials monitoring Merapi's activity.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the nearby regencies of Boyolali, Klaten and
Magelang are keeping the level of danger at "stand-by alert,"
asking people to be prepared for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Since the alert level was raised earlier this week, the volcano
has been closed to mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
Tourist spots near the mountain, especially in the Kaliurang
resort area, have also been closed until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, which dominates the flat plain of southern Java, last
erupted in 1994, killing more than 60 people and forcing more than
6,000 others to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one of 127 volcanoes in the country and has also been
classified as the most active one in the world.

LHASA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central government
and local governments in other parts of China have helped Tibet
Autonomous Region complete 56 projects over the past two years, in
a drive to aid its development.
</P>
<P>
Six other projects are still under construction in Tibet. This
scale of construction has never been seen before in the region,
said local officials.
</P>
<P>
To help with the projects, 165 teams of workers have been sent
to the region. The projects cost a total investment of 3.52
billion yuan (about 424 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 56 projects mean that Tibetans will have an additional 206
million kilowatt hours of electricity annually, and seven counties
will be lit up at night.

<P>
KIEV, January 16 (Xinhua) -- One thousand generals and officers
will be sacked from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and military
commands this year as high debts force the country to make
sweeping budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 military units and organizations will also be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said the ministry will get
only one quarter of the money it needs from the 1997 budget,
forcing him to launch a major reform of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Given its limited funds, the ministry is to focus on developing
medium-sized bombers, fighters and missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's economic crisis has forced the defense ministry to
tighten its belt and even sell military assets to raise money.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it raked in 32.6 million hryvnas (about 17.6 million
U.S. dollars) from sales. Some 70 percent of the money was used to
modernize weapons and military technology and 30 percent to build
houses.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentinian President
Carlos Menem has labelled "unjust" the United States' decision to
withdraw 50 percent of Argentina's duty-free privileges in the
America's market.
</P>
<P>
"It is a completely unfair sanction which does not agree with
reality," President Menem said today on state television.
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced
her government's decision Wednesday to put higher tariffs on 260
million U.S. dollars worth of trade with Argentina, but to suspend
it until March 1, giving both countries time to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
United States pharmaceutical companies complained that their
products were not being protected by Argentina's current copyright
laws and demanded the Clinton government sanction Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The Argentinian Congress has approved a bill, at the call of
Cilfa (the organization representing Argentinian laboratories),
which permits the country's pharmaceutical industry to copy
foreign companies' patents over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Despite of his regret, President Menem said the U.S. measure
would not damage bilateral relations and Argentina would seek to
settle the dispute through dialogue.

<P>
VIENNA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million people, some
13 percent of the population, live in poverty in Austria, press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
More than half the total, or 500,000 people, are workers,
office workers and government functionaries and nearly an eighth,
130,000, are retired people, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that 14 percent of Austria's manufacturing
workers, 310,000, live in poverty, as do seven percent (190,000)
of office and government workers. Just over half the unemployed,
70,000 people, are also poor, as are 22 percent of farm laborers,
accounting for 70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The major causes of poverty are the death of a spouse, divorce,
unemployment, heavy debts and low income including pensions,
said Austria's labour union.
</P>
<P>
Government's plans to cut expenditure have also added to the
burden of poverty, the union said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices went up
at sales this week, with the eastern market indicator jumping 33
cents to close at 6.17 Australian dollars (4.93 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said that in
the two weeks of selling since the mid-season Christmas break, the
indicator has risen by nearly 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said prices soared during the week across all micron
categories, with the largest increases recorded for wool of 21
microns and finer.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that the boosted prices followed the lowest
weekly offering for the season to date of 53,460 bales at Sydney
and Geelong, resulting in an overall pass-in rate of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"While there is good demand for the best quality wool on offer,
exporters report that the overall market sentiment is being driven
by the relatively small quantities rostered for sale in January,"
ACWE added.
</P>
<P>
The Wool International, while commenting upon the wool prices,
said that due to gradually strengthening demand in Western Europe
and steady demand in China, the price is expected to rise further.

<HEADLINE> Huber Enters Last 16 in Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Anke Huber became
the first player to sail into the last 16 of the Australian Open
on Friday by beating Natasha Zvereva in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
By nipping Zvereva 7-5, 6-0 in 65 minutes, Huber who ranked
seventh in the world, strode a step closer towards her second
successive final at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
As usual, Huber had a slow start with her first game broken but
found her rhythm in time to come out of the shadow of the collapse
of her mother.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Zvereva who made her name by winning 15
doubles grand slam titles, was distracted and ran out of steam.
</P>
<P>
Huber rallied to tie 5-5 in the first set and ran towards the
victory by taking eight games in a row.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Huber lost to Monica Selea in the final in Melbourne.

<HEADLINE> Income of Chinese Farmers Inreasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The per capita annual net
income of farmers in China was figured at 1,750 yuan in 1996, 290
yuan more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Good harvests of principal crops such as grain, oil-bearing
plants, and sugarcane was given as the major reason for the
increase, "Economic Information Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Other things contributing to the increase were the higher price
of grain and the development of rural industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita income of farmers in
economically-developed east China was up by 383 yuan last year to
2,374 yuan, while income of farmers in the country's western part
averaged 988 yuan, a rise of 154 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the income of rural residents in western
China was 60 percent lower than for those in eastern China, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The income of each farmer in rural Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, was 3,595 yuan, 4.5 times as much as that of a
farmer in poverty-stricken Guizhou province in the southwest.

<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's postal and health care
services have given the stamp of approval to a new way of getting
information about healthcare.
</P>
<P>
A new kind of postcard, which combines the postal service and
health care information, has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
The postcards can be bought for ten yuan in post offices around
the country. Users then mail the cards with details of their
names and questions about health care, and will get prompt and
efficient answers.
</P>
<P>
The use of the postcards is considered a social service and has
gained solid support from the China Hospital Management
Association of the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the association, hundreds of medical
experts have set up seven large medical data banks, including the
national medical experts' data bank, the national special clinics
data bank, the national medical organizations' data bank, the
national pharmaceutical manufacturers' data bank, the national
medical equipment data bank, the national commercial medical
organizations' data bank and the national patients' cases data
bank.

<HEADLINE> Soccer City Gives Foul Language the Boot (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese soccer city has cried
foul on the use of four-letter words.
</P>
<P>
Soccer venues are usually the place for outbursts of wild
enthusiasm, particularly when clubs are hunting league titles.
</P>
<P>
Dalian's soccer team clinched the 1996 professional
championship, while their football stadium beat off all rivals to
gain the award for the most polite and orderly sporting venue.
</P>
<P>
Today's well mannered Dalian is a far cry from the city of
years ago. Then north China's largest port in Bohai Bay was noted
for its quarreling, as well as the most uncontrollable soccer
venue.
</P>
<P>
At that time, urban dwellers fell out with people from other
places, and often hurled a string of four-letter words in their
verbal attacks.
</P>
<P>
One time, an overseas Chinese bus passenger politely asked
whether the next stop was the People's Square, his intended
destination. But the response from the bus conductor was
"Nao-You-Bing," meaning "dummy". The impolite aside greatly
infuriated the overseas traveler.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the phrase "Nao-You-Bing" had been the most used
expression in some Dalianers' daily vocabularies in the past.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in Dalian, the most economically developed city
in Liaoning Province, were concerned about the state of
impoliteness, which also worried the city government.
</P>
<P>
Now a city-wide clean-up campaign has eradicated bad language,
and brought in a new era of politeness to Dalian.
</P>
<P>
"Spoken dirty words are sure signs of low individual moral
qualities," said Bo Xilai, Dalian's mayor. "This could stain the
city's image and block our opening endeavors as well."
</P>
<P>
Thus, the city government initiated the massive politeness
project last June, urging the people to comply with moral
standards and speak in a polite way.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is part of the city's drive for ethical and cultural
progress, as a gesture to respond to the country's endeavor for
building modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all urban residents actively responded to the call,
outlawing callous talk, dirty words and even local accents when
talking with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Local TV stations have broadcast a discussion program on "how
to be a polite Dalianer" among over 50,000 people in the downtown
districts of Zhongshan and Ganjingzi.
</P>
<P>
The staff in the Dalian Weiman Clothes Company, reputed for its
men's suits, also started their own soul-searching bid.
</P>
<P>
Workers in the company's tailoring department, once renowned as
"kings of dirty words", have created a successful method of
counting oral politeness violations of individuals on a specially
designed form on the wall.
</P>
<P>
The department made quick progress, resulting in a politeness
award issued by their boss.
</P>
<P>
The dirty-word fight has become popular across the board
throughout the city, and the result has turned out to be a
success, which is in step with its fast economic growth and the
residents' improved living standard.
</P>
<P>
In addition to outlawing four-letter words, local officials
called on people to study and practice 50 common daily English
expressions, in urgent need of the city's ambition to be more
foreign-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, China has started a massive clean-language campaign
in its tertiary sectors and governmental institutions, including
department stores, restaurants and police stations, to help
improve service quality. Dalian is one of the most successful
cities in this effort.

<HEADLINE> New Droppler's Meteorological Radar Station Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A highly sophisticated radar
device that can forecast typhoons and fierce storms has been built
in China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new 1.87 million US dollar installation is the second
Droppler's radar station -- a state major science advancement
project -- built in China. It has gone into operation in
Guangdong's Shantou city.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kejian, director of the Shantou Meterological Bureau,
said the high-tech radar system has been installed in the city to
improve the monitoring and forecasting of typhoons, torrential
rainstorms and thunderstorms that often hit the city.
</P>
<P>
He said only a few countries, such as the United States and
Canada, have so far developed the high-tech radar
system. Droppler's radar is much superior in detecting natural
disasters than the widely used meteorological radar equipment.
</P>
<P>
The building of the new radar station was completed in three
years. The station includes a special highway to the Qingyunyan
Mountain where the radar station is located, a 1,600 square-meter
building and a telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the computerized system can provide 13 kinds of
radar images which can quickly be transmitted to Beijing and the
provincial capital of Guangzhou by connecting the special computer
system to computers in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the new radar station will prove to be very
helpful in forecasting natural disasters, boosting disaster-relief
work in the city.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Fails to Meet Privatization Earnings Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government earned
5.6 billion pesos (213.7 million U.S. dollars) from its
privatization program in 1996, or a mere one-fourth of the
targeted 21.5 billion pesos (820 million dollars), a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in privatization receipts will probably prevent
the government from attaining the 17.5 billion pesos (668 million
dollars) budget surplus it had projected for 1996, the paper Today
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has yet to announce its actual budget surplus
for 1996, but has already hinted that this might fall below the
full-year target.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance attributed the lower-than-expected
privatization revenues to the government's continued failure to
dispose of some of its big-ticket assets including the Food
Terminal Inc.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of state-owned assets, which began in 1986,
has been a major source of revenue for the cash-starved government
to beef up its budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the government posted for the first time a budget
surplus of nearly 15 billion pesos (573 million dollars) after
selling off assets worth more than 40 billion pesos (1.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the government has come under fire from economists and
fiscal experts for relying too much on earnings from privatization
to attain a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
To lessen fiscal reliance on non-recurring revenue sources, the
government began to pin hopes on its comprehensive tax reform
program to increase tax collections. Most parts of the program
have been passed by the Congress and will take effect later this
year.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Buy More Hi-tech Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Patterns of consumer spending
in Guangzhou are changing as people's residual income rises,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Though private cars will continue to be a long-term dream for
most, average families already possess the whole range of
household appliances, a consumer survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Hi-fi systems, personal computers, air-conditioners and
large-screen television sets will top the shopping lists of
consumers in Guangzhou this year, the survey, covering 600
families in 25 areas of Guangzhou, suggests.
</P>
<P>
Over Spring Festival in February, clothing, electrical
appliances, health-care products and tourism services will be in
high demand.
</P>
<P>
Japanese-made television sets, which have flooded into China's
major cities since the 1980s, are still the first choice, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
More than 28 percent of the families interviewed owned

were planning to replace old sets with larger ones in 1997.

<P>
Air-conditioners were little used in Guangzhou until the
1990s. But the city's hot and humid sub-tropical climate has
persuaded nearly 50 percent of Guangzhou families to equip
themselves with air-conditioners, a lower percentage than Shenzhen
but much more higher than Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Last year, sales of air-conditioners in Guangzhou increased by
11.8 percent. Experts predict a similar rise this year.
</P>
<P>
Telephones, a symbol of social status five years ago, now ring
in 80 percent of Guangzhou homes. Though the average family makes
less than two calls per day, 10 percent of families said they were
going to purchase mobile phones this year.
</P>
<P>
About 18 percent of families owned personal computers. Most
families seldom used their computers this year. Sales increased
by 7.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to Guangzhou's traffic jams, the rate of ownership of
private cars is lower than in Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
But 25 percent of families owned motorcycles, which are much
more common in south China.

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso won the first round in his bid for
reelection when the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill today
which would allow him to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
A special Chamber commission voted 19 to 11 in favor of the law
which will now go to the Senate for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if it becomes law, would change the current
constitution under which the president, governors, and mayors
cannot serve for more than one term of office.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso, who was elected president in January 1995, is seeking
a second term of office at the next presidential election at the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president has enough support to get the bill through the
Senate, but still needs to drum up backing in the Chamber
assembly, sources say.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that 70 percent of the population supports
Cardoso's reelection because of his success in managing the
economy and reducing inflation.

<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Liberian soccer player George Weah
said he may boycott the awarding ceremony of FIFA'S Fair Play in
Lisbon this year due to a legal action against him.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment I am not really planning to go to Lisbon on
Monday," said Weah, the 1995 FIFA world player of the year.
</P>
<P>
During a European Champions' League match in Portugal, Weah of
AC Milan was accused of butting Portuguese Jorge Costa in head and
the latter has filed a suit against the "Fair Play" winner.
</P>
<P>
"Jorge Costa has still not withdrawn his legal action and, by
going to Portugal, I would face not only legal risks but also an
enormous amount of local pressure," Weah said.
</P>
<P>
And Weah has expressed his worries to FIFA general secretary
Sepp Blatter, requesting guarantees from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Last month Weah apologised to FIFA for his rude behavior which
led to his six-match ban.

MEXICO CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City will host the
Second International Congress for Disabled Persons from March 12

Vulnerable Groups said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Mexican Autism Society and the

with access to the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to call for the ratification of Accord
159 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which sets down
the right of the disabled to be admitted into the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Leon Robles, president of the association, said tax
rebates will be promoted to encourage companies to implement
programs for training disabled people to provide them with working
skills.
</P>
<P>
One of the obstacles these persons met when they tried to enter
the labor market was the lack of training and of sensibility on
the part of employers, Robles said.

PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- TV replays will not be allowed to
be exploited to interrupt the course of soccer games, said a top
official of the sport's world governing body FIFA.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, FIFA general secretary, said "we must never allow
television to influence the decisions of referees" because soccer
was a sport played and watched by human being.
</P>
<P>
"Referees will always make errors but we have to live with
those because that is what the game is all about," said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
He explained that TV replays will be used for disciplinary
matters but never to change decisions made on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Blatter made these remarks when he arrive here for next
summer's Four Nation Tournoi de France which features Brazil,
England, Italy and the host.
</P>
<P>
During the tournament, referees and their assistants will be

<HEADLINE> Brazil Increases its Foreign Debt Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will pay off 17.5
billion U.S. dollars from the principal of its foreign debt this
year, a 50 percent increase over 1996, the Brazilian Central Bank
said today.
</P>
<P>
A bank communique said today that in 1997 the country would
disburse much more of the interest on its foreign debt than in
1996 when 11.3 billion dollars in interest was paid up to last
November, 10 percent more than 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise in payments was attributed to a bigger inflow of
capital into Brazil and better conditions on the reimbursements,
Geres Ayres, adjunct head of the Central Bank's Foreign Debt
Department, said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's foreign debt rose from 129.3 billion dollars in 1995
to 159 billion dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Gold Output Up, Copper Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Gold production at the
Philippines' commercial mines rose to 16,900 kilograms in 1996, up
36.55 percent from 12,400 kilograms in 1995, according to the
latest figures of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
The Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau of the department placed the
value of the 1996 gold output of local mining firms at 5.6 billion
pesos (213.7 million U.S. dollars), or 41.6 percent more than the
previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, domestic production of copper nosedived by 49.8
percent in 1996 to 51,552 tons from 102,637 tons in 1995, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The lower output sent the country's copper revenues plunging by
51.8 percent to 2.8 billion pesos last year from 5.8 billion in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the decline in domestic copper production
last year to the temporary closure of two major mining firms --
Marcopper Mining Corp. and Maricalum Mining.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of 88 Killed in Bosnian War to Be Exchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Commission
for prisoner release and exchange of dead bodies said on Thursday
that Serbs and Muslims would soon exchange 88 bodies.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the state commission Jovo Rosic told Tanjug in Serb
city Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia that the exchange would be
made within the next 10 days under an accord reached in Banja Luka
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Rosic said Muslim Commission Chairman Amor Masovic had agreed
that the bodies of 50 killed Serbs should be turned over to the
Serb Republic in the next 10 days at the latest, in exchange for
the exhumation of 38 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
although the Bosnian civil war was ended more than a year ago,
thousands of people from the three ethnic groups are missing, many
of whom are believed to be killed and buried in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
Rosic also said that an agreement had been struck with Bosnian
Croat Commission Chairman Berislav Pusic a week ago to open mass
graves of Serbs in Grahovo and Jajce, central Bosnian towns which
had been in Serb control until the Muslim-Croat offensive in
Autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The exhumations, however, would have to be postponed because of
a thick blanket of snow and poor weather conditions, and would
certainly be carried out as soon as the situation on the ground
allowed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Starts Talks with Egypt, Russia on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish government ministers have
started urgent talks with their counterparts from Egypt and Russia
in an attempt to dissuade them from extending their bans on Irish
beef exports, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has imposed a six-month ban on Irish live cattle and
Russia has threatened to extend its three-month exports ban since
the Irish government announced earlier this month the number of
new cases of mad cow disease last year had reached a record high
of 73.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Russian government delegations have arrived in
Dublin to decide whether Ireland's claims that it had the world's
most stringent controls were enough to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Egyptian and Russian exports, the biggest importers
outside the European Union (EU), could cost the Irish beef
industry 240 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An Irish Ministry of Agriculture spokesman is quoted as saying
earlier today: "When you consider that we have seven million head
of cattle, 73 cases is not many."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Irish farmers blame the government for not
controlling the use of scrapie-infected bone and meat feed, which
is believed to be the cause of mad cow disease.

No venue for the briefing has been agreed yet, according to

place in the past.
</P>

The proposal for four-party talks, grouping DPRK, South Korea,

today met with his foreign policy advisers to work out his
second-term strategic goal in European security, including the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the hour-long meeting
was the first in a series of foreign policy meetings Clinton will
hold in coming weeks on U.S. global strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The future of a united integrated Europe and Russia's

As a measure to calm the Russians, alliance officials want to
negotiate a special charter with Moscow that would ensure Russia
did not feel excluded from the new European security structures
but was engaged in a close and cooperative relationship with NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana is to begin negotiations
in Moscow on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
on the charter, in which Russians want the West guarantee that
NATO would not deploy nuclear weapons on the soil of the proposed
new members.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States and its allies were
discussing ways to let Russia consult on NATO operations in the
same way NATO and Russia worked together toward achieving peace in
Bosnia. But NATO would not give Russia the veto power over NATO
decisions.

Clinton and his top aides have identified six strategic global

relationship with Asia, dealing with challenges of terrorism, drug
trafficking and international crime proliferation, dealing with
regional disputes, according to McCurry.

WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 51 million U.S. dollar loan to help finance the Natural
Resources Management and Poverty Alleviation project in the Sierra
region of Peru.
</P>
<P>
The project will help improve water and natural resource
management in the seven most poverty-stricken districts of the
Sierra mountains.
</P>
<P>
The project is also designed to help adjust land use to soil
characteristics, increase production of fertile lands and convert
marginal and erosion-prone soils into stable soils suitable for
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the World Bank loan, local community labor will
contribute some 28 million dollars to the total project cost of 93

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Political Difference Must Not Block Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday political and party disputes should be
resolved in a constructive and democratic way, in which the
government and its ministries have a special role.
</P>
<P>
While discussing economic situation and new year economic
policies with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, Milosevic
said political differences should not be the cause of any blockade
in the economic development and normal life, official news agency
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also noted that the safeguarding and strengthening of
the country's political stability "is of immense importance for
Serbia, since confrontations effected by political differences
inflict both political and great economic damage on the country
and impede the attainment of developmental, economic and social
goals.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian opposition coalition Zajedno has been staging
protest demonstrations over the past 58 days in capital Belgrade
over the annulment of the November 17 local election results,
causing a political crisis in the Yugoslav republic. Zajedno
claims victory in 14 big cities in Serbia and demands the full
recognition of their victory in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Karjanovic had also discussed about preparations
for structural and ownership changes in the republic's economy,
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government and other institutions are working on
adjusting economic legislation to the needs of effective economic
activity and a speedy integration of the Yugoslav economy into
world economic processes, it added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is eager to join some key international financial
institutions which can provide large sum of loan to revive its
economy wrecked by the four-year international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian president and the premier agreed that the economic
policy for 1997 should also be based on reforms, with the reform
of banking system as priority, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
President Milosevic underscored the great importance of the
upcoming changes, and said the reforms would step up economic
recovery and open prospects for stepped-up development, as major
conditions of the country's stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street edged to
new highs today after recovering from an afternoon pullback
spurred by another increase in interest rates in a jittery bond
market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 38.49 to 6,765.37,
barely beating Tuesday's record finish at 6,762.29.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer set its seventh new high in nine
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly an 8-to-7
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume reaching
532.31 million shares, slightly more than 525.02 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 2.55 to 769.75, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 1.08 to 406.12, both setting new
highs.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.93 to 1,340.46, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.88 to 587.36.
</P>
<P>
Computer-related issues led the early advance as investors
reacted enthusiastically to more better-than-expected earnings
news from leading technology concerns such as Sun Microsystems and
Digital Equipment.
</P>
<P>
Bonds moved lower in the morning after the Labor Department
reported that the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits
fell last week to a three-month low.
</P>
<P>
As bonds fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose from late Wednesday's 6.79 percent to nearly 6.86 percent
before settling at about 6.83 percent.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Attack Injures Two People in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Two people were injured in a
car bomb explosion in Yugoslavia's southern city Pristina early
Thursday, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
University Chancellor Radivoje Papovic and his driver Nikola
Lalic were injured when the explosion occurred about 50 meters
from Papovic's home at 8:45 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The Audi, carrying Papovic, was thrown off several meters by
the bomb, activated in a parked car.
</P>
<P>
The two injured were taken immediately to a hospital in
Pristina, the capital city of Kosovo province, for treatment.
Tanjug quoted hospital sources as saying that they were hurt in
head and body but not in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility to the attack and police have
been making investigation on the incident.
</P>
<P>
An examining magistrate in Kosovo said on Thursday that
morning's attack on the Pristina University chancellor had all the
hallmarks of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Pristina magistrate Danica Maksimovic said the explosion had
taken place in a side-street in Pristina, had been activated from
a distance, Tanjug reported from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Papovic, who was hurt in the eye, was later flown to a Belgrade
eye clinic for further treatment after he and Lalic had been
treated for head and body injuries and burns, Pristina Surgical
Clinic Administrator Andrija Tomanovic said later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the terrorist attack was condemned by the ruling
Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SPS main committee press service said in a statement that
acts of provoking of and inciting to inter-ethnic enmity and
hatred were aimed at jeopardizing peaceful coexistence of all
citizens of Serbia's southern province of Kosovo based on the
principles of national equality.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia's citizens will not allow Serbia and Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to be destabilized by internal enemies working
against the interests of their own country backed by foreign
factors," it said.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million population are
ethnic Albanians who wish to gain independence from Yugoslavia and
merge with neighboring Albania. There have been many clashes
between local Albanians and Serbian police in the province in the
past, leaving dozens dead and injured.

<HEADLINE> French Export Insurance Group Says Asia Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite the slow-down of its
economic growth, Asia remains the most attractive market for
French enterprises to sell their consumption products and
equipments, the French export insurance group, Compagnie Francaise
pour le Commerce Exterieur (COFACE), said today.
</P>
<P>
"China, South Korea, Thailand, (the Chinese province of)
Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore figure
among the all primary priorities'' for French enterprises to
export their products, said the study by COFACE.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Asian market as having "the strongest potential
of development" in the world, the COFACE said that except in
Vietnam, Pakistan and Myanmar, French enterprises can have
business there with weak or moderate risks.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from the World Bank, COFACE said that by the
year 2005, Asia -- without taking into account Japan -- will be
the biggest producer in the world in terms of the real purchasing
power of its local population.
</P>
<P>
The overall production of the region will by then attain 31
percent of the world's total, surpassing the United States, Europe
and Japan respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said that China's growth remains strong, while its exports,
imports and foreign investments are impressive, and its reserve of
hard currencies have attained record high.
</P>
<P>
The COFACE has a 50 billion franc (10 billion U.S. dollars)
business in China and signed with China several big insurance
contracts, including those over the Daya Bay nuclear power station
and China's purchase of 30 Airbus passenger carriers last year.
</P>
<P>
French enterprises only have a 2 percent share of the Asian
market, but the latter has 40 percent of the big insurance
contracts opportunities in the world, said COFACE.

<HEADLINE> U.S Says Syrian-Israeli Talks Unlikely to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that the conclusion of the Hebron accord between the
Israelis and Palestinians did not mean Syrian-Israeli negotiations
would immediately go back on track of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, while hailing as
"encouraging" the agreement reached at Tuesday midnight on Israeli
troops' pullout from the West Bank city of Hebron, told reporters
that this progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track of the peace
process "stand on its own," and "there is no indication right now"
that Syria and Israel are about to begin their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Washington "has had as a long-term goal the reinvigoration of
the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations," Burns said. But "do we
think that those are imminent? No, we don't."
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations were suspended nearly a year
ago as both sides were snagged over security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were postponed to even more remote time when
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu became new Israeli prime minister
after a election victory in last May.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu deepened rift between Syria and Israel when he
rejected the land-for-peace formula and insisted that negotiations
should be resumed without preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Ruling Party Splits: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's ruling
Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) has split, Information and
Broadcasting Minister Monyane Moleleki said today.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying in capital Maseru that a rift has developed between two
factions in the party as a result of a high court ruling that the
BCP Executive Committee elected in 1996 was invalid.
</P>
<P>
A dispute has developed between members of the invalidated
committee and an old executive committee elected to office in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki, also a senior BCP member, said the old committee
consisted of people "elected unconstitutionally", adding that
they have rebuked BCP leader Ntsu Mokhehle on a number of public
occasions.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the old committee challenged the
constitutionality of the committee elected last year, of which
Moleleki is a member, resulting in its invalidation.
</P>
<P>
The minister asserted that there are fundamental differences
over whether or not the party's constitution had been violated
during the party's annual congress in March last year when the
new committee was elected.
</P>
<P>
After the election, four constituencies of the BCP made
petitions to the High Court, charging that Mokhehle had violated
the BCP's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Moleleki said in a statement that there are
people plotting to destabilize the Lesotho government by taking
advantage of the protracted legal battle.
</P>
<P>
BCP deputy leader Molapo Qhobela, a member of the old
committee, however, denied there is a split in the party ranks.
He said what Moleleki has said in fact has hinted at him.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki refused to identify the people he suspected of
plotting to distablize the government, saying their names would
be published "only when the time is right."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Approves Hebron Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Knesset (Israel's
parliament) tonight ratified the long-awaited Hebron accord,
giving the greenlight to the Israeli army to redeploy its
troops in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
After more than 11 hours of intensive debate, the Knesset
approved the accord by a large majority, an 87 to 17 vote
with one abstention, due to the strong support by the
Labor-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
The accord was initialed Wednesday morning at the end of
a summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, held at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of this morning, the Israeli cabinet,
after close to 12 hours of deliberation, approved the
agreement by an 11 to 7 vote, followed immediately by the
dramatic resignation of diehard opponent Science Minister Ze'ev
Begin.
</P>
<P>
At 11:00 a.m. local time (0900GMT) this morning, Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu opened the Knesset special session in
a speech stressing that Israel was not pulling out of
Hebron, but redeploying in the city.
</P>
<P>
The special session lasted until 11:00 p.m. local time
(2100GMT) tonight, as most of the 120 members of the house
spoke on the issue, before the vote finally took place.
</P>
<P>
Although the Knesset has ratified other international
agreements, including the Camp David Accords and the Oslo
Accords, this is the first time it was voting on an
agreement which has only been initialed and not signed and
implemented.
</P>
<P>
As the Knesset finally passed the accord, the Israeli army,
already began to remove its belongings out of Hebron during
the day, is due to handover 80 percent of the city to
the PNA within hours if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, the Israeli army, after the Hebron
pullback, will redeploy its troops in rural areas of the
West Bank in three phases, with the first one to be
carried out during the first week of March, and the last
to be taken place in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Within two months after the implementation of the Hebron
redeployment, Israel and the Palestinians will begin negotiations
on the final status in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
By August 1998, the Palestinians are due to control most
parts of the West Bank except Jewish settlements and what
Israel considers as military areas.
</P>
<P>
In other commitments, Israel agreed to release Palestinian
prisoners and to resume negotiations immediately on opening a
Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip, as well as a
safe-passage between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Palestinians agreed to complete the
process of revising the Palestinian National Charter which calls
for the destruction of Israel, to fight terrorists and to
confiscate illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also agreed to deal with Israeli requests
to transfer suspects and defendants in accordance with the
Interim Agreement, known as the Oslo II accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Nevah Wednesday said that one
of the most important achievement for Israel was a letter of
guarantee to Netanyahu by outgoing US Secretary of State
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Among other issues, the letter permits Israel to unilaterally
decide the size of the areas it will turn over to the PNA
and ultimately the areas to be turned over in a final
agreement.

<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East Countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) today
sold 30 million shares of its Gulf Bank assets to private
subscribers and investors in an auction.
</P>
<P>
The auction started with a launching price of 10 fils (0.033
U.S. dollars) per share and the race was heated between two
investment companies which were contending on behalf of a group
of investors.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Kuwaiti Stock Exchange Market Hisham
Al-Oteibi, who represented the Kuwaiti state assets supervising
authority, said the auction ended with a final price of 570 fils
(1.88 dollars) per share for the offered shares.
</P>
<P>
The sale was within the KIA's privatization plan. The KIA will
also offer 60 million shares of its Gulf Bank assets for public
subscription in the near future, KIA sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1.8 billion U.S. dollars was raised in Kuwait from a
privatization drive following today's public auction of shares
that raised 56.93 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The KIA, the state-owned agency overseeing the privatization
program, so far has finished 17 different privatization projects
in companies where the government owns more than a 10 percent
stake since the sell-offs began two years ago, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program set out to sell state stakes in
some 62 companies and is due to be completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will invite bids for the construction of a
water project on the River Manavgat for the purpose of selling
fresh water, local newspaper Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
The tender of the program prepared by the State Waterworks
Authority (DSI) was published in the Official Gazette, calling
for the submission of bids by February.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions of the tender is that bidders must be
involved in manufacturing or trade in a field open to the
international market and have an annual sales turnover of at
least 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to DSI sources, the project is expected to be
completed at the end of this year, and then the facilities will
be transferred to the successful bidders for a period of 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey will receive a certain percentage of income
from each cubic meter of water sold, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to have a capacity of transferring a
total of 500,000 cubic meters of water per day through water
pipelines to the coast, where it will be loaded onto tankers.
</P>
<P>
The tender has reportedly aroused interests of some companies
from Israel, Libya, Italy as well as some Arab countries, where sea
water has to be desalted at great cost.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Motorola Israel, a subsidiary of the electronics
giant in the United States recorded sales of more than one
billion U.S. dollars in Israel in 1996, a 30 percent rise
compared with that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post, the Tel Aviv-based
subsidiary also reported a 27 percent increase in exports from
233 million dollars in 1995 to 295.5 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The firm beat its Illinois-based parent company in using
digital coding for its data communications products and became
the first international distributor of Motorola products before
being taken in as the parent's wholly-owned subsidiary in 1975.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Bahrain-based Gulf Air has decided to sell six
Boeing-767 aircraft and close routes in a bid to save itself from
falling into a debt trap, the official Bahraini News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a recent meeting by the Board of
the airline, which is equally owned by Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the executive chairman of the
Gulf Air Sheikh Ahammed bin Suaef al Nahyan said in a statement
to the Bahraini News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The regional carrier will sell six planes during the period
from February to July and close some uneconomic routes to help
reduce its debt burden and realize profits, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The routes which will be closed include its flights to and
from New York, Geneva and Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The carrier has mapped out measures to prevent travelers from
being affected, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Air's debts are estimated at some 2 billion
U.S. dollars, mostly in bank loans. The debts resulted from a
flurry of buying new aircraft in the late 1980s and opening
uneconomic routes.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden carrier currently has 32 aircraft, said to be
far more than its needs to fly a handful of its profitable routes.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the airline recorded its worst annual loss of 159
million dollars, the biggest since the Gulf crisis in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Cofinancing for IDB Projects Mobilizes $2.4 Bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen bilateral and
multilateral agencies provided a total of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars
in cofinancing in conjunction with 1996 lending program of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Bank reported today.
</P>
<P>
As in past years, cofinancing was a major instrument in support
of IDB lending, which totaled some 6.74 billion dollars last year
for the economic and social development in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Cofinancing from Japan ranked the largest during 1996 and
reached a record of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as
the average amount for that country for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is the main source of multilateral cofinancing,
providing a total of 1.1 billion dollars during 1996. Other
confinanciers also include European institutions, providing a
total of some 92 million dollars for the IDB projects last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Press Canada for Dairy Tariffs Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States plans to
continue pressing Canada for the removal of its import tariffs on
its dairy and poultry products, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S.-Canada dispute on dairy and poultry tariffs
will become one of the top priorities of the new Clinton
administration, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Clickman told
Canada's Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This concerns us very much," Clickman was quoted as saying.
The recent NAFTA panel ruling that endorsed Canada's import
tariffs "was a very disturbing decision...We are now looking at
our options."
</P>
<P>
The panel ruled late last year that Canada's new import tariffs
on key dairy and poultry products did not violate NAFTA (North
American Free Trade Agreement).
</P>
<P>
Canada imposed the tariffs as part of the new international
trading rules. They replaced quotas it had used for 20 years to
keep out almost all U.S. and European imports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dairy industry estimates that it could sale as much as
1 billion U.S. dollars a year to Canada if it were allowed open
access to the Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
Clickman said one option available to the U.S. is to try to
force Canada to eliminate the import tariffs during the next round
of farm trade talks starting in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Canada has already indicated it is not interested in
launching negotiations about the farm issue, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley in Midst of Economic Boom: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley, known as a
center for much of innovation underlying semiconductor and
personal computer, is in the midst of its most remarkable economic
boom in two decades, thanks to the rise of Internet, according to
an annual report of Joint Venture Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Valley, which is located in the region south of
San Francisco in California state, has added 125,000 jobs. In 1996
alone, the area added roughly 50,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The area is headquarters for the leading companies in the
computer-networking business. The 30 largest such companies more
than double their employment from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Valley's growth has been accompanied by a shift in new jobs
from computer and semiconductor manufacturing to software
development, thanks to the rise of the Internet and the scramble
to exploit it economically.
</P>
<P>
For example, Cisco Systems, the San Jose maker of computers
that route over the Internet, hired about 50 employees a week
throughout 1996. The company has continued to expand and now has
800-1,000 job openings.
</P>
<P>
Still, it is the growth of software companies like Netscape
Communications and Orale that suggests the region's new structure.
Traditionally a manufacturing center, it is being transformed.
</P>
<P>
The rise in software business has brought sharply higher pay in
the high-cost region. In 1996, the average wages grew 5.1 percent
after accounting for inflation-- more than five times the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The current period of economic boom is all the more remarkable,
because only four years ago, before the emergence of the Internet,
Silicon faced a crisis, losing factory jobs and venture capitals.
Last year, however, almost all doubts about the area's future
seemed to have dissipated because of its strong growth.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Museum Robbed of Valuable Artefacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Livingstone National
Museum was robbed over night of 23 artefacts worth of 850,000
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency quoted Southern Division Police Chief
Ephraim Mateyo as saying today a hole was found dug open in the
roof for the thieves to enter the museum's building.
</P>
<P>
The artefacts stolen dated back as in the 1920s. These include
witchcraft objects, wooden bow, masks, Elan fly whisks and
walking sticks with ivory handles.
</P>
<P>
Today police finger print experts are busy sifting through
vandalized collections in the ethnography gallery to take finger
prints of the thieves.
</P>
<P>
''They have taken our most valuable and rare artefacts dating back
to the 1920s. I don't think we shall even get such collections
again,'' lamented the museum director.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Again Clash with Central African Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- French troops killed one rebel
soldier and arrested another in a new clash with the mutinous
soldiers of the Central African Republic this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted an "authorized source"
as saying that rebel soldiers opened fire on a patrol of French
soldiers near the Kasai military barracks in the Central African
capital Bangui.
</P>
<P>
No loss was inflicted on the French side during the clash,
which took place after French soldiers intervened to stop the
rebels from fleecing civilians, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The new incident took place when four African countries, backed
by France, are seeking a solution to the three-month long mutiny,
the third in eight months, against President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
French troops killed dozens of rebels in a reprisal action on
January 5 after the "assassination" of two French soldiers by
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The head of the African mediation team, former Malian head of
state General Amadou Toumani Toure, said that a 300-man African
peace-keeping force will arrive in Bangui in three weeks on a
six-month mission.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from Gabon, Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad -- the four
mediating countries -- and Senegal will participate in the force.
</P>
<P>
France is maintaining a 2,300-strong force in the Central
African Republic, which is the largest military base of France in
Africa after Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The first secretary of the French Socialist Party, Lionel
Jospin, today again rapped the policy of the government in Central
Africa as "a combination of interference and impotence."
