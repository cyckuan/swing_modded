<HEADLINE> Canada Offers to Lead Aid Force in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada is offering to lead an
international military force to deliver food and other
humanitarian aid to refugees in Central Africa, aides to Prime
Minister Jean Chretien was quoted by the local press as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Chretien had discussions with some 15 world leaders over the
past two days to muster support for a multilateral humanitarian
relief mission for hundreds of thousands of refugees, who are
facing starvation and disease following recent fighting along the
Rwanda-Zaire border.
</P>
<P>
Canada is offering to send a special 180-member Canadian force
as the vanguard unit for a larger U.N. force, the press reported.
</P>
<P>
The team would include officers experienced in
U.N. peacekeeping missions, communications officers, a field
hospital capable of treating 500 people a day and a complete
water-purification system.
</P>
<P>
Given a go-ahead order, the team will be prepared to move
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
But before Canada would commit its troops, a number of
conditions would have to be met, in particular a clear mandate,
certain funding and firm assurance from other countries that they
too would send troops, the press added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council is to consider the Canadian
offer today, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, is
currently on a special mission to Central Africa for U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, attempting to reach an
agreement that will allow assistance to be delivered to the
refugees.

the northeastern part of the country, according to local radio and
TV reports.
</P>

involved in the offensive and eventually drove out the Muslims
from Gajevi, which was a Muslim village but sits on the Serb
republic side of the so-called "Zone of Separation".

injuries, while other sources said that Muslims returned fire,
wounding some Serb policemen.
</P>

some shots of fighting in the area, but has not confirmed it was a

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
expecting foreign doctors and nurses to apply for positions left
by dismissed striking junior doctors and nurses in the southern
African nation.
</P>
<P>
But so far, there have been no acknowledgements of the
invitation by the government to the posts.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare said today
that they had not received applications to replace nearly 2,000
nursess and 232 junior doctors who were fired for engaging in the
three-week strike that has crippled health services.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government started advertizing vacant posts for
nurses dismissed two weeks ago for defying a government order to
resume work by October 30.
</P>
<P>
Advertizements have been placed in South Africa, Britain and a
number of African countries. Locally interested people were asked
to submit their applications at hospitals in writing or in
person.
</P>
<P>
One senior official at Aarare Central Hospital said, "to tell
you the truth, we have not received any application letters so
far. Where are they going to get nurses and doctors to replace
those that they fired?"
</P>
<P>
"Do you think a doctor or nurse in South Africa and Britain would
be willing to come here because there is a crisis, which was as a
result of a strike by nurses and doctors who are pressing for better
working conditions and salaries?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Curb Amphetamine Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Tuesday opened a four-day scientific meeting on the use of
amphetamines in an effort to contain the worldwide abuse of the
chemicals as central nervous system stimulants.
</P>
<P>
Experts from 14 developed and developing countries are expected
to examine the existing epidemiological evidence of worldwide
amphetamine abuse.
</P>
<P>
The current WHO meeting is the first ever on amphetamine abuse
and part of a long-term international project to tackle the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamine abuse has posed a major public health concern in
many countries, even though health risks and social implications
of the abuse has not yet been fully understood and scientific
evidence of the adverse effects remains incomplete, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
So far, studies suggest that related health problems include
psychiatric and neurological disorders, cardiac arrhythmia,
hypertension, liver damage and fatal overdose.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamine-type psychostimulants often have longer lasting
effects than, for example, cocaine. Generally, users of them do
not perceive these substances as dangerous to health.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that in many countries amphetamine abuse is more
widespread than that of cocaine and heroin combined.
</P>
<P>
It added that, amphetamine drugs can be easily produced because
production is relatively simple and the chemicals used in their
manufacture are cheap and freely available in most countries.
</P>
<P>
The WHO noted a dramatic increase in production and trafficking
of illicit amphetamine stimulants over the last 20 years, adding
that their market is significant, although it accounts for less
than 1 percent of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
In the United States alone, official market is worth over 100
million U.S. dollars, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
The WHO listed Japan, the United States as the largest
markets, followed by Brazil, Canada, China and certain European
countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain.

<HEADLINE> France Expects Answer from U.S. on Zaire "in Hours" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France is expecting the United
States to give an answer "in the coming hours" on whether it will
join the multinational intervention force to be deployed in Zaire,
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today.
</P>
<P>
"In the hours we are talking about, things are going, and they
are going fast. It is not only a matter of time," said de Charette
in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that France hoped that the United States would give its
answer in the coming few hours, so that the United Nations
Security Council could meet to make a final decision on sending
the multinational force.
</P>
<P>
France has asked the United States to contribute one thirds of
the force, whose number varies from 5,000 to 10,000 according to
different estimations, aimed at saving about 1.2 million refugees
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past one week, we plead for an intervention by the
international community (in Zaire). France has indicated that it
is willing to participate in it," said the French foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the participation by the United States was
indispensable because each member of the international community
should take up its own responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Apart from France, Canada, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and
some African countries have agreed to contribute to the
multinational force.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Economic Reform in MENA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher urged here today the Middle East and North African
countries to undergo economic reform while calling for a special
attention to the plight of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the three-day Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) economic conference, he said the region
now faces a dual challenge if it is to prosper in an increasingly
competitive global economy.
</P>
<P>
"To compete effectively, this region must not only make
peace. It must reform," said the U.S. official who led a
170-member delegation to the conference, the third of its kind
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The first MENA economic summit was held in Casablanca,
Morocco, in 1994, and the second in Amman, Jordan, in 1995. In
view of the stalemate in the Arab-Israeli peace process, Egypt,
the host of the current conference, decided to downgrade it to a
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Christopher spoke highly of Cairo's efforts to convene the
economic gathering despite political setbacks, saying over 50
U.S. companies, encouraged by Egypt's reforms, have manufacturing
operations in the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to normalize relations with
Israel, receives 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in aid from Washington
annually.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also singled out Jordan and Israel for the
need to continue economic reforms, pledging better ties with the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to announce that yesterday, the United States
and Jordan signed an Open Skies Agreement to fully liberalize
commercial aviation between us. It is the first such agreement we
have reached outside Europe, and I hope that we can negotiate
with others in this region soon to make both business and tourist
travel more efficient," Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that trade and investment between the United
States and Israel would continue to expand, encouraging greater
U.S. economic engagement across the MENA region.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not said whether the new U.S. administration
would continue to fight against the cuts in foreign aid proposed
by the Republican-dominated Congress.
</P>
<P>
"You are pioneers of peace, and we need your courage and
perseverance now more than ever," Christopher said, addressing to
the Arab and Israeli business people.
</P>
<P>
"But most urgently of all, I want to encourage you to invest
in peace where it can make the greatest difference. Economic
conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have not prospered as we
have hoped. They must improve -- and improve quickly -- if we are
to give Palestinians a full and tangible stake in peace," added
he.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton recently signed legislation to grant
duty-free access for Palestinian exports to the United States to
help the Palestinians build a prosperous free market economy, the
U.S. official announced.
</P>
<P>
He urged other major powers to take similar steps toward the
Palestinians, who are now suffering an eight-month closure
imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Christopher stood short of openly backing the Palestinian
Authority in demanding the lifting of the siege, which causes the
self-rule region a loss of 6 million U.S. dollars per day,
according to Palestinian and international estimates.

<HEADLINE> EC Refocuses Trade Policy Towards Market Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
has unveiled today the European Union's new Market Access Strategy
designed to sharpen EU's ability to remove the most persistent
barriers to its exports.
</P>
<P>
The EC said in a statement that it would focus much of its
efforts and resources on the elimination of barriers to European
exports in a bid to help business to expand abroad and create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy will regroup all the multilateral and bilateral
tools at Europe's disposal and urge businessmen to tell the
Commission systematically where the worst barriers are," it was
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the strategy this morning to a Symposium attended by
over 500 European business people, Sir Leon Brittan, EU's Trade
Commissioner, said: "We must enforce our rights vigorously, and
give our companies an equal chance to compete."
</P>
<P>
He added that "it is not enough to negotiate new international
trading rules, we must ensure that they are effectively enforced".
</P>
<P>
The EC has reportedly set up an on-line Market Access Database
to record and describe all the trade barriers faced by European
firms in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it would then use the database to monitor
legislation to open those markets and recommend the right action,
whether a WTO panel or a bilateral negotiation for example, where
markets remain closed.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, over 700 obstacles have already been
identified, hitting sales of anything from toys to Brazil, cars
to Indonesia, silk to the US or vodka to Russia.
</P>
<P>
As of today, the EU is now actively involved in 12 cases before
the WTO, where alone or with others it fights for the interests of
its exporters.

"Ethiopia is acting according to the decision made by the 32nd
annual summit of the Organization of African Unity last July to
free Africa from polio before we enter the 21st century," said
Gidada.

<HEADLINE> EU to Further Open Telecom Markets to Help WTO Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Tuesday
pledged to open its telecommunications markets further in the hope
to break the long-held deadlock in the World Trade Organization's
talks for a global telecom market-opening agreement.
</P>
<P>
The offer, submitted to a WTO meeting of senior telecom
negotiators, eliminated or cut restrictions on satellite services,
license number, foreign investments and mobile services in some or
all of the EU's 15 states.
</P>
<P>
The EU's move aimed at generating corresponding actions from
other countries to clinch a global liberalization deal by next
February 15, EU senior negotiator Karl Falkenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline of the telecom talks, which have dragged on for
over two years, had been put off from April to next February after
the U.S. refused to open its market for what it said to be
inadequate offers by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Falkenberg said the EU gave up more market protections as it
and the U.S. had agreed to provide joint leadership in the telecom
talks. He expected Washington to follow suit and make a new offer
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal which is conditional on similar actions
from other trading partners, all restrictions on satellite
services and license number within the EU will be withdrawn, and
the liberalization of mobile services advanced to 1998, except for
minor restrictions in Ireland and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Spain, the EU's fifth largest market, will move up the date of
its complete telecom service liberalization from 2003 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Spain, Belgium and France will call back or lessen
limits on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In return, the EU asked the U.S. to stop limiting underwater
cable tradings and to open its satellite service market.
</P>
<P>
The EU, together with the U.S., also hoped Asian and Latin
American countries, such as Japan, Singapore, Mexico and Brazil,
will allow freer competition in their domestic telecom markets,
Falkenberg said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Prime Minister to Postpone Kiev Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will postpone his visit to Ukraine as the two
countries failed to draft all necessary documents ahead of the
visit slated for middle November, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's visit to Ukraine will take place "when the
documents, which must be prepared for the visit, are ready,"
spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Moscow in October, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma announced that Chernomyrdin would travel to Kiev in
the first half of November to sign agreements, including one on
the division of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attributed the postponement to the two sides'
continuing dispute over the division of the Black Sea Fleet and
related issues.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Ukraine are willing to settle the dispute and
try to finalize the documents on the fleet future, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are "looking for compromise solutions to the
problem of separate bases for the Russian and Ukrainian rumps in
Sevastopol (Ukraine) and the problem of mutual settlements
relating to the stationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in
Ukrainian territory," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed in Kiev to continue the negotiations in Moscow
in the next few days, added the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China Keen on Comprehensive Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
today reiterated China's keenness to further the comprehensive
cooperation with the Middle East and North Africa and make its due
contributions to development and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shanzai, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, told the plenary session of the third
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference, which
opened here this morning, that the occasion itself has manifested
the prevalence of cooperation over confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed of great significance that we can sit together
again today in such a difficult situation facing the Middle East
peace process," said Liu, who is also China's special envoy to
MENA III.
</P>
<P>
This has vividly manifested that "peace and development" is the
major trend of today's world and dialog and cooperation is the
strong desire of all peoples in the region, Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China has been attaching great importance to
the relationship with these countries and is willing to further
the friendly ties with them.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and Mideast and north Africa states belong to
developing countries and are complementary to each other in
economic fields, which have ensured broad prospects for further
cooperation," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary session, Liu also showed China's
keenness to develop mutually beneficial cooperation of various
forms on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, with the aim
of making its due contributions to peace and development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
With the rich oil reserves and strategic geographical
location, the MENA region has made important contributions to the
global economic development and should have been on the fore
front of the world's economic growth, Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
But the bloodshed and conflicts have greatly stubbed local and
regional economic cooperation, he deplored.
</P>
<P>
"China hopes to see an early restoration of comprehensive and
just peace as well as the improvement of the political
environment of this region so that efforts can be focused on
economic development and peoples can enjoy the fruits of peace at
an earliest possible date," he reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Arab-Israeli conflict should only be solved
through peaceful dialog based on the land-for-peace principle and
relevant U.N. resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the achievements at the previous two MENA conference
should be further consolidated and effective steps be taken, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding this, Liu urged the participants and industrialized
countries in particular to honor their promises and assist
Palestinians to extricate itself from the economic predicament
caused by Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
China, Liu added, even when in economic hardships itself, has
provided assistance for Palestine to the best of its abilities.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Chinese government always encourages its enterprises
to take an active part in the economic reconstruction of the
Middle East. China's bid to become the 20th member of the Middle
East Development Bank farely reflects the point.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the Chinese official expressed his conviction
about creating a peaceful, stable and prosperous Middle East on
the basis of an early, comprehensive and just solution to the
issue of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-minister is heading a 40-member delegation,
which includes ranking officials and businessmen from 23
companies, to the three-day economic event.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,500 businessmen and delegates from 72 governmental
and 52 regional and international institutions are participating
in the Cairo conference.

<HEADLINE> (URGENT) United States Agrees to Send Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
send troops to Zaire in a multinational intervention to save more
than 1 million refugees, reported the French daily "Le Monde"
quoting "good sources at the United Nations and in Washington."
</P>
<P>
The force, to be participated by Europeans and Africans as
well, will be headed by a French-speaking Canadian general and
will have a double mandate: rescue the refugees and help
repatriate them to Rwanda, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the United Nations Security Council will
vote this week on the dispatch of the force. Apart from the United
States, Britain, France, Spain and Canada will also send troops to
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, the force will not be responsible for disarming Hutu
militias held responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in
which at least half a million people were massacred, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
These militias are reportedly controlling hundreds of thousands
of Rwandan refugees in the Kivu region of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The multinational force will "rapidly" give its place to
another peace keeping force, which will be established by the
United Nations in "the framework of a classic peace-keeping
operation," said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Lahore High Court
(LHC) today called for a report from the Customs Department on its
seizure of gold from Asif Zardari, husband of the ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The LHC's order followed a writ petition filed by Advocate M.
D. Tahir seeking the court's order for a probe into the case.
</P>
<P>
The petition said the Customs Department recovered gold worth 2
billion rupees (50 million U.S. dollars) from a container owned by
 Zardari.
</P>
<P>
The advocate charged that Zardari was sending his gold abroad
with an ill intention, but the container was withheld after the
removal of the government by President Farooq Leghari last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the court to immediately shift the seized gold to the
State Bank of Pakistan and order an inquiry to unearth the facts
behind the gold transportation.
</P>
<P>
The court directed the Customs Department to submit its report
about the gold seizure within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Zardari has been detained since last Tuesday without any
charges. The caretaker government said the charges against him
would be made public very soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deposed Benazir has filed a petition to the
court demanding the release of her husband.

<HEADLINE> 22 Civilians Killed by Afghan Taliban's Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two civilians were
killed Monday as rockets fired by Afghanistan's Taliban militia
missed their military target and crashed into a village, according
to reports from Afghanistan today.
</P>
<P>
The rockets landed 500 meters away from the Baghram Air Base, a
military air base held by anti-Taliban alliance about 50
kilometers from the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It demolished half a dozen houses in the village nearby, some
occupied by refugees from Kabul, which was captured by the Taliban
on September 27.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as Taliban fighters and forces of the former
government military commander, Ahmed Shah Masood, stepped up the
battle for control of the two roads leading from the Baghram Air
Base to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting began Saturday when the
anti-Taliban alliance of Masood and Rashid Dostum, an Afghan
warlord who controls seven northern provinces, failed to advance
on one of the two roads.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Taliban troops moved about 2,000 meters closer to
the air base, but were pushed back on Monday, said officers under
Masood's command.
</P>
<P>
For Masood, gaining control of either road could open a route
for a major effort to retake Kabul from the Taliban. But the
battle has been in a stalemate for the last three weeks.

<HEADLINE> WEF President Spells out Rules to Meet Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the World Economic
Forum (WEF) Klaus Schwab today spelled out three "golden rules" to
meet the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Schwab, while addressing the third Middle East and North
Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three) held here, said the
first rule is that the entry card to the process of global
wealth creation is regionalization.
</P>
<P>
"No individual country, whatever its strength, can afford to
be isolated," he told the gathering that included government
officials and business leaders from some 90 countries and regions
across the world.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true to the Middle East region which, in
terms of its present GDP but not in terms of its potential, is
dwarfed by other regional blocs such as the European Union or the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), he explained.
</P>
<P>
The second rule, he said, is that the role of governments must
be redefined in fostering the most conducive environment for the
creation of wealth, or creating an investor-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
In his view, governments must fulfill promotion of
competitiveness through flexibility, deregulation, privatization
and responsibilization.
</P>
<P>
He said governments should also promote confidence through
non-intervention, fiscal discipline, price stability and consistent
long-term policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Schwab, the third rule is that governments,
enterprises and society need to manage the tremendous pressures
of an ever-accelerating world, "which does not excuse a lack
of sense of time."
</P>
<P>
"In the old world, it was the big fish that ate the
small one," he said. "Today this is irrelevant. Now it is
the fast fish that eats the slow."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his pleasure over the fact that there are
more business leaders converging here for the MENA Three than
in Casablanca in 1994 and in Amman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the long-term potential of the region, we
believe in the integration of the region into the global
economy and we also believe in the wisdom of peace," he
said in a reference to the large gathering, which is
estimated at 3,500-strong.
</P>
<P>
Schwab said that the needs to build a community of wealth
creation and peaceful cooperation are far greater than the
differences in the region.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he called for an all-out efforts to lay the
foundations of prosperity, saying that "we are here to invest,
to invest into peace."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the
opening session of the conference with a key-note speech,
followed by an address by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who arrived here Monday leading a large U.S.
delegation to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Heavy police presence is seen in and around the Cairo
International Conference Center where the conference is held.

<HEADLINE> Consultations on Resuming Athens Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The consultations between the
the Association of Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) Members(SMEHA)and
the government on resuming trading at ASE were broken off today.
</P>
<P>
The bourse has been closed since Friday when brokers refused to
trade after it was discovered that brokerage firm Delta Securities
had failed to pay 2.6 billion drachmas (11.3 million U.S. dollars)
in settlements, making it impossible for the bourse's clearing
house to pay other brokers.
</P>
<P>
The government, the ASE supervising authorities and the SMEHA
governing board agreed Sunday on the terms and conditions for the
reopening of the ASE, an agreement which was, however, overtuned
by a stockbrokers' general assembly on Monday, and consultations
were resumed today but were finally broken off.
</P>
<P>
SMEHA discontinued its consultations with the government
following an effort by the ASE supervising authority to operate
the exchange with the participation only of the brokerage firms
that are subsidiaries of the major state-controlled banks, such as
National Bank of Greece, Commercial Bank, Ionian Bank and
Ergobank. This sparked protest from other brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said the government is eager to resuming
trading as soon as possible, feeling that a protracted closure
will hurt Greece's image with foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Sherritt to Invest Heavily in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Sherritt International
Corp. is raising more than 225 million U.S. dollars to pursue an
ambitious expansion program in Cuba despite of U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt has announced that it wants to pump money across the
Cuban economy, including petroleum refining, real estate, sugar
and communications, today's Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company announced on Monday that it had
entered a bought deal to raise 225 million dollars from the sale
of debentures for projects in the Caribbean island state of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Early indications suggest an enthusiastic response to the
issue, the paper said. If the demand is strong enough, an
additional 225 million dollars would be raised.
</P>
<P>
"It's full steam ahead," Sherritt spokeswoman Patrice Merrin
Best was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to participate as a proxy for economic growth as
the Cuban economy starts to develop," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt is one of a handful of companies singled out under the
infamous U.S. Helms-Burton law, which seeks to strangle Cuba by
punishing foreign companies doing business there.
</P>
<P>
Its directors and officials were barred earlier this year from
entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
By raising such a large amount of money to invest in Cuba,
Sherritt showed once again "its refusal to capitulate" to U.S.
pressure, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt has been active in oil exploration, nickel mining,
agriculture and tourism in Cuba, where it has so far invested
around 200 million dollars.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada has made it
clear to the U.N. that it is ready to take the lead of a
multinational force for Zaire, a U.N. spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the new development, the spokesman, Sylvana Foa
said Canada now has 1058 troops serving in U.N. peacekeeping
forces around the world and has a lot of peace-keeping
experiences.
</P>
<P>
She hoped the Security Council can soon give a mandate to the
multinational force, which is designed to protect humanitarian
supplies to the refugees affected by recent fightings.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the multinational force, which was
sponsored by France, was delayed by the United States last
weekend. The United States argued that foreign interference might
aggravate the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Rwanda had opposed French participation as
it consider Paris an ally of French-speaking Zaire and a Hutu
extremist militia largely controls the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Canada is regarded as neutral by the concerned countries in
the Great Lakes region of the Central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Amnesties Bread Riot Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
approved an amnesty to those involved in bread riots following a
price hike this fall.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the amnesty was contained in a message from
Hussein to Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty also pardons all those who were judged not being
dangerous to the public security.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties here claimed that hundreds of citizens had
been arrested and tried for their suspected involvement in the
so-called "bread riots."
</P>
<P>
The riot took place in southern parts of the kingdom in
mid-August after the government decided to lift the
subsidies on bread and increased the price by more than 200
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the king expressed appreciation to the
government's efforts in the economic reform which has proven to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
Hussein noted in his message that since grain prices in the
international market were dropping, the government should reduce
the price of bread accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Government officials quoted by the local press said the
reduction of the price would take place early next year.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
today made an important proposal which could dissolve the
differences on the November 18 elections, the Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation Television reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the proposal during his consultations with his
South African counterpart Nelson Mandela in Pretoria, capital of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Mandela told a news briefing that Chiluba
will disclose the proposal after returning home.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that he is satisfied with his discussion with
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
At the news briefing Chiluba described his meeting with
Mandela as constructive.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba returned home this afternoon after a brief visit to
South Africa earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) leader Dean
Mung'omba urged here today Chiluba and former president Kenneth
Kaunda to dissolve their differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda
and several other opposition parties have declared their election
boycott in protest against the government insistence that the
elections be held under the new constitution, which in fact bars
Kaunda from contesting the presidency in the elections because
his parents are foreign immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Minister Vows To Pursue Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Ben Jassim Bin Al-Thani said here today that his country
will continue to pursue peace and prosperity despite the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the third Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) economic conference, the Qatari minister said his
country has sent a large delegation to the conference to show "a
spirit of optimism" towards a just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari official expressed concern over the fact that the
peace process has slowed down on the Palestinian track and almost
frozen on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment to the principle of 'land for peace,' the
establishment of a Palestinian state, and the Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied territories are the basic understandings for the
establishment of coexisting and cooperating communities in this
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar participated the previous two MENA economic summits held
respectively in Casablanca, Morocco in 1994, and in Amman, Jordan
in 1995. It made an indirect deal with Israel on gas sales at the
Amman summit.
</P>
<P>
But the Gulf state decided to slow down the normalization
process with the Jewish state in view of the hardline policy
adopted by the new Israeli government which came to power last
June.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari official stressed that the unpleasant political
atmosphere "should not be a reason for pessimism or the
abandonment of the declared goals of this conference or
boycotting it..."
</P>
<P>
Qatar's view is in sharp contrast to the negative attitude by
Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Libya and Iraq toward the three-day
conference, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
These countries have boycotted all the three economic
conferences in view of the lack of political headways in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to take part in all the functions of the
peace process to secure all of our rights," he said, arguing that
participation in conferences will be in everyone's interests
instead of in Israel's alone.

LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the Niger Republic

peace on the border, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Deputy Surveyor-General Esther Adebiyi said this
today at the Ninth United Nations Regional Cartographic
Conference for Africa, which opened in Addis Ababa today.

</P>
<P>
In doing so, the two countries will build more beacons and
renew the old ones to international standard, she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy surveyor-general also said that Nigeria and
Equatorial Guinea have started bilateral talks on the
demarcation and survey of their common border.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Govt Purchases Half of Cloves It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar State
Trading Corporation (ZSTC) has bought half of the 10,000 tons of
cloves expected to be harvested this season which started last
August.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Official Daily News, ZSTC General
Manager Abdulharman Rashid said in the town of Zanzibar today
that they are expecting to buy 2,000 tons more from farmers in
the last two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Rashid reiterated that higher
producer prices announced by the government last September have
pushed daily sales by farmers up to 15 tons from one ton
previously. The new prices had inspired farmers to speed up clove
picking.
</P>
<P>
For this season, the prices of first grade clove had been
raised to 320 Tanzania Shillings (about 0.53 U.S. Dollar) per
kilogram from 250 Shillings (about 0.42 Dollar), while second
grade sales for 280 Shillings (about 0.47 dollar) per kilogram up
from 225 Shillings (about 0.38 Dollar).
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's main source of income stems from exports of cloves
of which zanzibar was formerly regarded as the world main
producer. But in recent years countries like Brazil, the Comoros,
Madagascar, Sri Lanka and Indonesia have successfully established
themselves in the Market.
</P>
<P>
The crop price in the world market had dropped drastically
from about 9,000 U.S. Dollars per ton in 1960s to less than 1,000
Dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
In Zanzibar, there has been a persistent downward trend in the
production of cloves which declined from an average level of
20,000 tons in 1960s and 12,000 tons in 1970s to the current
average level of 7,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
However, even now, the crop still earns Zanzibar more than 85
percent of its foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority Urges Israel to End Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
today urged Israel to end the closure on the Palestinian
territories, warning that Israel cannot have both closure and
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a thematic session on the Palestinian economy held
on the sidelines of the third Middle East and North Africa (MENA
Three) economic conference, PA Minister of Finance Mohammad Zuhdi
Nashashibi said the Palestinians have paid a high price for making
peace with Israel due to the crippling closure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian economy has in fact remained
totally controlled by Israel, which imposes blockade periodically
for so-called security and other reasons. He added that it is
against the agreement signed between the two sides on allowing
free movement of goods and labor.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed the Palestinian territories since late
February after a series of suicide bombing attacks by Islamic
militants killed 58 people inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred 60,000 Palestinian workers from their
jobs in Israel and cost the Palestinian economy 6 million
U.S. dollars of loss daily.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi blamed the closures for the deterioration of the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister demanded an immediate lift of the closure as a way
to improve the economic situation in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"We must be allowed to trade with the rest of the world
freely, we must be allowed to travel freely," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has defended the closure as a necessary step to
protect Israelis who have been the prime targets by Palestinian
extremists.
</P>
<P>
David Brodet, director-general of Israel's Ministry of Finance,
told the session that Israel has no interests in imposing closure
on the Palestinian territories except for certain security and
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel has played a major role in helping improve
the Palestinian economy, such as transferring a total of 2 billion
shekels (600 million dollars), or 35 million shekels (10 million
dollars) annually, in income tax collected from the Palestinian
workers in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The basic consideration of the Israeli government is to
improve the Palestinian economy, there is no doubt about it," he
asserted, adding that he believed that the situation would be
better in the future.
</P>
<P>
To protest against Israel's blockade, most Palestinian
businessmen boycotted the MENA Three conference.
</P>
<P>
The PA has only sent a small delegation to air their
complaints against Israel and to seek international pressure on
the country to ease the blockade.

the Middle East peace process and Jordan-Indonesia relations.
</P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
The two leaders later attended the signing ceremonies of three
Jordanian-Indonesian agreements on investment protection,
abolition of dual taxation and maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Jordan's exports of phosphate,
potash and fertilizers to Indonesia exceeded 57 million
U.S. dollars in 1995. The Kingdom imported 82.6 million dollars
worth of timber, vegetable oil, textiles and clothing from
Indonesia last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Tanzania Urge UN to Send Neutral Force to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka stressed today that a neutral and multinational
force should be rapidly sent to Zaire to create safe corridors
for refugees to prevent a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal here along with his Tanzanian counterpart,
Jakaya Kikwete, in a new briefing on arrival at the Jomo Kenyatta
Airport from Addis Ababa after attending an OAU extraordinary
session on the situation in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka told reporters that the one-day session of the Central
Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution unanimously endorsed the communique of the
November 5 Nairobi regional summit on the eastern Zaire crisis
initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
He said the main thrust of the session of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) is to impress the U.N. Security Council and
the international community that very speedy deployment of a
neutral and multinational peacekeeping force in Zaire is urgent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over a million refugees have been stranded
in the fighting between government troops and the Tutsi rebels in
eastern Zaire. Many of the refugees have been left without food
and water for many days.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka and Kikwete said both Kenya and Tanzania are willing
to contribute to such a force, but insisted that such a force
should be "put together under the umbrella of the Untied
Nations".
</P>
<P>
"We should avoid unilateral actions as much as possible," said
the Tanzanian foreign minister, referring to France's intention
to send its troops to Zaire by its own.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two ministers urged the U.N. Security Council
to facilitate "Africa's effective participation" in the proposed
force by paying its cost.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they noted, most African countries will be left out
of the multinational force because they are unable to keep their
troops in Zaire if they are requested to pay for their own.

ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister
Abdullah Gul reassured Iraq today that Turkey's fight against the
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern
Iraq is not aimed at breaking down Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Gul was speaking to reporters this evening after a meeting
between Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Iraqi First
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who arrived here today for a
one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish state minister said the meeting discussed a series
of issues including the territorial integrity of Iraq, the
multi-party meeting on northern Iraq held in Ankara Iraq last
month, the reopening of the Yumurtalik-Kirkuk petrol pipeline, and
the struggle against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Gul said, "The U.N. sanctions against Iraq are detrimental to
this region, but beneficial to terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Ankara meeting was attended by representatives from the
U.S., Britain, Turkey, the Turkoman Front in northern Iraq, the
Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The two Iraqi Kurdish rival factions, Iran-backed PUK and the
Baghdad-supported KDP, signed a peace deal following the meeting,
pledging to maintain and strengthen the ceasefire in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
self-rule, which has claimed the lives of more than 21,000 people
including PKK militants, civilians and government troops in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> CBI Split on Minimum Wage, Turner Admits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harrogate, England, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Adair Turner, the
Director General of the Confederation of British Industry has
admitted for the first time that the CBI is split on its attitude
to the National Minimum Wage.
</P>
<P>
In an interview during the CBI annual conference which ended
today, Turner said that his organization is divided over its
attitude to the wage policy, "some of our people do not mind one
at a low level but the balance of opinion is that most members
are against it".
</P>
<P>
Seizing on the first public admission of division over the
National Minimum Wage, John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
union said "The case for the National Minimum Wage is being
won...at last employers are looking at how poverty pay can be
ended."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the remarks by Turner at the CBI Annual
Conference will be highlighted by the trade unions in the
forthcoming general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The GMB earlier published details of a MORI poll of small
businesses which shows that 3 in five (59 percent) support the
National Minimum Wage.
</P>
<P>
Edmonds said: "The idea that business is opposed to the
minimum wage is being debunked - more and more are low pay,
sweatshop conditions are bad for business and bad for the
economy."

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Urges US to End Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian here today strongly urges the United States to stop its
35-year blockade against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on "Necessity of Ending
the Economic, Commercial and Financial Embargo Imposed by the
United States of America Against Cuba," Wang said that the item
under consideration bears on the purposes and principles of the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.N. General Assembly has adopted a number of
resolutions on this issue, the United States, turning a deaf ear
to the just demands of the international community, is continuing
and further intensifying the blockade and sanctions imposed on
Cuba for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only brought difficulties to Cuba's economic and
social development, seriously hurting the Cuban people, especially
the health and well-being of women and children of the country,
but also has affected the normal trade and economic exchanges of
many countries with Cuba, bringing damage to their legitimate
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is right of the people of every country to choose their own
social system and mode of development in the light of their
specific national conditions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Differences and problems existing between states should be
settled through dialogue and negotiations based on equality, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"It is an expression of power politics to willfully resort to
embargo, blockade and sanctions, exert pressure on other sovereign
states and interfere in others internal affairs in disregard of
their legitimate rights and interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. actions above constitute a violation of the basic
norms governing international relations and intensify
contradictions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the United Nations to change its course of action
in this regard by renouncing the practice of interfering in the

<HEADLINE> Liberia: Agreement Reached on Disarmament Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Organizations monitoring the
disarmament process in Liberia have reached pact with most of the
warring factions in the country's dispute on arms collection
centers, with disarmament just about a forthnight away.
</P>
<P>
Only George Boley, leader of the Liberian Peace Council, is
not party to the agreement, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today, quoting Victo Malu, commander of the West African
Peacekeeping Force, known as Ecomog.
</P>
<P>
Details would emerge after the collection of data on the arms
collection centers, Major-General Malu told the ninth meeting of
the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of
West African States (Ecowas) in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Ecomog intends to embark on simultaneous disarmament of all
the centers," Malu said.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of all warring factions in
Liberia are scheduled to start on November 22 this year and
finish at the end of January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ecomog now is cooperating with the U.N. humanitarian
coordinating organization, U.N. observers mission in Liberia and
the Liberian transition government to work out ways for the
demobilization and repatriation of combatants, displaced persons
and refugees in line with the peace accord signed by warring
factions last August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, Malu emphasized that although Ecomog has begun
confidence patrols in strategic parts of Liberia, deployment in
the hinterland still depends on the arrival of the more troops.
</P>
<P>
Some Ecowas member countries have promised to provide
additional troops to Ecomog but they are yet to arrive in the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of pledged troops is critical to the success of
the disarmament process and complements the present international
support for the peace process through the provision of logistic
support," Malu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the commander, Ecomog's search operations aiming
at retrieving illegal arms in Monrovia has achieved "excellent"
results as substantial arms have been recovered, particularly at
the Barclay Training Center, the scene of the last factional
fighting in early April this year.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by Roosevolt Johnson, Ulimo-J, has handed over
two artillery guns, part of the weapons seized from Ecomog during
an attack on the force late last year, Malu revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Attorneys General in the
United Stated have designated Thursday "Tune Out the Violence" day
with a view to heightening awareness of the possible effects of TV
and movie violence on children.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Attorneys General has joined with
the American Medical Association, which recently distributed its
Physician Guide to Media Violence to about 60,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
The AMA urges parents to limit children to one or two quality
hours of television a day, to watch what programs their children
are viewing and to learn about movies that are playing.
</P>
<P>
"There is no quick-fix solution to the problem of violence, and
there is no cure-all violence preventive program," said Scott
Harshbarger, Massachusetts attorney general and president of the
national group.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "If we can develop an effective partnership among
parents, doctors, teachers, media and law enforcement to reduce
the amount of media violence our children are exposed to, we will
have made a great stride toward a safer future for society."

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Calls for Accountability via Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The most appropriate
accountability process is via elections and the people should
realize this and elect an honest and able leadership, Pakistan's
caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a delegation in Punjab's provincial capital of
Lahore, he said it is not possible for the caretakers to realize
complete accountability within three months.
</P>
<P>
The expectations of the people are very high, he said, but the
caretaker government could not bring about revolution in three
months.
</P>
<P>
He said the holding of elections will be meaningless without
accountability, adding that such an accountability mechanism will
however be evolved or its foundations laid so that the process
could continue even after the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said it is clear who should be held accountable, but if the
same political party comes to power again after the election then
it will stop accountability against itself.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, exact, meaningful and deep-rooted accountability has
to be demanded by the voters themselves by rejecting the corrupt
and looters, Miraj was quoted by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the caretaker law minister is working on a new law on
fool-proof accountability so that a permanent accountability
process could be set in.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that he along with his team can
ensure transparent, free and impartial elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will neither create hindrances even for the worst personal
enemy nor support friends to get elected," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He said the present government was working on election laws and
would soon bring about long-term changes in the election laws to
ensure that ordinary citizens could contest elections.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government took office on November 5 after
President Farooq Leghari dissolved the National Assembly and
dismissed the government of Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Miraj said the two main tasks of his government were
to hold free and fair elections on February 3 next year and start
an accountability process against national wealth looters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's karaoke houses and
dance halls are to face a new three-per cent tax to help the
country protect and improve its traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued a series of regulations to improve
the country's economic policies to help cultural businesses. The
aim is to expand financial resources for the country's
money-strained cultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at establishing a "multi-tier investment organism" for
cultural circles, the new regulations give the green light to
collecting a nationwide Culture Construction Levy.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, all the commercial dance halls,
Karaoke houses, music teahouses, golf courses, and billiard and
bowling alleys, will face a tax of three per cent of their
business income to help the country's culture construction. The
rule will also be applicable to the advertising agencies and news
media's advertising-related activities.
</P>
<P>
The levy will be exclusively collected by local tax organs, and
be turned over to treasuries of central and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
Using this levy, the country will set up a special fund to aid
culture across the country.
</P>
<P>
Tax payers will also be encouraged to donate to culture, with
donors offered a discount in annual income tax.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that tax payers donating up to three
per cent of annual income tax to cultural organizations such as
philharmonic orchestras, ballet and opera troupes, libraries,
museums, fine art galleries and historic relic protection
organizations, will be awarded with an equivalent income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also urge governments at all levels to increase
input in cultural business, and provide cultural circles with more
preferential policies in tax levies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will launch a number of special funds
for cultural projects, and the management for the funds will be
improved.

<HEADLINE> Top Military Leader Inspects PLA Unit To Be Stationed In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The vice-chairman of the
China Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing, has said that the
military forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to
be stationed in Hong Kong in 1997 have made great achievements in
the three years since the unit was founded.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remark during an inspection of the troops now
stationed in Shenzhen two days ago. He urged the troops to carry
on the fine traditions of the PLA, and be ready to present a good
image to the Hong Kong residents. Liu is also a standing committee
member of the political bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, Liu Huaqing visited the troops' barracks, and
reviewed a guard of honor of the three forces. He watched military
performances by the officers and soldiers, including shooting,
climbing, bayonet combat and boxing.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the soldiers' dormitories and dining rooms and
inquired about the soldiers' training, study and daily
life. During the inspection, Liu tested the soldiers on their
knowledge concerning the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, Liu heard a work report of the troops,
stressing that the stationing of the Chinese military forces in
Hong Kong will be both a military and political task, aimed at
safeguarding the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong. The move will also be an embodyment of Deng Xiaoping's idea
of "one country, two systems," he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu urged the officers and soldiers to be highly-disciplined,
and to deal properly with Hong Kong residents, making
contributions to the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland
as well as its stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed satisfaction with the unit's preparatory work,
but cautioned that they might meet unexpected problems. He urged
the officers and soldiers to lay a solid foundation politically
and militarily, to enhance their ability to cope with various
situations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Shenzhen, Liu also visited the seventh
National Book Fair, the Shenzhen Huawei Technology Company, and
Futian Bonded Zone. He stressed the importance of paying attention
to both economic development and the cultural and ideological
progress, and spoke highly of the achievements Shenzhen has made

<P>
HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese mainland financial
institutions in Hong Kong will not enjoy any special privileges
after 1997, the head of the People's Bank of China (PBC) said here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
These institutions will be subject to the same supervision of
the financial regulatory authorities in Hong Kong on the same
regulatory standards, PBC Governor Dai Xianglong told a dinner of
the Hong Kong Association of Banks, when speaking of the
relationship between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong after
1997.
</P>
<P>
Dai stressed that the PBC will not replace the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) and will not set up any branches in Hong
Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the two mutually independent monetary
systems, the PBC and the HKMA will maintain a mutually independent
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own separate note
issuing and currency management systems, he pointed out. The
renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar will be the legal tenders of the
Chinese mainland and Hong Kong respectively and will be in
circulation separately in the two places.
</P>
<P>
He said the Exchange Fund of Hong Kong will be administered
entirely by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR)
and the fiscal revenues of Hong Kong will be allocated at the
discretion of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
"We will not for any reason or in any manner utilize Hong
Kong's Exchange Fund or her other assets," he declared.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will not levy any tax in Hong Kong," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the HKSAR government will continue to be
responsible for the supervision of the financial institutions in
Hong Kong in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and
international practice.
</P>
<P>
 Dai disclosed that an association of banks in the Chinese

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Trudging Forward Amid Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry has
been growing steadily this year, but a poor economic performance
as a result of complicated factors remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at the Ministry of Machine-building Industry said
today that the machinery industry scored a gross industrial output
value of 341.06 billion yuan in the first nine months of this
year, up 10.4 percent, at comparable prices, over the
corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The production and marketing ratio reached 95.2 percent during
the period. Between January and August, electrical and mechanical
products worth 28.88 billion US dollars were exported, up 7.5
percent against the same period in 1995, which is higher than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman added that the machinery industry is expected
to reap a total output value of 450 billion yuan for the whole of
1996, up 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that the most outstanding problems are poor
economic performance, deteriorating profits and increasing
loss-making enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the industry gained
sales of 273.19 billion yuan, up 5.6 percent over the 1995
period. However, the pre-tax profits stood at 18.2 billion yuan, a
drop of 17.1 percent from the corresponding period of 1995, and
the aggregate profit was 4.63 billion yuan, down 41.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman attributed the problems to a shortage of
capital, shrinking domestic demand for investment products, and
insufficient production as a result of excessive imports.
</P>
<P>
But the most important factors leading to poor economic
performance, according to the spokeswoman, are poor quality,
irrational industrial structures, and weak development capability.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that it will be hard for the machinery industry
to have an all-round recovery in 1997, but the general situation
will improve.
</P>
<P>
The gross output value of the machinery industry is expected to
grow by 10 percent next year, said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's national flag
carrier Lufthansa is to stop its operation in Nepal in May, 1997,

<HEADLINE> Belarus' President Favors Deeper Integration With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko today proposed that lawmakers of Belarus and Russia
gather for a joint session in January 1997 "to decide the future
of integration and unity and, if necessary, reunification of the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the State Duma, the lower house of Russian
parliament, Lukashenko said that Belarus is for further
integration with Russia and "will go as far in this direction as
Russia is ready for."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who chairs the Supreme Council of the
Russia-Belarus Community, arrived in Moscow earlier today for a
short working visit.
</P>
<P>
He told the Russian lawmakers that "the Russian president
(Boris Yeltsin) welcomes the idea of broadening cooperation
between Belarus and Russia."
</P>
<P>
Denying assertions that Belarus is lagging behind Russia in
implementing reform, Lukashenko said: "The percentage of
privatized enterprises has never been the main argument for me."
</P>
<P>
"It's far more important to ensure that the privatized
enterprises work efficiently," he said, adding that privatization
will continue in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to strengthen strategic cooperation
between Belarus and Russia in joint efforts to oppose the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastward expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
"NATO expansion has actually begun," Lukashenko pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that Belarus is already fully ensuring Russian security
on the western direction, which costs his country 300 million
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
"Belarus has always been and remains a strategic partner of
Russia," Lukashenko said, noting that his country is ready to
develop relations with the West, but not to the detriment of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
While Lukashenko began speaking in the lower house, Russian
liberal reformist Grigory Yavlinsky and some 70 "democratic"
lawmakers walked out of the State Duma. Yavlinsky blasted
Lukashenko's speech as "a political show and buffoonery."
</P>
<P>
However, the Belarussian president was welcomed with a storm of
applause by communists and other Duma lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Businessmen Feel Snubbed at Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- When other businessmen
attending a regional economic conference in Cairo mingled freely
to do business today, their Israeli counterparts felt being
snubbed.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the third Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) economic conference opened Tuesday, some 1,500 businessmen
begin to negotiate business deals at the Cairo International
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
As the MENA conference has been downgraded to a ministerial
meeting in order to exclude politics from business at a time when
the Israeli-Arab peace process was deadlocked, Israel sent a
100-strong delegation to the meeting led by Foreign Minister
David levy and Minister of Trade and Industry Natany Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said the meeting was going well as political
meetings gave way to business ones. He said the Israeli
delegation had held business meetings with the Egyptians and
Jordanians to discuss ways to boost economic cooperation which
has taken a pace slower than expected so far.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli businessmen still felt the chill that
apparently affect their business. Although they hold strong
desire for doing business with counterparts in the region,
they conceded in the same time that they did not expect
much from such meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere is not the same like the previous meetings.
It is not (changing) for the better," said Micha Hertz,
Chairman of Israel's Kibbutz Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the atmosphere might change in
the future because politics always experienced ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
"It is a business meeting, it moves from a political
meeting in Casablanca to a business meeting. It is an
opportunity to meet business people around the world, including
from the Middle East," said Yoseph Rosen, Chairman of Israel
Cement Enterprises Ltd., adding he hoped politics should be
separated from business.
</P>
<P>
David Kimche, chairman of Israel's New Middle East Ltd.
which deals with agricultural exports, said that the current
tension in Israeli-Arab relations had obviously affected the
business.
</P>
<P>
The former Director-General of Foreign Ministry refused to
discuss politics, adding that he hoped the political effects
were small. He said he had done some business with the
Egyptians, but complained that the process was "too slow."
</P>
<P>
Rosen was among 60 Israeli and Egyptian businessmen who
held a meeting to explore ways of cooperation. He said no
concrete results came out of the meeting other than creating
a kind of "positive atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The uneasy feelings of the Israelis are understandable as
almost all the Arab participants blame Israel for poisoning
the political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions boycotted the
meeting, while President Hosni Mubarak warned that Israel could
expect no Arab cooperation while holding up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Industry and Trade Minister Ali Abu Ragheb also
sent a clear message to Israel Tuesday that no business
without peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries which have
normalized relations with the Jewish State. But Israel has
been complaining about the slow pace of economic normalization.
</P>
<P>
As the MENA economic conference entered its second day today,
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdulla Bin Hamad
Al-Attiyah told Xinhua that his country would keep its ties with
Israel frozen until progress is made in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Qatar suspended an indirect gas deal with Israel earlier this
year. The Gulf country signed a memorandum with a U.S. company on
the 2 billion dollar package at the Amman economic summit last
year.

LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's general elections
scheduled for November 18 will go ahead as arranged because there
is no justifiable reasons for postponing them, declared Zambian
Vice-president Godfrey Miyanda here today.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda was dispelling speculations at a press conference that
the November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections will be
postponed to a later date.
</P>
<P>
The speculations were based on a report saying Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba indicated in his recent tour of South
Africa that a postponement of the November elections was possible
to ensure all political parties had opportunities to contest.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda, who was speaking on behalf of President Chiluba,
denied that Chiluba made any commitment to postpone this year's
elections because the law did not allow it.
</P>
<P>
But he promised that the government would leave it entirely
for the electorial commission to decide whether to postpone the
elections.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's annual inflation
rate fell slightly to 20.2 in October against all market
expectations of a substantial rise to over 22 percent following
the recent spate of price rises.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National News Agency reported today that the
decline, from 20.6 percent in September, defies earlier
predictions by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that inflation would
rise between October and November before falling to below 20
percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The major contributor to the fall in inflation was the fall of
food prices by an average of 1.4 percent between September and
October, mainly as a result of this year's agricultural harvest.
</P>
<P>
During the height of the 1991/92 and 1993/94 droughts, food
prices shot up as a result of massive crop failures, which saw
inflation soar to a record level of over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there were fears that inflation could rise again
early next year, mainly because of the expected heavy government
borrowing to meet the huge civil service salary bill.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Pushing Forward State Firm Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
today reiterated that China will continue to push forward the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises in an active but cautious
manner.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of State Economic and Trade
Commission, made the pledge at the opening ceremony of the China
Summit 1996.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the official pointed out that the reform of
state enterprises has entered a critical period, as some of the
firms currently meeting serious difficulties.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a gradual reform process, paying much
attention to the balance between deepening of the reform, economic
growth and social stability, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
"Since China adopted opening and reform policies, state
enterprises, like other kinds of firms, have made constant
progress and their economic power has been increasingly
strengthened," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Chen said, between 1990-1995,
state-owned industrial enterprises experienced an average yearly
growth of 18.4 percent in their output value, and 13.8 percent in
profits and tax. The state enterprises have maintained a good
development trend as a whole, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that state companies are facing huge
pressures, due to the fact that the government has stopped the
practice of granting preferential policies to state firms; there
is no longer a "seller's market" in the country; and many
internationally-known name-brands have entered the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises are further plagued by the problems of old
ideas, inflexible management, low efficiency and not being adapted
to a market economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the number of loss-making state
firms, and the sum they have lost, have both been growing this
year, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "We can no longer save every state-owned
firm by using traditional methods, and the only way-out is reform."
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has applied its principles and policies
to restructuring of enterprises, to tackle the deep-level problems
faced by these firms.
</P>
<P>
The policies include setting up a modern enterprise system,
accelerating readjustments on industrial structure; supporting the
larger businesses and pushing into the market the smaller ones;
pushing forward the annexing and bankrupting of some firms,
strengthening enterprise management, relocating factory workers
who have been laid off, increasing capital funds through more
channels, speeding up related reforms on enterprise restructuring,
and strengthening personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the implementation of these measures has
yielded certain results, and balanced reform will succeed if more
efforts are to be made and continue to the end.

<HEADLINE> Rally to Mark 100th Anniversary of Wang Ruofei's Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Party History Research
Center of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee today
sponsored a symposium in the Great Hall of the People to mark the
100th anniversary of the birth of Wang Ruofei.
</P>
<P>
Wang is best known as the Party's long-tested proletarian
revolutionary, an outstanding political activist and a fighter
loyal to communism.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, attended the symposium and Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee, spoke highly of Wang's glorious merits, and
called for all the people to learn from his revolutionary spirit,
fine conduct and lofty moral character.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged the Chinese people to learn from Wang's spirit of
pursuing truth unswervingly, seeking truth from facts, and serving
the people whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruofei was born in Anshun in southwest China's Guizhou
province. He devoted himself to the communist cause in his youth,
and became a formal CPC member in 1923. During the Great
Revolution period in the 1920s, he acted as secretary-general of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the war against the Japanese aggression, Wang acted as
chief of staff of the Central Military Commission, and deputy
chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army. After the anti-Japanese
war, Wang, following Mao Zedong and Zou Enlai, took part in the
negotiations between the Communist Party of China and the
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
On April 8, 1946, Wang was killed in an airplane accident when
he was returning to Yan'an from Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> Police Wounded in Intensified French Guiana Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Two French paramilitary police
were shot today in the sixth day of French crackdown on riots in
French Guiana which was triggered by student protest against poor
school conditions in capital Cayenne, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The riot police and paramilitary police in Cayenne, greatly
reinforced by mainland France police, used armored vehicles and
tear gas to disperse the rioters, who returned with stones, fire
bombs and guns robbed from arms stores.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, groups of young rioters turned the
streets of the capital into battlefields, setting on fire
government buildings, turning over vehicles and looting shops and
armors, the Agence France Presse (AFP) said.
</P>
<P>
The French government condemned the riot, saying that it took
place when the impoverished colony began to see economic
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Last week, French Minister for Overseas Territories
Jean-Jacques de Peretti said the rioting was led by vandals "who
have nothing to do with the problems of education and the young."
</P>
<P>
However, an independence movement in New Caledonia, another
troubled French colony in the South Pacific, today blamed the
intensified violence on "irresponsibility of the local authorities
of French state."
</P>
<P>
Siding with the Guianese, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front said the tension would not have flared up if the
school strike were responded with "a responsible attitude by the
local authorities," AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
The revolt erupted on Thursday night when high school students,
after staging a strike demanding better school conditions,
barricaded the administrator of the French overseas department for
hours by burning tyres and throwing rocks outside his prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The French colony on the northeastern coast of South America,
where the European Ariane satellite launching space center is
located, has been suffering from sluggish economy, with an
unemployment close to 25 percent, double that of mainland
France. The youth are the worst hit by joblessness.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK) is
to invest billions of US dollars more in China in the next few
years, Dr. Han Seung-Soo, ROK Deputy Prime Minister, said in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
ROK companies' investments in China "now total 2 billion US
dollars on a cumulative basis, and this figure is likely to double
in the next few years as new projects move from the planning to
the implementation stage,' Han said.
</P>
<P>
The growing confidence and friendship between the two
neighboring countries was spelled out in the Chinese capital by
the deputy premier. He said that ROK-China relations show
promising prospects.
</P>
<P>
Han Seung-Soo, also Minister of Finance and Economy of the ROK,
was speaking at the opening session of the China Summit '1996.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Korean-Chinese industrial collaboration is still at a
very early stage. But I am hopeful that within a decade,
businesses from our two countries will be jointly developing,
manufacturing and marketing sophisticated products throughout the
world."
</P>
<P>
Calling China the nearest, largest, and most economically
dynamic neighbor of ROK, Dr. Han said China is already his
country's third largest trading partner.

Chinese joint ventures in the Northeast Asian region, to develop
infrastructure, as well as natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Han said that China's reform is successful, and he attributed
the success to China's policy to listing agriculture as a
priority, and to opening the country to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Only One in 20 Chinese Prisoners Reoffend After Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Less than six percent of
prisoners reoffend after their release from Chinese jails, one of
the lowest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a move to transform life behind bars, and treat inmates in a
civilized way, the country has selected model prisons as examples
of its penal system.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Justice today honored five model prisons,
chosen from across the country, in recognition of their painstaking
efforts of self-improvement during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The five model prisons, or "Modern and Civil Prisons", as the
ministry named them, are in Beijing, Zhejiang and Shandong
Provinces in east China, Yunnan Province in southwest China, and
Henan Province in Central China.
</P>
<P>
In early 1994, the Ministry of Justice called upon all prisons
across China to start the work of "building modern and civil
prisons".
</P>
<P>
It was intended to improve the general quality of the work in
prisons, and to bring about more satisfactory results for the
reform of criminals.
</P>
<P>
"The work is not only of great significance to the improvement
of China's prison system, but also in line with the promotion of
the socialist ethical and cultural progress," Zhang Xiufu, vice
minister of justice, said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the role of prisons as a window to display
China's level of civilization and social progress to the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice required a "modern and civil prison" to
possess advanced and full facilities, as well as a complete and
effective criminal reform system.
</P>
<P>
"It should also manage, teach, and reform the criminals in a
scientific and civil way, and achieve satisfactory results," Zhang
added.
</P>
<P>
The five prisons honored today have all passed strict
examinations and inspections by the justice ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the ministry is expecting to turn most
prisons in China into "modern and civil prisons" by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 680 prisons in China. Official figures
put the ratio of released criminals recommitting crimes at six
percent or so, which is one of the world's lowest.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce More Electricity to Meet Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
depend on privately-run generators to produce more electricity to
meet soaring demand by the year 2000, a government official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The government has signed agreements with the private sector to
build 19 electricity generators with a total capacity of 6,545
megawatts, President Director of the State Electricity Company
(PLN) Djiteng Marsudi said.
</P>
<P>
The PLN's generators now produce 15,000 megawatts and the
figure is expected to increase to 18,000 megawatts in the next
five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for electricity is expected to go up by 15 to 20 percent
from 10,000 megawatts in 1996 to 20,000 megawatts by the year
2001, Marsudi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mines and Energy Minister I. B. Sudjana underscored
the need to streamline the electricity sector to create a good and
transparent investment climate.
</P>
<P>
"In the era of globalization, the supply of electrical power
should no longer be monopolized by the PLN, but must be done in
cooperation with the private sector to encourage efficiency as
well as give better services to the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the minister said Indonesia will build more power
plants with a capacity of 23,900 megawatts by the year 2003/2004.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to make electricity available to
all regions, including the villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2003/2004, he added, the installed capacity is
expected to reach more than 35,000 megawatts, the electrification
ratio about 74 percent and the average electricity consumption 612
kwh per capita.

</P>
<P>
The government will also adopt measures to support the

</P>
<P>
As for China's push to open wider to the outside world, Chen

percent, China's tariffs will be lowered to the average level of
developing countries by the year 2000, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China will also open wider the doors of its agriculture,

<HEADLINE> Arabic Speeches in Knesset to be Translated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab members of the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) who address the plenum in Arabic
will have their speeches translated into Hebrew, Knesset Speaker
Dan Tichon promised this week.
</P>
<P>
Tichon said a translation service would be provided as long
as the number of speeches is "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Knesset (MK) who want to speak in Arabic will
have to supply a copy of their speeches in advance that will be
translated into Hebrew and read from the podium immediately
after the MK finishes his address.
</P>
<P>
"Both Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages, but
Arabic has not been used for the past 30 years, because the
Arabs themselves have neglected their rights," said Abdul Wahab
Darawshe, MK for the Democratic Arab Party.
</P>
<P>
"This consolidates Arabic as an official language and
consolidates the Arab presence in the Knesset and in Israel,"
Darawshe said.
</P>
<P>
Arab MKs in the present Knesset have increased the number of
speeches they give in Arabic, but until now the lack of
translation has meant Hebrew speakers have been unable to follow
what was said.
</P>
<P>
The promise of Arabic translation comes soon after the
Knesset provided a prayer room for Moslem MKs, who demanded they
have the same facilities as their Jewish peers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are two Arab parties, Hadash and the Arab
Democratic Party, in the present Knesset, while eleven MKs
represent more than 900,000 Arabs, comprising some 18 percent of
the total Israeli population of 5.5 millions.

BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- After its return to China in
1997, Hong Kong will be able to maintain its market environment
characterized by fair competition, Lu Ping, Director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The rules for free market operation will by no means be
undermined, and the situation favorable for the common development
of capital from different countries and various sectors will
remain unchanged, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"The central government of China, resuming its exercise of

Kong, nor will it levy taxes in the region," Lu Ping said in a
speech at "China Summit 1996."
</P>
<P>
All of Hong Kong's financial revenues will be placed solely in
the hands of the government of the Kong Kong Special
Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR), he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he explained, the Hong Kong-based mainland
organizations, which are treated no differently from local
investors and investors from other countries and regions, will
undertake economic activities guided by local supervisory bodies,
and operate strictly in accordance with the local market rules
without any privileges granted.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that the clear stipulations in the Basic Law
ensure the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as a free port, and
that any further development of its economic relations with the
rest of the world will further promote prosperity in Hong Kong and
create more business opportunities for people throughout the world
who are investing in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Document Praises China's Agricultural Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully met the
challenge of achieving universal food security in the face of
increasing population, says a technical background document
released here today at the World Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. document, entitled "Success Stories in Food Security,"
says China deserves acclamation for its ability to feed over
one-fifth of the world population with only one fifteenth of the
world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
It points out that starting from a level of 1,500 Calories per
capita per day at the beginning of the 1960s, China had increased
food availability to over 2,700 Calories per capita per day by the
beginning of the 1990s, almost exclusively through increases in
domestic production.
</P>
<P>
From being a country with a low level of food security during
1969-71, China has come close to being considered a country with a
high level of food security, the document notes.
</P>
<P>
The total shortfall of requirements for the undernourished was
nearly 15 percent in the beginning of the period considered,
falling to below five percent in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The document praises the reforms in agriculture initiated by
Chinese leadership after 1978. Such reforms included both
increased incentives in the form of higher state procurement
prices and a series of institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
It mentions in particular the predominance of the household
responsibility system, which restored the primacy of the
individual household in place of the collective team system as the
basic unit of production and management in the rural areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
The document says the real value of China's agricultural output
more than doubled since 1978, and the most rapid increase in rural
per capita income occurred between 1979 and 1984 when it averaged
a 15 percent increase per year.
</P>
<P>
It observes that in 1978, most of the poor resided in areas
where rapid productivity gains were feasible through an increase
use of farm inputs and hybrid seeds. By 1985, however, China's
remaining poor were in the less productive, less rained areas.
</P>
<P>
While some increases were achieved in these resource-poor
areas, the gains in agricultural growth were so far largely offset
by population growth, it says.

minister said the Chinese government has consistently depended on
domestic resources, viewed self-reliance in grain supply as a
basic policy for solving the food problem, and regarded family
planning and land protection as a basic national policy.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's annual net import of grain will not
exceed five percent of its domestic consumption under normal
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Experience has proved that the Chinese people have not only
succeeded in providing food for themselves, but also in improving
their living standards, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In changing the country's economic growth mode put forward by
the central government, a great improvement in the efficiency of
energy and raw materials should be achieved.
</P>
<P>
In building some trans-century projects such as the Three
Gorges Project, China has blazed a new trail of high efficiency,
low consumption and energy-saving, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As for the concern that China's environment will deteriorate as
a result of the country's rapid growth, Li said China will not
follow the formerly-held disastrous road of "pollution followed by
clean-up," which has been traveled by other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels in China are enhancing control over
industrial pollution and environmental treatment, and policies in
these areas are being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, 50,000 enterprises which had discharged waste
exceeding the state-set standard were forced to close.
</P>
<P>
With the progress of science and technology and improvements in
the nation's economic strength, China's work in environmental
protection will be sure to gain more effective results, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to cooperate with other countries in the
prevention and treatment of environmental pollution and in working
to benefit future generations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Minister: Ties With Israel Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's ties with Israel would
remain frozen until progress is made in the Middle East peace
process, announced Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Ben
Hamad al-Attiya here today.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Xinhua, the minister, now in the Egyptian
capital for the three-day Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
Economic Conference, said that his country would not implement
the indirect gas deal with Israel unless the Arab-Israeli
negotiations bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
Israel signed a memorandum at the 1995 Amman economic summit
with Enron Development Corporation of the U.S., covering the
supply of 2 billion dollars of Liquefied Natural Gas from Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The deal was suspended by the Gulf state earlier this year
after hardliners assumed power in Israel in June and slowed down
the peace process in this troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Hamad Al-Attiyah said: "There is no economic cooperation
between Qatar and Israel this time and the bilateral ties are
frozen until peace prevails in this region."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is hope that the gas deal would be revived, he
said the purchase agreement must be finalized first.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the most important matter and without peace there
will not be economic cooperation in the Middle East," the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabr
al-Thani said that his country backs the convening of the Cairo
economic conference despite the stalemate in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Urging Israel to follow the "land for peace" formula, Jabr
al-Thani expressed the belief that not only Israel but all the
MENA countries would benefit from the proposed economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is one of the few Gulf countries which preferred to
have normal relations with the Jewish state, but the changes in
Israel's government and policy prompted the Gulf state to
postpone the opening of a representative office in Tel Aviv and
canceled a visit by an Israeli business delegation earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Achieves "Soft Landing" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The over-heated economic
development in China has been effectively curtailed and the
Chinese economy successfully achieved a "soft landing," State
Councillor Li Tieying said here today at the opening of the "China
Summit 1996".
</P>
<P>
Owing to moderately-tight macro-economic control measures taken
by the Chinese Government, China's inflation rate plummeted from
21.7 percent in 1994 to 6.6 percent in the first three quarters of
this year, Li said in a speech entitled "China Marching to the
21st Century and the World Economic Development."
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate also dropped from 11.8 percent to 9.6
percent, and the exchange rate of Renminbi remained stable, said
Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission for
Restructuring Economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the country scored 8.1 billion US dollars in the
favorable balance of import and export trade, and 95.4 billion US
dollars in its total foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The grain output for this year is expected to reach 480 million
tons, a record high.
</P>
<P>
To date, various macro-control targets have been basically
accomplished, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to sustained development, the minister said this is a
global issue, concerning whether or not the international
community can bring a peaceful, stable and prosperous world into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion, China
pays great attention to the coordination between man and the
environment, regards sustained development as a matter of
strategic importance and makes it a part of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan and the long-term objectives through the year 2010.

He said that Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability is
also represented by the strengthening of its status as an
international financial center. Hong Kong will implement
independent monetary policy and system, which becomes an important
part of the principle of "high degree of autonomy" for the Hong
Kong SAR in the future.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China shall not interfere with its
operation, but instead will actively support the local financial
authorities in their efforts to stabilize the local finance,
maintain the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar, and consolidate
Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"While talking about continuous prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong after 1997, what's to be mentioned in particular is the
positive role of Chinese inland area in supporting and promoting
the development of the Hong Kong economy," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping was full of confidence about Hong Kong's future
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong will contribute not only to the reform and opening up drive
in the mainland, but also to the peace and development of the
Asian-Pacific region and even the whole world.

<HEADLINE> US: Gaza Industrial Park to Operate in 2 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The first Palestinian
industrial park is to begin operating at the Karni junction
between Israel and the Gaza Strip within two months, according
to today's Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Stuart Eisenstadt, U.S. Undersecretary of
Trade, as saying that he believed that a U.S. team, working
with the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, has
made "real progress."
</P>
<P>
The park is one of nine planned industrial zones for the
Palestinian autonomous areas that will be financed by Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon told
Eisenstadt Monday that Israel would provide water and
electricity for the parks, including those located on the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reportedly
prefers that the Karni park straddles the border between Israel
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky said
Israel is prepared to contribute more than the 14 million
U.S. dollars initially earmarked for the park, even if it does
not straddle the border.
</P>
<P>
Until now, senior ministry sources have said that the
government would not provide assistance if the entire park was
located inside the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
"We on the Israeli side are organizing to do everything we
can in Karni, but we still have to look at the important issues
of security and legislation," said Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel may help fund a rail link to the area,
saying "we want them to have what they require, and we do not
want to impose our will on them."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves Against Human Rights Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has launched a
diplomatic offensive to avert the adoption of another resolution
against it on human rights by the current session of the United
Nations Generalby Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Ambassador to the UN Ibrahim Gambari met with African
envoys on Friday to seek their support against the proposed
resolution, the Nigerian media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cambari is acting on the information that the United Kingdom
and the European Union are planning such a resolution against
it.
</P>
<P>
Gambari urged the African envoys to oppose the resolution by
supporting a "no action" motion to be tabled by Nigeria if the
resolution was introduced.
</P>
<P>
He briefed his African counterparts on the development of
human rights and democracy in Nigeria, saying that the
transition-to-civil-rule program is now fully on course and
political activities have resumed with the registration of five
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has intensified efforts to implement
most of the recommendations dictated by a recent UN report, the
envoy said, adding a national human rights commission has been
established in Nigeria, with the release of 20 persons detained
under Decree Two of 1984.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing the Untied States presidential campaign slogan of
Republic candidate Bob Dole, Gambri told the African ambassadors
to "just say no" to the authors of the proposed resolution, which
is expected to be introduced at a committee of the assembly this
month.
</P>
<P>
The UN adopted a resolution against Nigeria last year, when Nigerian
author Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogonis were
executed. Ogonis are a
minority people in Nigeria seeking government compensation for the
pollution of their land by oil firms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israelis, Palestinians Seek to Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arafat's political adviser Ahmed Tibi said that the
Palestinians were demanding Netanyahu put down in writing a
timetable for implementing the peace agreements, known as the
Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said that the Palestinians were concerned that the peace
process will be put on hold following the Israeli redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He added that he doubted that any breakthrough will be
achieved before Netanyahu's scheduled departure for the
U.S. tonight to address the annual assembly of North American
Jewish federations in Seattle Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, pulling back from approximately 80 percent of the
city.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March which left more than 60 people dead
and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In last May, the previous Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general election, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterwards that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the center
of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 120,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he
would like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements
with the Palestinians, but at the same time he also said he
would stand by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Israelis and Palestinians started a
new round of continuous talks on the redeployment in Hebron,
which had already been delayed for more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
during the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements agreed upon under the Oslo accords, in light of the
violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations, triggered by the opening of the
Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70
people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, which had included
exchanges of fires between Israeli troops and Palestinian
police, US President Bill Clinton called an emergency summit in
Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks, in an attempt
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of Ross and other U.S. officials, the Israelis and
Palestinians failed to complete a deal on the Hebron
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Aid for Female Dropouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to attract more
donations from both at home and abroad to enable millions of girls
in poverty-stricken areas return school.
</P>
<P>
Kang Ling, vice president of the China Children's and
Teenagers' Fund, said at a press conference here today that it is
still difficult for all school-age girls in the country to go to
school. Therefore, foreign and Chinese institutes and personnel
are expected to donate more to aid them, he added.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that a special program to aid these girls, called
the "Spring Bud Plan," received four million yuan (500,000 US
dollars) of donations in 1995, with half of them given by people
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Aided by the funds, 50,000 girls returned to school this year,
bringing the total number who have benefited from the "Spring Bud"
project to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 70 percent of the school-age children who
cannot afford schooling costs are girls. Some rural farmers plan
to invest money they received from the "Hope Project," another
program to aid poor students, in their sons, who are considered to
be the backbone of a family, according to Chinese tradition.
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate of girls in some areas is high and continues
to climb, Kang said.
</P>
<P>
Her foundation, along with the Ministry of Culture, China
Central Television and the Capital Society of Women Artists, have
decided to hold two New Year's concerts next month, and will
donate the box-office receipts to the girls for schooling.
</P>
<P>
The foundation is also creating 1,000 "Spring Bud Classes" in
local provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
The cost for a girl to study in school for one year is about
300 yuan (38 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has invested a large amount of money to
build schools. But some farmers are still too poor to send their
children to the new classrooms.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, minister in
charge of the State Planning Commission, said today that China's
national economy will maintain its highly desirable development
trend through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening ceremony for China Summit' 1996,
Chen said that despite natural disasters in some parts of the
country and the poor operation of some state-owned enterprises,
China's economy enjoyed a rapid growth rate during the first nine
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the increase in the retail price index
stayed at about seven percent during the period, and the output of
summer grain witnessed a new high.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China is expected to set a record-high grain output
this year, with steady increases in the production of animal
husbandry and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth was seen in the country's industrial sector, and
its fiscal revenue quickly increased.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Ninth Five-Year Plan, Chen noted that China will
maintain an average growth rate of eight percent in the 1996-2000
period, while significantly lowering the scope of the price
increase, and maintaining the growth rate for fixed assets
investment at around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, China will attach great importance to
building up agriculture, energy, transport and telecommunication
sectors and water conservancy projects.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Kill SLA Militiaman in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked this morning a
position of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia
in an Israeli-occupied border strip, and killed a militiaman.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of Hezbollah, announced that one group of its
fighters killed a SLA militiaman in an operation in the middle
sector of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio Voice of the South, organ of the Israeli client
militia, admitted that an SLA position at Alman, Marjayoun, was
attacked at 7:40 a.m. (05:40 GMT) by guerrillas, and one
militiaman was killed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio confirmed that another SLA militiaman was
injured in an attack carried out by Hezbollah guerrillas at an
SLA patrol near the position of Sweidah Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA militia, provided and trained by Israel,
patrols the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone," which was set
 up by the Jewish state in 1985 in a bid to prevent
crossing-border guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli heavy artillery bombarded this morning suspected
guerrilla targets in the Litani river basin and on the hills
facing the buffer zone, without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
High Tensions have shrouded south Lebanon since the weekend
following a series of operations carried out by Hezbollah
guerrillas in the border strip in which one Israeli soldier was
killed and some five others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla campaign
against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, have launched a
number of attacks at the Israeli occupation forces and the SLA
militia.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory bombardments
 by Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last active
battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a large-scale blitz against Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon in April, which lasted 17 days and
in which some 200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The blitz only ended when the United States mediated a
cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and the Jewish
state.

commitment to achieving food security for all and to an on-going
effort to eradicate hunger in all countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World
Food Summit Plan of Action, the immediate goal will be to reduce
the number of undernourished people to half no later than 2015.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, held by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), has brought together state and government leaders from more
than 140 countries around the world to pledge their commitment to
ensuring food security for all and eradicating hunger and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration says it is intolerable and unacceptable that
more than 800 million people throughout the world, and
particularly in developing countries, do not have enough food to
meet their basic nutritional needs.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirms that a peaceful, stable and enabling political,
social and economic environment is the foundation which will
enable states to give adequate priority to food security and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is a major cause of food insecurity and sustainable
progress in poverty eradication is critical to improving access to
food," the Declaration says.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the urgency of taking action now to fulfill the
responsibility of achieving food security for present and future
generations. Attaining food security is a complex task for which
the primary responsibility rests with individual governments, the
document adds.
</P>
<P>
"Food should not be used as an instrument for political and
economic pressure," the Declaration points out. It reaffirms the
importance of international cooperation and solidarity as well as
the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures, not in
accordance with international law and the Charter of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration sets seven commitments for the governments of
all countries to undertake in realizing food security and
eradicating hunger and malnutrition. The action plan defined
detailed objectives and actions necessary to fulfill these
commitments.
</P>
<P>
The seven commitments are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- We will ensure an enabling political, social and economic
environment designed to create the best conditions for the
eradication of poverty and for durable peace, based on full and
equal participation of women and men, which is most conducive to
achieving sustainable food security for all;
</P>
<P>
-- We will implement policies aimed at eradicating poverty and
inequality and improving physical and economic access by all, at
all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and
its effective utilization;
</P>
<P>
-- We will pursue participatory and sustainable food,
agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies
and practices in high and low potential areas, which are essential
to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household, national,
regional and global levels, and combat pests, drought and
desertification, considering the multifunctional character of
agriculture;
</P>
<P>
-- We will strive to ensure that food, agricultural trade and
overall trade policies are conducive to fostering food security
for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system;
</P>
<P>
-- We will endeavor to prevent and be prepared for natural
disasters and man-made emergencies and to meet transitory and
emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, and
to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that
encourage recovery, rehabilitation, development and a capacity to
satisfy future needs;
</P>
<P>
-- We will promote optimal allocation and use of public and
private investments to foster human resources, sustainable food
and agriculture systems, and rural development, in high and low
potential areas;
</P>
<P>
-- We will implement, monitor, and follow-up this Plan of
Action at all levels in cooperation with the international
community.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,437 violations of
the Thai electoral law have been reported to the PollWatch since
election campaigns began in the country on October 21, according
to poll sources today.
</P>
<P>
The PollWatch is a neutral agency that supervises Thailand's
general elections scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported cases, 1,042 involved candidates giving money
to potential voters and 227 concerned officials failing to remain
neutral as requested by law.
</P>
<P>
"In this election, money dumping is heavier than it has ever
been. It is the heaviest in the northeastern region," said
PollWatch Vice Chairman Vijit Yoosuphab.
</P>
<P>
"Vote-buying has been reported in every area and fraud is
everywhere," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said 100-baht (four U.S. dollars) notes are the most popular
denomination being withdrawn from commercial banks across the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that with vote-buying so rampant nationwide, about 20
billion to 30 billion baht (800 million to 1.2 billion dollars)
may have been spent since the election campaigns started.

<HEADLINE> FAO Chief Urges Concrete National Measures on Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organization (FAO) today urged governments all
over the world to take concrete measures to incorporate the
decisions made at the World Food Summit into projects and programs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the summit this morning, FAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf outlined the main points of the
"Rome Declaration on World Food Security" which will be adopted
shortly after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The document reaffirms "the right of everyone to have access to
safe and nutritious food" and sets the immediate goal of reducing
the number of undernourished people to half their present level no
later than 2015.
</P>
<P>
It considers it "intolerable that more than 800 million people
throughout the world, and particularly in developing countries, do
not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs."
</P>
<P>
It also specifies that "food should not be used as an
instrument for political and economic pressure."
</P>
<P>
After outlining the seven commitments in the declaration which
are designed to ensure that "all people, at all times, have
physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious
food," Diouf emphasized that these commendable international
decisions risk turning sour unless measures are taken here and now
to mould them into national projects and programs.
</P>
<P>
He added that operational decisions have to be taken at the
country level, because it is only there the changes can be made to
move the indicators of food security forward and to open the way
for development options that will conserve the already
over-exploited natural resources and guarantee social equity in
the distribution of the fruits of agricultural growth.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraq Opposes Turkey's Plan to Establish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz strongly objected to the security belt which
Turkey plans to establish in northern Iraq to fight against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), thus leaving this issue
the most serious difference between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who paid a one-day surprise visit to Ankara on his
return trip from Moscow Tuesday, announced his objection
following the meeting with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
There also existed difference of opinions between Aziz and
Ciller on the subjects about the Turkomen's role and the peace
process in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters that Iraq would not accept any security
belts which are unilaterally established, and Iraq could not
condone any cross-border operations staged by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller also told reporters that Turkey and Iraq should "solve
their difference of opinions through dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul, the main aide to Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, reassured Iraq that Turkey's fight
against the PKK militants in northern Iraq is not aimed at
breaking down Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government troops have been staging cross-border
military operations in northern Iraq in a bid to wipe out the
PKK rebels, who take shelter in this region and infiltrate into
Turkey to attack military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
autonomy, which has claimed over 21,000 lives, including
civilians, government troops and PKK militants, in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Turkish analysts said that Aziz's visit to Turkey was aimed
at asking Ankara for support to the quick implementation of the
long-delayed oil-for-food deal signed by Baghdad and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also wants this because the sooner the deal is
implemented, the sooner the Turks will start receiving transit
fees for their petrol pipelines from Iraq. The fact that Iraq
will be buying Turkish goods is also mouthwatering for Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Aziz, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
told reporters that the two countries would play a vital
role for the total peace and stability in the region, saying
that the trade ties between the two countries should be enhanced
to the highest level as Turkey lost over 30 billion U.S. dollars
due to the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
Aziz's meetings with Turkish leaders coincided with a
strong-worded protest Baghdad lodged against Turkey's alleged
violations of its territorial integrity through cross-border
strikes against the PKK guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf sent a letter Tuesday to U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, accusing the Turkish troops of shelling
Iraq's villages and towns in the north and illegally entering
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf urged Turkey to end the mandate of the U.S. and allied
forces policing a no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit came to block the joint Turkish and U.S. efforts
to work out a peaceful settlement between the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) led by Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) headed by Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
The second Ankara meeting is expected to be held on November
15 with the participation of the representatives of the U.S.,
Britain, Turkey, the Turkoman Front in northern Iraq, the KDP
and the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted between the Iraqi Kurds factions once
again when the KDP drove the PUK out of the Kurdish enclave with
Iraqi military support at the end of August. Last month, the PUK
launched counterattacks and regained the bulk of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is aware that Aziz's visit has raised some eyebrows in
the United States where such contacts with the Iraqi regime are
undesired.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a fact that Turkey simply cannot ignore the
Iraqi authorities in Baghdad. The Turks are obliged to deal with their
neighboring Iraq, but of course this has to be done in an
appropriate manner until Baghdad agrees to fully implement the
terms established by the United Nations for its reintegration
into the international community.

<HEADLINE> World Delegates Uphold Peace Through Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen and officials from
the four corners of the world have expressed their common desire
to cement peace through economic cooperation at the Cairo
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian participants called for an
enhanced role by business in promoting political stability and
peace, though they are far apart on the very definition of
peace.
</P>
<P>
President of the Israel Manufacturers Association Dan Propper
told Xinhua Tuesday that the economic conference
gives good prospects for doing business as well as promoting
peace. "Good conference, good atmosphere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Director of Israel World Trade Center Moshe Nahum, speaking
in the same vein, said that business will help cement peace
when fluctuations occur in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The 95 Israeli businessmen, eager to do business with
Jordan and Egypt, are coming here with the idea of making
Israel their partner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli business lineup was echoed by Palestinian
participants who tried to draw world attention to their plight
and strong desire for better life.
</P>
<P>
Eager to reactivate their ailing economy after 27 years of
Israeli occupation, the Palestinians are wondering how.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Finance Minister Muhammad Nashashibi said that no
country could survive and develop when it is deprived of a
free access to trade, job and business.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty can never produce peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
An eight-month Israeli-imposed closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip bars thousands of Palestinian workers from reaching
jobs in Israel and brings export and trade to a near halt,
costing the Palestinian economy millions of dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Charles-Alexis Mossa,
director-general of external economic relations of the European
Commission, also urged Israel to resolve the Palestinian issue
as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the deterioration in the Palestinian economy
could lead to more violent uprisings and the halt of
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
A businesswoman from Motorola in the 177-strong U.S. team
expressed the belief that "economic push will drive the
political process and peace will take place faster" through
the business meeting, which she termed as "very smart."
</P>
<P>
She said the hope of Mideast peace should rest in the
hands of people here, although she believed the U.S. will
play an important role in the process.
</P>
<P>
The head of an Egyptian advertising company, Kamal Iskander,
said that he and his compatriots are eager to make their
due contributions to the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress in Israeli talks with the Palestinians
and the absence of negotiations with Syria and Lebanon have
cast a shadow over the ongoing meeting, designed to draw
foreign investors to the region.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 3000 officials and business people are participating
in the three-day event, which opened Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Thai Democrat Party to Win Most Seats: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Democrat Party led
by former Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has been projected to lead
in the country's general elections on Sunday with 132 seats,
according to a poll conducted by the Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The poll put the New Aspiration Party in second place with 122
seats out of a total of 393 at stake.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Pattana (National Development) party led by former
Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan was placed third with 51
seats, while the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party led by outgoing
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa was forecast to rank fourth
with 36 seats.
</P>
<P>
As no party is likely to win a clear-cut majority in the
elections, the new Thai government is expected to be a coalition,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are expected to win 49 of the 52 seats in the
south of the country, 26 of the 37 in Bangkok and 19 each in the
northern, northeastern and central regions, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration party, led by outgoing Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, is likely to win 64 of
the 137 seats in the northeast, 24 of the 75 seats in the north,
31 of the 92 in the central region and three in the south.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israelis, Palestinians Seek to Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are to continue talks today on Israeli troop
redeployment from Hebron following a late Tuesday night meeting
near Tel Aviv, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
High-level negotiators were reportedly cloistered in Tuesday's
 talks, which lasted after midnight, at U.S. Ambassador Martin
Indyk's residence in Herzliya Pituah, northeast of Tel Aviv, in
a last-ditch effort to work out an agreement over Hebron by
today.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak headed the Israeli
negotiating team to the talks, and the Palestinian side was led
by Mahmoud Abbas, deputy for Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who is currently in the
Egyptian capital of Cairo to attend the regional economic
conference, said Tuesday night that an agreement on the
redeployment in Hebron could be signed today.
</P>
<P>
Both Levy and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
also in Cairo to attend the conference, said an agreement is
very close and would almost certainly be reached this week.
</P>
<P>
Levy also hinted that a signing ceremony would be held at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip, between
Netanyahu and Arafat, attended by U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
A source said that Ross was standing by to see whether to
come to Israel from Cairo today to finalize the agreement, but
added that Ross would not come unless there is sure ground to
tread on.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
might postpone his scheduled departure for the U.S. tonight
because of the negotiations, adding that "his presence is
necessary here at this sensitive juncture."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the optimistic expectation that a deal
will be sealed very soon, other Israeli sources remained
pessimistic, saying the gap between the two sides is still too
great.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Palestinians earlier had turned down
a bridging proposal put forward by the U.S., still hoping that
the U.S. will make Israel give up the additional security
arrangements it would like in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"We were ready to sign two and a half weeks ago," an Israeli
official said. "But unless there is a dramatic breakthrough, it
does not look possible, and Arafat still has to give the go
ahead."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu is ready to meet a key Palestinian
demand and issue a written pledge to honor all agreements
between the two sides, including further withdrawal in the West
Bank, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation Sunday night, Netanyahu assured
Arafat of Israel's commitment to implement all the agreements,
urging the Palestinian leader to speed up the signing of the
agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian officials later said that they consider
this "a word commitment" only, adding Netanyahu has failed to
convince Arafat to conclude the negotiations on the Hebron
redeployment.

HANOI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As many as 337 out of a total of
536 AIDS victims died of the fatal disease in Vietnam in recent
years, a report of the National AIDS Committee said.
</P>
<P>
There are now 4,344 HIV carriers in the country and Lang Son
province has the highest number of residents detected HIV positive
so far this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It cited drug addiction, prostitution and blood transfusion as
the main sources of virus transmission, saying 71 percent of the
victims are drug addicts and prostitutes.
</P>

Ho Chi Minh city, Khanh Hoa province on the central coast and
An Giang province in the Mekong delta are cited as places where
the transmission of the virus is most active.

Vietnam has a population of 75 million. The Vietnamese National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology has predicted that the
number of HIV carriers in the country could exceed 356,000 by the
year 2000 and up to 15,000 people could die from the deadly
disease which attacks the body's immune system.

</P>
<P>
Wang said people in the industrial and commercial circles of
both China and ROK should increase exchanges and cooperation, and
jointly promote the development of the economic and trade ties
between the two sides, and friendly relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening
policy and economic development, saying he hopes that such big
enterprises as the Hyosung Group in the ROK will grasp
opportunities to expand investment in China, in order to bring
economic and trade ties between the two countries to a higher
level.
</P>
<P>
Cho Sok Rai agreed with Wang, saying that since the ROK and
China are close neighbors, the increasingly close economic and
trade ties will bring about a better relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hyosung Group is a well-known large enterprise in the ROK. It
has an investment in China totalling 200 million US dollars, and
is now planning to expand its investment.

<HEADLINE> China: Re-Employment Scheme Lands Million Workers New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Liu Xiaoli, a textile worker
laid off earlier this year, recently was hired as a sales clerk at
the "Red Babies" Beef Chain Shop in Chengdu of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The store also employed 37 other laid-off women. Other
unemployed women from Sichuan took tests and exams to get work in
modern plazas, such as the Chengdu Pacific Store.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a successful fledgling re-employment plan in China's
most populous province, more than 10,000 laid-off workers have
landed new jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Sichuan is not the only province in China that has
benefited from the nationwide project, launched a year ago to cope
with the rapidly-growing army of laid-off workers and surplus
laborers that are the by-product of enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
In the booming city of Chaozhou in Guangdong Province, the
forerunner in China's opening up drive, more than 26,000 laid-off
workers and surplus laborers from various firms have found work.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city, family-related service
trades have become major channels of re-employment for thousands
of dismissed workers.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Labor told Xinhua that China has
re-employed over a million laid-off workers since last year.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deepening of enterprise reforms, China must face
the reality of a growing number of laid-off workers and surplus
laborers, as some unprofitable firms have gone bankrupt or
closed. Others require less manpower, due to technological
advancements and a higher level of automation, ministry officials
observed.
</P>
<P>
While the massive lay-offs will help raise the productivity of
relevant enterprises, they also tend to create social problems if
difficulties experienced by the laid-off workers are not addressed
properly, economists here noted.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a number of measures to deal with this issue,
including finding new jobs for those who have been laid-off, and
establishing a minimum wage system to guarantee the basic needs
for those unlikely to get a job soon.
</P>
<P>
Employment agencies have mushroomed to cash in on the
opportunities: in Sichuan alone, 1,252 such businesses have opened.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei and other provinces, firms specializing in training
the laid-off workers have sprung up.

SEOUL, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China adheres to the

technology, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>

and industrial ties with research and development institutions,
aiming at the establishment of a new type of science and
technology system by the year 2000, to meet the requirement of the

<P>
The Chinese government and the science community are trying
their best to create a sound environment and better conditions for
promoting science and technology cooperation in the APEC, he said,

with all APEC members."
</P>
<P>
During the two days, the nearly 300 conference participants
from 18 APEC members as well as other international organizations
will discuss the policy outlook on regional science and technology
and joint activities under the APEC Action Program of industrial
science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Macro Economy Operates Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 13 (Xinhua/OANA) -- China's macro economy has
been operating well since the beginning of this year, according to
information from a recent national meeting on finance and
financial accounts held in Ezhou City of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first nine months of 1996, China
realized 4,567.5 billion yuan in gross domestic product, a rise of
9.6 percent over the same period of last year, according to
constant prices.
</P>
<P>
Though more than a half of the country's provinces and
autonomous regions were hit by serious or devastating natural
disasters, the country's agricultural situation is still
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that grain output of the whole country will
reach a record high of 480 billion kg this year, an increase of
13.5 billion kg over last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, industry has also been faring well, with the
added value created by industrial businesses at and above township
level, amounting to 1,357.5 billion yuan in the first three
quarters. This represents a rise of 12.9 percent, compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The market has been recovering, with the ratio of production of
industrial products to marketing improving month by month. The
average ratio of production to marketing from January to September
reached 94.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financial situation has been stable, and the
moderate tight money policy has been well implemented, according
to reports from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of the year, the savings deposit
balance of rural and urban residents in the whole country reached
3,700 billion yuan, an increase of 737 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Banks across the country increased the issue of an additional
440.6 billion yuan in loans in the first nine months, to be used
for purchasing farm and sideline produce, supporting major
enterprises and major projects.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining a better balance between revenue and
expenditure, China has also been successful in curbing inflation,
which has brought the price hikes to their lowest level.
</P>
<P>
The country has also experienced rapid expansion in its foreign
trade, more foreign economic cooperation, and has continued to
maintain a favorable balance between imports and exports, with the
foreign exchange reserves continuing to grow.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demand Rights at Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have used the
Cairo economic conference as a political forum to defend their
rights to survival rather than a meeting to forge business ties.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister of the Palestinian Authority Muhammad
Nashashibi Tuesday told a session on the Palestinian economy at
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference that
the Palestinian people are suffering heavily from the
Israeli-imposed closure of the West Bank and Gaza strip since
March.
</P>
<P>
The closure bars thousands of Palestinian workers from
reaching jobs in Israel and brings export and import trade to a
near halt, costing the Palestinian economy millions of dollars a
day.
</P>
<P>
"No country can survive and develop under such conditions,
when they are barred from the freedom to travel, to work and do
business," he said, adding that poverty can never produce peace.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties concerned with the peace process to end
the so-called "combative peace" between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian official urged the Israeli
government to lift the restrictions and closures imposed after a
wave of suicide bombing attacks in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Though there are many misgivings, the private sector in the
Palestinian self-rule areas has given a story of success, he
said, adding that there are several private power and
telecommunications companies as well as a private financial
market operating in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before the afternoon session, Samir Hulleileh, under-secretary
of the Trade and Industry Ministry of the Palestinian Authority,
told Xinhua that the Palestinian delegation is here to express
their desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
Specifying the mission of the 45-member Palestinian
delegation, he said they came here, foremostly, to press and
declare their position with Israel on the self-rule areas that
peace has to proceed and Israel should not and cannot stop it.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, restrictions and closures have to be removed and
make way for free trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli command cannot have everything in its hand. It
cannot block peace while collect the benefit of peace in such
conference," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With the risks, there are also benefits and low risk
investment projects available," he said in an apparent effort to
attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation comprises 15 businessmen and 30
government officials, much smaller than its teams to the
previous MENA conferences.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 60 Palestinian delegates went to the Amman summit
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Association and Chamber of Commerce boycotted
the three-day meeting, which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Israel and the Arab world has been high since
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu formed a hardline government
in Israel in June. Egypt, angered by Netanyahu's negotiating
policies with the Palestinians, at one point nearly called off
the conference.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Ready To Send Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is ready to
send troops as part of an international peace keeping force to
the strife-torn eastern Zaire, a local daily "The Citizen" said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Permanent Secretary in Botswana's Foreign Affairs
Ministry, Charles Ntwaagae, said yesterday in Gaborone that the
Botswanan government could send between 600 and 800 troops to the
Great Lakes region, but the final decision would likely be made
early next week.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan troops will only serve under the auspices of the
United Nations or the Organisation of African Unity, Ntwaagae
said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana will consult its military contrubutin to Zaire with
the 12-member Southern African Development Community, headed by
South African President Nelson Mandela, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Botswana was closely following the
developments in Zaire and is looking forward to resolving "what
we consider as an African problem" in that region.
</P>
<P>
Recent fighting between Zairean troops and its Tutsi rebels in
eastern Zaire has caused an exodus of millions of refugees in the
area.
</P>
<P>
A regional summit held in Nairobi of Kenya early this month
decided that an international neutral force should be created to
provide safe corridors for aid to more than one million refugees
in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Fight Against Hunger, Aid to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today urged the international community to make food
security an absolute priority and come to the aid of the one
million refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the first-ever World Food
Summit in Rome, the U.N. chief said the problem of hunger is not
only an economic, social or political issue, but also an ethical
and moral one.
</P>
<P>
He noted that hunger is a direct affront not only to the
physical integrity but also to the very dignity of the human
person.
</P>
<P>
"Hunger is an insult to the fundamental values of the
international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that even today when the summit is proceeding,
800 million people around the world are suffering from chronic
malnutrition; 88 states, almost half of which are situated in
sub-Saharan Africa, know the pangs of chronic famine and
malnutrition; and 200 million children under the age of five are
suffering from malnutrition and food deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable to see certain parts of the world
staggering under an abundance of food, while other parts lack
essential foodstuffs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite intolerable to see certain countries wasting or
destroying food, whereas others can not provide their children
with even elementary needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the World Food Summit will provide the occasion
for a new and general mobilization against hunger.
</P>
<P>
"In drawing the attention of everyone to the threats posed by
hunger and malnutrition to nations and to vast areas of the
planet, the World Food Summit clearly places the problem of hunger
among the foremost present and future priorities of the
international community." he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also expressed his concern over the situation in
eastern Zaire. "I should like to make a solemn appeal here to the
international community to help those men, women and children who
have lost everything and who face certain death unless they
receive immediate assistance."
</P>
<P>
"The international community must come to the aid of the
refugees in Zaire," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the largest gathering of heads of state and
government ever in Italy.

MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Workers, students and
government personnel in the Philippines' capital region and
Olongapo City will get four days of special holiday because of
the planned Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
meetings in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree issued today, President Fidel Ramos
declared the days between November 22 and 26 as special
non-working holidays in the two areas to ensure a free and
uninterrupted flow of traffic during the APEC meetings. November
24 is a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A series of APEC forum meetings, including an informal
gathering of leaders from 18 APEC economies, will be held in
Manila and Subic between November 22 and 25.
</P>
<P>
"The regular heavy traffic conditions cannot otherwise be eased
if normal working schedules are observed," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The decree suspended regular office hours for all government
offices, including corporations owned and controlled by the

<HEADLINE> Macro Economy Operates Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's macro economy has been
operating well since the beginning of this year, according to
information from a recent national meeting on finance and
financial accounts held in Ezhou City of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first nine months of 1996, China
realized 4,567.5 billion yuan in gross domestic product, a rise of
9.6 percent over the same period of last year, according to
constant prices.
</P>
<P>
Though more than a half of the country's provinces and
autonomous regions were hit by serious or devastating natural
disasters, the country's agricultural situation is still
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that grain output of the whole country will
reach a record high of 480 billion kg this year, an increase of
13.5 billion kg over last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, industry has also been faring well, with the
added value created by industrial businesses at and above township
level, amounting to 1,357.5 billion yuan in the first three
quarters. This represents a rise of 12.9 percent, compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The market has been recovering, with the ratio of production of
industrial products to marketing improving month by month. The
average ratio of production to marketing from January to September
reached 94.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financial situation has been stable, and the
moderate tight money policy has been well implemented, according
to reports from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of the year, the savings deposit
balance of rural and urban residents in the whole country reached
3,700 billion yuan, an increase of 737 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Banks across the country increased the issue of an additional
440.6 billion yuan in loans in the first nine months, to be used
for purchasing farm and sideline produce, supporting major
enterprises and major projects.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining a better balance between revenue and
expenditure, China has also been successful in curbing inflation,
which has brought the price hikes to their lowest level.
</P>
<P>
The country has also experienced rapid expansion in its foreign
trade, more foreign economic cooperation, and has continued to
maintain a favorable balance between imports and exports, with the
foreign exchange reserves continuing to grow.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Meets with ROK Deputy Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The future of economic
cooperation between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) is
optimistic for the period leading up to the 21st century, a senior
Chinese minister said.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, a state councilor and minister in charge of the
State Commission for Economic Restructuring, made the comment
Tuesday evening during a meeting with Seung-Soo Han, deputy prime
minister and minister of finance and economy of the Republic of
Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Li said China and ROK have a 2,000-year history of friendly
contacts, and that billateral economic and trade cooperation have
grown satisfactorily in recent years. He added that he is
convinced that there is a bright future to overall economic,
cultural, and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Seung-Soo Han said that it is a wonder that China, a big
country, has boosted its economic growth to double-digit
growth. He expressed admiration for China's success in reforming
its economic system, and reining in inflation.
</P>
<P>
ROK and China have made rapid progress in developing the
economy and investment since 1992, when the two countries
established diplomatic relations, he said, and that he hopes
relations between the two countries will develop further on the
existing sound basis.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the ROK for its economic development in the past 30
years, and said that China will continue to study and learn from
international economic development, including that of the ROK.

<HEADLINE> US Official: No Major Policy Changes Toward Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- There will be no major changes
in the U.S. policy toward Israel after President Bill Clinton's
re-election, a senior U.S. State Department official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Simons, Director of the Office of Peace Process and
Regional Affairs at the U.S. State Department, made the remark in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Simons, who is a member of the U.S. delegation participating
in the third Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
(MENA Three), said that "the U.S. policy on Israel has
been ... very consistent, and I don't foresee any major changes."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had pinned much hope on the U.S. to put more
pressure on Israel at the negotiation table after Clinton was
re-elected because they thought that the president would no
longer fear losing the Jewish votes. In this context, Simons'
words came like cold water thrown on them.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Simons joined a press conference given by the
Middle East-Mediterranean Travel and Tourism Association
(MEMTTA), which aspires to promote regional tourism activities.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there is a negative impact resulted from
Israel's closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas in terms of
tourism flow, Simons said: "It's hard to say, we can look at the
numbers. It's difficult to say."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official expressed his consideration toward Israel
in terms of its closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip out of
its "security concerns over terrorism."
</P>
<P>
However, Simons implied that the U.S. has to check Israel a
bit if its action goes beyond limits in view of the overall
consideration of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to react when they play up ... we have to be simply
honest, ... our policy has to be balanced," he said, in
reference to the Israeli closure on the Palestinian territories
and the conflicts arising therefrom.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he hopes the closure will be lifted to facilitate an
easy flow of tourists, Simons said: "We have expressed our views
before, we hope the security situation improves to a certain
extent the closure can be lifted."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. recognizes both the problem of the closure
and Israel's security considerations. "It is balancing," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Simons' views are no more than an echo of what U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher expressed at the opening session of
the MENA three, which was inaugurated by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his address to some 3,500 participants from about 90
countries and regions across the world, Christopher urged the
Israelis and Palestinians to understand each other and be ready
to compromise in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"For these and future negotiations to succeed, each side must
go the extra mile to understand the needs of the other -- to
take their requirements into account," Christopher said in his
address, seen as a footnote to the U.S. policy toward the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which have been stagnant for
months since Binyamin Netanyahu took power in June.
</P>
<P>
"Each side must accept that to succeed, there can be no
winners or losers," he said. "Each side must win and be seen to
win, or both sides will lose."
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that there will be no facelift on the
stagnant peace process, at least for the near future, in view of
the "consistent policy" of the U.S., the major broker of the
peace march.

<HEADLINE> World Delegates Uphold Peace Through Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen and officials from
the four corners of the world have expressed their common desire
to cement peace through economic cooperation at the Cairo
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian participants called for an
enhanced role by business in promoting political stability and
peace, though they are far apart on the very definition of
peace.
</P>
<P>
President of the Israel Manufacturers Association Dan Propper
told Xinhua Tuesday that the economic conference
gives good prospects for doing business as well as promoting
peace. "Good conference, good atmosphere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Director of Israel World Trade Center Moshe Nahum, speaking
in the same vein, said that business will help cement peace
when fluctuations occur in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The 95 Israeli businessmen, eager to do business with
Jordan and Egypt, are coming here with the idea of making
Israel their partner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli business lineup was echoed by Palestinian
participants who tried to draw world attention to their plight
and strong desire for better life.
</P>
<P>
Eager to reactivate their ailing economy after 27 years of
Israeli occupation, the Palestinians are wondering how.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Finance Minister Muhammad Nashashibi said that no
country could survive and develop when it is deprived of a
free access to trade, job and business.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty can never produce peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
An eight-month Israeli-imposed closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip bars thousands of Palestinian workers from reaching
jobs in Israel and brings export and trade to a near halt,
costing the Palestinian economy millions of dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Charles-Alexis Mossa,
director-general of external economic relations of the European
Commission, also urged Israel to resolve the Palestinian issue
as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the deterioration in the Palestinian economy
could lead to more violent uprisings and the halt of
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
A businesswoman from Motorola in the 177-strong U.S. team
expressed the belief that "economic push will drive the
political process and peace will take place faster" through
the business meeting, which she termed as "very smart."
</P>
<P>
She said the hope of Mideast peace should rest in the
hands of people here, although she believed the U.S. will
play an important role in the process.
</P>
<P>
The head of an Egyptian advertising company, Kamal Iskander,
said that he and his compatriots are eager to make their
due contributions to the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress in Israeli talks with the Palestinians
and the absence of negotiations with Syria and Lebanon have
cast a shadow over the ongoing meeting, designed to draw
foreign investors to the region.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 3000 officials and business people are participating
in the three-day event, which opened Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Accuses Iraqi Authorities of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
denounced the killing in Iraq of a Jordanian embassy driver
and held the Iraqi government full responsibility for the
murder, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Omar Ahmed Subeh, 30, whose vehicle was attacked and looted,
was killed Monday on his way to deliver the diplomatic bag to the
Jordanian embassy in Baghdad, according to the English-language
daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was
quoted as saying that Subeh, who was on his weekly routine trip to
Baghdad, was found dead near the highway with two bullets to the
chest and one to the head.
</P>
<P>
The official added that a diplomatic bag, which contained 250
blank Jordanian passports and official mail, was missing from
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government denounced the move as a "violation of
safety and immunity of the diplomatic bag and its bearer as
guaranteed by the Vienna Convention." It urged the Iraqi
authorities to arrest the perpetrators and return the stolen
passports.
</P>
<P>
Subeh's killing was the third such reported incident to
happen on Iraqi soils in the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
In September, a 25-year-old Jordanian driver was stabbed to
death while hauling a cargo to Baghdad when his vehicle was
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
Six months earlier, three Jordanians were brutally murdered in
Iraq when seven Iraqis hijacked their truck, shot them and
then decapitated the corpses and buried them in the Iraqi
desert.

<HEADLINE> Macao Proposes Preferential Policy for HK Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the government discussed with the Hong Kong-Macao
ferry boat company on the offering of monthly tickets at a
preferential price for those Hong Kong businessmen who have
investments in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the government also plans to set up a
special passage at the Hong Kong-Macao ferry terminal so that Hong
Kong investors will have convenience in traveling between the two
places.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the above remarks on Tuesday while meeting
with members of a local charity foundation, who plan to invite the
governor to cut ribbon for a 10,000-people charity walk early next
month.
</P>
<P>
Macao's current investment and immigration law rules that
people who have a million (about 126,600 US dollars) investment in
Macao will have the right of immigrating into Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Macao Daily News", the governor deems the
current economic situation in Macao as "not the best" and "but not
the worst."
</P>
<P>
The economic growth has slowed down owing to influences of the
world economy and growth in neighboring regions, and the
government pays great attention to the economic growth, according
to the governor.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the government aims to improve its working
efficiency, to offer a better investment environment to expand
Macao's economy.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba in S.Africa To Discuss With Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba paid a visit to South Africa on Tuesday for
talks with President Nelson Mandela over Zambia's forthcoming
general election, which was boycotted by several opposition
parties, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference after their hour-long
meeting in Pretoria, Mandela said Chiluba came up with a "very
important" proposal which could end an opposition party boycott
of general elections in Zambia scheduled for November 18, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "I am satisfied that we have made good progress
which can bring about a solution in Zambia with regard to this
election."
</P>
<P>
While describing their talks as being satisfactory, both
Chiluba and Mandela declined to give details on the proposal,
only saying Chiluba first had to canvass the idea with his own
party members.
</P>
<P>
Seven opposition parties, including former President Kenneth
Kaunda's United National Independence Party, were refusing to
take part in Zambia's upcoming poll.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties maintain that rules governing the
elections had been drawn up to ensure that the ruling Movement
for Multiparty Democracy remain in power.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a possible postponement of the poll, Chiluba
said the scheduled election will go ahead next week despite a
planned poll boycott by the oppositions.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Asks Mubarak To Release Israeli Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has sent a message to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak asking him to immediately release Azzam Azzam, an
Israeli citizen held last Wednesday in suspicion of spying for
Israel, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sent the message after an investigation, under his
order, was carried out on the Egyptian charge that Azzam worked
for the Israeli secret agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
It was cleared that Azzam had no connection with Israeli
intelligence, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister David Levy, now in Cairo
attending the third Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference, met with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa Tuesday
on the matter and demanded an immediate release of Azzam, a
35-year-old Druse mechanic working in a joint Egyptian-Israeli
textile factory in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A leading Egyptian Arabic newspaper, Al-Ahram, said Tuesday
that several charges including espionage were brought against two
men, an Israeli and an Egyptian. "Security authorities uncovered
the involvement of an Egyptian and an Israeli of Arab origin in
working for the Israeli intelligence body Mossad," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
"Information confirmed the defendant Azzam Azzam, 35, of Arab
origin, gave the Egyptian citizen Emad Eddin Abdel Hamid
materials ... that are used in espionage," said Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry received Egypt's official confirmation
of Azzam's arrest Tuesday night during the second meeting of
the day between Levy and Moussa. Israel was angered by the delay
in informing Israel of Azzam's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Azzam Azzam is not the first Israeli to be accused of spying
by Egypt since the two neighbors signed their peace treaty in
1979. Last month, Egyptian Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi
warned Egyptian youths against Israeli efforts to recruit them as
spies. Tantawi said Israel targets soldiers and military school
graduates.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Egypt's newspapers have portrayed the Israeli
Embassy in Cairo as a nest of spies and have warned Egyptians to
keep away from the building. At the same time, several Israelis
have been accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
Businessman David Ovitz was held for two months in 1992 on
suspicion of espionage. Another Israeli, Fares Subhi Masrati,
and his 17-year-old daughter, Fayqa, were arrested and reportedly
confessed to being recruited by the Mossad.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, two divers from then Israeli-occupied Rafah were
charged in Sinai with introducing an Egyptian woman to an Israeli
agent, who offered her money to spy for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Business Scarce for Palestine Under Siege: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) economic conference entered its second day here
today in the Egyptian capital, one could hardly tell for sure
what the participants would reap in the end.
</P>
<P>
A leading European expert has predicted that the Palestinian
delegation would take home from the Cairo economic conference
few concrete deals after having made a point and won sympathy at
the economic conference, the third of its kind since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua today, Charles-Alexis
Mossa, first director-general of external economic relations
affairs of the European Commission warned that economic
deterioration in the Palestinian territories is virtually kicking
the region out into an investment vacuum and the eye of violent
storms.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli-imposed closure of the West Bank and Gaza bars
thousands of Palestinian workers from reaching jobs in Israel
and brings export and import trade to a near halt, costing the
Palestinian economy millions of dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation In the Palestinian self-rule areas has
constantly deteriorated since Israel clamped the closure in
March, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not yet begun carrying out further withdrawals in
the West Bank as promised in the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
"No investment, no export, no reliability on contract in the
Palestinian territories. And when Israel tightens the screw,
it's difficult for the Palestinians to sell anything in the long
term basis," he said, adding that the lack of outlet zone or
transport route has left the Palestinian economy totally
depending on what Israel offers.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the fact that free access to the outside
markets is essential to succeed in such a tiny market as the
Palestinian one, potential investors virtually cannot take the
risks involved if there is a sudden cut of supply.
</P>
<P>
"No, it simply impossible to expect anyone prepared to invest
in the Palestinian economy because he does not know if he can
get raw materials, semi-products and machinery or, later get
them out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The point was immediately proved by an Israeli businessman who
is participating in a session on the Palestinian economy on the
sidelines of the conference. He told Xinhua that he has a office
in Gaza but now he cannot even go there and his business is dead.
</P>
<P>
The European expert waved off the 1994 agreement on the
Customs Union between Israel and Palestine as a joke, saying
that the lack of a minimum of political stability has crippled
investment and business opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Business Scarce for Palestine Under Siege: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under what the European called "excessive security" practices
in Israel, the Israeli economic growth dropped from 5 percent to
4 percent during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
But it is quite negligible in comparison with the Palestinian
woes.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, he said, the economic predicament
threatens to drive up a more violent Palestinian intifada
(uprising) than it was in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"When the Palestinians are fed up and really angry, there
will be an explosion," he warned, adding that it is the danger
everyone should be aware of.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his view on balancing the Israeli concern for
security and the Palestinian rights to survival, the
director-general underlined the urgency of a speedy solution to
the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same vein, he made two suggestions that is
"technically possible."
</P>
<P>
Israel can issue "dignity card" to the traders, workers or
whoever with good security record and import screening machines
to make better security checks.
</P>
<P>
"It should invest the hundred of million dollars on these
equipments in the interest of its neighbor," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the regional projects involving both the
Palestinians and Israelis, the expert said he cannot see that
they will come into operation in the next couple of years
despite the EU sponsorship and the readiness on the private
sector to invest.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the three largest projects, namely in gas,
road and electricity, generally involving Jordan, Israel, the
Palestinian Autonomous Region, Egypt and Turkey and the EU,
largely hinges on political decisions.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Israel and the Arab world has been on the
rise since Binyamin Netanyahu's hardline government took power
in June. Egypt, angry over Netanyahu's intransigent negotiating
policies with the Palestinians, at one point nearly canceled the
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Mossa said that the conference itself serves for some as a
barometer of the situation in the Middle East, more than a
match-making or deal-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We are here just to take temperature of what goes on in the
region, politically and economically," said the expert.
</P>
<P>
The 45-member Palestinian delegation, which includes only 15
businessmen and 30 government officials, is dwarfed by the
100-strong Israeli business delegation to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 3,000 or so representatives from 89 countries and
regions, 53 regional and international institutions and 850
world companies are taking part in the three-day event that
opened here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Much of China's Vegetables Turn Into Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As much as 30 to 40 percent of
the vegetables produced in China ultimately end up in the garbage
each year, due to improper storage and shipping practices, and
regional overstock.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Academy of Agriculture Sciences of China say that
transportation systems used by the country's vegetable industry
are not well-developed, and have caused substantial losses for the
industry which affected people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, winter is the time to store cabbage and green
Chinese onions in north China, but many residents in these areas
are worried about how to do this properly.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that five million tons of vegetables produced
in the west and south were shipped to the east and north between
1991-95, and the figure is expected to double to 10 million tons
during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The north and east areas, though they have built many
greenhouses, annually report shortages of seasonal vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The experts have called for the improvement of vegetable
packaging techniques, and for the creation of a modernized
vegetable manufacturing system.
</P>
<P>
They also have asked for more research into updated vegetable
production technology.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Has No Immediate Plans for Sending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has no plans
to send troops to the western-brokered intervention forces
seeking to avert bloodshed and facilitate the delivery of humantarian
aid to the refugees in Zaire, said a senior Tanzanian official.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Maokola-Majogo, Tanzanian Minister of State for Defence
and National Services, told a press conference on Tuesday that
sendng troops to join an intervention force has not been actively
considered by the government at present.
</P>
<P>
"We are not making any such plans. May be in the future, but
not now," said Maokola-Majogo, reacting to a question whether
Tanzania is ready to join hands with other countries to
constitute an intervention force to be sent to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The government has not been approached as yet with regard to
the formation of such a force. When such a proposal is advanced
to the government, we will then have to think about it," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted on October 18 between the Banyamulenge Tutsi
and the Zairean army, resulting into the displacement of about
1.2 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Many of th refugees are without access to water or food since
they fled from camps in Eastern Zaire last month.
</P>
<P>
UN officials expressed plans for military intervention to
provide humanitarian assistance to refugees. However, the body
has not reached a consensus about the matter, causing a delay
which France attempted to cover by sending its own 1,000-stong
force unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Maokola-Majogo said, "If France has decided to send its force
it is up to them. What I can say is that Tanzania has not been
approached and therefore has no immediate intention of sending
troops there."
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized the readiness of the Tanzania's armed forces
to counter any unexpected movemens or threat on its borders. "Our
forces are ready to ensure that peace within our borders despite
the fighting in the neighbouring countries," he said.

JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said Tuesday night he is willing to implement
the outstanding agreements with the Palestinians, including
redeployment in rural areas, according to Israel Radio.

<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks when he was speaking to the
Institute of Public Accountant in Jerusalem. He said that he
committed himself to continuing peace talks after an agreement
is concluded on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
His statement came at a time when senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators gathered at U.S. Ambassador Martin
Indyk's residence in Herzlia, north of Tel Aviv, trying hard to
remove the last obstacles blocking a final agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side reportedly demanded that Netanyahu
undertake his commitment to the Oslo Accords in a letter
attached to the pending agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he told Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat in a phone conversation Monday that radical forces on both
sides are provoking each other.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the coming year will be used by Israel and the
PA to prevent what he termed a collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As for Syria, he said, he expects Damascus to return to the
negotiating table, but this can only take place when a new U.S.
secretary of state is appointed in place of Warren Christopher
who is to retire in the upcoming U.S. cabinet shake-up.

Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and
Nigeria, will meet at the foreign ministers' level in Istanbul
next January and a summit meeting of heads of state or
government will be held in the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the "M-8" will initiate
cooperation for development, and will spread peace rather than
war throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"We expect all countries to join this group (M-8). The
problem is, if the group becomes too crowded, meetings will
become difficult. In order to facilitate meetings and decision-
making mechanism, we have decided to limit the number of initial
participants. But, the door of this group is open for all. This
group is not against any country or group," Erbakan said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Passes Indemnity Ordinance Repeal Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's parliament has
passed the indemnity ordinance repeal bill 1996 amid opposition
boycott to pave the way for trial of the killers of former
president Shiekh Mujibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur, the first head of state of Bangladesh, was
assassinated during a military coup on August 15, 1975 along with
members of his family and some of his associates. He is also
father of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who fled the killing with
her sister because of being abroad at that time.
</P>
<P>
The indemnity ordinance was promulgated on September 26, 1975
by the then president Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed to indemnify the
killers of Mujibur and others. But since the case involved many
army officers, many of whom are supporters of the then ruling but
now opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), it has been
prevented to be tried by governments since then.
</P>
<P>
By forming the new government after winning the seventh
parliamentary election in June this year, the ruling Awami League
has been determined to clear the way for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The indemnity ordinance repeal bill was passed last night,
relevant sources said, adding that Prime Minister Hasina was
present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
But the legislators of the main opposition BNP were absent from
the house for the third day on Tuesday in protest against the
ruling party's unfair treatment in the house. The MPs belonging to
another major party, the Jammat-e-Islami, also did not turn up in
the house Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of the indemnity ordinance repeal bill, State
Minister for Law and Justice Abdul Matin Khasru said that "we
could have taken revenge, but we did not do so because we believe
in the rule of law as we are civilized."

<HEADLINE> India Offers to Resume Talks With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- India said on Tuesday that
it was willing to discuss all bilateral issues with Pakistan, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, India put the onus on Islamabad for creating a
conducive atmosphere to resume the secretary-level talks between
the two countries which was suspended in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
India made the offer in response to Pakistani caretaker Prime
Minister Miraj Khalid's recent remarks that he was interested in
creating an atmosphere for resuming bilateral talks with India.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Indian External Affairs Ministry said on
Tuesday that as far as atmosphere in India is concerned, it is
agreeable for talks, adding that India is looking for normal,
peaceful and cooperative relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that India was waiting for a formal response from
Pakistan to Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's offer for an early
resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Gowda made the offer in June in response to a similar
suggestion first proposed by then Pakistani prime minister Benazir
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
India has been insisting that it is Gowda who first forwarded
such a proposal for the resumption of bilateral talks and has been
demanding a response to the Indian offer from Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Province Launches Anti-Poverty Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
plans to eliminate poverty one to two years ahead of its original
goal of the year 2000, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official said that the target will be
met by expanding agricultural production, planting trees and grass
to diversify its economy, and setting up companies that will process
farm products.
</P>
<P>
In the past 11 years, the number of impoverished people has
dropped by 4.13 million, the official said, adding that there are
still more than three million people in the province living below
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Most of the poor rural residents live in remote mountainous
areas, in ethnic minority areas, near the Three Gorges Reservoir,
or in disease-ridden areas. Natural conditions there are harsh and
not suited for socio-economic development, making it extremely
difficult to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Governor Jiang Zhuping has asked everyone in underdeveloped
areas to plant one mu (1/15 hectare) of cash crops and raise one
domestic animal to sell, and has urged poor villages to build more
 collectively-owned enterprises to earn 50,000 yuan (about 6,000
US dollars) a year from them.
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy is to be eliminated, and scientists and technicians
are encouraged to help eliminate poverty, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government recently decided to add 20 million
yuan to the poverty relief fund.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force to Build Laser-Armed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force
is to build a revolutionary prototype warplane using which uses
laser to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press reported today that a modified 747 freighter
would carry a weapons-class laser capable of tracking and
destroying ballistic missiles in their earliest boost phase.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force projection is for a seven-plane squadron of
laser-attack aircraft as early as 2008.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft could be deployed around the world to defend
against ballistic missiles such as the Scuds, as used in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
"Two would be flying around the clock, above 40,000 feet
(12,000 meters) over the country they would be protecting," an Air
Force fact sheet says of the aircraft. "If the enemy were to
launch a theater ballistic missile, the Attack Laser would detect
the booster while it is still powered and passing through the
clouds. The Attack Laser would then destroy the missile, with the
resulting debris falling back on enemy territory."
</P>
<P>
The warplane will be built by the Seattle-based Boeing Defense
Space Group team which also includes the Lockheed Martin Corp.
and TRW Inc. under a 1.1 billion U.S. dollar contract announced
today. Rockwell International lost the contract.
</P>
<P>
Currently, lasers are used by the military for finding the
range to targets. They are also used to in laser-guided bombs to
help the weapons reach a particular target. But they are not used
by themselves as weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Votes  to End U.S. Embargo against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The international
community today strongly urged the United States to end its
35-year trade embargo against Cuba and repeal controversial laws
punishing foreign firms investing in the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
For the fifth year in a row, the U.N. General Assembly
overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an end to the
sanctions by 137 votes to three (Israel, the U.S. and Uzbekistan),
with 25 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. allies, as well as adversaries, supported the draft
resolution, because they say the embargo violates their own
sovereignty as it subjects them to the effects of U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the embargo has heightened since the U.S. passed
its Helms-Burton Act earlier this year, allowing American citizens
who were Cuban nationals before the 1959 revolution to sue foreign
companies or individuals who are using property confiscated by the
government of President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
This year, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, along with
several east European countries, who abstained last year, switched
their votes in favor of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lage, Vice-President of the Council of State of Cuba,
told the assembly that the time had come for the U.S. to change
its policy toward his country.
</P>
<P>
He said that while blockade had been unjustified for
more than three decades, the pretexts used today to defend this
"criminal act" had run out with the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the embargo. imposed on Cuba in 1962, has
resulted in losses of 60 billions U.S. dollars, five times Cuba's
external debt.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah of India said that his country opposed any
unilateral measures by one country which impinged on the
sovereignty of another country. The use of unilateral trade
measures for domestic political reasons threatened the
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
India called upon the U.S. to settle its differences with
Cuba through negotiation on the basis of equality and mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
Hussin Bin Nayan of Malaysia said that "The Helms-Burton Act
clearly contravenes the principles and objectives of the World
Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia firmly believed there was no
justification for the U.S. to take unilateral trade measures
against Cuba, which also impinged on the right of other states to
engage freely in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador John Campbell of Ireland, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, said the EU wished to reiterate its rejection of
attempts to apply national legislation on an extraterritorial
basis.
</P>
<P>
"The Union has always rejected attempts by the United States to
coerce other countries into complying with the commercial measures
it has adopted unilaterally against Cuba," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason, the Union continues to oppose United States
legislation that applies United States law to companies and
individuals outside the jurisdiction of the United States."
</P>
<P>
The EU recently made it illegal for companies in member states
to comply with the Helms-Burton Act and has initiated proceedings
in the World Trade Organization to have the legislation declared
contrary to the obligations assumed by the U.S. as a member of
the trade body.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Nicolai Tchoulkov of Russia said his country believed
lifting the embargo and normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations would
promote a healthier international situation, facilitate Cuba's
inclusion in world economic relations and thus advance its
society towards democracy and greater openness.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels
rejected President Chandrika Kumaratunga's call to resume peace
talks to end the country's 13-year ethnic war, according to
reports reaching here from the north today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels saw nothing new in the president's insistence that
talks could be resumed only if the rebels indicate their
willingness to lay down arms and agree to a fixed and limited time
frame for the dialogue, the reports quoted the rebel radio as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have said that they
are ready for the peace talks only on an unconditional basis.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga last week renewed the call for peace
talks with the rebels and added that she was open to the idea of
third party mediation.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 13-year war against the government
for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country.
More than 50,000 people have been killed in the civil war.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Must Forge Consensus on Europe's "Security Model" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) must forge a consensus on a
"security model" for Europe at its summit next month, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Swiss counterpart Flavio
Cotti said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Cotti said at a news conference after talks that the
 summit in Lisbon must agree on a model, a code of conduct
governing political and military issues that will spell out the
respective roles of Europe's various security organizations.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel praised the role played by the OSCE and Switzerland,
which currently holds the organization's rotating presidency, in
preparing and supervising Bosnian general election. "This was the
most difficult project carried out by the OSCE so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the OSCE's efforts now must be concentrated on
next year's Bosnian local elections which were cancelled in
November. Kinkel said that only by holding elections could the
Bosnian peace process be ensured.
</P>
<P>
Cotti thanked Germany for its definite and clear support for
Switzerland's entry to the European Union (EU). Kinkel said
Germany would continue to make efforts to put an end to the
negotiations between EU and Switzerland as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also met with Cotti today.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Leaders Urge Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Congressional leaders from
both Republican and Democratic parties are calling again for
campaign finance reform in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House of Representatives,
suggested today that the House should hold hearings on the
millions of dollars outside interests invested in the just-ended
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting at the White House, Gingrich said there was
bipartisan agreement to "lay out clearly what are the contours of
campaign spending."
</P>
<P>
He said: "There was an amazing amount of money this year spent
outside the campaigns, spent by independent expenditures, spent by
groups that are not in any way accountable or reportable.
</P>
<P>
"And I think we all feel a concern, as the American people do,
for finding out, both through an oversight looking at the hearings
process, exactly what happened, how much money is involved, where
did it come from."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich called for a "good" campaign finance reform bill that
covered not just the finances of the candidates, but "all the
different aspects."
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, who also attended the
White House meeting, said campaign finance reform was one of the
party's top priorities this year, along with a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said he thought "there was an expression of interest
from all sides. There are disagreements on some parts of it, but I
think the important thing is there was a general agreement that we
should really try to do these two things as quickly as possible
and get everybody together on it."

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Warns Russia Over Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Foreign Ministry
warned today that relations between Ukraine and Moscow will
deteriorate following the Russian parliament's adoption of a bill
banning the division of the disputed Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said in a statement that territorial claims
by some deputies of the Russian State Duma (lower house) over
Sevastopol, the port city on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula where the
fleet is based, violated international law.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major fleet of the former Soviet Union,
has been a bone of contention between Russia and Ukraine since the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Both countries claimed the fleet, but after lengthy
negotiations reached a tentative agreement on dividing the fleet
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Even so, disputes have continued, notably over the status of
Sevastopol, a strategic port on the southern tip of the
Crimean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
On October 23, Russia's State Duma adopted a resolution
claiming that the fleet was Russia's property and banning its
division. The bill is now being debated by the Federation Council
(upper house).
</P>
<P>
There have also been claims from several key Russian
officials, including the sacked national security chief Alexander
Lebed, that Sevastopol itself is part of Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
Several deputies in the State Duma have called for a draft bill
to clarify the legal status of the city.
</P>
<P>
But the Ukrainian foreign ministry says that a treaty signed
between Kiev and Moscow in 1990 guaranteed existing borders
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Tariffs on Electronic Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
approved a plan to reduce tariffs on electronic parts to boost
local production and exports of electronic goods using imported
parts.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet meeting, the caretaker cabinet on Tuesday
endorsed a proposal to cut import tariffs to 1 percent for
electronic parts which cannot be produced locally, according to a
Government House press release available today.
</P>
<P>
Existing tariff rates on those parts range from 1 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rates are expected to take effect after at least four
weeks' time when the Finance Ministry have worked out details for
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently imports a high proportion of electronic
parts, such as capacitors, resistors, transistors, optical fibers
and crystals, to make many finished products.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also approved in principle a reduction in tariffs
for some categories of electronic parts which are already produced
in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Finance Ministry plans to study the proposal in
detail because the cut could hurt local producers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Do and Spend More on Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has vowed
to do more and spend more on protection of its rich cultural
relics from now on to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has earmarked 300 million yuan (about 36 million US
dollars) to restore 24 relics, including the Ming Tombs and
finances at district and county levels are required to implement
the preservation program.
</P>
<P>
Museums and historical sites are being encouraged to tap their
potential for development, the China Daily cited a recent local
government circular as saying.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the local relics should be included in the local
financial budget, urban and rural construction programs and
economic and social development plans, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of relics will be made part of the
responsibilities of local officials, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Acquisition of cultural treasures from Beijing's past also will
be stressed to private collectors and auctions encouraged.
Purchases of artifacts that have found their way overseas should
be pursued.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to open 20 new museums over the next five years,
including a new Capital Museum, the Beijing Agricultural Museum,
the Beijing Folk Customs Museum and the Museum of Beijing Siheyuan
-- a compound with houses surrounding a traditional Chinese
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the capital city is expected to have 110
museums, as it is one of the major tourist attractions in China.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), Beijing invested
257 million yuan (about 31 million dollars), an increase of 57
percent over the previous period (1986-1990), in 299 salvage,
protection and restoration projects, including Tian'anmen, the
Summer Palace, Yunju Temple and the Tianning Temple Buddhist
Pagoda.

<HEADLINE> Russian-Indian Trade Continues Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Russia and India
is expected to total three billion U.S. dollars this year, up 57
percent over the 1.9 billion dollars of 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, it will still be much less than the 5.5 billion
dollars for 1990.
</P>
<P>
The expected growth this year represents a continued rebound
during the past three years, after the two nations' annual trade
volume plummeted to 1.1 billion dollars in 1993, the lowest point
since 1990, when the Soviet Union fell apart.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries began to recover from the slump
in 1994 following Russian President Yeltsin's 1993 visit to
India. During the 1994 Moscow visit of the then Indian Prime
Minister Narasimha Rao, the two nations signed a package of
agreements, further fueling the recovery of their bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, which used to be
India's second largest trade partner, Russia fell behind Japan,
Germany, Britain, Hong Kong and other countries and regions in its
trade with India.
</P>
<P>
The United States replaced the Soviet Union, which used to
dominate the Indian power equipment and metal markets, to become
India's major power equipment supplier.
</P>
<P>
Despite pledges by Moscow and New Delhi to promote their trade
and economic cooperation, difficulty and barriers remain, such as
fierce competition from Western countries, an irrational trade
structure and a lack of legislation to meet the needs of the
market economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand-U.S. Deadlocked over Textile Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States
have failed to solve a compensation row regarding a change in the
American rule of origin.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. Regulation says the origin of textile and garment
products is the country which has produced the textile, rather
than the country where they are processed into garments.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S. has cut fabric export quota for Thailand
because Thailand is now considered the country of origin when Thai
textile was used by other countries to produce garments exported
to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous U.S. rules, effective until July 1 this
year, the origin of the finished garments was where the material
was cut, i.e., the country which added finishing processes to Thai
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
A foreign trade department-led Thai delegation went to the U.S.
last weekend to discuss textile and garment quotas and to request
compensation for losses incurred by Thailand due to the change in
the U.S. rules.
</P>
<P>
The Thai delegation asked the U.S. for quotas of 200 million
square meters -- 170 million square meters for the loss of Thai
quotas to the European Union and the rest to other markets like
Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade representative said more time was needed to find
exact figures from importers before negotiations could continue.

<HEADLINE> More Power Plants for North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a new
Sino-foreign power plant, with an investment of 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars, will begin in Handan, Hebei Province later this year.
</P>
<P>
According to "China Daily", the Hanfeng Power Plant is designed
to have a capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts, one of the highest
outputs in China.
</P>
<P>
The project will alleviate power shortages in north China and
consume anthracite coal stockpiles in a nearby major mine.
</P>
<P>
With the approval by the State Council, a contract for
importing two sets of 660,000-kilowatt generating equipment was
signed recently in Beijing by several Chinese, German and American
companies for the first phase of the Hanfeng project.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that both generators go into operation in 2000 and
2001, the Chinese government has included the project in this
year's key construction plan.
</P>
<P>
Major power generating equipment including turbines and boilers
will be provided by Germany's Siemens Ag and the United States'
company of Foster Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
The China Electric Power Technology Import and Export
Corporation is the import agent and the Hebei Electric Power Corp
is responsible for organizing invitations for bids, and commercial
and technical negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture Hebei Hanfeng Power Generating Co. Ltd.,
approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, will be responsible for financing, construction,
operation and loan repayment of the project.
</P>
<P>
In the joint venture, the Siemens Power Development Hanfeng
GmbH holds 40 percent stake, the North China Power Group 30
percent, the Hebei Construction and Investment Corp., 20
percent, and Hebei Electric Power Corp., 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 million U.S. dollars of foreign funds will be used to
construct the power plant.
</P>
<P>
The German bank, KfW, and the Spanish bank, Banesto, will
provide some 400 million U.S. dollars on a project financing basis.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives of participant companies said that they are
considering ordering minor equipment from Chinese firms.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapping Cases Soar in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Kidnapping cases across the
Philippines have increased by 40 percent during the last nine
months, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping incidents rose to 125 in the period, from 89
recorded during the same period last year, the Philippine Daily
Inquirer said, citing a report prepared by the Department of
Interior and Local Government.
</P>
<P>
Of the 125 cases, 39 involved the payment of ransom while the
remaining 86 cases or 68.8 percent were "simple kidnapping or
serious illegal detention."
</P>
<P>
The national capital region had 25 kidnap-for-ransom cases, or
the highest among the country's 13 administrative regions, which
were officially reported to the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
The report said cases of simple kidnapping this year rose by as
much as 126.3 percent, from 38 incidents last year to 86 this
year, while kidnap-for-ransom cases decreased by 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the Interior Department admitted that law enforcement
agencies "may not have captured all the kidnapping data" since
many victims prefer to suffer in silence rather than report the
incident to authorities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the country's private Citizens Action Against Crime
and Movement for the Restoration of Peace and Order revealed that
a total of 179 people were kidnapped this year, 18 of which were
killed by their captors.
</P>
<P>
The organization said a total of 130 million pesos (5 million
US dollars) was paid to syndicates in exchange for the safe
release of their victims.

<HEADLINE> Fruitful Discovery in Grotto Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in Henan and
Shanxi provinces have discovered more than 100 places of
historical interest during rescue excavation work at the
construction site of the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, near
the ancient capital of Luoyang, in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The 109 sites include cultural ruins, grottos, ancient tombs
and local-style residential houses, which have been classified into
three categories in accordance with their value in artistic research.
</P>
<P>
Henan has 24 underground, and five ground-level cultural relics
under government protection, while Shanxi has 13 underground and
two ground-level sites. Seven million yuan has so far been spent
on the archaeological excavations.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'ao Grottos in Xin'an County, and the ruins of an ancient
commercial city in Yuanqu County, are considered of high value in
archaeological research, said an official from the Henan
Provincial Research Institute of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Xi'ao grotto, built in the year 525 on the southern bank of the
Yellow River, has a cliff Buddha, four pagodas, two caves and 171
niches.
</P>
<P>
This is the only well-preserved grotto dating back to the
Northern Wei period (386-534) found on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yellow River, which is known as the cradle of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Niches of Buddha carved on the cliff were arranged in a row in
the order of size, a rare shape in the arrangement of Buddhas in
China, said an archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
The 197-cm-high cliff Buddha stands in a niche with a
lotus-shaped base. Though the well-preserved Buddha bears no
chronological record, archaeologists deemed it was built in the
late years of the Northern Wei period, as its shape and artistry
were similar to other carvings in the grotto.
</P>
<P>
The discovery provided new historical material for the
artistic research of grottos in China.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered were Changquan, Baigou, Zhaigen, Zhouli and
Qinghe ruins, and valuable historical remains with a total
excavated area of 55 million square meters, shedding light to the
study of production, and the lives of people on the middle reaches
of the Yellow River in ancient times.

MEXICO CITY, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least two people died
from burns today and 13 others were injured in a raging fire after
three fuel tanks exploded just north of Mexico City on Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people were evacuated from the area around the
oil depot run by state oil monopoly Pemex as firefighters battled
to control the inferno which raged for more than a day.
</P>
<P>
The capital's skyline was lit up by flames from the blaze which
soared up to five kilometers high.
</P>
<P>
Pemex said in a statement said that one of its workers, Jose
Antonio Ibarra Gonzalez, 36, and a fireman, Jose Luis Romero del
Toro, 46, died in city hospitals from their burns.
</P>
<P>
The company said the explosion, which caused more than 5
million U.S. dollars of damage, happened when workers were
repairing a valve in a fuel tank containing 80,000 barrels of oil
at a storage facility, but the exact cause was not known.
</P>
<P>
The area where the explosion occurred is no stranger to
disaster. More than 500 people were burned to death after a
liquefied petroleum gas tank exploded in November 1984 and
another explosion happened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This is the third serious incident involving Pemex in the last

they managed to re-start his heart. It is the first time a case
has been reported in which a patient has stopped breathing for
such a long time, and recovered.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, a farmer in Wuqing county in the north China port city of
Tianjin, went to a local red-cross hospital feeling ill with pains
in his stomach on the morning of November 4, according to the
Yangcheng Evening News.
</P>
<P>
When a doctor was checking Zhao, the patient suddenly lost his
breath and consciousness and his heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
Six doctors started to give him massage successively, and his
heart resumed working 40 minutes later. When the doctors thought
the danger had passed Zhao's heart stopped again, and again.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, realizing that Zhao was still young, continued
their massage, though they knew that a patient would be
certified dead if his heart refused to work for as long as 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Within three hours, Zhao's heart stopped nine times. The
doctors massaged his heart more than 10,000 times, and
administered 14 electric shocks using a heart resuscitation
machine. Finally, Zhao came back to life and he is now reported
to be out of danger.

<HEADLINE> October Trade Hits Annual Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's external trade posted
the year's largest monthly volume and the largest surplus in
october, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
External trade volume rose 13.7 percent from a year ago to
26.53 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports in October shot up 23.3 percent to 15.55 billion US
dollars, rebounding for a fourth straight month since a lull hit
the sector last November.
</P>
<P>
Imports totalled 11.31 billion US dollars in October, rising
just three percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The slump in exports bottomed out in June following State
measures to speed the payment of export rebates and increase
credit supply for export-based enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With the stimulus from tariff cuts fading over time, import
growth has become increasingly weak.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade volume hit 117.5 billion US dollars by
October, up 12 percent from a year ago with its share of China's
external trade rising to 52 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Largest Motorcycle Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China has become the leading
motorcycle producer in the world, with production totaling 7.8
million units last year, according to the Economic Information
News.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 43.5 percent of the world's total, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 81,000 motorcycles to 104 countries and
regions in 1995, to the tune of 63.8 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese experts are still of the view that the motorcycle
industry in China is a weak competitor on the international market
because it has not introduced a new product development system.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry will make a shift from quantity to
quality and encourage the establishment of enterprise groups
during the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Four or five enterprise groups capable of developing a variety
of new products with increasing competitiveness on the world
market will have been formed by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Two old people have died from

</P>
<P>
Their hearty laughter caused them to choke to death as they

</P>
<P>
The tragedies happened within 48 hours in Tianjin in northern

</P>
<P>
On the evening of November 8, an old man named Li was at a

grandsons placed a slice of beef into Li's mouth with chopsticks,
as he played in his grandpa's arms.
</P>
<P>
The boy tried to make his grandpa laugh by tickling him under

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Hired in Foreign Firms via Fesco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,100 Chinese were
hired in foreign companies in Beijing in the first nine months of
this year via the Foreign Enterprise Service Corporation (Fesco).
</P>
<P>
Thus so, the Fesco has supplied foreign firms with 16,000
Chinese employees since the specialist personnel bureau opened 17
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The agency has provided staff for the representative offices of
nearly 4,000 foreign-funded firms in Beijing, according to the
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Fesco, a state-run firm, was established in 1979 to act as
a recruitment agency for Beijing-based representative offices of
foreign countries as they are not allowed to hire locals directly.
</P>
<P>
The company has placed staff in sales, maintenance and
financial services sectors, and ensures that foreign firms achieve
steady progress in their China business.
</P>
<P>
"They play an important role in helping the country to
introduce foreign investment and expand foreign trade," said Liu
Tianjian, Fesco vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The Fesco has set up subsidiaries to provide foreign
corporations with such services as airline tickets, freight
transportation, auto and equipment repairs and domestic help for
their employees.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms pay a fee for every local they hire. The Fesco
pays between 45-60 percent of that amount to its recruits and
spends the balance on their welfare, housing and medical costs or
to cover its own operating costs.
</P>
<P>
Being hired by foreign firms via the Fesco usually means high
payment and high life for locals.

<HEADLINE> Regulations Encourage Investment in Zhejiang's Coastal Marsh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Investors in the development
of the polder area along the coast of east China's Zhejiang
Province will enjoy favorable treatment under a new set of
regulations adopted by the local people's congress.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, to take effect on January 1 next year, will
strictly protect the interests of investors in the development of
polder areas, or coastal marshes.
</P>
<P>
Investments can take the form of joint ventures, cooperative
businesses, wholly-owned companies or joint-stock enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has rich resources on its coastal marsh, which grows
in area by 2,000 hectares every year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, the province has made constant
investment in developing resources on the coastal marsh, and
creating 15,000 hectares of land by enclosing the sea.
</P>
<P>
But investment in enclosing the sea to create more land is
huge, and takes a long period to recover. So the province has
decided to expand financial resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, investors will obtain land
use rights for a specified period. If investment in a tract of
land on the coastal marsh aims at the development of agriculture
in a comprehensive way, investors will receive allowances from the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
If a tract of land on the coastal marsh is developed for
planting and fish and aquatic farming, the government will waive
the fee from the investor for using coastal marsh resources.
</P>
<P>
The government will also free the investor from paying
agricultural taxes for five years, and the local agricultural
product tax for three years.
</P>
<P>
Investors with land use rights will be allowed to inherit,
transfer, lease and mortgage the rights for a certain period.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will enjoy other preferential treatment from
all levels of government in the province.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Orders Roma to Pay for Mihailovic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA ordered on Tuesday Italian Serie A club AS Roma to pay Red
Star Belgrade 11 million dollars for Yugoslav international Sinisa
Mihailovic.
</P>
<P>
Roma had withheld the original nine million dollar fee on the
27-year-old midfielder when a trading ban was imposed on the
Yugoslavs because of the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Italian club had agreed initially to pay the fee when the
ban was lifted in November 1995 but had then reneged on the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the FIFA Players Status Committee has informed both
clubs that the contract for Mihailovic's transfer was valid. The
deal is not affected by the fact that Mihailovic moved from Roma
to Sampdoria in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
They instructed Roma to pay the original nine million dollar
transfer fee plus 5.5 percent interest -- a total of 11.1 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Roma have to pay the fee in five instalments, the first on 31
December 1996 and the last on December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ferrari Kills Engine Deal with Sauber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari announced on Tuesday
night they had killed off talks with Swiss Formula One team
Sauber over the supply of engine technology.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari were upset that Sauber had not only gone public on
Monday about an outline agreement, but had also said that a
two-year deal had already been sealed -- a claim hotly denied here.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari spokesman Giancarlo Baccini said: "In principle, we
were agreed about a relationship that would have enabled us to
transfer technology to Sauber.
</P>
<P>
"But we did not expect matters to have been revealed so
prematurely, as far as the details were concerned. The agreement
was only based on willingness."
</P>
<P>
And he added: "Now it has become impossible to take these
meetings any further."
</P>
<P>
The trouble had been brewing since Sauber, who have been using
Ford V8s for the past two seasons, made its premature move.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Baccini had made it clear that although
talks with Sauber were indeed underway, nothing had been signed or
finalised and there was no question of selling them finished
engines.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon to Double Finance on Probe Into Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today
that it would double its finance in the investigation to determine
whether U.S. troops were exposed to chemical agents in the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Secretary John White told reporters that the
Pentagon was pumping 27 million U.S. dollars into further medical
research and an intensified investigation of events during and
after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Patagon's decision came after senior defense officials told
White in recent weeks that the investigation work would be much
greater than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, complicated issue. We're looking at an
operation that took hundreds of thousands of people. There are
literally millions of pages of documents. It is operationally
complicated," White said.
</P>
<P>
The additional 27 million dollars will include 5 million
dollars for further research into the possible effects of
low-level exposure to chemical weapons, 10 million dollars for
research into chemical hazards, and 12 million dollars on general
research into chemical weapons-related aspects of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will include not only the March 1991
destruction of an Iraqi weapons storage bunker at Kamisiyah, but
dozens of other incidents, including several in which the chemical
weapon detectors carried by U.S. or allied soldiers activated.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that there was no evidence that Iraq
used chemical weapons on U.S. troops and no Gulf War veterans had
been found with symptoms traceable to chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 Americans were serving in the Gulf during the
Gulf War. The Patengon has sent letters to more than 20,000 of
them for information to assist the investigation and about their
health situation.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona, depressed
at the arrest of his manager on drug charges and facing a new
paternity suit, says he is "dead" as a footballer and has even
thought of killing himself.
</P>
<P>
"Maradona the footballer is dead. I can't go any further, I
have no strength," the former Argentine captain said on a
television talk show late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to push me towards killing myself, but I won't
do it for my daughters' sake," said a tearful Maradona.
</P>
<P>
The soccer star's personal manager, Guillermo Coppola, was
arrested in October on cocaine dealing charges.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an unidentified woman filed a paternity suit against
Maradona, claiming he was the father of her 7-month-old baby.

<HEADLINE> US Likely to Send Ground Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States is likely
to send ground troops to participate in humanitarian intervention
in eastern Zaire, and an announcement will probably be issued in a
few days off, a U.S. government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official said the precise nature of the American role is
still undecided.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department declined to say whether or not
a decision had been made on U.S. troops dispatching to the Central
African country, where hundreds of thousands of refugees are
fleeing U.N. camps amid fighting between the Zairian army and the
Zairian ethnic Tutsi rebels, and are on the brink of death without
food and water.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said there is a very
complex situation, "and the essence of it for the United States is
deciding what makes sense to do, what can we do, and then to make
a decision whether or not to go ahead and do that. I mean that
decision has yet to be made."
</P>
<P>
The United States has been extremely cautious about
humanitarian interventions in Africa ever since 18 American
soldiers were killed in a fire fight in Somalia three years ago.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today in Rome
that Canada has agreed to lead a multinational contingent of up to
20,000 troops in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials traveling with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in Europe said the United States is willing to back a
lead role for Canada because Washington itself is not eager for
such duty, and it does not either wish France play a central role
in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Total Ban of Anti-Personnel Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament
Ambassador Sha Zukang said today that China is against a proposed
total ban of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should deal with the
question of anti-personnel landmines in a balanced way, taking
into consideration of both the humanitarian concern and the need
for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the First Committee of the General
Assembly, which is meeting on a draft resolution, urging states
to pursue vigorously an effective, legally-binding international
agreement to ban the anti-personal landmines.
</P>
<P>
"The legitimate means of self-defense for many countries gave
them the right, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, to
use landmines for their security," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
"To protect against interference or encroachment upon the
sovereignty of a country, including those countries that had less
developed military technologies, landmines were still a legitimate
means of military defense," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without currently effective military
alternatives, a comprehensive ban violated the internationally
recognized principle that arms control measures should not
diminish the security measures of a country.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, China supported appropriate, practical
restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and the humanitarian
efforts for civilian victims of those mines.
</P>
<P>
He said the main task of the international community was to
gain universality and observance of a newly amended landmines
protocol because it set important and meaningful limitations on
landmines, especially the anti-personnel landmines. Together with
efforts of mine clearing, it can prevent the discriminate use of
anti-personnel landmines, he added.

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker to Be Bought by Drug Wholesaler in Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bergen Brunswig
Corporation, one of the biggest drug wholesalers in the United
States, announced Monday that it would buy the Ivax Corporation, a
maker of low-cost generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The deal valued at 1.4 billion U.S. dollars was described as an
unusual pharmaceutical merger which made many investors confusing,
according to a report published in today's New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The merger could eventually quadruple Bergen Brunswig's 2
billion annual sales of generic drugs, the report said, quoting a
leading figure of the company.
</P>
<P>
Ivax, which has been troubled financially, has met with two big
problems -- retaining solid operating management and integrating a
number of widely different businesses, most of which have been
unable to deliver much in terms of profit performance.
</P>
<P>
Drug analysts said that the merger reflected the fact that many
drug makers are in real trouble and need money to rescue them. It
is expected that many of the Ivax portfolio of companies,
including hospital supplies, cosmetics and hair care products, and
specialty chemicals, would be sold.

<HEADLINE> Britain's TUC Seeks To Work With Employers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARROGATE, ENGLAND, November 12 (Xinhua) -- John Monks,
secretary-general of Britain's Trades Union Congress proposed a
wide-ranging cooperation pact between trade unions and employers
at the CBI's annual conference which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The TUC and CBI should develop a joint approach to government
on economic issues, whoever wins the next general election, Monks
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Monks put forward seven principles including commitments to
macro-economic stability, low inflation, low unemployment,
competitiveness, more investment in education, technology and
transport, and improving European Union relations.
</P>
<P>
Monks' suggestion was welcomed by Adair Turner, the CBI
director-general, who said, "We're happy to acknowledge that there
are areas of common policy ground between us and the TUC.... We
broadly agree with the seven key policy issues raised by Mr
Monks."
</P>
<P>
Monks said the common approach would "signal a new form of
partnership across industry that would be different from both the
conflict model which we now reject and our previous more formal
attempts at working together."
</P>
<P>
"The proper relationship between unions and employers at every
level is one in which we seek to resolve our differences as
maturely and amicably as possible and build on our shared
interests in success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Monks admitted there were disagreements between the TUC and
CBI over issues, including the minimum wage, the EU social
chapter and the EU's working time directive.
</P>
<P>
Over the minimum wage, Monks said the real issue was not the
principle but the level, which had yet to be set. He hoped the
directive could be made to work "flexibly and efficiently but
effectively in the UK."

nation to participate in the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000-12,000 soldiers will be involved in the mission,

<HEADLINE> US President Softens Position on Balancing Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
softened his once-firm opposition today to a balanced-budget
constitutional amendment that appears increasingly likely to pass
the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony for a parks bill, Clinton said he still
believes an amendment is unnecessary. But he then said, "If we
have it, it ought to be implemented in a way that actually works
and gives the country what it needs to manage a recession."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said an amendment should not be used as an excuse for
delaying action to balance the budget. And he said any amendment
would have to provide the tools necessary to lift the economy if
it slips into recession.
</P>
<P>
"If it sets a framework and says that in the 21st century in
the economy we're going to be living in, other things being equal,
we ought always to be balancing our books, I agree with that," the
U.S. president said.
</P>
<P>
White House aides said the president's change of tone on an
amendment was a bow to political reality after Republicans gained
two seats in the Senate for a 55-45 advantage over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans increasing their strength in the Senate,
Republican leaders in the Congress have said that a balanced
budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution might be voted on early.
</P>
<P>
A version of amendment on the balanced-budget passed the U.S.
House of Representatives in 1995 but failed by a single vote in
the Senate. It appeared there were enough votes to pass it now.
</P>
<P>
One week after the U.S. presidential election, President
Clinton met today with the returning leaders of the U.S. Congress
to begin planning for talks on how to balance the budget and other
matters.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks continued
their rally today, with major indexes ending in record high
territory again.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average up 10.44 at 6,266.04, setting
its fifth consecutive closing high. The blue-chip index lost 16
points in early trading, recovery to show a gain of more than 20
points, then slipped back a second time before rallying into the
close.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was healthy at around 400
million shares, up from Monday's pace of 353.96 million.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were mixed.
</P>
<P>
At the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond moved up late in
the session, pushing its yield, which moves opposite the price, to
6.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors also took profits ahead of a series of economic data,
including the October wholesale price index, the consumer price
index and industrial production and factory-use data, this week.
</P>
<P>
Investors hope the reports will give a sign about whether the
Federal Reserve is likely to change interest rates before the end
of the year. The Fed's policy committee meets Wednesday, but is
not expected to take any action regarding interest rates at that
time.

<HEADLINE> China Contributes to Protecting Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese
representative today called for greater international efforts for
the protection of children and gave an account of China's
achievements in children's programs.
</P>
<P>
"It remains a very arduous task for Member States (of the
United Nations) to ensure that every child enjoys fully his or her
rights," said Xu Hong from the Chinese delegation at a meeting of
the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that children's rights have been seriously violated in
some places of the world due to poverty, natural disasters, armed
conflicts and crimes against children.
</P>
<P>
"We are required to take more effective measures at both the
national and international levels to create a favorable
environment for children's happy and healthy upbringing by
removing the root causes of their problems and giving assistance
to those in misery," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He said China fully supports the discussions sponsored by
relevant U.N. agencies on the protection of children's rights and
on the prevention and eradication of the sale of children, child
prostitution and child pornography.
</P>
<P>
For a country with over 300 million children, China attaches
great importance to children's survival, protection and
development. Since the initiation of reform and opening to the
outside world in the late 1970s, children's programs in China have
become important component parts of the nation's construction and
the duties of the whole society.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics contained in the U.N.'s report on the
State of the World's Children 1996, China has done a better job
overall than other developing countries in lowering children's
mortality rate and improving their nutrition, health and
education, according to the Chinese representative.
</P>
<P>
The representative also listed other measures taken by the
Chinese government in international cooperation in the field of
protection of children.

ROME, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today met with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali
who arrived here Monday afternoon to attend the World Food Summit.

<P>
The prime minister's office said in a press release that the

Security Council adopted resolution 1078, he added.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the Italian government will work for the
stabilization of the situation in eastern Zaire.
</P>

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of
the House of Representatives, has indicated his willingness to
cooperate with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday night Gingrich said that Republicans "should
not flinch from four years of working with this administration,
because it is the administration the American people chose."
</P>
<P>
"We'll seek to find every possible common ground to work with
him for the betterment of America because the entire world is
watching to see if we can make this experiment of self government
work," he told the GOPAC, the political action committee he
chaired until last year.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow ourselves to be mired down as the anti-Clinton
party, subsumed in some sense of anger or rage," Gingrich said
Monday night. "We cannot be in a permanent campaign."
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich also celebrated Republican victories in the
campaign just ended, saying Republicans should not be depressed
over Bob Dole's loss to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"It is morning in America again," he suggested, quoting
Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign slogan. "Is this disrespectful
of Bob Dole and Jack Kemp? Not at all."

</P>
<P>
Ford became the latest auto maker to offer the program with the
first "quality certified" used Fords to be sold next week from
some dealers in the Southeast. The program is expected to be
available at dealers nationwide next spring. And 250,000 to
300,000 used cars annually will be sold under the warranty
program.
</P>
<P>
The General Motors Corporation is already signing up new car
dealers nationwide for a warranty program for cars and trucks with
no more than 60,000 miles. By the end of next year, it expects
that 1,500 dealers will offer "G.M. certified" used cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler Corporation will test a similar program in Kansas
City starting February 1 next year. If the program is successful,
Chrysler could roll it out nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The move was made by the Big Three auto makers in face of new
pressure from used car superstores which are trying to attract
buyers with no haggle pricing and promises to skip the
high-pressure sales tactics often found in traditional dealership.
</P>
<P>
The guarantees from Ford and other auto makers are intended to
help used car buyers feel an affinity to their traditional
dealership.

<HEADLINE> Cornerstone Laid for Serb Sarajevo Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Premier
Nikola Sainovic laid the cornerstone in the Serb part of Sarajevo
today, launching a project for the construction of 7,000
residential buildings in the Serb suburb of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"The years of war have passed and today marks a new page in
history, new homes for Serb Sarajevo" in Bosnia, the Tanjug news
agency quoted Sainovic as saying in Pale, the Serb administrative
center near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He said the construction of new homes confirmed a wish for the
settlement of refugees in Yugoslavia and Europe. The Bosnia war
ended last November but there are still more than 600,000 refugees
from Bosnia and Croatia living in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is participating in the construction project with
107 million German marks (71 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony in Pale was attended by members of
a Yugoslav business delegation, headed by Sainovic, Bosnian
presidency member Momcilo Krajisnik, Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Gojko Klickovic and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at another ceremony held on the same occasion in the
Serb Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica, Krajisnik stressed the
importance of economic and political aid that Serbia and
Yugoslavia had extended to Republika Srpska.

<HEADLINE> Major Vows to Fight EU Work Hours Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today pledged to block any agreements on the European
Union's (EU) Inter-Governmental Conference until the EU directive
on a maximum working hours is reversed.
</P>
<P>
Major made the statement after the Luxembourg-based European
Court of Justice rejected Britain's challenge to an EU law setting
a maximum average work week of 48 hours earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters outside Downing Street today, Major said,
"I believe it is a bad piece of legislation. I don't accept that
it is appropriate to the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Major stressed that the British government would "go to the
Inter-Governmental Conference and insist on reversing this
legislation."
</P>
<P>
"Our partners know that we will require changes in the European
law to reinforce Britain's protection from such legislation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
British Trade and and Industry Secretary Ian Lang reportedly
said today that Major had written a letter to EU Commission
President Jacques Santer to demand an overturn of the EU law.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the British government is heading for a
collision course with its EU partners by declaring another
non-cooperation policy with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Presidency Fails to Agree on Ministerial Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The collective presidency of
Bosnia once again failed to reach agreement on the structure of a
ministerial council, or future government, at today's session in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Discussions that lasted several hours did not make headway in
bringing closer the positions of the Muslim-Croat side, who want a
government with a prime minister and five ministers, and the Serb
side that demanded a prime minister and two ministers, the Tanjug
news agency reported from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
It has been agreed that a working group will continue to
discuss the composition of the ministerial council.
</P>
<P>
The presidency, however, has adopted, with members of the
council for the implementation of the Dayton agreement, a platform
for the Paris conference on November 14, although some important
issues are still controversial. The presidency members are
expected to elaborate on them in Paris, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the presidency will report to the leading world
powers on the situation regarding the constituting of joint
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The presidency members will attempt in paris to coordinate
their positions on the ministerial council and other joint
institutions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The presidency session, held in the Zemaljski Museum in
Sarajevo, was attended by President of the collective presidency
Alija Izetbegovic, Serb member Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat member
Kresimir Zubak as well as the international community's High
Representative Carl Bildt.

<HEADLINE> Business Costs Lower in Canada Than in US: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Business operating costs,
particularly total labor costs, are significantly lower in Canada
than in the United States, an independent study of 23 Canadian and
U.S. cities showed.
</P>
<P>
Based on a detailed analysis of key cost factors, the study
found that after-tax costs average 6.7 percent less in Canadian
than in U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
The study compared the costs of establishing and operating
industrial facilities across seven industries in suburban sites in
13 Canadian and 10 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
All of the most location-specific costs were taken into
account, including land and building costs, according to KPMG, the
Canadian consulting firm that conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
The strong Canadian results are primarily due to total labor
costs, including wages, employer-sponsored benefits, and
employer-sponsored statutory benefits, said Stuart MacKay,
director of the study.
</P>
<P>
"The image of Canada as having higher labor costs is simply not
accurate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When all the costs of U.S. labor costs are factored in and
converted to Canadian dollars, the net advantage to Canada is
significant," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among key findings, the study found that for every industry
examined, overall costs are lower in Canada than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Costs related to location are, on average, 15.7 percent lower
in Canada. Those costs amount to about 40 percent of total
operating costs and lead to an after-tax cost advantage of 6.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The size of the Canadian advantage varies by industry, ranging
from 5.5 percent for telecommunications to 10.5 percent for
software production, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, industrial land, construction and electricity
costs are lower in Canada. And the largest Canadian centers are
less costly than all of the U.S. locations examined.
</P>
<P>
Exchange rates are the key to Canada's cost advantage, the
study noted. This advantage will be retained as long as the
Canadian dollar exchange rate is under 0.87 U.S. dollars, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The study was sponsored by the Canadian Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, the Royal Bank of Canada and the
Economic Developers Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Its findings were released today by Canadian Minister for
International Trade Art Eggleton.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi, Turkish Leaders Agree on Joint Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi and Turkish leaders
reached a consensus here today that their countries should iron
out their differences through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, both the visiting
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and his Turkish counterpart
Tansu Ciller stressed the importance of joint efforts to seek
mutual interests between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here this morning for a one-day visit to
Turkey, described his meeting with Ciller as "useful."
</P>
<P>
Ciller said the two countries should "solve their different
views through dialog."
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters before his meeting with Aziz, Turkish
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan also pointed out that the two
countries play a vital role for the peace and stability in the
region, saying that Turkey lost over 30 billion U.S. dollars due
to U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's meetings with Turkish leaders today coincided with a
strongly-worded protest Baghdad lodged against Turkey's alleged
violations of its territorial integrity through cross-border
strikes against the the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Ciller said today that Turkey would strongly fight against the
PKK rebels, who take shelter in northern Iraq to attack military
and civilian targets in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahaf sent a letter today to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, accusing the Turkish troops for shelling of Iraq's
villages and towns in the north and illegally entering its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf urged Ankara to end the mandate of the U.S. and allied
forces policing a no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit came amid joint Turkish and U.S. efforts to work
out a peaceful settlement between the Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) led by Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) headed by Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted between the Iraqi Kurds factions once
again when the KDP drove the PUK out of the Kurdish enclave with
Iraqi military support at the end of August. Last month the PUK
launched counterattacks and regained the bulk of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and its rival PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Adopts Resolution Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly today adopted a resolution urging the United
States to end its economic, commercial and financial embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the United States to take necessary
steps to repeal or invalidate laws or regulations related to the
embargo as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The document, adopted by a vote of 137 in favor, three against
and 25 abstentions, reaffirmed the international norms such as the
sovereign equality of states, non-intervention and
non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of
international trade and navigation.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth resolution adopted in a row by the U.N.
General Assembly since 1992, with more nations each year voting in
favor of the measure, indicating the U.S. dilemma on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embargo on Cuba has been in place since 1962, causing
severe damage to the island states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting before taking vote this morning, Carlos
lage Davila, vice president of the Council of Ministers of Cuba,
pointed out that the Helms-Burton Act which, given its
extraterritorial, unilateral and coercive nature, violates
international law and the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
He gave a detailed account of the difficulties and sufferings
of the Cuban people as a result of the U.S. embargo on his
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. "criminal policy, which has been in place for more
than a third of a century, has caused a damage of over 60 billion
U.S. dollars, five times as much the amount of our country's
external debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no reason at all to blockade Cuba, the vice president
noted, adding that the time has come for a new U.S. policy
approach toward Cuba as President Clinton is reelected.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from various countries at the meeting criticized the
United States for the Helms-Burton Act which, they observed,
attempts to internationalize the existing economic embargo.

<HEADLINE> Investment Linked to Peace: Egyptian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri said here today that economic integration and
cooperation among the Middle East states is linked to the
comprehensive and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri was speaking in an interview with Xinhua at the Cairo
International Conference Center during the third Middle East and
North Africa economic conference which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference was downgraded from the summit level to
the ministerial level in light of the stalled peace process in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian minister, inter-Arab trade volume
accounted for 8 percent of the total Arab trade volume, with the
remaining 92 percent represented by trade between the Arab and
non-Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri also called upon the Arab states to invest inside the
Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said that each country has its own way of attracting
investments, noting the favorable investment climate in Egypt
would attract more foreign investments to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is reportedly presenting to the economic conference 188
projects with a total investment of over 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 people from 78 countries and regions are
participating in the three-day conference.
