<HEADLINE> Ford, UPS Join Forces  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will work with a United Parcel
Service subsidiary to nearly cut in half the time it takes to ship vehicles from
assembly plants to dealerships.
</P>
<P>
	   UPS Logistics Group will revamp Ford's network of road and rail carriers and
add a high-tech information system that makes it easy to track individual
vehicles, chief executive officer Dan DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the optimized network is complete, Ford customers can expect the same
on-time delivery reliability they get from UPS," he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the partnership with UPS Logistics will let car buyers use a Web
site to track a new vehicle through the delivery process the way they now can
track packages.
</P>
<P>
	   But when it is implemented in March, the system should reduce the time the
average new vehicle is in transit from 14 or 15 days to about eight or nine,
said Frank Taylor, Ford's vice president of material, planning and logistics.
</P>
<P>
	   "Speed is a competitive advantage," Taylor said. "If you look at what
happens in the total network today, it's lacking speed, and it's lacking
precision, and the customer needs both. Speed and precision will drive cost
down."
</P>
<P>
	   Tracking individual vehicles and using the data to individually route new
cars will make Ford's distribution network more reliable and efficient, reducing
transportation and inventory costs, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Greiner, chairman of the National Auto Dealer Association's Ford
committee, said the ability to tell customers exactly when their vehicle will be
available will become a selling point.
</P>
<P>
	   "It provides an unprecedented connection between Ford, its dealers and its
customers," said Greiner, who owns a Casper, Wyo., dealership. "The ability to
have our customers instantly informed is definitely a competitive advantage, and
any reduction in delivery time is a plus."
</P>
<P>
	   Automakers have reported problems with rail delivery in recent months, due
to congestion on some routes and mergers that delayed trains in several parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system may not completely solve all transportation problems, but,
"even with logistical problems of delivering, whether that's by rail or truck,
to provide consumers information about where their car is in transit is an
absolute home run," Greiner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analyst Alan Baum said the initiative by Ford, the world's No. 2
automaker, is a combination of streamlining internal operations and improving
customer service.
</P>
<P>
	   "UPS has made a business of this kind of work," said Baum, of IRN Inc. "It's
significant because they (Ford) are looking -- like lots of companies are
looking -- at the service aspect to try to improve revenues."
</P>
<P>
	   The partnership continues the trend of making more of the car-buying process
accessible through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford in January partnered with Yahoo! to create a Web site where vehicle
owners access owner guides, recall notifications, Ford Credit account
information and personalized maintenance logs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ford customers who shop online for cars and trucks will be delighted to
learn that they soon will be able to use the Web to track their vehicle delivery
as well," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said it will begin the program with Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars in
the western and southwestern United States, Taylor said. The system will cover
all of North America when it is fully functional in late 2001. Ford then plans
to add Volvo, Mazda and Jaguar to the system.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 100-150 UPS employees and 30-50 Ford employees will manage the
system together, and UPS will be compensated based on how it helps Ford meet its
speed and efficiency goals, Taylor said. Detailed terms were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Retirment Funds Hit $1.7 Trillion  </HEADLINE>
    By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As state and local government payrolls grow longer,
public employees' retirement funds grow fatter.
</P>
<P>
	   Total cash and security holdings for non-federal government retirement
systems rose to an all-time high of $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 1997-98, up
$237 billion from the previous year, according to data being released Thursday
by the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the same period, the total number of full-time state and municipal
employees rose about 300,000 to 14.5 million, Census data indicates.
</P>
<P>
	   Thank the overall good health of the American economy for padding public
employees' retirement accounts, said Steve Regenstreif, director of the retiree
program for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "In recent years, the health of it is due to the rise in the stock market,"
he said. "The majority of public sector retirement systems are now either fully-
or well-funded and this is a very good development."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $1.7 trillion, the Census Bureau reported that more than $1.2
trillion was invested in non-governmental securities, including $639 billion in
corporate stocks, $258 billion in corporate bonds, and $195 billion in
international securities.
</P>
<P>
	   State and local governments are paying more attention to the future of their
employees, and more systems are offering the option of defined contribution
accounts like 401(k) plans as options, said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 2,140 public employee retirement systems in 1997 nationwide.
Illinois had the most with 374, followed by Pennsylvania, which had 343. Hawaii
and Maine each had only one system that served all of their state and local
government employees.
</P>
<P>
	   California's 66 public employee retirement funds in 1997 totaled $291
billion in assets and served over 1.6 million members -- both highs in the U.S.
The largest is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, with about
$165 billion in assets covering 1 million people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Global Warming Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a major increase in
federal spending to combat global warming and pollution, along with new tax
incentives to encourage business to invest in environmentally friendly
technology, White House officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In his upcoming budget request, Clinton will ask Congress for $2.4 billion
for various initiatives designed to reduce the harmful effect of global climate
change, said Roger Ballantine, White House environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount is more than 40 percent above what Congress approved last year.
Ballantine said he is optimistic nonetheless, in part because U.S. business
interests are eager to sell technology and environmentally friendly products
abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone agrees that there is an enormous market out there as the
developing world adds the enormous amount of new energy capacity that they're
planning, and that U.S. business can and should get into that market,''
Ballantine said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president proposed a package of conservation incentives a year ago but
Republicans in Congress, leery of the unratified international climate change
agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, wouldn't go along.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the new money would go toward a push to accelerate development and
distribution of clean energy technologies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is asking for $200 million -- twice the request from last year -- to
pair that U.S. business opportunity with an effort to convince developing
countries to choose environmentally benign energy sources such as wind power and
alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy use in developing countries will overtake that of industrialized
countries by 2020, representing a market for technology and energy products of
between $4 billion and $5 billion, a White House primer on the initiative said.
The trend will continue, with developing countries accounting for 75 percent of
the increase in global energy use between now and 2050, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other industrialized countries, which have already
reaped both benefit and harm from the use of dirty fuels such as coal, want to
encourage developing countries to choose cleaner options. Vice President Al Gore
and others cite the dangers of global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   Some poorer countries have resisted this push as so much meddling. The new
money, spread among several U.S. government agencies including the Export-Import
Bank and the Department of Energy, is intended to help decision-makers abroad
get comfortable with new technology that may carry higher upfront costs but pay
off in the long run, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The initiative will help lay the technical and policy foundation,'' for
poorer countries ``to build a clean energy future, leapfrogging past the
polluting energy technologies used by the industrial countries,'' the White
House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will send Congress his spending proposals for fiscal year 2001 on
Monday, although the White House has already disclosed much of the package.
Clinton also outlined many of the big-ticket budget items in his State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also outlined a plan to give $4 billion in tax incentives over
five years to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging people to buy
more energy-efficient cars, homes and other products.
</P>
<P>
	   That plan, which also requires congressional approval, would give a tax
break to home buyers who choose a new, energy-efficient house. The tax credit
would be $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the energy efficiency of the chosen
home.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House also wants a tax credit for energy-efficient water heaters
and other equipment in homes and commercial buildings. The credit would be 20
percent of the cost of the equipment, up to a cap.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar proposals died in Congress last year.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer, Warner-Lambert Work on Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. has tentatively agreed to a sweetened
$85 billion takeover offer from Pfizer Inc., that would create the world's
second-largest pharmaceutical maker, according to two people familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies were working out the details on Wednesday. Part of that
equation will be how to placate American Home Products, the losing suitor in a
3- month fight for control of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home had signed a $59 billion deal in November to acquire
Warner-Lambert before Pfizer trumped the bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which is best known for its Viagra drug, will offer 2.75 shares,
worth about $99, for each share of Warner-Lambert, maker of the blockbuster
cholesterol drug Lipitor, said the sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   While Warner-Lambert shareholders would get 10 percent more of Pfizer's
stock than its original offer, those shares are worth about 8 percent less today
than they were when Pfizer first made its bid. Pfizer's original offer would
have been worth $77 billion based on Wednesday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer will have to pay a $1.8 billion breakup fee to American Home
Products. And Pfizer may also have to make other concessions to American Home,
which could still prevent Pfizer from using a favorable accounting treatment in
its acquisition of Warner-Lambert. That could hurt Pfizer's profits.
</P>
<P>
	   All three companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would have a wide range of medicines including the
blood pressure-control drug Norvasc and the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as
consumer products like Bubblicious Gum, Certs mints, Schick razors and Listerine
mouth wash.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a formidable, global company that investors will be very happy
with," said Tony Butler, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, who expects the
company's profits will grow at 24 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have tremendous potential to be a force in any therapeutic area
where they have entries, not just today, but in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pfizer-Warner-Lambert combination is part of an industrywide
consolidation, and follows last month's announcement of deal that would combine
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham to create the biggest drug
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the advantages of combining the research budgets and sales staffs of
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer, the companies have waged a very public battle in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have filed lawsuits against each other, and Warner-Lambert
had unsuccessfully sought a white-knight bidder to fend off Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   With such acrimony between the two chairmen, Wall Street does not expect
Warner-Lambert's chairman and chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, to
have a role in the new company. Details, however, were not available Wednesday
evening.

nuclear disarmament measures that are stalled and initiatives that haven't
gotten off the ground, including the START II accord, signed in 1993 and
ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996. It was intended to halve U.S. and Russian

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Hike Shrugged Off  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times in
the past seven months, but many Americans don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer confidence and spending are at their highest levels on record. Low
unemployment, rising personal income and a booming stock market have put more
money in Americans' pockets, offsetting worries over rising rates.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, the Fed's efforts to slow down economic growth as a way to fend
off inflation haven't yet had a visible impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just psychology. People think things are going well so they aren't
reacting as quickly to these interest rate hikes as they would if they thought
things were bad," said David Orr, an economist at First Union Corp. in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   As expected, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates another
quarter-point Wednesday to 5.75 percent. It was the fourth increase since last
June.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer optimism that has blunted the effect of the rate increases is
directly tied to the availability of jobs, Orr said. It's no coincidence, he
added, that consumer confidence is at a 30-year high at the same time
unemployment is at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent economic indicators point up that optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   The housing and automobile sectors -- both extremely sensitive to interest
rate fluctuations -- have dismissed the recent spate of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing construction rose 7.1 percent in December, ending the most
successful year since 1986. New homes sales rose 4.5 percent in December,
pushing the total for 1999 to an all-time record.
</P>
<P>
	   These increases came despite mortgage rates that now average 8.25 percent,
the highest since the summer of 1996. Last June, before the Fed started raising
rates, the average mortgage was at 7.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, car sales in the United States accelerated in January following
up on last year's record sales of 16.9 million vehicles. The Michigan research
firm Morgan &AMP; Co. said sales of cars and light trucks rose 10 percent during the
month, for a projected annual rate of 17.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending has been the major driver behind the economic boom as it
represents two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Macias, 48, a retired Army officer from El Paso, Texas, is
representative of the national mood. On Wednesday he was looking at a $10,000
Harley-Davidson motorcycle that he ordered two days ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to buy the bike no matter what," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Macias said he expects the latest interest rate hike to make Americans "more
conscious of how much you're going to spend on an item and if you really need it
or not."
</P>
<P>
	   But it won't stop him from buying the motorcycle, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Macias said he believes the economy still has room to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's enjoying the prosperity and not thinking about the future,"
added Herman Scott, 66, a retired FBI agent from Jonesboro, Ga. "Everybody says,
'Hey, if I can get it, I'm going to get it."'
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Fed's strategy of incremental rate hikes isn't
intended to end the party, but merely lower the volume a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're tapping on the brakes of the economy, not trying to slam on the
brakes," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, a St. Louis
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   After a record-breaking 107 months of expansion, accompanied by few signs of
rising inflation, the economy doesn't need a major overhaul, said Ken Goldstein,
an economist with the Conference Board, a New York research group that measures
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got so much momentum it's like a runner at the beginning of a race.
It's not wheezing across the finish line," Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   That momentum makes it likely that the Fed will raise rates again in the
coming months, Goldstein added.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's rate increase, the fourth since last June, marked the first time
interest rates have risen above the levels of mid-1998, when the Fed lowered
rates three times in an effort to free up capital to help bail out flagging
Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
	   Barring some similar catastrophe, consumer optimism is expected to remain
high.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumer confidence is a reflection of what your own life is like. Most
people are saying to themselves, 'My job is doing well, my company is doing
well, and it looks like it's going to continue for the foreseeable future,"'
said Godfrey Wood, president of the Greater Portland, Me., Chambers of
Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Anger Over Minority-Ownership Rule  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading black and Hispanic entrepreneurs are challenging a
move by a key corporate advisory group to drop a requirement that firms be 51
percent minority-owned to qualify for certain corporate contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   These leaders contend that this will lead to the end of affirmative action,
while creating fronts for white-owned firms to scoop up billions of dollars in
equity capital.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't think that our community is not receiving venture and equity
capital now, what makes you think this will change?" George Herrera, president
and chief executive of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council
countered that her group had created a solution to a pressing problem: Many of
the companies that currently quality are too small to attract large investments
and instead have to rely on loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The NMSDC says that under the new rules, companies would be more attractive
to venture capitalists and other investors because they could potentially be
larger.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 15,000 firms the NMSDC certifies, at least three-fourths have instead
had to rely on debt financing.
</P>
<P>
	   The 51 percent rule still applies, but the NMSDC created a new class of firm
that can be 30 percent minority-owned as long as 51 percent of the voting stock
is held by minorities and that they control the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, NMSDC-certified firms won more than $40 billion in contracts from
NMSDC members, a group of 3,500 companies that includes more than half of the
Fortune 500.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed rule change, which has been under consideration for more than a
year, led to the creation of a coalition last fall of civil rights leaders from
the NAACP, the National Urban League and the National Action Network along with
Earl G. Graves, the publisher of Black Enterprise, elected officials and
Hispanic business leaders.

<P>
	   Because of the objections, the NMSDC had its 78-member advisory board vote
in private, with a majority deciding by Tuesday to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition fears that Congress will take its cue from the vote and end
affirmative action, which has ushered innumerable small companies into the
business world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rules are being changed because of the proliferation of minority-owned
businesses," Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a thing called racism that necessitated that affirmative action
come into being. When did that go away?" Graves said. "There's not a (major)
minority contractor in construction in the New York area."
</P>
<P>
	   But Harriet Michel, the head of the NMSDC, said it's not likely there will
be majority-owned fronts because "this is going to be the most highly-controlled
investigation into certification in the country."
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no absolute," she said. "There are corporations today that accept
companies without any certification."
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules are expected to go into effect in about 90 days,

<HEADLINE> FTC Rejects BP Amoco, ARCO Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By T.A. BADGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Less than a week before BP Amoco was to finalize
its proposed takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., the Federal Trade Commission
has stepped in front of the deal, branding it anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC on Wednesday voted 3-2 to direct its staff to seek an injunction
that would torpedo the $29 billion merger, concluding the new company would
dominate Alaska oil production and West Coast markets and have the power to
control prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "This particular merger is anticompetitive," said Richard Parker, director
of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. "We're going after this merger and we're
going to try to stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco launched its bid for Los Angeles-based Arco in March.
The deal was scheduled to go through on Monday, but Parker said the government
would go to court in San Francisco as early as Friday to block it.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal proposes to create the second largest nongovernment oil company
behind Exxon Mobil, whose merger was approved by the FTC in November.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco said they would fight the FTC in court.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe we have a compelling case," BP Amoco said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said the BP Amoco-Arco combination would create "a colossus" that
could dictate prices to West Coast refiners reliant on Alaska crude oil. Merger
critics say such supply dominance could force up gasoline prices in California
and other West Coast states.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska is where BP Amoco and Arco have the most overlap in their global
operations. They are the state's two largest oil producers, accounting for more
than 70 percent of daily output.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaskans have been split over the buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Public Interest Research Group was elated.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great day for Alaska and Alaska's future," said Jim Sykes, executive
director of the group, which was part of the makeshift coalition of deal
opponents that span the political spectrum. "It's not the final step, but it's a
major, major victory."
</P>
<P>
	   But others believe the BP-Arco combination would be in the state's best
interests, and that the FTC has extended what has been an unsettled 10 months
since the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there's uncertainty in the oilpatch, long-term decisions won't be made,"
said Karen Cowart, executive director of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FTC's Parker said BP already takes advantage of refiners by charging
higher prices to those most dependent on Alaska crude.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker also charged BP with using Alaska oil exports to restrict supply to
the West Coast and thereby keep crude prices artifically high.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal will cement that market power and harm competition by creating a
significant risk that crude oil prices would be higher on the West Coast than
they would be without the deal," Parker said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, BP Amoco and Arco disputed the FTC view, saying oil
was a global commodity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any suggestion that there is a special West Coast market for Alaskan crude
oil that functions independently of world crude prices is without foundation,"
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco had said it would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as
part ownership in two Alaska oil fields. But Parker said the new company still
"would control overwhelming proportions of the (Alaska) production."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the proposed divestitures, the combined company would account for
55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   Litigation could take months and eventually may end up before the Supreme
Court if BP Amoco persists in fighting the biggest antitrust challenge to the
oil industry since the Standard Oil breakup nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Antitrust experts said the government may have a tough time proving its
case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil flows. They're going to have to find some sort of argument to show why
the international (market) is not going to solve the problem," said Victor
Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia University.

<HEADLINE> Arson Fire Kills Four Children  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An intruder splashed a flammable liquid on the floor of
an apartment and sparked a blaze Wednesday night that killed four children,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The person had knocked on the door of the house and asked by name for the
mother of the children, who was not home. He then set the apartment on fire and
fled, Jefferson Parish authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   An elderly man in the home, identified as the grandfather, was able to rush
two children to safety, but four others ran up to the second floor of the
apartment because they were frightened by the flames, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was turned back by intense smoke and heat when he tried to return
for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters made their way inside as they fought the blaze and found the
bodies of the remaining children.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities did not immediately release the names of the victims, their
mother or the family members who escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   Family and neighbors could be seen sobbing outside the smoldering apartment,
which was part of a complex in an area known as Harvey, across the Mississippi
River from New Orleans. Jefferson Parish authorities referred to it as a
high-crime area.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Cross officials said four families were forced out of neighboring
apartments.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities had a vague description of the intruder but no name and few
other leads, said Sheriff Harry Lee.

<HEADLINE> Sydney 2000 Accepts Rescue Package  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The organizing committee for the Sydney 2000 Olympics
has accepted a rescue package aimed at curbing its $123 million budget blowout.
</P>
<P>
	As a tradeoff, SOCOG has surrendered some of its responsibilities as the New
South Wales State Government, which is underwriting the Olympics, seeks a ``more
hands on'' approach to hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG agreed to the rescue package, which still has to be ratified by the New
South Wales treasurer, during a board meeting Thursday following revelations of
an expected ticket revenue shortfall of some $48 million.
</P>
<P>
	Projected sponsorship shortfall had already reached almost $69 million.
</P>
<P>
	The package involves the Australian Olympic Committee and the International
Olympic Committee each forgoing $7 million from their respective shares of the
SOCOG budgeted surplus.
</P>
<P>
	The New South Wales Government also agreed to forgo its budgeted surplus of
$19.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	The agreement reduces SOCOG's budget deficit by $33 million. Other budget cuts
will be announced following the next SOCOG board meeting on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president and Olympics Minister Michael Knight, who last year predicted
record profits from the 2000 Games, downscaled his expectations Thursday, saying
that SOCOG was aiming to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a profit, we're certainly not looking for a profit, but we're
pretty confident we can deliver a balanced budget,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
	He said IOC coordination committee chief Jacques Rogge supported the budget
measures.
</P>
<P>
	AOC president John Coates, who is also the SOCOG vice president, said the
Australian Olympic Committee ``doesn't blame'' anyone from SOCOG for the budget
problems and insisted that the previous profit projections had been inflated.
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreement, the Government-run Olympic Coordination Authority will
take over responsibility for operational programs and budgets for all games
venues other than the Olympic villages.
</P>
<P>
	Up to 10 SOCOG employees will also be seconded to the OCA as the groups bid to
streamline running and increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG will retain responsibility for the Torch relay, technology, the workforce
and the sporting aspect of the event, while SOCOG chief operating officer Jim
Sloman will remain in charge of the overall running of the Olympic program.
</P>
<P>
	Knight said SOCOG would now focus on ``delivering sports, which is still very
much at the center of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
	He said the ticket revenue shortfall had been identified following a ``very
detailed scoping of the number of seats available'' after accounting for ``seat
kills,'' which is the number of seats lost to sporting federations and media.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG officials said people who had already purchased tickets would be almost
assured of receiving their tickets.

<HEADLINE> Oilers 4, Blackhawks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Mike Grier scored his third short-handed goal of
the season Wednesday night to spark the Edmonton Oilers to a 4-1 win over the
Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Grier, who has seven goals, is tied for second in the league in short-handed
goals, one behind John Madden of the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Grier forced a giveaway by Tony Amonte just inside the Chicago blue line and
skated in alone to beat goalie Jocelyn Thibault with a nifty deke at 15:42 of
the second period, making it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Weight, Ethan Moreau and Janne Niinimaa also scored for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Olczyk scored the lone Chicago goal after the Oilers had built a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago's Dean McAmmond was assessed a major penalty for checking from
behind, plus a game misconduct, for a reckless hit on Jim Dowd at 17:40 of the
second. McAmmond knocked Dowd into the Chicago net, behind Thibault.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blackhawks were outshot 14-4 in the second period and failed to score on
eight power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   Weight opened the scoring at 12:29 of the second, taking an excellent pass
at the goal mouth from Ryan Smyth, who was behind the net.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers jumped ahead 3-0 in the third when Moreau intercepted a poor
clearing attempt by Anders Eriksson just inside the Chicago blue line and skated
in alone to score at 5:03.
</P>
<P>
	   Olczyk snapped the shutout when he slipped behind Oilers defenseman Sean
Brown and beat Tommy Salo with a wrist shot from well out at 7:11.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreau got the puck to Niinimaa for a short-handed goal into the empty net
at 18:11. Thibault had been removed 29 seconds earlier for an extra attacker.

	   The Sonics lost their second straight home game following a loss Saturday to

game and the Sonics All-Star guard was 5-for-18 from the field.

<P>
	   Artest equaled his season high and converted 12 of 13 free throws.

<P>
	   With the Sonics down 82-78, Payton was called for an offensive foul and
whistled for a technical after Brent Barry fouled Artest.

3-point shot that put the Sonics ahead 49-44.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Plane Spun Before Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Moments before it crashed, Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 started ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down'' as it hurtled toward the
Pacific Ocean, a federal investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-83 jetliner was in one piece and there were no signs of fire or smoke
when it hit the water, killing all 88 people aboard, witnesses told
investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   As it passed over Anacapa Island, just off the Southern California coast, a
witness heard several popping sounds, watched the plane turn, then plunge into
the Santa Barbara Channel, NTSB member John Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft was twisting, flying erratically, nose rocking,'' the witness
told investigators, Hammerschmidt said. Pilots in the vicinity described the
plane as ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and
inverted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, searchers recovered one of the ``black box'' recorders
that could help explain the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The remote-controlled underwater robot Scorpio broke the blue surface of the
Santa Barbara Channel shortly before sundown, clutching the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
	   The device would have recorded conversations and any other sounds in the
cockpit during the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The search continued in about 700 feet of water for the flight data
recorder, a companion box that would reveal details of the plane's mechanical
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope the recorders will help find what happened in the
terrifying few minutes between the pilots' first report of mechanical problems
on Alaska Flight 261 and plane's nose-dive into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Five crew members and 83 passengers were on the flight Monday from Puerto
Vallarta, a Mexican vacation spot, to San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there was a new report the plane had mechanical problems on
its flight down to Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times reported there were problems with a part of the tail
called the horizontal stabilizer on the flight to Mexico. The stabilizer keeps
the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle denied the report: ``We
stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware of any
maintenance anomalies with this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the board was looking into the earlier flight and would
interview the pilots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Flight 261 crashed, the pilots reported struggling with a jammed
stabilizer. The pilots also radioed a Seattle maintenance crew about the
problem, and the NTSB on Wednesday began analyzing recordings of that call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said in
Washington, D.C. ``It's going to be very important to this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also interviewed pilots who were flying in the area of
the crash and may have seen Flight 261 go down.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to return to Phoenix 20 minutes after it took off for Dallas Wednesday. The
plane is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them, said Phil Frame, a spokesman for the NTSB in
Washington. Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the
Alaska Airlines investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the search for survivors was called off over the protest
of some family members who held out hope that someone might still be alive in
the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the relatives were staying at a Los Angeles hotel, where they met
with Red Cross counselors and were briefed on the search by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, the Navy took over control from the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other remote-control submersibles like Scorpio were either on scene or
en route, as well as ships with side-scan sonar equipment that can make detailed
maps of debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down -- well below the 300-foot limit for
safe operation by divers.

nuclear disarmament measures that are stalled and initiatives that haven't
gotten off the ground, including the START II accord, signed in 1993 and
ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996. It was intended to halve U.S. and Russian

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Elias scored a goal and assisted on another
Wednesday night as the New Jersey Devils stretched their unbeaten streak against
New York to 17 games, beating the Rangers 3-1. The Devils have not lost to the
Rangers in the regular season since Jan. 12, 1997 (12-0-5). Claude Lemieux put
New Jersey ahead 2-1 at 19:04 of the second period with his 18th goal. Lemieux
intercepted the puck in the Devils end, took it all the way up ice behind the
New York net, then banked in a shot from behind the net off the skate of Rangers
defenseman Kevin Hatcher.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Bias Ruled On  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California courts make it too hard to prove
discrimination in jury selection, a federal appeals court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   California judges require a defense lawyer who challenges the prosecutor's
removal of a juror to show a ``strong likelihood'' of bias before the judge will
order the prosecutor to give an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said this method violates the U.S.
Supreme Court's rules for the type of proof needed to require a hearing on juror
challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's high court requires only evidence that creates a ``reasonable
inference'' of bias before a hearing is ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   The California test, in effect at least since 1994, is ``impermissibly
stringent'' and violates defendants' rights, said Judge William Fletcher in
Wednesday's 3-0 appellate ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court nevertheless upheld the convictions of two men for firing
shots through an apartment door that wounded two Richmond police officers in May
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were black. The jury included one black member, but two other
blacks were removed by the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense failed to offer enough evidence of discrimination to justify a
hearing into the removal of a black female juror, even under the more lenient
federal standard, Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the state did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall Plans New Sprinklers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Seton Hall University has announced that it will
install sprinkler systems immediately in its two dormitories that lack them,
including one where a recent blaze killed three students.
</P>
<P>
	   Three 18-year-old freshmen died in the Jan. 19 fire at Boland Hall. No
charges have been filed, though The Star-Ledger of Newark reported Wednesday
that investigators believe the fire was set.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Lisa Grider discussed the sprinklers Wednesday, but
referred all questions about the report to the Essex County prosecutor's office.
Executive Assistant Prosecutor Charlotte Smith said her office would not comment
on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said investigators believe the fire, which injured more than
60 students, may have resulted from a feud between a group of students and
non-students who were in the building the night of the blaze. It said they had
not concluded whether the third-floor lounge fire was started as a prank or an
attempt to harm someone.
</P>
<P>
	   A student resident adviser had asked three visitors to leave Boland Hall
less than an hour before the fire broke out. Investigators said they believe one
of the three remained in the building, located on the campus of the
9,200-student Roman Catholic university.
</P>
<P>
	   The resident adviser, Dana Christmas, 21, remained in critical condition
Wednesday with severe burns and has yet to speak with investigators. Three other
students who are in critical condition also have not been interviewed.

<HEADLINE> Rio's Oil Spill Impact Severe  </HEADLINE>
   By HAROLD OLMOS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The environmental devastation from thousands
of tons of oil that spilled from a pipeline into Guanabara Bay was immediate.
Black muck spread through protected mangrove swamps, covering birds, crabs and
fish.
</P>
<P>
	   The social damage was slower to surface.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In total, close to 10,000 fishermen and their families have been deprived
of their way of living, and at least 2,000 are in desperate conditions. Nobody
can go fishing any more,'' said Gilson Carlos de Matos, spokesman for the
Guanabara Bay fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosemary Paulino Cavalcante had plans to finish the roof and paint the brick
walls of her two-room shack with the money her husband earned fishing. Now, she
simply wonders how she will feed her family and buy clothes for her children,
age 7 and 10. ``We can't even imagine what we are going to do if there is no
fish to catch,'' Cavalcante said.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill occurred around midnight of January 18 at Reduc, one of Brazil's
biggest oil refineries. Crude spewed from a broken pipeline at the bottom of
Guanabara Bay, and five hours went by before it was stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   The government oil conglomerate Petrobras has estimated 8,200 barrels were
released, but the Union of Oil Workers claimed it was three times as much: 1
million gallons, or 24,600 barrels.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of the amount, environmentalists say it will take at least 10
years to fully restore sea life within the 16 square miles affected by the
spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Once renowned as an inspiration for poets, Guanabara Bay now receives 400
tons of waste daily. Its beaches aren't suitable for swimming, and some are
little more than mosquito-infested marshes.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil that will seep into the seabed ``may kill the plankton, breaking the
food chain, compounding a situation which already was like that of a sick man in
the intensive care unit,'' said Marcelo Furtado, a Sao Paulo-based director of
Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras was punished with a record fine of $28.6 million, although a
loophole reduced that amount by 30 percent. Petrobras said the discount will go
to a fund to help clean the bay, but victims said it is hardly enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the fishermen have filed a suit against Petrobras demanding
$67 million in compensation for ruined nets, oil-soaked boats and a loss of
earnings over four years. This is ``the minimum time for us to return to
fishing,'' said de Matos, the fishermen's spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, 100 fishermen staged a protest on the bay. One carried a sign
saying: ``It's not only the environment. It's people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of them were like Cavalcante's husband, Jorge Edmar da Silva. For ten
years he made his living from the bay, leaving home before dawn to fish and
selling his catch on the beach for 73 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   It was enough to support his family and build a hut by the sea in Gradim,
one of Rio's hundreds of slums. Over the years he bought a TV set and a
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
	   A few yards away, the beach is dark, stinking mud, covered with garbage,
flies and at least a dozen cats. Rio's gleaming skyline is barely visible, just
12 miles off but a world away.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavalcante and other families have received donations of food from
Petrobras, but the handouts weren't well received. Some fishermen complained the
company was treating them like beggars, while others noted that the food wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavalcante said the food basket she received with rice, black beans and a
liter of cooking oil -- meant to last two weeks -- was gone in three days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are other needs,'' she said. ``We have nothing for medicine, we
don't have any soap to wash.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plans to fix the house were put off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will have to wait who knows for how long,'' she said. ``We can't plan
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors 101, Grizzlies 95  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Mookie Blaylock scored 25 points, including nine in
the fourth quarter, as the Golden State Warriors rallied to beat the Vancouver
Grizzlies 101-95 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison added 21 points and John Starks, playing for the second time
since missing 10 games with a knee injury, added 17 for the Warriors, who
matched a season-high by winning their third straight. Golden State has won five
of seven since snapping a 12-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 25 points to lead Vancouver. Michael Dickerson added
19 points, Mike Bibby had 13 and Bryant Reeves 10, all in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaylock also matched a season-high with 10 assists, including a feed that
led to a layup by Jamison with 32 seconds remaining for a 96-93 Warriors' lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State was ahead most of the game but began the fourth quarter with a
four-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Three straight 3-pointers by Donyell Marshall, Starks and Blaylock offset a
3-pointer by Dennis Scott and a layup by Reeves as Golden State moved into an
85-all tie with 6:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver moved back in front when Scott hit another 3-pointer but Blaylock
answered by draining his fourth 3-pointer of the night to put the Warriors up
92-91 with 1:58 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State didn't trail again, though Abdur-Rahim's layup with 27 seconds
narrowed the gap to a point. But Starks, Blaylock and Marshall combined to make
five of six free throws down the stretch to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by six at the half, the Grizzlies used a third-quarter surge to
take their first lead of the game. Abdur-Rahim fueled the rally, scoring 12 of
his points in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   After Jason Caffey's putback put Golden State up 67-64 with 3:31 left in the
third, Dickerson dunked off an alley-oop from Abdur-Rahim despite being fouled.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson made the free throw to complete the three-point play and start a
10-0 run that carried the Grizzlies to a 74-67 lead. Abdur-Rahim had a pair of
free throws and a driving layup before Dickerson capped the flurry with another
three-point play as Vancouver led 76-72 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamison scored 15 of his points in the first half, helping Golden State take
51-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bibby converted a three-point play that pulled the Grizzlies within three
but Blaylock came back to hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the second
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Plane Spun Before Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Moments before it crashed, Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 started ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down'' as it hurtled in a violent
plunge toward the Pacific Ocean, a federal investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no signs of fire or smoke when the jetliner hit the water in one
piece, killing all 88 people aboard, witnesses told the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt provided the witness accounts after the
second day of investigation by the agency, which is trying to determine the
cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB will also rely on radar data, information from the ``black boxes''
and a photograph to piece together the terrifying few minutes between the
pilots' first report of mechanical problems and the plane's crash in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, searchers recovered the cockpit voice recorder. The
device, which records conversations and other sounds in the cockpit, was found
in 700 feet of water by a remote-controlled robot shortly before sundown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As luck would have it, almost literally true, as soon as they got down to
the bottom they found the first box,'' said Navy Capt. Terry Labrecque.
</P>
<P>
	   The search continued for the flight data recorder, a companion box that
records information about the plane's mechanical operation. Searchers had heard
a ping that they believed pinpointed the box's location on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before it crashed Monday, Flight 261 reported problems with part of
the tail called the horizontal stabilizer and was cleared for an emergency
landing at Los Angeles Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Still a mystery is what exactly went wrong with the plane's tail controls
and what the pilots did to try to fix it as the plane hugged the Southern
California coast on its way to San Francisco and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   As it passed over Anacapa Island, just off the coast, a witness heard
several popping sounds, watched the plane turn, then hit the ocean,
Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft was twisting, flying erratically, nose rocking,'' the witness
told investigators, Hammerschmidt said. Pilots in the vicinity described the
plane as ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and
inverted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there was a new report the plane had mechanical problems on
its flight down to Puerto Vallarta. The Seattle Times reported there were
problems with the horizontal stabilizer on the flight to Mexico. The stabilizer
keeps the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle denied the report: ``We
stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware of any
maintenance anomalies with this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the board was looking into the earlier flight and would
interview the pilots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Flight 261 crashed, the pilots also radioed a Seattle maintenance
crew about the problem, and the NTSB on Wednesday began analyzing recordings of
that call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said in
Washington, D.C. ``It's going to be very important to this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to return to Phoenix 20 minutes after it took off for Dallas Wednesday. The
plane is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them, said Phil Frame, a spokesman for the NTSB in
Washington. Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the
Alaska Airlines investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the search for survivors was called off over the protest
of some family members who held out hope that someone might still be alive in
the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the relatives were staying at a Los Angeles hotel, where they met
with Red Cross counselors and were briefed on the search by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, the Navy took over control from the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other remote-control submersibles like Scorpio were either on scene or
en route, as well as ships with side-scan sonar equipment that can make detailed
maps of debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down -- well below the 300-foot limit for
safe operation by divers.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Found in Northern Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
   By JAIME PUEBLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   XOLCUAY, Guatemala (AP) -- On the last day of February 1982, Gaspar Tzuluch
left his three children with his mother and hurried off to the market of a
neighboring village to hawk his coffee yield. He returned to find nothing but a
mountain of corpses.
</P>
<P>
	   The decayed remains of Tzuluch's mother and his children, ages 10, 8 and 3,
were among 35 bodies a team of excavators pulled from shallow graves this week
in Xolcuay, 155 miles northeast of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers believe the bodies constitute nearly all of Xolcuay's
inhabitants. They say the villagers were killed by soldiers who were battling
leftist guerillas at the height of Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Tzuluch was among several family members on hand Tuesday to help researchers
and excavators from Guatemala's Anthropological and Forensic Foundation identify
the remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The 46-year-old calmly recounted how he had to flee Xolcuay and leave the
bodies of his family to avoid capture by the soldiers still occupying the
village.
</P>
<P>
	   After three days of hiding in deep mountain jungle, he said, he returned to
find the bodies buried in hastily prepared mass graves.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers confirmed Wednesday that they had identified 33 of the 35
bodies. The remains of the last two victims were to be taken to Guatemala City
today for testing and analysis, said Fredi Peccerelli, one of the foundation's
forensic specialists.
</P>
<P>
	   The daylong dig Tuesday unearthed men, woman and children of all ages, all
of whom were shot to death, Peccerelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation, which in recent months has led dozens of expeditions in
search of buried corpses hidden in the Guatemalan countryside, had expected to
find as many as 100 bodies in Xolcuay.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a 1996 report by the Guatemalan Truth Commission, more than 100
Indian villagers in and around Xolcuay vanished in February 1982, all thought to
have been killed by a special government anti-guerilla team. Peccerelli said
future expeditions are planned for areas near Xolcuay.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200,000 Guatemalans, mostly Indians from rural areas, died during a
civil war that ended with a 1996 peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> DNA Chips Used to Identify Cancer  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT KOHLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A new technology that uses computers to rapidly monitor the activity of
thousands of genes in cancer cells is giving scientists the ability to more
precisely diagnose cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   That kind of detailed information should one day let doctors classify tumors
with more precision, helping them tailor treatments to each patient, scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, doctors diagnose cancer by looking at tissue under the microscope
for certain biological changes and by doing other tests. The new technique,
however, goes beyond those methods to look at the activity of many tumor genes.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could think of it as a new kind of microscope" that looks at gene
activity instead of the visible structure of cells and tissues, said Dr. Patrick
Brown, an associate biochemistry professor at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's issue of the journal Nature, Brown and colleagues from Stanford,
the National Cancer Institute and elsewhere describe one of the first
large-scale experiments with the technology. They used glass chips the size of a
penny to keep track of how active each of 18,000 tumor genes were.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers focused on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of caner
diagnosed in more than 25,000 Americans each year. They uncovered two distinct
forms of that disease, distinguishable by different patterns of gene activation.
By checking records of previously treated patients, they found that one form was
deadlier than the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings help explain why two-fifths of patients with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma can be cured with standard chemotherapy while the rest often
relapse or die, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technique works because active genes in a cell give off chemical
messages. These messages will bind to specific DNA segments, depending on what
gene they came from. The glass chips carried some 18,000 DNA segments,
representing each gene the scientists wanted to monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   So by tracking which DNA segments attracted the chemical messages, and how
many messages bound to each segment, the technology revealed how active each of
the studied genes was.
</P>
<P>
	   The results need confirmation in larger studies but establish an important
principle, said Dr. Todd Golub of the Whitehead Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "It suggests that we are really at the tip of the iceberg and that our
expectation going forward is that there will be similar stories emerging for all
common human cancers," Golub said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an accompanying Nature commentary, Anton Berns of the Netherlands Cancer
Institute agreed patients should someday benefit by genetic analysis. But he
cautioned that such analysis may not able to predict how cancers will behave
after the initial treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   DNA chips also hold promise for cutting the price of treatment. Someday, a
DNA chip that costs less than $100 could take the place of a barrage of current
tests, said Pat Brown, an associate biochemistry professor at Stanford who also
was part of the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "The actual technology is cheap, very cheap," he said.

<HEADLINE> Small Babies May Earn Less Later  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies born smaller than normal tend to have lower incomes
as adults but are just as likely as those of normal birth weight to be employed,
married and satisfied with their lives, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   A study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association linked
the lower incomes to lower achievement in school, which led to lower-paying,
blue-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies have linked low birth weight to problems with brain
development in children.
</P>
<P>
	   But those studies did not track low birth-weight babies past mid-childhood,
said Dr. Richard Strauss, the study's lead researcher and assistant professor of
pediatrics at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School.
</P>
<P>
	   The study tracked about 1,000 full-term babies who weighed less than about
5.5 pounds at birth in Britain in 1970. They were examined at ages 10, 16 and 26
and compared with normal-size babies born the same year.
</P>
<P>
	   The adults born small earned about 10 percent less, and those who had normal
birth weights were twice as likely to become professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   At age 26, no differences were seen between the normal and low birth-weight
adults in years of education, hours worked, marital status, satisfaction with
life and perception of standard of living.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers are "really getting at the issues that parents want to
know," said Dr. Marie McCormick, head of maternal and child health at the
Harvard School of Public Health. "People think these problems give you a really
poor quality of life, but this shows that they don't feel that way."

<HEADLINE> Pedophile Ex-priest Goes Free  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest convicted of child molestation
left jail after a judge ruled his detention on a later charge violated terms of
a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert Gauthe, 59, first pleaded guilty in 1985 to 33 charges involving 11
boys, but he admitted that he had molested dozens of others. In exchange for his
guilty plea, prosecutors had given Gauthe immunity from any other charges
involving children molested before 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   He was released in 1995 after serving 10 years of a 20-year sentence. But
Gauthe was arrested two years later, charged with raping a 12-year-old girl in
1982.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, a judge ruled that Gauthe's 1997 arrest and detention pending
trial had violated his earlier plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The former priest didn't speak to reporters as he stepped into a relative's
car outside jail on Wednesday. He was headed toward Texas, escorted by sheriff's
deputies as security, said his attorney G. Paul Marx.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if his client planned to sue for false imprisonment, Marx
replied: ``My reading on him is he's real sorry for all the trouble he's caused
in this part of the state for so many years and would just as soon not come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthe is still on seven years of probation for fondling a 3-year-old boy in
1996, the year after he was released from prison. Gauthe pleaded no contest to
the child injury charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Lafayette Parish District Attorney Mike Harson, who charged Gauthe in 1997,
said prosecutors who negotiated the 1985 agreement never meant for Gauthe to be
let out of prison early.
</P>
<P>
	   State law at the time gave most convicts one day off of their sentences for
each day of good behavior in prison. The law has since been changed to require
sexual or violent offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentences.

<HEADLINE> Study: Dying Kids Suffer Needlessly  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Childhood cancer was an almost certain death sentence 30 years ago, with
nine of every 10 victims succumbing to the disease. The death rate has dropped
to one in four, but researchers say many of those who die suffer more than they
have to.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason, according to a new study, is that doctors try so hard to cure
the children they don't pay enough attention to easing symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is very difficult, especially in the late stages of a difficult
struggle, to focus on relieving the pain and balancing that with whatever
treatments may still exist," said Chris Hoefflin, whose son, Michael, died from
brain cancer in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoefflin, of Santa Clarita, Calif., said doctors did everything they could
to ease Michael's suffering. But, he said, "I think pain care and psychological
care is still an area that needs more attention. For the kids and also for the
parents."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joanne Wolfe, the lead author of the study published today in the New
England Journal of Medicine, is among those working for such change.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe is an instructor in pediatric oncology at Harvard University and at
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital, which conducted the
study.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers talked to parents of 103 children who died of cancer between
1990 and 1997. They were told that 92 had suffered "a great deal" or "a lot"
from at least one symptom. More than half had suffered significantly from at
least three symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatigue, pain, trouble breathing and poor appetite were the most common
complaints. Nausea and vomiting, constipation and diarrhea were next. More than
80 percent of the children hurt. Most were treated for the pain, but only 27
percent of those felt better.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty of the children were still getting cancer treatments, such as
radiation, chemotherapy or a bone-marrow transplant, in their last month alive.
Seven died in the bone-marrow transplant unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For most children with cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to achieve
a cure," Wolfe wrote. "Considerations of the toxicity of the therapy, the
quality of life, and growth and development are usually secondary to this goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Suzanne Mintz, president and co-founder of the National Family Caregivers
Association, said she wasn't surprised by the findings. She said other studies
have found that many people die in pain.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings indicate that doctors "were pushing for a cure even to the end,
not knowing exactly when to stop," said Marilyn Hockenberry-Eaton, an associate
professor of pediatric hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine and
director of nurse practitioners at Texas Children's Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   She praised the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have created very successful treatments for childhood cancer, but on the
way, something's had to go," she said. One of those things, she said, is a focus
on relieving symptoms of terminally ill children.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like its overlooked, but it's not emphasized," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hockenberry-Eaton said parents often do not want their children to get
opiates for pain, either because they are afraid of addiction, or because it
seems to represent acknowledgment that the disease is terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a number of studies have found "suboptimal" quality of care for
dying adults, high-quality care to relieve symptoms is now an expected standard,
Wolfe wrote. The researchers looked at whether the care of children with cancer
met that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Early findings from the study prompted Dana-Farber and Children's to set up
a team in 1997 to help parents, doctors and nurses ease the hurt for dying
children.
</P>
<P>
	   The team created discussion groups and a worksheet to help parents, doctors
and nurses recognize symptoms and treat them. It is working on a diary to help
parents keep track of the symptoms and treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   It has helped parents figure out how to let a toddler visit her dying
brother, also a toddler, without scarring her emotionally. And with the same
parents, the team discussed the painful question of when to stop treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people think that will extend life, but in this case it would
only have increased his suffering," said Janet Duncan, an oncology nurse at
Children's. "So the family was able to do that, and make handprints with him
that they could keep, and really be together to say their goodbyes."

<HEADLINE> Solution Sought in Northern Ireland  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Faced with a crisis over the Irish
Republican Army's refusal to disarm, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland
are hoping to find a way to prevent the collapse of the fledgling
Protestant-Catholic administration in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland scheduled an emergency
summit today in a bid to save the four-party coalition, which faces suspension
or collapse just nine weeks after receiving considerable powers from Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, insist
they had agreed to accept the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party as Cabinet colleagues
only on condition that the IRA responded rapidly by cooperating with a
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the IRA promptly met the commission's chairman, Canadian Gen. John
de Chastelain, a still-confidential report from the general presented this week
to Blair and Ahern confirmed that disarmament has not begun.
</P>
<P>
	   That has left the Ulster Unionists warning they will have to resign their
Cabinet posts, probably by next week. Their party grassroots only narrowly voted
to form the Cabinet on an experimental basis and in expectation that the IRA
would respond.
</P>
<P>
	   The dilemma facing Blair and Ahern is how to keep the Ulster Unionists in
the Cabinet even though no imminent act of IRA disarmament appears to be on
offer. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble faces a potential revolt at the
party's next internal meeting Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's most likely recourse -- to reverse the recently transferred
powers, leaving the Cabinet powerless but intact -- is being sternly criticized
by both Sinn Fein and the Cabinet's main Catholic-supported party, the pacifist
Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahern and Blair were expected to meet somewhere in southwest England in the
afternoon. Blair's secretary for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, was expected
to then announce the government's intentions in Parliament, though this could be
delayed if the two governments couldn't agree on the strategy ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahern spent two hours Wednesday discussing the prospects for IRA
disarmament, and the potential fallout from a Cabinet suspension, with a Sinn
Fein delegation led by party leader Gerry Adams. The Irish side reportedly was
pressing for an unambiguous IRA statement promising it would disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Adams insisted that he remained personally committed to securing
the gradual scrapping of the IRA's network of arms dumps -- a goal that the 1998
accord expected to be completed by this May -- but that the IRA wasn't inclined
to meet Ulster Unionist demands.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the consequence of requiring a start to IRA disarmament now or
suspending the Cabinet, in which Sinn Fein holds two of the 12 posts, would be
``disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP and the Cabinet's top Catholic
minister, said de Chastelain had been appointed chairman of the disarmament
commission in 1997 and it was reasonable to ask the IRA that if it ever intended
to disarm, ``why not now?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``To refuse when everything else of substance within the Good Friday accord
has been implemented or put in train fuels the reasonable suspicion -- and not
just in unionist minds -- that the IRA as an organization is incapable of
renouncing violence or the threat of violence for political purposes,'' Mallon
said.

<HEADLINE> Austria Govt. Decision Near  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president has made it unmistakably clear
he doesn't want to approve a new government including Joerg Haider's far-right
anti-immigrant party. But he admits he has little choice.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil is expected to confirm the coalition today, despite
a growing wave of threats and protests from abroad against a government with
Haider's Freedom party.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to spare Austria international isolation, Klestil has
requested Haider and Wolfgang Schuessel, head of the conservative People's Party
and the likely new chancellor, sign a ``declaration of values of European
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first fallout came Wednesday, when Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak
called Haider ``dangerous'' to democracy and recalled his country's ambassador
from Vienna for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
	   At home, outrage over the proposed coalition spilled into the streets
Wednesday. Police said some 15,000 people rallied in the evening in front of the
People's Party headquarters to protest the coalition deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prove yourself to be a patriot,'' theater producer Andre Heller told the
crowd in remarks directed to Schuessel. ``No alliance with meanness. No alliance
with right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   But no one seemed to be able the stop the players involved.
</P>
<P>
	   In a meeting that ended after midnight today, the executive committee of
Schuessel's Austrian People's Party adopted the coalition agreement with only
one dissenting vote. The Freedom Party had endorsed it unanimously a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither party has confirmed the makeup of the government under the coalition
deal reached Tuesday. The Austria Press Agency reported the posts would be split
evenly between the two parties, with Schuessel as chancellor and a Freedom Party
member as vice chancellor. Haider was not expected to take a Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry would go to a member of the People's Party, the agency
said. The Interior Ministry is responsible for immigration and the police --
high priorities for the Freedom Party, which wants to restrict immigration and
has a tough law and order image.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published Thursday, Klestil took the unusual step of sharply
criticizing both Haider and Schuessel. Still, he said he had to follow the
results of Oct. 3 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a democracy, a parliamentary majority must be respected,'' Klestil
said. ``Personal sensitivities do not count.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Should I swear in this government, I wouldn't do it out of personal
conviction, because I fear that international damage will be inflicted upon
Austria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That fear is shared by other politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Van der Bellen, the widely respected leader of the Greens party,
called Haider a ``stubborn repeat offender'' and expressed dismay over Haider's
``undifferentiated'' attacks against ``our friends and neighbors'' in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to Klestil, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
president rejected some of the Cabinet nominees put forward by Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety around a decade ago by praising Adolf
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against the EU's expansion and has predicted the
new government will impose a nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   With an agreement between Haider and Schuessel in place, attention has
shifted to President Klestil, a courtly 67-year-old former career diplomat.
Although his post is largely ceremonial, the president must swear in a new
government.
</P>
<P>
	   In principle, Klestil could reject the coalition and even call new
elections, although such a move would be unprecedented in Austria's post-World
War II history.
</P>
<P>
	   In October's parliament vote, the Freedom Party took second place, closely
followed by the People's Party. The leading Social Democrats failed to agree on
a coalition with the People's Party.

<HEADLINE> Garcia Wins in MLB Arbitration Case  </HEADLINE>
   By RONALD BLUM
AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   For the first time in four years, baseball players opened salary
arbitration with a win.
</P>
<P>
	   Karim Garcia beat the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday and will get
his $700,000 request instead of the team's $470,000 offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia, 24, hit .240 last year with 14 homers and 32 RBIs in 288
at-bats and made $270,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time players opened with a win was 1996, when they
began arbitration 4-0. Rick Shapiro argued the case for Garcia and
Houston Astros president Tal Smith for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
	   Arbitrators Robert Light, Richard Kasher and Jack Clarke, who
heard arguments Tuesday, made the decision overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakland right-hander Ariel Prieto, who hasn't pitched in the
major leagues since April 1998, was the only player to go to a
hearing Wednesday, asking for a raise from $210,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Athletics countered at $300,000. A decision was expected
today from Stephen Goldberg, James Gross and Ted High. All cases
are being heard by three-person panels this year in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Prieto, 30, is recovering from reconstructive elbow and shoulder
surgery and hasn't pitched in the major leagues since April 19,
1998. He was Oakland's opening day starter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Three players who filed for arbitration agreed to contracts
Wednesday. Milwaukee right-hander Juan Acevedo got a two-year deal
worth $1,625,000, Detroit catcher Gregg Zaun got a $525,000,
one-year contract, and New York Mets pinch-hitter Matt Franco got a
$462,500, one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty players remain in arbitration, with hearings scheduled
through Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Among free agents, the Yankees agreed to a minor league contract
with 33-year-old infielder Rafael Bournigal, who would get a
$500,000, one-year contract if he makes the team.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, he hit .274 with two homers and 14 RBIs in 95 at-bats
with the Seattle Mariners. New York has been looking for a backup
infielder to replace D'Angelo Jimenez, who fractured a bone in his
neck in a car crash last week and is not expected to play again
until the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Outfielder Darren Bragg, released St. Louis in December, agreed
to a one-year contract with Colorado. Right-hander Julio Santana,
released by Boston in December, agreed to a minor league contract
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the San Diego Padres reversed course and ended their minor
league contract with outfielder Danny Tartabull, who wanted bonuses
based on games played rather than started. Instead, the Padres are
closing in on a deal with third baseman Ed Sprague.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Depending on what happens, he could find his way into the
starting lineup,'' general manager Kevin Towers said. ``He's got to
realize that he could be a role player, but (manager Bruce) Bochy's
the type of guy who's going to go with the best nine.''
</P>
<P>
	   In other baseball news, Arizona put reliever Bobby Chouinard on
waivers at the pitcher's request.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old right-hander, 5-2 last season with a 2.68 ERA in
32 appearances, faces 5-15 years in prison if convicted of charges
he choked and slapped his wife, Erica, on Christmas night and
pointed a loaded handgun at her head as she pleaded for him not to
shoot her.
</P>
<P>
	   If no team claims Chouinard by Friday, he would become a free
agent and receive $32,967, which is 30 days termination pay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't want to go into training camp with anything hanging
over heads -- for him, for us, for everyone involved,'' owner Jerry
Colangelo said. ``That's no way to go into a camp situation, so one
way or another this would have been resolved before training
camp.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the first round of the playoffs, Chouinard gave up the
game-winning grand slam to Edgardo Alfonzo in the ninth inning of
the New York Mets' 8-4 victory over the Diamondbacks in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am receiving counseling to resolve some difficult and
regrettable problems,'' he said in a statement issued by the team.
``In the best interests of my family and of baseball, I have asked
the Diamondbacks to release me so that I can concentrate on
continuing to work on my personal and family issues.''

<HEADLINE> Cadillac Back in Sports Car Racing  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE HARRIS-
AP Motorsports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Cadillac is returning to sports car racing after a
50-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
	The Cadillac Northstar LMP sports car was to make its debut today at Daytona
International Speedway, the opening day of practice and qualifying for the Rolex
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	``They definitely have put together the best looking race car out there,'' said
Wayne Taylor, a former Daytona and Sebring 12-hour winner who will drive one of
two Cadillacs entered in the 24-hour event Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	The last time Cadillac raced was in 1950 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where
Briggs Cunningham drove a specially built car and a near-stock Coupe de Ville.
The purpose-built race car, driven by Cunningham and Phil Walters, finished 11th
despite skidding into a sand pit. Sam and Miles Collier drove the Coupe de Ville
to 10th.
</P>
<P>
	An English race car, the Allard J2, used a Cadillac V8 engine in the 1950 Le
Mans and finished third.
</P>
<P>
	The marketing strategy for General Motors' luxury division didn't include
racing, and Cadillac dropped out after that event. However, to help market the
new Northstar engine, the company felt it was time to get back into the sport.
</P>
<P>
	The new cars are being built by Riley &AMP; Scott in Indianapolis, which also
builds its own sports cars and chassis for the Indy Racing League. The cars will
be powered by a 4.0-liter version of Cadillac's 32-valve Northstar V8 engine
with dual turbochargers.
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be involved with the biggest car manufacturer in the world,''
Taylor said. ``When you say the word Cadillac, it really gets people's
attention. I feel that with the commitment GM has put into this program that
it's the best place to be. Their goal is to win Le Mans, and that's one race
that I haven't won.''
</P>
<P>
	The South African-born racer will share the cockpit of one of the Cadillacs
with Italian Max Angelelli and Eric van de Poele of Belgium. The second entry
will be co-driven by Butch Leitzinger, Frank Lagorce and Andy Wallace of
England.
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say the Cadillac is the most solid car I've ever driven right out
of the box,'' said Leitzinger, who was part of the winning Dyson Racing team
last year.
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually like driving a production Cadillac down pit road because it
runs like a street car at low (engine) revs and it doesn't have the shakes and
rattles that a new car usually has.''
</P>
<P>
	The season-opening sports car endurance event will also be the first race for
the new Grand American Road Racing Association, a sports car sanctioning body
formed by International Speedway Corp. ISC also owns and operates NASCAR and
several racetracks, including Daytona.
</P>
<P>
	One-hundred cars in five classes, including 23 in the top SportsRacer division,
have been entered. About 80 of them are expected to start the race on Saturday.
The balance of the classes are GT, GTO, GTU and American GT.
</P>
<P>
	Besides the two Cadillacs, the top division will include five Ferrari 333SPs
and several Riley &AMP; Scott Mark IIIs.
</P>
<P>
	The defending champions have entered the Riley &AMP; Scott that carried them to a
win last year and might also debut a Ford Reynard 2KQ. Rob Dyson's driving
lineup will include James Weaver of England, Elliott Forbes-Robinson, CART star
Max Papis and John Paul Jr.
</P>
<P>
	Today's qualifying session includes all classes, with the top 35 cars locking
up starting positions in the race. The rest of the field will be set in
qualifying Friday.

Witnesses Describe Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Moments before it crashed, Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 started "tumbling, spinning, nose-down" as it hurtled toward the
Pacific Ocean, a federal investigator said Wednesday. The MD-83 jetliner was in
one piece and there were no signs of fire or smoke when it hit the water,
killing all 88 people aboard, witnesses told investigators with the National
Transportation Safety Board. As it passed over Anacapa Island, just off the
Southern California coast, a witness heard several popping sounds, watched the
plane turn, then plunge into the Santa Barbara Channel, NTSB member John
Hammerschmidt said.

<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president has made it unmistakably clear
he doesn't want to approve a new government including Joerg Haider's far-right
anti-immigrant party. But he admits he has little choice. President Thomas
Klestil is expected to confirm the coalition Thursday, despite a growing wave of
threats and protests from abroad against a government with Haider's Freedom
party. In an attempt to spare Austria international isolation, Klestil has
requested Haider and Wolfgang Schuessel, head of the conservative People's Party
and the likely new chancellor, sign a "declaration of values of European

<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A tribunal sentenced eight people to life in
prison Wednesday in the death of a crusading journalist, ending a case that
shocked Argentines and drew international outrage. A three-judge panel found
three former provincial police officers, a former security guard and four
civilians guilty of killing Jose Luis Cabezas, an investigative photojournalist.
A fourth police officer was sentenced to four years on a fraud charge related to
the case. The 36-year-old photographer had been shadowing Alfredo Yabran, a
camera-shy businessman whose links to government officials and vast business
empire had come under question.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a major increase in
federal spending to combat global warming and pollution, along with new tax

technology, White House officials said Wednesday. In his upcoming budget
request, Clinton will ask Congress for $2.4 billion for various initiatives
designed to reduce the harmful effect of global climate change, said Roger
Ballantine, White House environmental adviser. The mount is more than 40 percent

Small Babies May Earn Less Later
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies born smaller than normal tend to have lower incomes
as adults but are just as likely as those of normal birth weight to be employed,
married and satisfied with their lives, researchers say. A study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association linked the lower incomes to lower
achievement in school, which led to lower-paying, blue-collar jobs. Previous
studies have linked low birth weight to problems with brain development in
children.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, still seeking to slow the

a fourth time since June by pushing a key interest rate up a quarter point to
5.75 percent today. The Fed action to boost its federal funds rate, the interest

<HEADLINE> South Rises in Recruiting Wars 2000  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD ROSENBLATT AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   When recruiting's version of the two-minute drill ended, Florida and Florida
State came away feeling like champions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gators landed nearly every player they wanted on Wednesday and were
rewarded by recruiting wizards as the team with the best group of high school
hotshots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Florida was No. 1 going in and came out with a bunch of stars to make the
choice pretty easy," Tom Lemming of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Prep Football Report
said Wednesday, the first day players were able to sign letters of intent.
</P>
<P>
	   "A landslide for the Gators, an easy win," Allen Wallace, publisher of
Laguna Beach, Calif.-based SuperPrep magazine, said. "What an incredible day
they had."
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State, though, made a tremendous surge by signing no less than seven
top prospects who entered the day with several schools on their mind. Best among
the group was Travis Johnson, a Parade and USA Today All-American defensive end
from Sherman Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson also considered Michigan and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wow! What a great player he is," Odell Haggins, the Seminoles' defensive
line coach, said as he laid eyes on the fax with Johnson's signature.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden also beat out his son, Clemson coach Tommy
Bowden, for three players, including wide receiver Michael Boulware from
Columbia, S.C. Boulware is the brother of former Seminoles All-American Peter
Boulware.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's just as well," Bobby Bowden said, smiling, "because I don't like him
(Tommy) much anyway. What I had to do was try to get the parents to understand
he was the only one of my children who lies a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   Kidding aside, Florida led the way in Recruiting Wars 2000 with an incoming
class led by quarterback Brock Berlin, USA Today's offensive player of the year,
and All-American linebacker Darrell Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Gators landed five Sunshine staters who were up for grabs
-- defensive backs Cory Bailey (Hialeah) and Tre Orr (Lake City), and offensive
linemen Jonathan Colon (6-6, 285, Miami), Max Starks (6-8, 340, Orlando) and
Kevin Deaton (6-4, 290, Merritt Island). They also plucked two away from the
state of Georgia -- defensive tackle Kenny Parker (6-4, 300) and wide receiver
Kelvin Kight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did get most all the guys we went after this year," Spurrier said. "A
few weeks ago, I didn't think we were recruiting enough players to sign 21 or
22. But it seemed like they all wanted to come play for the Gators this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Bobby Burton of Austin, Texas- based The National Recruiting Advisor also
gave the No. 1 nod to Florida, while Max Emfinger of Covington, La.-based
National Blue Chips had Tennessee first with the Gators a close second. Alabama,
Florida State, Penn State and Texas also showed up in at least one of the four
recruiting gurus' top-5 lists.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tennessee signed some of the most dominant players in the country,"
Emfinger said. "They have two top quarterbacks already getting ready for spring
training and they signed two top wide receivers today in Tony Brown and Rashad
Baker."
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterbacks Casey Clausen and John Rattay, brother of Louisiana Tech's Tim
Rattay, made early commitments and are set to take part in the Vols' spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
	   So is the 6-1, 190-pound Berlin, the Gators' prize recruit from Shreveport,
La., who threw for 4,219 yards and 36 TDs in his senior year at Evangel
Christian. In four years, his team was 60-0 with four state titles.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a perfect season and national championship, the Seminoles weren't on
many top 10 lists -- until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the day ended, Florida State was third on the lists of Emfinger
and Wallace, fourth on Lemming's and seventh on Burton's. Burton said the
Seminoles began the day rated 24th on his list.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Johnson, Florida State also grabbed two other homegrown
All-Americans on Wednesday -- defensive back Bryant McFadden (Hollywood) and
linebacker Eric Moore (Pahokee). All-American defensive back Yohance Buchanan
(Atlanta) made good on an earlier verbal commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker D.J. Williams, the consensus defensive player of the year from
Concord, Calif., did not sign Wednesday. He was said to be considering Florida
State, Michigan and California.
</P>
<P>
	   The four recruiting experts agreed it was a big year for Southern teams,
specifically the Southeastern Conference. Alabama joined Florida and Tennessee
with an impressive signing class.
</P>
<P>
	   "The South is cleaning up," Lemming, who had Florida, Tennessee and Alabama
1-2-3 on his top 10 list. Among the Crimson Tide's best prospects were
All-American defensive tackles Albert Means and Anthony Bryant.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan and Notre Dame, usually top 10 finishers, didn't fare so well. The
Wolverines lost out on several players, including All-American wide receiver
Charles Rogers from Saginaw, Mich., who chose Michigan State, and All-American
offensive lineman Kwame Harris, who signed with Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irish didn't have a marquee player in their incoming class, says
Emfinger. They didn't even sign Starks, the son of former Notre Dame star Ross
Browner, who chose the Gators instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were about 15th -- the problem is they don't have a difference maker,
a 7 in my ratings," Emfinger said. "They have some 6s and 5s and they also
signed four quarterbacks. What are they going to do with all of them?"
</P>
<P>
	   Irish coach Bob Davie said he planned it that way. Jarious Jackson is gone
and Eric Chappell has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quarterback, no question that was a priority for us," Davie, whose team
went 5-7 in '99, said. The quarterbacks are Matt LoVecchio, Jared Clark, Carlyle
Holiday and Abram Elam, who also plays defensive back.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Wednesday, Penn State coach Joe Paterno had himself a No. 1 class --
no one spectacular, but a solid all-around group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Penn State dictated the process for seven months," Wallace said, "and
Florida took over on signing day."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Nittany Lions signees were quarterbacks Zac Wasserman of Westlake
Village, Calif., and Zack Mills of Ijamsville, Md. Also, Wallace noted six
linemen who made his All-America team -- Jeremiah Davis of Annandale, Va.; Scott
Davis of Parkersburg, W.Va.; Sam Ruhe of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio; Erik Noll of
Gaithersburg, Md.; Dan Acri of Harrisburg, Pa.; and Jason Robinson of
Swedesboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas, the winner of last year's recruiting fight, had another strong year.
The Longhorns grabbed homegrown receivers B.J. Johnson (South Grand Prairie);
Roy Williams (Odessa), Sloan Thomas (Klein) and Brock Edwards (Fort Worth).
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee also signed 6-7, 285-pound offensive lineman Michael Munoz of
Cincinnati, son of NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz.
</P>
<P>
	   And finally, Virginia Tech benefited a bit from its ride to the national
title game against Florida State with a better than average class, according to
Burton.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Tech's top signees were Jonathan Dunn, a 6-6, 300-pound offensive
lineman from Virginia Beach; Richard Johnson, a wide receiver from Baltimore,
and Jason Lallis, a 6-2, 235-pound defensive end-tight end from Mitchellville,
Md.

<HEADLINE> No Feud Between Greene and Boldon  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL-
AP Track Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Feud? What feud?
</P>
<P>
	The one between Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it never happened.
</P>
<P>
	The purported disagreement between the two world-class sprinters and HSI
teammates grew out of a story in the Trinidad Express.
</P>
<P>
	``I gave an interview ... to let the people of Trinidad and Tobago know about
what's happening with me,'' said Boldon, a native of that country. ``I was asked
if there would be any `tag-teaming' with me and Maurice this year.
</P>
<P>
	``I said it will be every man for himself. I will do things independently off
the track. I said sprinters have to get self-centered, because this year is all
about gold medals.
</P>
<P>
	``The story was blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
	It became so magnified that even Boldon's family got concerned.
</P>
<P>
	``It got to the point where my mother called, and Maurice and I were sitting on
the floor watching the Sugar Bowl,'' Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world record-holder and two-time world champion in the 100 meters,
and Boldon, the 1997 world champion at 200 meters, are still very close. They
train together and socialize occasionally.
</P>
<P>
	And Friday night, they will line up side-by-side for the 60 meters at the
Millrose Games in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
	Greene, an accomplished indoor runner who holds the 60-meter world record of
6.39 seconds, is leery about predicting another record in his season's debut.
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to put on a show like I always do at Millrose,'' Greene, the two-time
defending champion, said.
</P>
<P>
	Greene is excited about the new Mondo surface that has replaced the wooden
boards at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
	``When you set a world record, it's not necessarily the surface,'' he said.
``I'm not going in thinking about a world record. But the surface is going to
help. Mondo? Wow!''
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, less of an indoor specialist, normally would skip the Millrose Games,
but he is coming back from an injury and wants to get the feel of competition
again.
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a good job of rehabbing,'' Boldon said of the strained hamstring
that forced him to miss the latter part of the 1999 outdoor season, including
the World Championships at Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
	``I've tested it in practice. But there will be a difference between
competition and practice. The purpose of my running the indoor season is to get
back into competition and not get stale.''
</P>
<P>
	The injury, the first major one of Boldon's career, caused him much
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't missed a meet before,'' Boldon, 26, said. ``I've been on the circuit
since I was 18. But I couldn't walk faster than average speed. It was difficult.
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it could be career-threatening because it was very painful.''
</P>
<P>
	Boldon will run 3-4 indoor meets -- all in Europe -- after Millrose, then go to
Australia, before returning to his Los Angeles training base and prepare for his
first outdoor meet, the Mount San Antonio Relays at Walnut, Calif., in April.
</P>
<P>
	Boldon already has seen the Olympic stadium in Sydney, and was dismayed by the
intense wind.
</P>
<P>
	``The wind is all wrong,'' he said. ``It blows directly down the straight where
we run. It's similar to Barcelona because of the wind. I'll run to win. Time
will matter the least.''
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who had a full 1999 season, will compete once in Europe, then join
Boldon in Australia. Unlike Boldon, who will not compete in Australia, Greene
plans to run a couple of races, mainly to get used to the surroundings and
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was great, but I have to do even better this year,'' said Greene,
who set the world 100-meter record of 9.79 in 1999 and won gold medals in the
100, 200 and 400 relay at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
	Greene also then will compete at Mount SAC, as he and Boldon step up their
preparations for a possible showdown at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try and impress the world even more this year,'' Greene said.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Tennessee 72, No. 1 UConn 71  </HEADLINE>
    By DONNA TOMMELLEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Lady Vols were six points down and one
step ahead of their coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Summitt's team was trailing 34-28 at halftime Wednesday night against
top-ranked Connecticut when she saw that someone had already written the phrase
"box out" on the locker room board. Junior Kyra Elzy fessed up. She and her
Tennessee teammates knew that rebounding would get them back in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols (17-3) rallied with a dozen points off second chances in the
final period and got a game-winning jumper from Semeka Randall with 4 seconds
left to beat UConn 72-71. It was the Huskies' first loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing you don't want to do is fall apart," Summitt said. "We came
together."
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies held Randall to four points in the first half. Randall, the
emotional leader of the team, didn't get her first field goal until 13 minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second half, the Lady Vols needed rebounds and they needed Randall.
</P>
<P>
	   They got both.
</P>
<P>
	   She finished with 17 points and got six points in the final two minutes in
the second meeting of the women's basketball powerhouses this year. The Lady
Vols reversed a 74-67 loss to Connecticut (19-1) in Knoxville on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamika Catchings led all players with 13 rebounds for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Double-teamed down the stretch, Randall split two defenders and made the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got a good look. I took the shot, I didn't think twice, I just went with
my instinct," Randall said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw the look in her eyes," Catchings said. "Whenever she gets a look like
that, I know it's going to go in."
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies had one more chance. Svetlana Abrosimova took the inbounds pass
and got the ball to Tamika Williams. Guarded by Michelle Snow, Williams' shot
bounced off the bottom of the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   "She bumped into me," Snow said. "I saw it go up and I thought 'I hope
not."'
</P>
<P>
	   Williams said the play was designed for Abrosimova to drive to the basket,
but she drew two defenders as she neared the lane and passed to Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just happened to come to me," Williams said. "I just have to take it up
stronger."
</P>
<P>
	   There always has been little room for error in the rivalry, which took root
in 1995 when the Huskies beat the Lady Vols in the regular season to gain the
No. 1 ranking. They met again in the national championship game, and UConn came
away with its only national title and a 35-0 season. The Lady Vols have won six
national titles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time we made a mistake, they made us pay for it. We reacted like a
young team. We let them keep going on their roll,' Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma said. "It was fitting it came down to the last shot."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols trailed by as many as 13 in the first half. Catchings scored
five points, starting a 15-0 run that extended into the first two minutes of the
second half and gave Tennessee its first lead at 36-34.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hope was in the end we could just hang on and make plays," Summitt
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catchings had 11 of her 19 points in the second half, including two free
throws midway through the half that gave the Lady Vols their largest lead at
63-54.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams then scored nine of the Huskies' next 12 points as Connecticut took
a 66-65 lead with 3:46 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Randall finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams led the Huskies with 19 points, and Sue Bird had 15 points and
eight assists.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Plane Spun Before Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Moments before it crashed, Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 started ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down'' as it hurtled in a violent
plunge toward the Pacific Ocean, a federal investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no signs of fire or smoke when the jetliner hit the water in one
piece, killing all 88 people aboard, witnesses told the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt provided the witness accounts after the
second day of investigation by the agency, which is trying to determine the
cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB will also rely on radar data, information from the ``black boxes''
and a photograph to piece together the terrifying few minutes between the
pilots' first report of mechanical problems and the plane's crash in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, searchers recovered the cockpit voice recorder. The
device, which records conversations and other sounds in the cockpit, was found
in 700 feet of water by a remote-controlled robot shortly before sundown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As luck would have it, almost literally true, as soon as they got down to
the bottom they found the first box,'' said Navy Capt. Terry Labrecque.
</P>
<P>
	   The search continued for the flight data recorder, a companion box that
records information about the plane's mechanical operation. Searchers had heard
a ping that they believed pinpointed the box's location on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before it crashed Monday, Flight 261 reported problems with part of
the tail called the horizontal stabilizer and was cleared for an emergency
landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Still a mystery is what exactly went wrong with the plane's tail controls
and what the pilots did to try to fix it as the plane hugged the Southern
California coast on its way to San Francisco and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   As it passed over Anacapa Island, just off the coast, a witness heard
several popping sounds, watched the plane turn, then hit the ocean,
Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft was twisting, flying erratically, nose rocking,'' the witness
told investigators, Hammerschmidt said. Pilots in the vicinity described the
plane as ``tumbling, spinning, nose-down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and
inverted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there was a new report the plane had mechanical problems on
its flight down to Puerto Vallarta. The Seattle Times reported there were
problems with the horizontal stabilizer on the flight to Mexico. The stabilizer
keeps the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle denied the report: ``We
stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware of any
maintenance anomalies with this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the board was looking into the earlier flight and would
interview the pilots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Flight 261 crashed, the pilots also radioed a Seattle maintenance
crew about the problem, and the NTSB on Wednesday began analyzing recordings of
that call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said in
Washington, D.C. ``It's going to be very important to this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to return to Phoenix 20 minutes after it took off for Dallas Wednesday. The
plane is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them, said Phil Frame, a spokesman for the NTSB in
Washington. Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the
Alaska Airlines investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the search for survivors was called off over the protest
of some family members who held out hope that someone might still be alive in
the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the relatives were staying at a Los Angeles hotel, where they met
with Red Cross counselors and were briefed on the search by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, the Navy took over control from the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other remote-control submersibles like Scorpio were either on scene or
en route, as well as ships with side-scan sonar equipment that can make detailed
maps of debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down -- well below the 300-foot limit for
safe operation by divers -- and most of the bodies are believed pinned in the
debris on the bottom of the ocean. Searchers have recovered the remains of only
four passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Ventura County Coroner's office said it could take months
before body parts of all of the victims are identified.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Union Agrees To Delay Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Engineers and technical workers have rejected The Boeing
Co.'s latest contract offers, but agreed Wednesday to return to contract talks
next week after the federal government's top negotiator offered to sit at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
had threatened to strike Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said workers were being asked not to stage a wildcat
walkout, but that their members were so angry over the contract talks, some
might walk out anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   In mail-in ballots counted Wednesday night, engineers voted 3,308 to 3,173
to reject Boeing's latest three-year contract offer, said Bill Dugovich,
spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or
SPEEA. Technical workers also rejected Boeing's offer to them, 3,374 to 2,039.
</P>
<P>
	   The union will continue with strike preparations, and will take renewed
negotiations "a day at a time," Dugovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding said talks with the company
would resume Monday and Tuesday with Richard Barnes, head of the federal
Mediation and Conciliation Services agency, sitting at the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said Barnes's offer to join the talks was highly unusual and that
he should be given a chance to help resolve the contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very hard decision to make," Bofferding said of calling off
immediate strike plans and opting for more talks. "We think it would be a shame
to not give the strength and power they (workers) have exerted already a chance
to succeed and give them the contract they deserve."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company agreed to resume talks to
"honor the request" of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we hope the meeting on Monday is constructive ... our participation
in the meeting should not imply to anyone that Boeing intends to make additional
proposals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike preparations have been under way for more than two weeks, and SPEEA
headquarters has at least 500 "On Strike" signs ready for picketers, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not stopping this strike forever," SPEEA President Craig Buckham
said. "We're simply giving this new turn of events a chance to succeed. We hope
it will, but we're not throwing away the signs."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's previous offers for the engineering segment and the technical
workers were rejected by 99 percent and 98 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting on the latest offers began by mail two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents 22,352 Boeing engineers and technicians, though only
about 13,780 of those workers actually are union members.
</P>
<P>
	   In its latest offers, Boeing backed off proposals for mandatory weekend
shifts for some workers. However, the company's offer reduced life insurance
benefits and altered health benefits -- a sticking point with many SPEEA
members.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Boeing offers, professional workers would make a minimum of
$35,000 per year, with a maximum of more than $105,000. Technical workers would
have a minimum of $20,500 with a maximum of $88,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing made its first contract offers Nov. 11. The SPEEA negotiating team
recommended they be voted down and they were rejected Dec. 1, the day the old
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks resumed Dec. 8 and Boeing made its latest offer Jan. 13. The SPEEA
team has recommended approval, but union officials acknowledged it is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Seeks Sixth Straight PGA Win  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Now that he's 20 years old, Sergio Garcia no
longer wants to be called "El Nino." That's not a bad idea at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   No two words have ever caused as much consternation as El Nino, the weather
pattern that seems to batter the Monterey Peninsula right about the time the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am rolls around.
</P>
<P>
	   Only once in the past four years has the tournament gone the distance
without weather problems. It was canceled in 1996, delayed (by seven months) in
1998 and reduced to 54 holes a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I should be known as Sergio," the precocious Spaniard said Wednesday after
a practice round at Spyglass under glorious sunshine. "But I'm the one playing.
I'm not the one up there in the clouds. This 'Nino' is OK, is not going to give
you any problems."
</P>
<P>
	   No guarantees on the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The most popular person at Pebble Beach -- besides Tiger Woods, who is going
for his sixth consecutive PGA Tour victory -- might be Mike McClellan, the
tour's meteorologist this week.
</P>
<P>
	   McClellan has been camped out in a trailer with gadgets on the roof that
look like upside-down mixing bowls, studying six computer models that are
supposed to help him predict whether it will rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
	   "None of them agree," he said Wednesday. "It's been wild."
</P>
<P>
	   The forecast -- but don't hold him to it -- is for the sun to disappear
about the time Woods makes the turn today at Poppy Hills, followed by light rain
and then heavy rain. Friday should be OK, but the weekend "is still up in the
air."
</P>
<P>
	   If recent history at Pebble Beach holds true, there will be at least one
rain delay.
</P>
<P>
	   And if recent history on the PGA Tour runs its course, Woods will walk off
with yet another victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The winning streak began in August and at times appears as though it might
never end.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to take somebody to stuff it in his face a couple of times
coming down the stretch to knock him off," said Davis Love III, who had his
crack at Woods in the Tour Championship and finished four strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
	   A victory this week would be his sixth straight on the PGA Tour -- the
longest since Ben Hogan won six in 1948 -- and would move Woods one step closer
to the record of 11 in a row set by Byron Nelson in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   No one in the last 47 years has won this many in a row. A streak this long
in today's era of so many talented players is bordering on absurd, but no one
will go so far as to say it's impossible -- not when it involves Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything you said wasn't quite possible, he has pretty much done," Love
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Butch Harmon, Woods' coach the past seven years, has seen the swing evolve
into a piece of art the past 20 months. What hasn't changed is Woods' desire to
win, usually with style.
</P>
<P>
	   "He likes the theater," Harmon said. "He likes to be the man."
</P>
<P>
	   Pebble Beach is Woods' first tournament since he went eagle-birdie-birdie to
win the Mercedes Championship over Ernie Els on the second playoff hole, and
it's only his second event of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   But he is quick to remind people that he did play a European tour event at
the end of last year, the Johnnie Walker Classic in Taiwan, and tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if it's six or not," he said. "I'm just counting that I've won
once this year and trying to win two in a row."
</P>
<P>
	   He will agree on this much -- his swing is pure and his confidence is in
orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is pretty high right now because obviously I've had a lot of success
lately," he said. "More importantly, I know how to get it around when I'm not
playing that well. There were times when I didn't play that well and I was able
to get the round in under par, just kind of hang in the tournament. And I was
able to go on to win."
</P>
<P>
	   It might take more than that at Pebble Beach, which will be played with
amateurs over three courses the first three rounds, with no guarantee there will
be a fourth round.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Payne Stewart won without hitting a shot in the final round. It
was washed out by rain -- the third time in four years rain kept the tournament
from going the distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods had planned to play with Michael Jordan, but that fell apart when
Jordan bought part of the Washington Wizards and was put in charge of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can't get off work, even though he's the boss," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Woods and Stanford buddy Jerry Chang will be partners, paired with
Mark O'Meara and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   With a $4 million purse -- the same amount as the Masters last year --
Pebble Beach has its strongest field ever.
</P>
<P>
	   All of them will be gunning for the same guy -- Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is doing some things that are slightly better than the rest of us," Love
said. "We have to try to figure out what that is."

<HEADLINE> Senate Vote on Greenspan Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The robust U.S. economy is performing so well that not
even an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve is enough to rile
politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as the Senate was taking up President Clinton's nomination of Alan
Greenspan to a fourth term as Fed chairman, the central bank announced Wednesday
that it was boosting the borrowing costs of millions of Americans by increasing
its federal funds rate to 5.75 percent, the fourth increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   While some liberal Democratic senators did take to the Senate floor to
denounce the action, they were few in number.
</P>
<P>
	   The overwhelming majority of the Senate strongly supports Greenspan's record
at the Fed, especially in light of the fact that the current expansion set a
record this week as the longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The full Senate was expected to vote today to confirm Greenspan, 73, for
another four-year term as chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a strong case can be made that Alan Greenspan is the greatest
central banker in the history of the world," Senate Banking Committee Chairman
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, a Republican, was first picked to lead the Fed by Ronald Reagan
in 1987. He was renominated by George Bush in 1992 and by Clinton in 1996 and
again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to a group of state legislators Wednesday night, President
Clinton praised Greenspan and said he helped sustain the long economic growth by
not intervening too aggressively in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   While traditional economic theory said the rapid growth would bring high
inflation, "he had the courage to look at the evidence over the arguments of the
past to see that something fundamentally different was going on in our economy,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., praised Greenspan for his "great devotion to
public service," but said he would vote against the nomination because he
believed Greenspan and the Fed were fighting an inflation threat that does not
exist.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, complained during the debate about the Fed's
secrecy and argued that the four rate hikes since June were hurting the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding to
death," Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists, however, warned that the Fed's latest rate increase on
Wednesday is likely to be the first of several this year as the central bank
fights to slow the economy to a more sustainable rate and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed wants to bring this high-flying economy down to a soft landing,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research Corp. "The rate increases
so far haven't really taken a toll on the economy, especially the consumer
sector."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed action to boost its target for the federal funds rate, the interest
that banks charge each other, was quickly followed by announcements from major
banks around the country that they were raising their prime lending rate a
similar quarter point to 8.75 percent, the highest level for this benchmark
consumer and business rate since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., in New York,
predicted that the rate increase this week would be followed by further rate
boosts at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 21 and
again at the May 16 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts said the unrelenting strength of the economy could prompt a
seventh-quarter point move at the June 28 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to boosting the federal funds rate, the Fed increased its
largely symbolic discount rate, the rate the Fed charges to make direct loans to
banks, by a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement announcing the Fed decisions, the policy-makers said they
remained concerned that the strong economy and tight labor markets will produce
rising wage demands that will not be offset by gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion," the Fed said in explaining its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan has expressed growing worries that the dwindling supply of
available workers will eventually force employers to raise product prices to
cover their higher wage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he
expected Friday's unemployment report would show that the jobless rate, already
at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent in December, fell even further to 4 percent in
January, reflecting the economy's strong momentum going into the new year.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Minimum Wage Boost  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A boost in the minimum wage seems likely this election
year, though not without a partisan battle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate kicked off the fight Wednesday, passing a $1-an-hour minimum wage
increase that the White House said was too stingy to workers and also would give
unwarranted tax cuts to some businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-written bill would gradually raise the current $5.15 hourly
minimum wage by $1 by March 2002. The increase was contained in legislation
revamping bankruptcy laws that passed 83-14, although there was no separate vote
on the minimum wage provision.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has yet to pass its own minimum wage legislation because
Republican leaders there lack the votes for a similar proposal. And with
President Clinton and Democrats complaining that the wage increase would take
too long to phase in and opposing small business tax cuts that both GOP packages
include, quick enactment seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't think the actual rise in the minimum wage goes up quickly
enough,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The tax cuts that are put
in there are not paid for and are skewed to those who don't necessarily need tax
cuts at this time.''
</P>
<P>
	   With many Republicans -- especially in the House -- eager to avoid repeated
campaign-season attacks on the widely popular issue, some increase seems likely
to become law before Election Day. House leaders hope for a vote on the issue by
late March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Tuesday when
asked about the minimum wage increase. ``Obviously, we don't have the votes to
stop minimum wage, so we ought to do something that lessens the burden on people
that pay the wages.''
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a GOP bill that
would increase the minimum wage by $1 over three years and cut taxes by $30
billion over five years. Some $16 billion of that price tag is a reduction in
the estate taxes paid by upper-income people who inherit substantial assets.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fate of the House legislation is unclear. With defections likely by
moderate Republicans from urban, Northeastern districts, GOP leaders are short
of the votes needed to move the bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate GOP measure contains $18 billion in tax cuts over five years --
mostly for small business owners.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP's desire to avoid making the proposal a campaign issue gives
Democrats little incentive to quickly settle for anything less than what they
want: a two-year phase-in, with a much smaller tax package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just don't think Republicans will want to mess around with this issue
this year,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``I don't think they will fall on
their swords over the three-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 million Americans are paid the minimum wage. About half of them are
less than 24 years old, and many hold part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   More important to the politics of the issue, however, is the proposal's
popular appeal. In a poll taken last spring for the Wall Street Journal and NBC
News, three-fourths of those questioned favored the $1-an-hour increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The potency of the minimum wage as a campaign issue was last illustrated in
1996, another campaign year. After initial opposition by many Republicans,
Congress finally voted to raise the wage from $4.25 to its current $5.15 in two
steps.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Senate bill would increase the wage by 35 cents an hour in March
2000, by 35 cents more in March 2001 and 30 cents in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The language was added to the bankruptcy bill in November after Democrats
tried unsuccessfully to force their own version into the legislation. The
Democratic alternative would have raised the minimum wage by $1 in two 50-cent
increases over 13 months, while also providing $9.6 billion in tax relief and
raising other taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In a dispute the two parties have fought for decades, Democrats say that
with many Americans flush from the booming economy, the time is ripe to raise
the minimum wage. They say the difference between their version and the GOP
language would cost each minimum-wage earner $1,200.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The watered-down wage proposal in this bill is an insult to hardworking
men and women,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of the Democratic
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers argue that businesses might eliminate up to 500,000 jobs,
rather than increase minimum salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do we get passed a very defensible bill that would not increase the
number of unemployed as dramatically as Kennedy's amendment would do,'' is how
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., described the GOP's task. ``Tax
relief is an important component of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bankruptcy language would make it harder for people to erase credit card
and other debt through bankruptcy. If a debtor is found to have enough income to
pay back at least 25 percent of his or her debts over five years, they would be
required to repay them, rather than allowed to have them abrogated.
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed a similar bankruptcy bill last May. The next step is for
the two chambers to try working out a compromise measure.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Lewis Innocent in Killings  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawyers for Ray Lewis claim that while the All-Pro
linebacker was at the scene of two stabbing deaths, he is innocent of killing
the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors counter that he is still in jeopardy of a possible murder trial
even if didn't wield a knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 24, is charged with two counts of murder in Monday's deaths of
Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth "Shorty" Baker, 21, both of Decatur. He is being
held without bail until at least Feb. 24, and faces life in prison or the death
penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' lawyer, Max Richardson Jr., has acknowledged the Baltimore Ravens
linebacker was at the scene of the incident, but didn't kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Fulton County district attorney said Wednesday that it
doesn't matter whether Lewis actually held the knife -- he can still be tried
for murder if he helped the killer or was involved in the fight that preceded
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
	   "When and if this case goes anywhere, there will be aggravated assault
charges added," spokesman Erik Friedly said. "And someone died as result of the
assault, so felony murder charges are automatic. It's like the lookout in a bank
robbery getting charged with murder if one of the robbers shoots and kills
someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Fulton County associate medical examiner Dr. John Parker said that whoever
fatally stabbed the two men during the brawl "knew what they were doing."
</P>
<P>
	   The wounds were directly to major organs, and both men quickly bled to
death, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of times in a fight with a knife, we'll see just mayhem, people
swinging wildly, abrasions, light cuts, things like that," Parker said. "This
wasn't like that. These were well-directed wounds into vital areas."
</P>
<P>
	   Lollar was declared dead at the scene by police responding to a fight call
in the Buckhead bar district several hours after the Super Bowl ended seven
miles away at the Georgia Dome. Baker was dead on arrival at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said that Baker suffered wounds to both his liver and heart, while
Lollar's wounds were concentrated around his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "A typical pocket knife could do this," Parker said. "Whoever did this knew
exactly where to hit and do the damage ... you could say they knew something
about anatomy."
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday, Atlanta police would not give any further details about the
investigation. Published reports have said that officers are seeking arrest
warrants for at least two of Lewis' friends that were with him Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to witnesses, the two victims were involved in a fight with six
men who fled the scene in a limousine.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have released limousine driver Duane Fossett, according to a
spokeswoman for All Stretched Out Limousine Service, which is based in Glen
Burnie, Md.

	   Fossett returned to the Baltimore area Wednesday after being questioned and
kept in Atlanta on Monday by investigators, said Lorena Cochran.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Fossett was instructed not to speak to anyone about the case, and
that the company's owner, Anthony Toskov, accompanied the limousine back to
Maryland, but would not be available for comment. No one answered the telephone
at Toskov's home.

<P>
	   In Wednesday's editions of The Sun in Baltimore, Toskov said that Fossett
told him that Lewis did not kill the two men.
</P>
<P>
	   Toskov also said that Lewis rented the limo and left Baltimore with some
friends. The group stopped in Charlotte, N.C., to pick up a few more friends en
route to Atlanta, where Lewis made several appearances leading up to Sunday's
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte police said Wednesday that Atlanta police had not contacted them

<HEADLINE> Catfish Farmers Go High-Tech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TCHULA, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi catfish farmers are investing in computer
chips and other high-tech gear to track fish-eating birds from satellites
orbiting Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle against the double-crested cormorants has escalated once again.
The species was once nearly decimated by agricultural chemicals and other
poisons.
</P>
<P>
	   But the birds have bounced back to bite fish farmers in Mississippi and
neighboring states, with the population in interior North America now increasing
by an average of 29 percent a year to up to 1 million birds or more.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are breeding in areas where they have never nested before," said Tommy
King, a biologist at the National Wildlife Research Center in Starkville, an arm
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   The first cormorant nests in more than 50 years were found in Mississippi in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fish farmers and sport-fishing interests to the north are demanding more
controls on cormorant numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   The information the biologists are collecting will be used to prepare a
nationwide management plan, so any controls can be minimized. To do that, more
must be known about the birds' habits, including where they travel through the
year and how much time they spend in certain places.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding more about cormorants will lead to more reasonable, publicly
acceptable controls, federal biologists say.
</P>
<P>
	   "The American public demands that we take ecological approaches," said Mark
Tobin, who supervises King and other USDA biologists trying to mediate the
cormorant dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody wants to kill all the birds," said Sterling Withers of Tunica,
president of the Catfish Farmers of Mississippi, an industry group. "The more
information we have, the better decisions we can make. There's a degree of
balance we need."
</P>
<P>
	   The northern-nesting cormorants have flown south each winter for easy
pickings at the catfish ponds. More than 60,000 cormorants spend each winter in
the Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago, fish farmers in Mississippi and other states won federal
permission to shoot an unlimited number of cormorants on farms. Producers say
the shooting is not putting much of a dent in the cormorant population.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers also have tried to drive away the birds with noise-making pistols.
Lately, biologists are testing devices that aim harmless laser beams into the
nighttime roosts to flush the birds.
</P>
<P>
	   This winter, 25 of the cormorants are being fitted with satellite-tracking
devices so their movements between Great Lakes-area breeding grounds and winter
haunts in the South can be traced.
</P>
<P>
	   King's team has attached 15 transmitters so far. They plan to outfit birds
in Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana. Counting the expense of
retrieving data from satellites, tracking each bird for a year will cost about
$4,400.
</P>
<P>
	   The cormorants, which travel in flocks by the hundreds, seem to eat whatever
fish they can catch by diving in the ponds.
</P>
<P>
	   King is not surprised solving the cormorant conflict demands the use of
satellites and other high-tech tools. He thinks the birds can recognize
"individual vehicles" around fish ponds that may be a threat to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Outsmarting the cormorants, King said, will take smart weapons.

<HEADLINE> Morris' Agent Denies Bam Wrongdoing  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Retired running back Bam Morris is claiming
innocence in his latest involvement in a drug case.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, who unexpectedly announced his retirement from the Kansas City
Chiefs last month, and teammate Tamarick Vanover were mentioned in an affidavit
filed last week in connection with drug distribution charges lodged against a
Kansas City man, Gregory Burns.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I thought my client was involved in criminal activity, we wouldn't be
talking to the press," Morris' agent, Terry Lavenstein, said Wednesday from his
Baltimore office. "I'd like to get his name cleared as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Vanover's representative didn't return calls from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit said the distribution ring stretched from Missouri to
California and Mexico. Burns, described in the affidavit as a personal assistant
to Vanover, was named as a major supplier of marijuana and cocaine in the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Morris nor Vanover, who won a game against Denver for the Chiefs
this season with an 80-yard punt return, has been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, authorities at the University of Kansas said they would contact
federal officials to discuss a report that one person had been denied bail
because he was supplying drugs to Jayhawks football players and fraternities.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI agents said that Chad M. Pollard "has supplied members of the Kansas
University football team with drugs since 1996 as well as various Kansas
University fraternities," according to documents quoted by The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletic director Bob Frederick said he met Wednesday with chancellor Robert
Hemenway and that neither man knew anything about the claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick said he asked Ralph Oliver, the school's director of public
safety, to contact the FBI for further information.
</P>
<P>
	   "The university is not an investigative body," Frederick said. "Ralph said
he probably wouldn't be able to be very successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Amy Perko, the associate athletic director who oversees Kansas' mandatory
drug-testing program, said athletes are subject to "a significant number of
tests throughout the year."
</P>
<P>
	   "The results of those tests are all confidential," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, who spent 89 days in a Texas jail in 1998 for violating probation
from a 1995 drug case, was mentioned once in the affidavit filed in connection
with the arrest of Burns. Vanover was mentioned several times.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chiefs, already reeling from a one-car accident on Jan. 23 that left
star linebacker Derrick Thomas paralyzed from the chest down, were taking a
wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody here knows anything about it," team spokesman Bob Moore said. "If
something happens, it happens. But our people are not rushing back from (the Pro
Bowl in) Hawaii because of this."
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard and Logan Gearheart, from Kansas City, Kan., were charged early last
month with drug trafficking. Both pleaded innocent at hearings and Gearheart was
released on bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, who unexpectedly retired from the NFL less than two weeks ago, twice
was suspended by the NFL for substance abuse while with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bam, unfortunately, will continue to have to live with the mistake he made
in 1995," Lavenstein said. "Any time an NFL player is involved in some type of
criminal activity, no matter how slight, the Bam Morris incident is going to be
brought up. That's something we have to live with, no matter how unfair that may
be."

<HEADLINE> House Passes Liability Limit Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturers of aging work equipment would gain
protection against lawsuits by injured workers under a House-passed liability
limit aimed at ending ``frivolous'' litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said the 18-year liability limit, passed 222-194 by the House on
Wednesday, was needed in an age of endless litigation. They also argued that
machines often are resold or modified without a manufacturer's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics said the measure was ``unfair'' to American workers. The White House
has indicated the measure would be vetoed in its current form, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have left workers out to dry,'' said Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones,
D-Ohio. ``It (the bill) provides more protection for machines than people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Added Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va.: ``It gives a disincentive to manufacturers
to make sure their products are safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and the bill's sponsor, said endless lawsuits
cost businesses, employees and consumers. ``A very significant amount of the
money that's won or settled ends up in the lawyers' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, ``If a product is used safely for
a substantially long period of time, it is not likely it was defective when
originally purchased. It's more likely the product was either misused or not
well maintained.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans have led the push for liability reform, but the bill's
future in the Senate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill covers workplace goods like machine tools, printing presses and
farm equipment. It bars suing manufacturers of those products for incidents that
occur 18 years after it was delivered to its first purchaser.
</P>
<P>
	   Exempted from the bill are workers who do not qualify for any form of
workers' compensation and products with warranties that guarantee the life or
safety of the product for more than 18 years. The bill would not affect products
such as automobiles and commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen states now have similar laws on the books, although all are for a
period less than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a similar 18-year liability measure in 1994 to protect the
small aircraft industry from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will not cause injured parties to go uncompensated,'' said Rep.
Mark Green, R-Wis. ``It separates out the least productive portion ... the
litigation driven costs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unions have campaigned against the bill. John Irvine, spokesman for the
American Federation of Government Employees, called the measure ``a dangerous
bill that will eliminate workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would also allow employers and innocent bystanders to sue for
damages, while eliminating workers, Michael E. Mathis, government affairs
director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters complained in a letter
to lawmakers. ``This makes no sense.''

<HEADLINE> Marriage Penalty Tax Relief Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are forging ahead with a bill that would cut
income taxes for millions of married couples by $182 billion over 10 years, but
Democrats say it represents a warmed-over tax cut that was already rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton will not go along with the House GOP strategy of dividing
last year's vetoed $792 billion tax cut into pieces like the ``marriage
penalty'' bill, all in an effort to put Democrats in a difficult political spot
-- even though Clinton has a smaller marriage penalty proposal of his own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can change the tactics, you can change the packaging, but if the
overall goal is to do a trillion-dollar tax cut to squeeze Social Security and
Medicare, we're going to oppose it,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the House Ways and Means Committee voted along party lines
Wednesday to clear the bill for floor vote as early as next week, just in time
for Valentine's Day on Feb. 14. Republicans accused Democrats of playing games
on tax cuts to forestall any GOP legislative victories in this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's either too big, or it's too early, or it's too late, or it's too
risky,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman.
``There's always some excuse.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 25 million couples, most of them with dual incomes, pay more income
taxes than they would if single. Millions more couples in which one spouse is
the main breadwinner get a marriage bonus through current tax law. The GOP bill
would cut taxes for all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   At an estimated cost of $182.3 billion over 10 years, the Republican bill
would consume about 10 percent of the projected budget surplus not dedicated to
Social Security, according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the cost comes from gradual enlargement, between years 2003 to 2008,
of the bottom 15 percent tax bracket so that it applies to more income for
married couples. If that were in effect today, married couples would pay the 15
percent rate on their first $52,500 of taxable income, instead of $43,850.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the GOP bill would increase the standard deduction for joint
tax filers to double that of single filers beginning in 2001 and expand the
earned-income tax credit for lower-income married people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal, estimated at $45 billion over 10 years, includes similar
provisions to boost the standard deduction and on the earned-income credit --
both geared more toward people with modest incomes -- but does not adjust the 15
percent bracket, which generally would help higher-income couples.
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said the legislation came far
too early in the year, before a budget framework has been worked out on how to
treat Social Security, Medicare, payment of debt and key spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no budget. We don't know how this fits into any larger picture,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told lawmakers he would recommend a
presidential veto of the GOP bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans are divided about pushing individual tax relief bills, in
part because Senate rules make it more difficult. Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., told reporters he supports the thrust of the House approach but may try
to combine the tax bills into a big single measure later in the year. ------

<HEADLINE> Rams' Martz Will Still Call Plays  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mike Martz will still be running the offense for the St.
Louis Rams, only it will be from the sidelines instead of upstairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Vermeil's retirement cleared the way for Martz to inherit the Rams'
head coaching job, his first ever. But Martz said Wednesday that he doesn't
expect to turn over his duties as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what I love doing," said Martz, who got a four-year contract. "That
is going to be fun for me."
</P>
<P>
	   Martz, 48, led a unit that averaged 33 points and more than 400 yards per
game with an inventive mix of formations designed to put pressure on a defense.
He said he would increase the responsibilities of some of his assistants, wide
receivers coach Al Saunders in particular, to help fill the gaps.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is the first of several offseason adjustments for the Rams, who are
soon expected to elevate Charley Armey from personnel director to general
manager and Jay Zygmunt to president of football operations. Vermeil had been
president of football operations, leaning heavily on advice from Armey and
Zygmunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz is the fifth coach in NFL history to take over a Super Bowl winner,
and the first since 1993, when Barry Switzer replaced Jimmy Johnson at Dallas.
Martz's staff agreed it would be a crime for him to become a supervisor instead
of a hands-on guy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never been around a guy that took a more aggressive approach to the
game," tight ends coach Lynn Stiles said. "Bill Walsh was that way, but this guy
is out of sight. We could be up 30-0 and he would act like it was still
zero-zero, and now he's the head coach and he doesn't have to pull off."
</P>
<P>
	   With one big year, Martz made a name for himself. He was with the Rams from
1992-96 as an offensive assistant, coaching tight ends, receivers and
quarterbacks. After Rich Brooks' staff was fired, he coached quarterbacks for
two years with Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil brought him back last season after the Rams went 4-12 with the NFL's
27th-rated offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago, star quarterback Kurt Warner was stocking grocery shelves.
Martz's story is comparable because his first NFL job was as an unpaid tight
ends coach with the Rams. Chuck Knox gave him a shot, but no money in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The line of succession was established last month when the Rams signed Martz
to a two-year contract that handed him the job when Vermeil finished the last
two years of his deal. The promotion came a lot sooner than expected for Martz,
who was shocked when Vermeil broke the news Tuesday morning that he is retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's advice: "There's only one way to become a head coach, and that's
be one."
</P>
<P>
	   Martz has had some time to get used to the idea, and it's clear he's quickly
growing into the job. When the team named him their leader of the future, Martz
was uncomfortable at the podium, but on Wednesday he was cool and confident and
even cracked a joke or two about his playing career, his family and advice he
might get from his assistants.
</P>
<P>
	   Over and over again, he said he was ready.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I've seen every side of this game," Martz said. "I've been with the
best and the very worst, and I started at the very bottom, and right now I'm at
the very top.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel good about being able to handle it and take another run at this
thing."
</P>
<P>
	   This promises to be a hectic, compressed offseason for Martz. In addition to
playing a month longer than most teams, he's also due to undergo surgery to fuse
vertebrae in his neck. That operation had been scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the assistant coaches out there have already had a week or two
off," Martz said. "Our guys, we just caught our breath."

<HEADLINE> Army May Prosecute No Gun Ri Vets  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is holding out the possibility that some Korean
War veterans could face criminal prosecution if investigators find they
participated in alleged mass killings of South Korean civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Wednesday it was too early in the
investigation to say whether prosecutions were likely or whether the U.S.
government would compensate South Korean survivors or families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly are prepared to recommend to the secretary of defense and to
the president that our country do the right thing if it is shown that U.S.
soldiers did something that was inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drawing a parallel to war crimes trials following World War II, Caldera told
The Associated Press, ``We don't want to set a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said Army investigators so far have questioned a few dozen U.S.
veterans from units that were in the area at the time of the alleged killings,
but have not yet talked to those who told the AP last year that a large number
of South Korean refugees were gunned down at the hamlet of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the AP report, which was based on ex-soldiers' statements as well as
declassified U.S. government documents, both U.S. and South Korean officials had
insisted there was no evidence to support the claims. After the report, however,
both the Defense Department and South Korea launched investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said the Army needs to investigate further before deciding whether
criminal prosecutions are warranted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not ruled that out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera, the Army's top civilian official, made these other points in a
wide-ranging interview with the AP:
</P>
<P>
	   --In searching for more effective recruiting methods, the Army has begun
trying to reach more young people who otherwise would move directly from high
school into college. Recruiters also will seek out college students who, for
financial or other reasons, are willing to leave school to join the Army. With
these and other new approaches, the Army's recent slump in recruiting ``will
turn around for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The Army's budget for 2001, to be submitted to Congress on Monday, will
include $1 billion for an ambitious effort to transform the service into a
lighter, more mobile force. Caldera would not discuss specifics, but said some
big weapons programs such as the Crusader mobile artillery will be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   In describing the Army's No Gun Ri investigation, Caldera said officials
have reviewed more than 1 million documents but have not yet approached the
ex-soldiers who have publicly asserted that they knew of -- or participated in
-- deliberate killings of South Korean refugees in the war's opening weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Army investigators are talking to veterans who had an indirect
connection, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes sense from an investigative perspective to begin your
investigation with those who may have knowledge of the actions of others, that
can shed light on the actions of others, before moving up to those who may
themselves have participated'' in the killings, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you go directly to the person involved, that person is going to be
represented by counsel, and the first thing they're going to do is ask for
immunity from any prosecution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At some point the Army will have to decide whether to grant some witnesses
limited immunity that would bar prosecutors from using their testimony against
them, he said. He distinguished this from offering complete immunity, which
protects a person from being prosecuted for crimes they testify about.
</P>
<P>
	   In saying the Army did not rule out seeking criminal prosecutions in No Gun
Ri, Caldera noted that the U.S. government supports various international
conventions that try war criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And we go after Nazis and others who perpetrated atrocities in World War
II, and we certainly don't want to set a double standard,'' Caldera said. ``But
we don't know at this point -- by any stretch -- whether this (No Gun Ri) is a
situation that is anywhere near related to those kinds of criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said the Army hopes to finish its No Gun Ri investigation before
June, when both Seoul and Washington will be holding special ceremonies to mark
the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Crash Agonizing  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- They met in high school. After dating for seven
years, he finally proposed. She accepted. And then she was gone.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamira Mohamed, 24, was a flight attendant on Kenya Airways Flight 431,
which slammed into the Atlantic just moments after takeoff Sunday from this
tropical port city. For her fiance, Mohamed Waseem, news of the crash was just
the start of the agony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Up to now we don't know if she is alive or dead, if the body has been
found, nothing,'' Waseem said Wednesday as he shakily lit a cigarette upon
arrival at Abidjan's international airport from Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   The Airbus 310 was carrying 179 people destined for Lagos, Nigeria, when it
tumbled from the sky. Only 10 survivors were found and 86 bodies retrieved.
State television Wednesday night said one of the plane's ``black boxes'' had
been found, but officials could not immediately be reached for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   Dazed and exhausted, about 150 relatives of the dead and missing staggered
off a Kenya Airways flight Wednesday from Nairobi and Lagos hoping to confirm
the fate of their loved ones and bring their bodies home.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman dressed in black collapsed into the arms of her waiting relatives
and burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her mother and son were on the flight,'' said Petra Kaumi, wiping away
tears of her own as she consoled her Kenyan cousin. ``The mother's body has been
found, but we are still looking for the boy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had buses ready to transport the families to the luxury Hotel
Ivoire, where they will stay until missing relatives have been identified.
There, they waited in line at a reception center to fill out forms and hand over
snapshots to help officials identify bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, tired of waiting, went to the city's main morgue themselves hoping
to locate friends and relatives. They waited for hours there, too, while
officials performed autopsies and completed paperwork.
</P>
<P>
	   Razak Ismail, a Nigerian, spent the entire day there Tuesday and was back
again Wednesday with his brother hoping to locate the body of his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are Muslims, we need to bury her,'' he said, referring to the religious
stipulation that the dead be buried within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgue head Albert Zeze explained there were only three doctors available to
conduct the autopsies. By Wednesday afternoon, just 26 of the recovered bodies
had been identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives also decried delays in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the 10 survivors clung to bits of wreckage for hours before they
were rescued, and at least one swam to shore. Many were saved by volunteers
trawling the waters in their own boats.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, when an Alaska Airlines jetliner went down off the coast of
wealthy and developed California on Monday, dozens of Coast Guard, Navy and
private ships arrived immediately, but found no survivors. U.S. authorities
planned to take relatives out to the site to salve their grief.
</P>
<P>
	   In Abidjan, many relatives knew nothing about counselors, manifests or
crisis centers. They were available, but no one told them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Africa we're so unfortunate,'' said Raliatou Atanda, an Ivorian who
returned three times to the morgue to look for his niece. ``Even the rescue
operation was hampered by a lack of resources. I'm sure more people could have
been saved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ivorian officials defended their response, while acknowledging the seaside
airport had no rescue boats on hand. They also pointed out the accident happened
at night, and on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I was informed and (rescuers) went to the site as soon as possible,''
said the director of the Ivorian civil aviation authority, Jean Kouassi
Abonouan.
</P>
<P>
	   Abonouan said that the country did not have the equipment needed to located
the airplane's flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, but that a
team of French specialists was combing the seas looking for them.
</P>
<P>
	   For Waseem, however, an explanation for the crash is not the priority. He
just wants to be able to bury his fiance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was very bubbly, never liked to stay at home,'' he remembered. ``The
only reason I agreed to wait two years to marry her is because this was her
dream job. And she is gone.''

<HEADLINE> Eight Convicted in Argentina Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- It was a case that had all the makings for a
crime novel page-turner: allegations of government corruption, rogue police
officers, a powerful businessman accused of being a crime boss, and a crusading
photojournalist hoping to unmask it all.
</P>
<P>
	   Ending a three-year-old national saga, an Argentine tribunal sentenced eight
people to life in prison Wednesday for the mafia-style killing of Jose Luis
Cabezas, an investigative journalist whose shocking murder is one of the most
notorious homicides in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight included three former provincial police officers, four civilians
and the former security guard of a prominent business mogul suspected of crime
links whom Cabezas had photographed.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth police officer was sentenced to four years in prison on a fraud
charge related to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm comfortable with the decisions handed down by the tribunal,'' Cabezas'
mother, Maria Cristina Robledo said, leaving the courthouse. ``My son can now
rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-year-old Cabezas was found dead Jan 25, 1997, in the glitzy Atlantic
coast resort of Pinamar, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires. He had been
handcuffed, beaten, shot in the head, doused in gasoline and torched.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying shocked Argentines and was eerily reminiscent of the work of
military death squads from the country's 1976-83 dictatorship. Argentine
journalists condemned the killing as evidence of an increasing threat against
freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
	   International press organizations rallied around the case as an example of
the risk Argentine journalists and others in Latin America run investigating
organized crime and political scandals.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide protests ensued as demonstrators cried out for justice. Posters
with the photographer's picture and the slogan ``Don't forget Cabezas'' can
still be seen in many parts of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabezas was killed while working on assignment for Noticias magazine, a
weekly newsmagazine known for its hard-edged delving into alleged wrongdoing by
politicians, police officers and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been shadowing reclusive businessman Alfredo Yabran. In 1995, former
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo accused Yabran of heading up an extensive crime
network and employing former ``dirty war'' military officers to control
government officials, judges, and several business entities. No formal charges
were ever lodged against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabezas had taken some of the few published photographs of Yabran, who
immediately became a prime suspect in the photographer's death, along with his
chief security guard, Gregorio Rios.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios was among those given life in prison late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yabran repeatedly denied allegations he was involved in the killing. Wanted
by authorities last year for questioning, he went on the run and became the
focus of a nationwide manhunt. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the
mouth as police closed in on him at his country resort last May. A handwritten
note left by his side professed his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   But the damage to Yabran's public image was already done. To everyday
Argentines, frustrated by a judicial system they deride as sluggish, corrupt and
protective of the rich, Yabran had become a symbol of impunity.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Guards Charged in Inmate Death  </HEADLINE>
   By RON WORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- Four prison guards spent a night in jail after being
charged with second-degree murder in the fatal beating of an inmate sent to
death row for killing a prison guard in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Timothy Thornton and Sgts. Jason Griffis, Charles A. Brown and Robert
W. Sauls were to make their first court appearances today in Bradford County
Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
	   All were named in an indictment issued Wednesday by an Alachua County grand
jury. The indictment was expected to be unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, they face up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm genuinely shocked that he was indicted,'' said Hank Coxe, a
Jacksonville attorney representing Griffis. ``I look forward to finding out
why.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a travesty of justice,'' said Gloria Fletcher, Thornton's attorney.
``The man didn't do anything. He was doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
	   The four men were among nine guards suspended after Frank Valdes died on
July 17 during a confrontation inside a disciplinary area at Florida State
Prison near Starke.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards said Valdes, 36, had severely injured himself by throwing himself off
his bunk onto the concrete floor of his cell. But an autopsy showed he was
beaten to death. A medical examiner said Valdes had boot marks on his body, his
ribs were broken and his testicles were swollen.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton, 34, Griffis and Brown, both 26, turned themselves in Wednesday at
the Bradford County Jail. Sauls, 37, was arrested at his girlfriend's house in
Jasper, about 75 miles away. Each was being held on $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Valdes was sentenced to death for the fatal shooting of a prison guard while
attempting to help a fellow inmate escape in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Another prison guard, Sgt. Montrez Lucas, 30, was accused of assaulting
Valdes on July 16, the day before the inmate died. Lucas, an instructor at the
guards' training academy, is free on $50,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   The other guards suspended were Sgt. Andrew W. Lewis, Officer Dewey Beck,
Officer Donald Stanford and Officer Raymon C. Hanson.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judges Scrap Bypass Rule  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Addressing a growing controversy, federal judges in the
nation's capital killed a rule that enabled the chief judge to send prosecutions
against friends and supporters of President Clinton to his judicial appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the courthouse say the judges revoked the rule on Tuesday, six
months after The Associated Press disclosed that Chief Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson bypassed the system of randomly assigning cases in some politically
sensitive prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges had begun a review of the rule last April before the controversy
erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Johnson directed a total of five Democratic fund-raising
prosecutions to Clinton-appointed judges, plus a tax evasion case against
long-time Clinton friend Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
	   The now-rescinded rule permitted Johnson to bypass the random assignment
system in ``protracted'' cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure to scrap the rule increased last month when Rep. Howard Coble,
R-N.C., chairman of a House Judiciary Committee panel, disclosed that Johnson
assigned a Clinton judge a case that was not ``protracted'' -- the guilty plea
of prominent Miami businessman Howard Glicken, a former fund-raiser for Vice
President Al Gore. Glicken admitted to two misdemeanors in the fund-raising
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief judge has never said why she bypassed the random assignment system
in Glicken's case.
</P>
<P>
	   Court records show presidential friend Vernon Jordan intervened in the case,
asking the sentencing judge to be lenient. Glicken was given community service
work and probation. Coble is seeking a judicial inquiry of Johnson's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges are developing a new system in which protracted or complex cases
will be randomly assigned from a separate pool of all the judges at the
courthouse, the officials said, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics questioned whether the special assignments created the appearance of
political favoritism. At the time Johnson assigned the cases, four of the 12
full-time judges at the courthouse were Republican appointees and all eight
senior judges were appointed by presidents other than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson has declined repeated requests for interviews. But in a letter to a
newspaper after the controversy erupted, she said she made the special
assignments to ``move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that
politics was ``never a factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who received some of the campaign
fund-raising cases from Johnson, spearheaded the internal courthouse review of
the long-standing rule. He recommended the rule be abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, University of Colorado law professor Christopher Mueller
argued against special assignments of politically sensitive cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not suggesting anything happened here, but when you are talking about
investigations that have a clear political component the opportunities and
temptations to tailor the choice of judge to a particular outcome are surely
much greater than they are in many other cases,'' said Mueller.

<HEADLINE> Beauty Races Provide Publicity  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The contestants in these beauty contests don't wear
sashes or tiaras, and there's nothing even close to a swimsuit competition. The
prizes don't carry any glamour, just a little momentum for the competitors -- if
they're lucky.
</P>
<P>
	   In the world of politics, beauty contests are presidential primaries or
straw polls that allow voters to express their opinions but have nothing to do
with the delegate selection process. A political beauty pageant in Delaware this
weekend is an example.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's Democratic party is having a primary Saturday but won't actually
allocate its 22 delegates until March 27 caucuses held throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still believe the primary is a way to gauge public opinion and we're
asking Democrats to participate,'' Purcell said. ``And being that it is a few
days after New Hampshire, it may have a little more bearing than people think.''
</P>
<P>
	   Or it may not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's really been no history that beauty contests and straw polls have
been president makers,'' said Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at
American University. ``If you look at the history of presidential nominations,
the front-runners almost always get nominated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beauty contest participants are usually second-tier candidates hoping to
gain a little publicity to boost a sagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Steve Forbes, trailing far behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
nearly tied the front-runner in an Alaska Republican presidential straw poll
last week. The millionaire publisher made several campaign trips to Alaska prior
to the nonbinding contest, while Bush and rival Sen. John McCain did not show
up.
</P>
<P>
	   Curt Achberger, executive director of Alaska's Republican party, said the
state holds the straw poll to grab attention it wouldn't receive otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Alaska gets forgotten a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Front-runners generally tend to ignore beauty contests, since they have
nothing to gain in the way of delegates, said Barbara Norrander, a political
science professor at the University of Arizona. Lesser-known candidates,
however, often participate because it's an easy way to get name recognition
without having to compete against major candidates with deeper pockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Beauty contest primaries aren't as common as they used to be, Norrander
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be they're still out there but there hasn't been as much attention
to them because there are so many primaries squished together so fast,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a front-loaded election calendar this year, a nominee for both
parties should be known by the end of March. Last year's scramble for earlier
dates -- and increased influence -- on the 2000 calendar resulted in a number of
beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington state Democrats, for example, have scheduled a beauty contest
primary for Feb. 29 -- but won't allocate their delegates until a week later.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona and Michigan, taxpayers will pay for a Feb. 22 presidential
primary in which only Republicans can participate. State Democrats instead will
hold party-run contests the following month because of a national rule that
allows only Iowa and New Hampshire to hold caucuses or primaries before March 7
without penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no question that having a caucus run by the state party is going
to cost us some money,'' said Dennis Denno, a spokesman for Michigan Democrats.
``But we're trying to make sure that, in the end, it's a better product.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norrander wondered how Bill Bradley would try to gain momentum in the runup
to the March 7 contests after his loss Tuesday in New Hampshire's Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He might end up looking around for a beauty contest,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Retirment Funds Hit $1.7 Trillion  </HEADLINE>
    By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Success in the stock market has boosted the worth of
state and local government employee retirement systems to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   Total cash and security holdings for nonfederal government retirement
systems rose to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 1997-98, up $237 billion from the
previous year, according to data released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the same period, the total number of full-time state and municipal
employees rose about 300,000 to 14.5 million, Census data indicate.
</P>
<P>
	   Thank the overall good health of the American economy for padding public
employees' retirement accounts, said Steve Regenstreif, director of the retiree
program for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "In recent years, the health of it is due to the rise in the stock market,"
he said. "The majority of public sector retirement systems are now either fully-
or well-funded and this is a very good development."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $1.7 trillion, the Census Bureau reported that more than $1.2
trillion was invested in non-governmental securities, including $639 billion in
corporate stocks, $258 billion in corporate bonds and $195 billion in
international securities.
</P>
<P>
	   State and local governments are paying more attention to the future of their
employees, and more systems are offering the option of defined contribution
accounts like 401(k) plans as options, said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 2,140 public employee retirement systems in 1997 nationwide.
Illinois had the most with 374, followed by Pennsylvania, which had 343. Hawaii
and Maine each had only one system that served all of their state and local
government employees.
</P>
<P>
	   California's 66 public employee retirement funds in 1997 totaled $291
billion in assets and served over 1.6 million members -- both highs in the U.S.
The largest is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, with about
$165 billion in assets covering 1 million people.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Ask For 2-Year Budget  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. David Dreier says the ``stars are beginning to
align'' this year for adoption of legislation that would end the annual budget
crunch and put Congress on a two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   Dreier, R-Calif., was joined Wednesday by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, in urging action this year on a
biennial budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the biennial budget, which would give Congress more time to
oversee the spending bills it passes, have for years failed to overcome the
resistance of appropriations committee members and others reluctant to give up
their annual shot at influencing government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   But last fall, Dreier, who heads the House Rules Committee, got 245
signatures, more than a majority, on a non-binding resolution saying the House
should take up the issue this year. President Clinton supports the concept and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on Tuesday said he was ``very much
for biennial budgeting'' and thought it could be acted on this year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., has also said he likes the idea
but has doubts about legislation moving in this second year of the congressional
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Several bills introduced in the House and Senate would follow the example of
some 20 states by having Congress pass a budget the first year of the session
and devote the second year to oversight of spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress spends more than half of its time each year voting on the
government's annual budget,'' Domenici said. ``Biennial budgeting would be a
dramatic improvement in the way Congress does business.''
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the inefficiencies of the current system, he noted that the
Army Corps of Engineers produced eight volumes, 2,000 pages, as part of its $3.7
billion budget proposal for 2000. He said in many cases 90 percent of the budget
requests are unchanged from previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the biennial budget would alleviate ``the gridlock so
often caused by our annual confrontations over budget and appropriations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the two-year budget, in addition to warning that it would weaken
congressional controls over the process, argue the biennial budget lacks the
flexibility to cope with sudden economic changes, wars or disasters. Supporters
counter that supplemental budgets can be passed to handle emergencies.

<HEADLINE> Labor Investigators Question Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIKEN, S.C. (AP) -- The National Labor Relations Board has ordered a hearing
to hear allegations that plastics plant officials had an employee arrested and
put in a mental hospital to stop his union activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary McClain has sued his former employer, Tenneco Packaging, Aiken County
Sheriff Howard Sellers and others, saying the company conspired with deputies to
remove him from union activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The NLRB, in its order issued Monday, said there is reasonable cause to
investigate McClain's allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Tenneco was named in the order, the name of the company and its
Beech Island plastics plant changed to Pactiv Corp. in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Pactiv has two weeks to answer the allegations, which will be heard by an
administrative law judge this month or in early March, the NLRB said.
</P>
<P>
	   It only means ``there are disputed issues of fact in this matter,'' Pactiv
spokesman Warren Hazelton said. ``We will cooperate fully with the board's order
and anticipate a hearing in which the disputed facts will be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
	   McClain, who had worked at the plant for 17 years, said he was stopped by
Aiken County sheriff's deputies on his way to work July 29 and arrested on a
4-year-old misdemeanor warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was taken to Aiken Regional Medical Centers and moved to Charter
Rivers, a Columbia psychiatric hospital, where he was kept against his will for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sellers has supported his deputies' actions, saying he is confident the
facts will come out in any court proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers for the International Union of Operating Engineers said the
ruling would strengthen their efforts at the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Britt, business manager of three operating engineers' union locals,
said the ruling should be a boost to workers, many of whom he said were ``really
scared after what happened to Gary McClain.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Struggles With Spouse Claims  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Changes made two years ago to prevent innocent spouses
from getting entangled in the tax debts of a divorced or separated partner have
resulted in a backlog of more than 46,000 claims at the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance Committee on
Wednesday that the agency was surprised by the sheer number of claims following
congressional passage of the law in 1998 and also wasn't fully prepared for the
complexity of determining which ones are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are really quite determined to get the claims right,'' Rossotti said.
``Sometimes, that has resulted in taking more time to get the result out to the
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   In general, the innocent spouse law enables one partner to obtain relief
from tax liabilities stemming from a jointly filed tax return -- unless the IRS
can prove the requesting spouse had knowledge of the offending items on that
return. The new law relaxed and broadened many requirements, among other updated
taxpayer rights.
</P>
<P>
	   In the four months before the 1998 IRS reform law took effect, Rossotti said
the agency had received about 3,000 innocent spouse claims. Since then, the
number of claims has ballooned to 63,906, with about 2,800 pouring in each month
-- and the backlog as of Dec. 31 was 46,665.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not satisfactory,'' said Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del. ``We do have to find some answers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti said the IRS intends for ``progress to pick up'' during 2000 and
projected the backlog to drop to about 30,000 claims by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Several senators were critical of reports that IRS enforcement actions --
liens, levies and property seizures -- have plummeted since the 1998 reform law
passed. Rossotti released new estimates predicting that the drop will end in
2000 as the agency improves how it administers the law and Congress provides
adequate money for staff and computer improvements.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Illness Questions Remain  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lack of coordination among government agencies has
contributed to lingering questions about Gulf War illnesses nine years after the
war, a federal investigator told Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While federally sponsored studies have resulted in some descriptive
information concerning veterans symptoms, many basic questions remain,''
Kwai-Cheung Chan of the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm,
told a House government reform subcommittee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Chan said, a Research Working Group created to focus on
research planning, review and dissemination, ``has not endorsed any case
definition or set of such definitions that might focus federal research.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chan's comments came during a hearing to examine $121 million of federal
research and investigation in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings ``validate our initial assessment, and confirm our worst fears
about the pace and prospects of the search for answers for sick Gulf War
veterans,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still don't know how many veterans are suffering unexplained illnesses.
We still don't know how their illnesses progress and we still don't know if they
are getting any better,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
	   Various government officials, including the Veterans' Affairs and Defense
Departments, testified about their efforts, saying studies were underway to
learn more about the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 30,000 veterans of the war have complained of mysterious maladies such
as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss they claim are related to their service
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These remaining questions do not reflect scientific indifference; instead
they reflect the complexity of assessing and predicting the health impact of
military deployments,'' said Dr. Drue H. Barrett, who serves as the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention liaison to the Health and Human Services
Department on Gulf War issues.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chan identified several problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the sponsored studies are ongoing or in review,'' Chan said. Of 20
reports due to the Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses, only
six had been publicly released at the time of the investigation. Fourteen had
been in draft or review status for a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the various agencies involved have had trouble coordinating, Chan
said, adding that contracting errors caused the improper awarding of $20 million
worth of task orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Shays said officials are mindful of the time research requires, but
``patience is no excuse for a lack of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must be certain all federal research into Gulf War illnesses is well
designed, vigorously pursued and keenly focused on the most promising
hypotheses.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Skips Calif. GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- When California Republicans meet this weekend to
size up presidential candidates, there will be a very conspicuous absence: Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who is skipping the gathering for the third straight time.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush will be in Michigan when the convention opens Friday, and will spend
most of the weekend resting in Texas after an 18-day sprint through Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Bush's brother, Jeb, the Florida governor, plans to speak on his
behalf, Sen. John McCain will speak for himself in hope of generating momentum
in the nation's largest state after his decisive win over Bush in the New
Hampshire GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Fleischman, executive director of the state GOP, said he didn't take the
Texas governor's absence as a snub.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If nobody was speaking at our convention representing George W. Bush, the
silence would be deafening,'' Fleischman said. ``The fact that we have his
brother there is huge.''
</P>
<P>
	   But by missing the convention, Bush risks alienating the more than 1,500 GOP
activists on hand, said Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for the
Study of Politics and the Media at California State University, Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Were I him, I'd be at the California Republican convention shaking
hands,'' she said. ``Snubbed once, they'll forgive you; twice, maybe they'll
forgive you; three times, they're going to dance with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., will mix with the party faithful and give a speech, as will
Steve Forbes. Alan Keyes also plans to attend; Gary Bauer declined an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker did not return two telephone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Republican Party holds conventions twice annually. A year
ago, Bush passed on the gathering, saying he would make no public appearances
outside Texas until lawmakers there finished considering his education plan. (He
attended nine California fund-raisers in the year leading up to the convention.)
</P>
<P>
	   In his absence, McCain stole the show with a speech imploring Republicans to
take the high road in the upcoming campaign, and gaining exposure in the news
media.
</P>
<P>
	   When the state GOP held its fall convention, Bush again took a pass, instead
attending the Ryder Cup golf tournament and a Hispanic gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes accused the Texas governor of ``cowering in the bushes'' by skipping
the September convention, but bypassing the meetings has caused Bush little if
any damage.
</P>
<P>
	   In three January polls, he led McCain among California Republicans by
margins ranging from 33 to 45 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Each survey was conducted before the Arizona senator's smashing victory over
Bush in New Hampshire on Tuesday -- a win some political analysts say could
change the race here.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator has long said California will be one of four crucial states,
along with New Hampshire, South Carolina and his home state. Bush, too, has said
he will compete aggressively here. He last visited Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Republican Party convention will showcase McCain, Forbes and
Keyes before California's most committed GOP activists, many of whom find Bush
too moderate and may be shopping for another candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP and Bush campaign officials say there is no bad blood between them, and
note that Bush helped the state party raise nearly $2 million at a fund-raiser
last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations have been rocky in the last year, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The party, which is dominated by conservatives, delivered a slap to Bush
last June when it voted to change the GOP presidential primary from
``winner-take-all'' to a free-for-all system that would award delegates to the
nominating convention to multiple candidates. The move was later blocked in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, California Republican Party conventions are perennial
battlegrounds for abortion fights, which Bush has resisted being drawn into.
Bush says he opposes abortion, but would allow it for cases of rape, incest or
when the mother's life is at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is certain to surface Sunday when the party votes on a platform,
said Bob Larkin, a party activist advocating removal of anti-abortion language.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign leaders in California are seeking to stifle such a battle to
``make sure the convention headlines are nonacrimonious,'' said a state GOP
leader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a dynamic at play from the Bush campaign where they don't want to
see controversy at the convention, they don't want to see abortion stuff in the
papers,'' the leader said. ``They're putting a lot of pressure on the Larkins of
the world to sit down and shut up.''

<HEADLINE> McCain N.H. Win Revives TV Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks knew John McCain was going to be a big
winner before the last vote was cast in the New Hampshire primary -- and
couldn't resist telling people about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary night revived a quadrennial concern for networks about whether they
should report how an election is going while the polls are still open.
</P>
<P>
	   The three cable news networks used exit polls to declare McCain the winner
over GOP frontrunner George W. Bush at 7 p.m. EST Tuesday, when most -- although
not all -- of New Hampshire's polls closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox News Channel's Brit Hume reported at 6 p.m. that "all signs point to a
very good night for John McCain." Much of the next hour included discussion
about the implications of a big McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "To do otherwise would have taken us completely off what we knew to be the
news," Hume said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Early victory projections were a big issue in the 1980s, when West Coast
politicians worried that network calls on a presidential race would keep voters
at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Research on whether this was true has been inconclusive, said Tom
Rosensteil, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. But networks
have generally waited in recent elections to avoid alienating voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With two new cable news networks for this presidential election and more
refined exit polling, there is a greater temptation to break ranks, said
Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Public Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of a competition among news networks on who could call the race
first, "we got into a race of who could insinuate first," Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the "CBS Evening News" at 6:30 p.m. Monday, Dan Rather said there were
"early indications of possible surprises" in both parties. Correspondent Bob
Schieffer said exit polls concluded New Hampshire Republicans gave McCain an
"astonishing" 70 percent favorability rating.
</P>
<P>
	   David Bloom said on NBC's "Nightly News" that "the McCain camp is brimming
with confidence tonight, and Bush aides appear resigned to defeat."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC waited until 8 p.m., when all New Hampshire polls had closed, to declare
McCain the victor. But Peter Jennings reported 90 minutes earlier that it
appeared to be a good day for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosensteil said that television commentators "pushed the semantic envelope
more last night than I have seen in a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   "We would argue that it's not semantic," ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.
"You're not projecting a winner."
</P>
<P>
	   CNN's 7 p.m. declaration made for one awkward moment: a half-hour later,
Judy Woodruff noted on the air that polls hadn't closed everywhere in New
Hampshire and that voters should exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN political director Tom Hannon said he had emphasized to correspondents
not to let what they knew from exit polls seep into their reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The risk of influencing, potentially, the outcome of an election is a
weighty responsibility, so we kind of play it straight," Hannon said. "I
recognize that it's a difficult issue. I'm not trying to imply any criticism of
the other networks."
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said Fox tries to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't want it to be a situation where the media and all the players
know what the score is and the spectators don't," he said. "There's nothing more
journalistically suspect to me than a bunch of journalists working with a head
full of knowledge and not telling the audience."

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch stored some of the
nation's most sensitive national security secrets on a home computer that also
was used to access pornographic Internet sites and to routinely receive and send
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the conclusion of CIA investigators in a case that is generating
alarm among congressional intelligence overseers and throughout the intelligence
community.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA Director George Tenet, in a public hearing on Wednesday before the
Senate Intelligence Committee and later in a private session with members, said
there was no evidence that Deutch's unsecured home computer had been hacked into
by foreign adversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   But neither was there any sure way to tell that it hadn't been, given that
the technology exists for such intrusions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was enormously sensitive material on this computer, at the highest
levels of classification,'' Tenet conceded at the public session.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was to testify today before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and
he seemed likely to be grilled further on disclosures that are turning out to be
a major embarrassment for the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional and intelligence community sources familiar with the
investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said among the e-mail
messages sent to Deutch was one from Europe from an individual who identified
himself as former Russian scientist.
</P>
<P>
	   As to the e-mail supposedly from a former Russian scientist, investigators
determined that the e-mail was incoming, and not solicited or answered by
Deutch, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA investigators studied data on the hard drive of the home computer used
by Deutch and were able to identify various pieces of e-mail and Internet
addresses that had been accessed by Deutch and members of his household though
an America Online account, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sources said there was no evidence that Deutch himself had visited any
of the pornographic sites, and that some of the times that had been logged did
not match up with times when Deutch was at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was among those delivering the sharpest criticism of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did. He worked around the clock. He didn't think
about what he was doing,'' Tenet told the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nevertheless, as director, I believe he should have known better,'' Tenet
added. ``We talk about electronic means of getting into our databases. Now it's
shown that this is an important issue that we're all paying attention to. And,
you know, one man's mistake is another man's stupidity. Of course it's troubling
that we're in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August 1999, even though
the CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began
in December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet had been Deutch's deputy. Tenet was sworn in as CIA director in July
1997 after serving as acting director during the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet denied he deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's
computer practices. However, he conceded, ``The internal investigation took too
long. The process was not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet agreed the CIA was slow in notifying appropriate officials and
lawmakers. ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized. Although the CIA eventually referred the case to the
Justice Department, Deutch has not been prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Japan Co. To Have License Repealed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The government said Thursday it has decided to repeal the
operating license of the company that caused Japan's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   JCO Co. will have an opportunity to appeal the decision at a hearing on
March 13, said Shigeaki Shiraishi, deputy director of nuclear safety at the
Science and Technology Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry will
issue a final decision on whether to bar the nuclear fuel processor from
business, said Shiraishi. But he added it was too early to say when that will
happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to carry out this disciplinary measure as quickly and smoothly as
possible," said Shiraishi. "We don't expect the company to put up a fight."
</P>
<P>
	   JCO plans to obey the government decision, said company spokesman Shuji
Noguchi.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sept. 30 accident occurred when two workers mixed too much uranium with
nitric acid to make fuel, triggering the reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of uranium used, 37 pounds, was almost seven times the approved
limit, said Shiraishi. The company has suspended operations since the accident,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hisashi Ouchi, one of the workers, died in December, becoming the first
fatality from an accident at a Japanese nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the government increased its estimate of the number of people
exposed in the accident to 439, far more than the previous figure of 90.

<HEADLINE> Wide Gaps Divide Barak, Arafat  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Only 10 days before a crucial deadline in peace talks, a
senior Israeli official said today the gap between Palestinian and Israeli
positions was still so wide that a Camp David-style summit was not realistic at
this point.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon spoke just hours before Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were slated to meet to try to
find a way to iron out the differences in the last phase of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders have committed to produce a framework agreement for a final
peace treaty by Feb. 13, but officials from both sides said the chances of
reaching understandings by then were remote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a formidable task,'' U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross said after
meeting separately with Barak and Arafat until the early hours today to try to
bridge the gaps.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has said that once sides made significant progress, it
would invite the leaders to Washington for an intensive negotiating session
under President Clinton's close supervision.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar negotiations at Camp David in 1978 lead to the breakthrough peace
treaty between Israel and Egypt. But Ramon said such a session was not realistic
at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the current situation, going to a summit in the United States when
the gaps are still so wide is not the correct thing to do,'' Ramon told Israel
radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The framework deal is to address the thorniest issues between Israel and the
Palestinians -- final borders, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the future
of Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The first four of 10 days of marathon discussions aimed at hammering out a
framework agreement yielded little progress. Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim on
Wednesday dismissed Israel's proposal for a final border as ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians were unlikely to be much happier with Israel's map for an
overdue troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which Barak's
Cabinet approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's summit, Barak and Arafat are also expected to discuss the latest
withdrawal, originally set for Jan. 20 and now slated for next week, and the
opening of a travel route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal outlined does not include the Jerusalem suburbs that the
Palestinians are demanding, Israeli settlers who were shown the map Wednesday
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the land to be given back is in the sparsely populated southern West
Bank, near Hebron, said settler spokesman Yehoshua Mor-Yosef. Smaller swaths of
land near the West Bank town of Jenin and near the Gush Etzion settlement bloc
were also included, he said, accusing Barak of isolating settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have flatly rejected Israel's proposal for a final border
because it would leave Israel with territory captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
They have not budged from their opening position demanding that Israel withdraw
from all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   One potential obstacle in negotiations was lifted Wednesday when the PLO's
policy-making Central Council recessed with Chairman Salim Zanoun saying the
body would postpone a vote on whether to unilaterally declare a state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is not opposed to a Palestinian state, but wants it to be created
through negotiations. Both sides have promised not to prejudice the outcome of
the negotiations before a September deadline for a final peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Glickman Wants Farm Subsidies Spread  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says the
administration's proposals for $11.5 billion in new farm spending will "lay the
groundwork" for developing a new agricultural policy that is better for the
environment and targets money to small-scale producers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the top of the administration's wish list is a new system of
"supplemental income" payments targeted to small and medium-size farm and
estimated to cost $5.6 billion through 2002, when the 1996 farm law is set to
expire.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration wants to spend an additional $2.7 billion for
conservation programs, including $1.2 billion in direct payments to farmers who
take steps to curb runoff of pesticides and fertilizers from their land. An
additional $1.3 billion would go toward expanding the federally subsidized crop
assurance program and providing discounts to farmers on the premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   To and some farmers, the "supplemental income" program would correct they
see as a flaw in the Republican-authored 1996 farm law, which scaled back on
crop subsidies, ended controls on planting and gave farmers a series of fixed
annual payments. Critics say the fixed payments were insufficient when commodity
prices fell sharply in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has passed $15 billion in emergency assistance over the last year
to compensate farmers for the low prices as well as weather-related crop losses
and is expected to consider another big aid package this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's plan is intended to substitute for additional emergency
bills that many lawmakers and administration officials think are inevitable
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two years of plunging commodity prices, natural disasters and nearly $15
billion in emergency relief was a tacit admission that the 1996 farm bill was
not satisfactory," said at a news conference Wednesday. "We cannot ask farmers
to wait any longer."
</P>
<P>
	   The supplemental income plan already is coming under criticism from farm
groups and in Congress, largely because of the administration's proposed $30,000
cap on payments. The fixed "market transition" payments that farmers get under
the 1996 farm bill would count toward the $30,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The administration's paltry plan for farmers is out of touch with the
economic crisis in rural America," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Indiana Republican Richard
Lugar, predicted earlier this week that farmers would reject the plan as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   The new program also runs the danger of driving commodity prices down
further by encouraging small farms to grow more crops that are already in
surplus, said Bruce Gardner, an agricultural economist at the University of
Maryland. The 1996 farm bill was designed to designed to do just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting into the 21st century. To say you're going to use commodity
policy to prop up these marginal farms ... is not a sustainable, long-term path
for agriculture," Gardner said. "I can't believe we're going to try to keep
these small operations in business.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA officials say they don't believe the supplemental income payments would
have any significant impact on production.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the spending in the administration's proposals would be in the
government's 2001 and 2002 budgets. The ideas include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$500 million in low-interest loans to finance construction of grain bins
on farms so producers can hold commodities off the market.
</P>
<P>
	   --$300 million in dairy subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   --A freeze in rates for government crop subsidies, which would otherwise
fall this year because they are tied to recent averages in commodity prices. The
freeze would cost taxpayers an estimated $530 million through 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   --$400 million to develop a bioenergy program for turning crops into fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   --$130 million to assist livestock producers in forming cooperatives for
processing meat.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Global Warming Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton hopes that American businesses eager to
sell environmentally friendly technology and products overseas will help win
approval in Congress for programs to combat global warming and pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   In his upcoming budget request, Clinton will ask Congress for $2.4 billion
for various initiatives designed to reduce the harmful effects of global climate
changes, White House officials said Wednesday. The amount is 42 percent above
what Congress approved last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will also propose new tax incentives to encourage investment in
environmentally friendly technology, said Roger Ballantine, White House
environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think when Congress sees what we're doing and business sees what we're
doing, we're going to have a lot of support,'' Ballantine said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the new money would go toward a push to accelerate development and
distribution of clean energy technologies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is asking for $200 million -- twice the request of last year -- to
pair that U.S. business opportunity with an effort to persuade developing
countries to choose environmentally benign energy sources such as wind power and
alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone agrees that there is an enormous market out there as the
developing world adds the enormous amount of new energy capacity that they're
planning, and that U.S. business can and should get into that market,''
Ballantine said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president proposed a package of conservation incentives a year ago but
Republicans in Congress, leery of the unratified international climate change
agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, wouldn't go along.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy use in developing countries will overtake that of industrialized
countries by 2020, representing a market for technology and energy products of
between $4 billion and $5 billion, a White House primer on the initiative said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend will continue, with developing countries accounting for 75 percent
of the increase in global energy use between now and 2050, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other industrialized countries, which have already
reaped both benefit and harm from the use of fuels such as coal, want to
encourage developing countries to choose cleaner options. Vice President Al Gore
and others cite the dangers of global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   Some poorer countries have resisted this push as meddling from rich
neighbors. The new money, spread among several U.S. government agencies,
including the Export-Import Bank and the Energy Department, is intended to help
decision-makers abroad get comfortable with new technology that may carry higher
upfront costs but pay off in the long run, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The initiative will help lay the technical and policy foundation,'' for
poorer countries ``to build a clean energy future, leapfrogging past the
polluting energy technologies used by the industrial countries,'' the White
House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will send Congress his spending proposals for fiscal year 2001 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also outlined a plan to give $4 billion in tax incentives over
five years to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging people to buy
more energy-efficient cars, homes and other products.
</P>
<P>
	   That plan, which also requires congressional approval, would give a tax
break to home buyers who choose a new, energy-efficient house. The tax credit
would be $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the energy efficiency of the home.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House also wants a tax credit for energy-efficient water heaters
and other equipment in homes and commercial buildings. The credit would be 20
percent of the cost of the equipment, up to a cap. Similar proposals died in
Congress last year.

<HEADLINE> Man Acquitted After 25 Years in Jail  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- After 25 years in prison, John Duval finally feels
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
	   The former transvestite prostitute was acquitted of murder Wednesday after
being put on trial for the second time for the bludgeoning and strangling of a
Philadelphia businessman in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval dropped his head and sobbed when the jury delivered its verdict after
a week of testimony and two days of deliberations. Relatives in the gallery
erupted in cheers and shouts of ``hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel overwhelmed,'' Duval said later, still dabbing his eyes. ``I always
maintained my faith.''
</P>
<P>
	   Duval, 47, had been freed last spring on the basis of new evidence. If he
had been convicted again of second-degree murder, he would have been returned to
prison and remained there until he died or was granted parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Haworth, 52, a consultant from Philadelphia to Eastman Kodak Co.,
left his hotel the night of May 24, 1973, apparently in search of a prostitute.
He was found dead in an alley the next morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson were convicted on the basis of
confessions they insist were beaten out of them by a rogue detective, and on the
testimony of two teen-age runaways. They were sentenced in February 1974 to 25
years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the teen witnesses, Wayne Wright, recanted his testimony in 1997,
saying he had lied about seeing Duval and Tyson with the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors then came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the
other teen, Jon Jackson, in which he denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the
victim -- contrary to what the teens had testified in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling that evidence was wrongfully suppressed, a judge freed Tyson in May
1998 and Duval last April. While prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson -- the
city gave her $1.2 million in compensation -- they went after Duval again. While
Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his
guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Gilda Sherrod-Ali, said in closing arguments that Duval lied to
the parole board in 1995 and in 1997 because ``he believed that was the only way
he could get out.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stock Prices Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks extended gains Thursday amid hopes that new
investment trust funds will draw more investors into the market. The U.S. dollar
fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished up 207.51 points, or
1.06 percent, at 19,786.42. On Wednesday, the average closed up 155.53 points,
or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar was trading at 108.18
yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 0.32 yen from its level of 108.50 yen late
Wednesday and below 108.26 yen overnight in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's benchmark stock index rose for a second day, buoyed by hopes for
several large-scale investment trusts set to be launched over the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds, many of which are targeting shares in technology companies, are
expected to encourage more individual investors to come into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   But some traders cautioned that the Nikkei's rise was based largely on
market sentiment rather than economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
	   "For now, the market is supported merely by investor hopes for good demand
for investment trust funds," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo
Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Nomura Asset Management, a subsidiary of Japan's biggest brokerage house,
raised about 800 billion yen (dlrs 7.4 billion) on Wednesday, the launch day for
its "Big Project-N" fund. The fund has a 1 trillion yen (dlrs 9.26 billion)
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage shares in general finished higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 points,
or 0.3 percent, to close at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 21.98 points, or 0.54
percent, to finish at 4,073.96.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
17.62 points, or 1.02 percent, at 1,729.48. On Wednesday, the index rose 14.71
points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,711.86.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency markets, traders sold the greenback to take profits after buying
up dollars on anticipation of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation of an increase was confirmed Wednesday when the Fed announced it
had decided to raise key rates. Investors then decided to cash in on their
dollar holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said, however, the outlook for the U.S. currency remained strong,
since the increase in interest rates makes the dollar more attractive to
Japanese investors because it leads to a higher yield on dollar-denominated
assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese government officials repeated their concerns about an excessively
strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda told
reporters Thursday morning that the ministry's foreign exchange stance remained
opposed to a higher-valued yen.
</P>
<P>
	   An excessively strong yen hurts export-based Japanese companies, as it
decreases their profitability when dollar earnings are repatriated back into
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 105.30 yen, above its level of
104.77 yen yen late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8450
from its close at 1.8350 Wednesday. Its price fell 0.09 point to 98.68.

<HEADLINE> Report: No English on Malay TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- In an effort to keep the national language
pure, Malaysia's state-run television and radio will no longer allow programs
that mix English or other foreign words with Malay, news reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Information Minister Khalid Yunus said a committee had been set up at
the government-owned Radio-Television Malaysia to scrutinize all scripts to
ensure producers were minding the language rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are firm in the usage of proper Bahasa Malaysia,'' or the Malay
language, Khalid was quoted as saying in The Star newspaper. He said that the
rule, which was in effect before but never enforced, was part of an effort to
protect the national language from being polluted and tarnished.
</P>
<P>
	   Spoken Malay is often a mixture of the languages used by the country's
different ethnic groups. Bind together the multilingual nation, it is a modern
language scripted in English and Arabic, and many words have their roots in
Persian, Arabic, English and Sanskrit.
</P>
<P>
	   In the nation of 22 million ethnic Malays, Chinese and Indians, English is
also widely spoken as a vestige of its former colonial rulers. But it is often
unrecognizable because of the local slangs attached to almost every sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalid added that even Cabinet ministers speaking on news shows would have
to comply with the rule. Exemptions would be made only where no Malay words
existed, he said.

Wide Gaps Divide Barak, Arafat

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Only 10 days before a crucial deadline in peace talks, a
senior Israeli official said today the gap between Palestinian and Israeli
positions was still so wide that a Camp David-style summit was not realistic at
this point. Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon spoke just hours before Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were slated to meet to
try to find a way to iron out the differences in the last phase of the peace
process. The two leaders have committed to produce a framework agreement for a
final peace treaty by Feb. 13, but officials from both sides said the chances of

Klestil is expected to confirm the coalition Thursday, despite a growing wave of
threats and protests from abroad against a government with Haider's Freedom
party. In an attempt to spare Austria international isolation, Klestil has
requested Haider and Wolfgang Schuessel, head of the conservative People's Party
and the likely new chancellor, sign a "declaration of values of European
democracy."

<HEADLINE> Operator Finally Rescued From Crane  </HEADLINE>
   By DIANE SCARPONI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- For eight hours, Robert Fitch lay buried alive in the
cab of a crane under 6 feet of twisted steel after a construction accident
killed two of his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers and rescue crews painstakingly used welding torches, hydraulic tools
and even hand saws to try to free the man they called ``Bobby.'' They held their
breath against the chance that their work could upset the heap of metal and bury
him even deeper.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Fitch's sons stayed by his side throughout the ordeal, as the
temperatures dropped into the low 20s and darkness fell. He was given
intravenous blood and plasma and blankets to keep him warm.
</P>
<P>
	   When the last piece of steel was removed and Fitch was freed Wednesday
night, his survival was hailed as a miracle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was a tremendous rescue today, for him to come alive out of that
vehicle,'' said Fire Chief Louis LaVecchia.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitch, 62, of North Branford, suffered injuries to both legs and had
hypothermia. He was listed in critical but stable condition Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the accident were Kevin Winslow, 43, of Newington, and Wayne Most,
38, of West Hartford, both boilermakers on the construction job. Another worker,
George Scrivner, 36, of East Haddam, was treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of Wednesday's collapse wasn't known. Inspectors from the state
and the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration were expected to tour
the site today.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident happened at about 10:30 a.m., when an 80-foot arch that was
meant to house a boiling unit for a new gas-fired power plant toppled over onto
Fitch's crane.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact snapped off the arm of the crane, which landed in a heap on top
of the pile of steel. Fitch, the crane operator, was trapped in the cab, with
steel pinning his legs and chest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The building has collapsed on top of the crane, and the crane is on top of
the building,'' said Fire Capt. Robin Tummins. ``It's almost like pickup
sticks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some workers were ordered home for the day, while others stayed at the site
to assist rescue efforts. Relatives of construction workers came by the plant
all day, hoping to find that their loved ones escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Milford is on the Connecticut shoreline, about 60 miles northeast of New
York City.

<HEADLINE> Survey Details Airline Delays  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers have a message: We will not go quietly
from bad service on that last flight.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the number of complaints to the Transportation Department
concerning the 10 major U.S. carriers more than doubled, ballooning to 13,709
from 5,808 in 1998. This increase occurred while the number of passengers on
those carriers increased by about 16 million between 1998 and 1999 to 553.8
million, a growth of about 3 percent, the department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints could include such things as scheduling, overbooking, fares,
baggage and service.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 airlines themselves reported more than 2.5 million complaints about
lost or damaged luggage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The irritation level is just a lot higher,'' said David Stempler,
president of the Air Travelers Association, a passenger advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Stempler said years of increasing numbers of air travelers has led to full
planes, stressed nerves and strained airline resources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We keep demanding of the airlines that they provide low fares, and one of
the ways they do that is by tightening up the seat rows, by reducing the amount
of food, by reducing the number of flight attendants. Then we complain about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A major focus of traveler ire last year was America West, which had the
highest rate of passenger complaints to the Transportation Department, nearly
four for every 100,000 passengers. The average for all 10 major airlines was
roughly 2 1/2 complaints for every 100,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the America West complaints related to cancellations and delays, and
if air travelers took attendance, the airline would be held after class for
chronic tardiness. The Phoenix-based company had the poorest on-time arrival
record of any major airline in 1999, with almost a third of its flights pulling
up to terminal gates more than 15 minutes behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA stood at the head of the class, with close to 81 percent of its flights
delivering passengers on time, according to the Air Travel Consumer Report
issued Wednesday. The Transportation Department report does not specify the
reasons for flight delays, which might be caused by severe weather, air traffic
control decisions, passenger problems or equipment failures.
</P>
<P>
	   The report showed that less than 70 percent of America West's flights
arrived on time in 1999. The airline also had the most arrival delays in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said she couldn't comment until
reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing only slightly better than America West in terms of delays was Alaska
Airlines, with 29 percent of its flights arriving late at the gate. U.S. Airways
rounded out the bottom three with close to 29 percent of its flights being
tardy.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the Transportation Department's inspector general began
accepting complaints from consumers concerned about airline overbooking and
ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerning reports of mishandled bags, United Airlines had the worst record,
with 543,491 complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest Airlines had the lowest rate of complaints overall last year, with
only 0.4 for every 100,000 air travelers. The airline also had the lowest
percentage of reports concerning bags that were damaged, lost or delayed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Southwest had been the on-time arrival winner but slipped to No. 2
last year with an 80 percent on-time record.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost in a dead heat with Southwest, Northwest came in third for on-time
arrivals, a big improvement for the airline that had ranked No. 9 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 air carriers were Alaska, America West, American, Continental, Delta,
Northwest, Southwest, TWA, United and US Airways.

<HEADLINE> Russians To Study Tanker Detention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign minister said today it was necessary to
determine the origin of oil aboard a Russian tanker detained by the U.S. Navy in
the Persian Gulf before deciding on a formal response.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. Navy ship stopped the Russian merchant vessel, Volgoneft-147, off the
coast of the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday and was taking oil samples to
determine whether it was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of a U.N. trade
embargo, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the ITAR-Tass news agency that he had no
immediate comment on the detention, saying ``it is necessary to analyze
everything carefully -- who the tanker belongs to and whose oil it was
carrying.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry official told the Interfax news agency that the
tanker was transporting fuel oil from Iran. The information was obtained from
the ship's owner, the Transpetro-Volga company, who presented the necessary
documents to the U.S. Navy, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Pentagon, the vessel was traveling away from Iraq, through
the Straits of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department spokesman P.J. Crowley did not say if the Pentagon knew
where the Russian ship had picked up the oil. If the oil is found to have come
from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an Emirates
port to haul the ship to a nearby port and dispose of the contraband, Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the U.N. Security Council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are trying to determine whether oil aboard
a Russian tanker the Navy detained in the Persian Gulf came from Iraq in
violation of the U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey stopped the Russian merchant vessel
Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said today it was necessary
to determine the origin of oil before deciding on a formal response.

</P>
<P>
	   Crowley did not say whether U.S. officials knew where the Russian ship had
picked up the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping a Russian ship was ``not new but it is unusual,'' said Jim Kout,
another Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said U.S.
officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal diplomatic
channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said in October that Navy ships had diverted at least five
ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems searching for
contraband in the preceding month. The United States and Britain are the main
enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Try To Overturn FEC Ruling  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deadlocked Federal Election Commission has dropped its
investigation of foreign donations to the Republican Party, sparking a lawsuit
from the same Democratic officials who instigated the probe in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that it had asked the
U.S. District Court in Washington to force the FEC to proceed with its probe of
a $2.1 million donation in 1994 to the Republican National Committee's National
Policy Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   The contribution was solicited from a Hong Kong businessman, Ambrous Young
by then-party chairman Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
	   The forum used $1.6 million of the funds to pay off a loan from the RNC,
which, in turn, spent the money to help the GOP in the 1994 elections. The
National Policy Forum eventually defaulted on the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats asked the FEC to investigate. General Counsel Lawrence Noble
concluded in September: ``Both Mr. Barbour and the RNC knew the foreign source
of the security for the loan, and that the known purpose of seeking repayment in
1994 was to make funds available to the RNC for the upcoming elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noble's office recommended the commission proceed with the investigation.
But the six-member commission deadlocked along party lines, 3-3, thus ending the
case, according to records in the case made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic officials want a judge to force the FEC to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the Republican Party and the leading Republican presidential
candidates start throwing stones about campaign finance reform and foreign
contributions, they had better make sure their own house is in order,'' DNC
National Chairman Joe Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC spokeswoman Kelly Huff said the agency could not comment because the
matter is in litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said the lawsuit was an
attempt to divert attention from Democratic fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democrats have no shortage of lawyers willing to file frivolous
lawsuits,'' Collins said. ``This is basically a subterfuge to cover up what
(Democratic) Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said was an embarrassing effort to
violate the law in 1996 by the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee was forced to return millions of dollars
in campaign contributions after the 1996 elections amid allegations that they
came from foreign sources, which is illegal.

<HEADLINE> CIA Director Details World Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet, in an annual appearance before
the Senate intelligence committee to outline world threats, said the world
remains a dangerous place more than a decade after the end of the Cold War and
that technology and the rising threat of terrorism has only increased that
danger. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --INDIA-PAKISTAN. Deep-seated rivalries persist among the world's two newest
declared nuclear powers. The October coup in Pakistan that brought a military
leader to power makes it even less likely that India will be willing to resume
peace talks. ``Pakistanis are equally suspicious of India's newly elected
coalition.'' Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues through the winter in disputed
Kashmir, with ``potential to fuel a wider and more dangerous conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   --NORTH KOREA. North Korea may already have the theoretical capability of
delivering ``a small biological or chemical weapon to the United States,'' and
may soon be capable of delivering a nuclear payload. Given North Korea's
economic woes and a population losing confidence in its rulers, ``sudden,
radical, and possibly dangerous change remains a real possibility... and that
change could come at any time.''
</P>
<P>
	   --RUSSIA. Russia's economic difficulties ``continue to weaken the
reliability'' of its system for controlling its nuclear arsenal. ``We have no
evidence that weapons are missing in Russia, but we remain concerned by reports
of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale and criminal activities at nuclear
storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   --THE CAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. With the conflict in Chechnya forcing a
stream of refugees into neighboring areas and with economies stagnating and
organized crime on the rise, ``the region could become a breeding ground for a
new generation of Islamic extremists, taking advantage of increasing
dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
	   --IRAN. Iran's government will remain hostile to U.S. interests, at least
for now; and the regime will ``probably'' have ballistic missile capable of
delivering a ``light payload to the United States'' within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   --IRAQ. Despite a worsening economy, increasing domestic unrest and U.S. and
British enforcement of no-fly zones, Saddam Hussein has ``shown himself to be
politically agile enough to weather these challenges.'' Major worries are
Saddam's reconstruction of suspected weapons sites destroyed in Operation Desert
Fox, missile development work, and the fact that Iraq continues to have a
conventional military that remains the largest in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   --THE BALKANS. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ``hold on power has
not been seriously shaken in the past few months.'' He still controls the
military, his inner circle remains ``loyal or at least cowed,'' and he controls
an ``effective media machine.'' This comes as Serbia has become the poorest
country in Europe in the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --CHINA. There is ``high potential for another military flare-up across the
Taiwan Strait'' this year, with the catalyst being the March 18 elections in
Taiwan. China has been building up its forces arrayed along the Strait.
</P>
<P>
	   --INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. The United States' attraction as a terrorist
target continues to increase. Fugitive Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden,
continuing to operate out of Afghanistan, is ``still foremost'' among terrorists
feared by the U.S. intelligence community. ``Everything we have learned recently
confirms our conviction that he wants to strike further blows against America.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials denied today that a Russian tanker detained
by the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of a
United Nations trade embargo, and demanded that the vessel be released.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. Navy ship stopped the merchant vessel Volga-Neft-147 off the coast of
the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday and took oil samples to determine whether
it was carrying Iraqi oil, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said the tanker was carrying fuel
oil from Iran to various ports in the Emirates when it was detained.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Judging from the ship's documents, there can be no talk of Iraqi oil,'' he
told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there was no way the ship's owner, Transpetro-Volga, could determine
the origin of the oil loaded in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin denied the tanker was carrying
contraband Iraqi crude oil. Sredin told Interfax that the tanker did not enter
either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports and must be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu-Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sredin said Russia had ``urged the American side not to take any hasty,
forceful measures before we conduct our own investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Pentagon, when the vessel was stopped, it was traveling
away from Iraq through the Straits of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the

</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu-Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,
through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowley did not say whether U.S. officials knew where the Russian ship had
picked up the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping a Russian ship was ``not new but it is unusual,'' said Jim Kout,
another Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said U.S.
officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal diplomatic
channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said in October that Navy ships had diverted at least five
ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems searching for
contraband in the preceding month. The United States and Britain are the main
enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the U.N. Security Council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Prayer Breakfast  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, at a prayer breakfast with political
and religious leaders, today decried religious and ethnic intolerance around the
world and said Washington politicians are guilty of ``dishonest demonization''
in the heat of political battle.
</P>
<P>
	   The president and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined several thousand
people at the Washington Hilton for the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual
gathering of members of Congress, Cabinet members, clergy and lay people. It is
a ritual dating back to 1952 when a group of lawmakers gathered to pray for
newly elected President Dwight Eisenhower and his government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a special year for me because ... I'm not coming back, at least in
my present position,'' said Clinton. He will leave office next Jan. 20 but hopes
to return to Washington from time to time as a Senate spouse, if his wife is
successful in her campaign for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning to a familiar theme, Clinton urged reconciliation among rival
groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today the Irish peace process is strained by a lack of trust between
Republican Catholics and Protestant Unionists,'' the president said. ``In the
Middle East, with all its hope, we are still having to work very hard to
overcome the profoundest of suspicions between Israeli Jews and Palestinian and
Syrian Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted rivalries on the Indian subcontinent, in Bosnia and Kosovo and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Here at home we still see Asians, blacks, gays, even in one instance last
year children at a Jewish school, subject to attacks just because of who they
are,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And here in Washington we are not blameless,'' the president added. ``For
we often, too, forget in the heat of political battle our common humanity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We slip from honest difference which is healthy into dishonest
demonization. We ignore when we're all tight and in a fight all those biblical
admonitions we profess to believe, that we all see through a glass darkly, that
with St. Paul we all do what we would not, and we do not do what we would.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also urged the audience to ponder ``what responsibilities are now
imposed on us because we live at perhaps the greatest moment of prosperity and
promise in the history of our nation, at a time when the world is growing ever
more interdependent. What special responsibilities do we have?''
</P>
<P>
	   Even in America, Clinton said, there are too many poor children and too many
communities that have not benefited from the nation's prosperity.

<HEADLINE> McCain N.H. Win Revives TV Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks knew John McCain was going to be a big
winner before the last vote was cast in the New Hampshire primary -- and
couldn't resist telling people about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary night revived a quadrennial concern for networks about whether they
should report how an election is going while the polls are still open.
</P>
<P>
	   The three cable news networks used exit polls to declare McCain the winner
over GOP frontrunner George W. Bush at 7 p.m. EST Tuesday, when most -- although
not all -- of New Hampshire's polls closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox News Channel's Brit Hume reported at 6 p.m. that "all signs point to a
very good night for John McCain." Much of the next hour included discussion
about the implications of a big McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "To do otherwise would have taken us completely off what we knew to be the
news," Hume said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Early victory projections were a big issue in the 1980s, when West Coast
politicians worried that network calls on a presidential race would keep voters
at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Research on whether this was true has been inconclusive, said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. But networks
have generally waited in recent elections to avoid alienating voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With two new cable news networks for this presidential election and more
refined exit polling, there is a greater temptation to break ranks, said
Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Public Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of a competition among news networks on who could call the race
first, "we got into a race of who could insinuate first," Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the "CBS Evening News" at 6:30 p.m. Monday, Dan Rather said there were
"early indications of possible surprises" in both parties. Correspondent Bob
Schieffer said exit polls concluded New Hampshire Republicans gave McCain an
"astonishing" 70 percent favorability rating.
</P>
<P>
	   David Bloom said on NBC's "Nightly News" that "the McCain camp is brimming
with confidence tonight, and Bush aides appear resigned to defeat."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC waited until 8 p.m., when all New Hampshire polls had closed, to declare
McCain the victor. But Peter Jennings reported 90 minutes earlier that it
appeared to be a good day for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenstiel said that television commentators "pushed the semantic envelope
more last night than I have seen in a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   "We would argue that it's not semantic," ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.
"You're not projecting a winner."
</P>
<P>
	   CNN's 7 p.m. declaration made for one awkward moment: a half-hour later,
Judy Woodruff noted on the air that polls hadn't closed everywhere in New
Hampshire and that voters should exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN political director Tom Hannon said he had emphasized to correspondents
not to let what they knew from exit polls seep into their reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The risk of influencing, potentially, the outcome of an election is a
weighty responsibility, so we kind of play it straight," Hannon said. "I
recognize that it's a difficult issue. I'm not trying to imply any criticism of
the other networks."
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said Fox tries to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't want it to be a situation where the media and all the players
know what the score is and the spectators don't," he said. "There's nothing more
journalistically suspect to me than a bunch of journalists working with a head
full of knowledge and not telling the audience."

<HEADLINE> Russia Tanker Searched for Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are trying to determine whether oil aboard
a Russian tanker the Navy detained in the Persian Gulf came from Iraq in
violation of the U.N. trade embargo. Russian officials said the oil came from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey stopped the Russian merchant vessel
Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Russian officials have been kept
informed of the process. ``I don't know if they've formally protested,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said inspectors had boarded ships 700 times last year and diverted them
to port for further investigation 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who want to engage in smuggling certainly will use whatever ways or
whatever methods are available to them,'' Lockhart said. ``It's the U.N.'s
responsibliity to make sure we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian officials denied that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said the tanker was carrying fuel
oil from Iran to various ports in the Emirates. ``Judging from the ship's
documents, there can be no talk of Iraqi oil,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told Interfax that the tanker did not
enter either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports and must be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 38.79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks are mostly higher this morning as an optimistic
profit forecast from Amazon.com and a rally in the bond market have prompted a
wave of buying.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 38.79 at 11,041.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 7.97 at 1,417.09, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 82.11 at
4,156.07.
</P>
<P>
	   Online retailer Amazon.com led the Nasdaq, rising 9 7/16 from its 4 p.m.
close to 78 7/8. The company said late Wednesday that while it posted its worst
losses ever during the fourth quarter of 1999, sales more than doubled.
Investors today were also enticed by the company's claim that losses will narrow
significantly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks also benefited from a continued rally in the bond market. Long-term
Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week, soared on
Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part of the
Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.13 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market also drew some support from the Federal Reserve's
widely anticipated decision Wednesday to raise interest rates by a
quarter-point, its fourth hike since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 145.10 million shares, well ahead of
Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.94 to 515.83.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hints at Wage Bill Veto  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foreshadowing a partisan, election-year battle, the White
House today hinted that President Clinton may veto a minimum wage increase if
Republican lawmakers insist on keeping ``narrowly written'' tax breaks attached
to it.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is not opposed to tax
reductions this year. But he also doesn't want GOP lawmakers to view that as
``an excuse for providing narrowly written special-interest tax breaks for
businesses that are doing quite well.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kind of unfunded, unpaid-for special-interest tax breaks that were put
forward by Republicans in this bill do not increase the chances of getting a
bankruptcy bill signed in this building,'' Lockhart said. ``I expect the
Congress to be realistic about how this will be paid for.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate kicked off the fight Wednesday, passing a $1-an-hour minimum wage
increase that the White House said was too stingy to workers and also would give
unwarranted tax cuts to some businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-written bill would gradually raise the current $5.15 hourly
minimum wage to $6.15 by March 2002. The increase was contained in legislation
revamping bankruptcy laws that passed 83-14, although there was no separate vote
on the minimum wage provision.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has yet to pass its own minimum wage legislation because
Republican leaders there lack the votes for a similar proposal. And with Clinton
and Democrats complaining that the wage increase would take too long to phase in
and opposing small business tax cuts that both GOP packages include, quick
enactment seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   With many Republicans -- especially in the House -- eager to avoid repeated
campaign-season attacks on the widely popular issue, some increase seems likely
to become law before Election Day. House leaders hope for a vote on the issue by
late March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Tuesday when
asked about the minimum wage increase. ``Obviously, we don't have the votes to
stop minimum wage, so we ought to do something that lessens the burden on people
that pay the wages.''
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a GOP bill that
would increase the minimum wage by $1 over three years and cut taxes by $30
billion over five years. Some $16 billion of that price tag is a reduction in
the estate taxes paid by upper-income people who inherit substantial assets.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fate of the House legislation is unclear. With defections likely by
moderate Republicans from urban, Northeastern districts, GOP leaders are short
of the votes needed to move the bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate GOP measure contains $18 billion in tax cuts over five years --
mostly for small business owners.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP's desire to avoid making the proposal a campaign issue gives
Democrats little incentive to quickly settle for anything less than what they
want: a two-year phase-in, with a much smaller tax package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just don't think Republicans will want to mess around with this issue
this year,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``I don't think they will fall on
their swords over the three-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 million Americans are paid the minimum wage. About half of them are
less than 24 years old, and many hold part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The potency of the minimum wage as a campaign issue was last illustrated in
1996, another campaign year. After initial opposition by many Republicans,
Congress finally voted to raise the wage from $4.25 to its current $5.15 in two
steps.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Senate bill would increase the wage by 35 cents an hour in March
2000, by 35 cents more in March 2001 and 30 cents in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The language was added to the bankruptcy bill in November after Democrats
tried unsuccessfully to force their own version into the legislation. The
Democratic alternative would have raised the minimum wage by $1 in two 50-cent
increases over 13 months, while also providing $9.6 billion in tax relief and
raising other taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In a dispute the two parties have fought for decades, Democrats say that
with many Americans flush from the booming economy, the time is ripe to raise
the minimum wage. They say the difference between their version and the GOP
language would cost each minimum-wage earner $1,200.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The watered-down wage proposal in this bill is an insult to hardworking
men and women,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of the Democratic
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers argue that businesses might eliminate up to 500,000 jobs,
rather than increase minimum salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do we get passed a very defensible bill that would not increase the
number of unemployed as dramatically as Kennedy's amendment would do,'' is how
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., described the GOP's task. ``Tax
relief is an important component of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bankruptcy provision would make it harder for people to erase credit
card and other debt through bankruptcy. If debtors were found to have enough
income to pay back at least 25 percent of their debts over five years, they
would be required to repay them, rather than have them wiped out.
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed a similar bankruptcy bill last May. The next step is for
the two chambers to try working out a compromise measure.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch's storing of national
security secrets on a home computer was a serious lapse in security but not
comparable to allegations against a former Los Alamos scientist, CIA Director
George Tenet insisted today.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal CIA report that Deutch stored some of the nation's most
sensitive national security secrets on a computer that also was used to access
pornographic Internet sites and to receive and send e-mail has generated alarm
among congressional intelligence overseers and throughout the intelligence
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet, who stripped Deutch of his security clearances last August over the
dispute, found himself defending the CIA's handling of the case for a second day
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   During today's session of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Wayne
Allard, R-Colo., asked why Deutch was being treated differently from Wen Ho Lee
since ``both of them made similar mistakes in the fact that they both had
information that was very important to this country on unsecured computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has been indicted for mishandling nuclear-weapons secrets, is being held
without bond and could face life in prison if he is convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In one instance, there is an intent to do harm to the United States.
That's a legal judgment that's been made. In the other instance, a similar legal
judgment was not made,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA referred the Deutch matter to the Justice Department, but Justice
decided not to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the cases are similar. That's not to say that this case
involving the former director is not serious. If it was not serious, I would not
have taken the action'' in revoking Deutch's security clearances, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet also said that Lee has been accused of transferring classified
computer files to other computers, while Deutch for the most part created the
sensitive files himself while working from home.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet declined to discuss new revelations that an e-mail from a Russian
scientist was found on the hard drive of one of Deutch's CIA-issued home
computers, and that someone in the Deutch household had used the computers to
access ``high risk'' sites on the Internet, including pornography sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't and I won't,'' Tenet told the Armed Services panel.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the material should have remained confidential, and that Senate and
House intelligence committees were pursuing the matter. ``Let the matter rest
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., called the reports of Deutch's
computer behavior ``very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony a day earlier to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tenet said
there was no evidence that Deutch's unsecured home computer had been hacked into
by foreign adversaries. But neither was there any sure way to tell that it
hadn't been, given that the technology exists for such intrusions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was enormously sensitive material on this computer, at the highest
levels of classification,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional and intelligence community sources familiar with the
investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said among the e-mail
messages sent to Deutch was one from Europe from an individual who identified
himself as former Russian scientist.
</P>
<P>
	   As to the e-mail supposedly from a former Russian scientist, investigators
determined that the e-mail was incoming, and not solicited or answered by
Deutch, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA investigators studied data on the hard drive of the home computer used
by Deutch and were able to identify various pieces of e-mail and Internet
addresses that had been accessed by Deutch and members of his household though
an America Online account, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sources said there was no evidence that Deutch himself had visited any
of the pornographic sites, and that some of the times that had been logged did
not match up with times when Deutch was at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was among those delivering the sharpest criticism of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did. He worked around the clock. He didn't think
about what he was doing,'' Tenet told the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August 1999, even though
the CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began
in December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet had been Deutch's deputy. Tenet was sworn in as CIA director in July
1997 after serving as acting director during the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet denied he deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's
computer practices. However, he conceded, ``The internal investigation took too
long. The process was not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's criminal division investigated Deutch's computer
use and declined last spring to prosecute, referring the case to the CIA
inspector general for administrative discipline, according to Justice officials
who requested anonymity. The division found the lapses were sloppy rather than
nefarious.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as an optimistic profit
forecast from Amazon.com and a rally in the bond market prompted a wave of
buying.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
8.69 at 11,011.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 9.44 at 1,418.56, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 89.44 at
4,163.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Online retailer Amazon.com led the Nasdaq, rising 10 15/16 from its 4 p.m.
close to 80 3/8. The company said late Wednesday that while it posted its worst
losses ever during the fourth quarter of 1999, sales more than doubled.
Investors today were also enticed by the company's claim that losses will narrow
significantly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other large-capitalization technology stocks also advanced. Cisco Systems
rose 3 3/16 to 117 1/16 and Intel rose 4 7/64 to 104 11/64.
</P>
<P>
	   "The action and performance is still being placed on the shoulders of the
heavily indexed stocks," said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum &AMP; Co. Those companies -- the market's best performers in 1999 --
are now so widely held and so coveted that investors see them as the safest bets
for 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks also benefited from a continued rally in the bond market. Long-term
Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week, soared on
Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part of the
Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.13 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market also drew some support from the Federal Reserve's
widely anticipated decision Wednesday to raise interest rates by a
quarter-point, its fourth hike since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 343.10 million shares, well ahead of
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.90 to 516.79.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tanker Searched for Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are trying to determine whether oil aboard
a Russian tanker the Navy detained in the Persian Gulf came from Iraq in
violation of the U.N. trade embargo. Russian officials said the oil came from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey stopped the Russian merchant vessel
Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Russian officials have been kept
informed of the process. ``I don't know if they've formally protested,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said inspectors had boarded ships 700 times last year and diverted them
to port for further investigation 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who want to engage in smuggling certainly will use whatever ways or
whatever methods are available to them,'' Lockhart said. ``It's the U.N.'s
responsibliity to make sure we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian officials denied that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said the tanker was carrying fuel
oil from Iran to various ports in the Emirates. ``Judging from the ship's
documents, there can be no talk of Iraqi oil,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told Interfax that the tanker did not
enter either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports and must be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,
through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowley did not say whether U.S. officials knew where the Russian ship had
picked up the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping a Russian ship was ``not new but it is unusual,'' said Jim Kout,
another Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said
U.S. officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal
diplomatic channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said in October that Navy ships had diverted at least five
ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems searching for
contraband in the preceding month. The United States and Britain are the main
enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until the U.N. Security Council lifted the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports on
Dec. 17, Iraq had been unable to sell its oil on the open market because of
sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Navy: Russian Tanker Has Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Navy officials say oil aboard a Russian tanker
detained in the Persian gulf is believed to have come from Iraq in violation of
a U.N. trade embargo. Russian officials said the oil came from Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey, operating as part of an
international force monitoring Persian Gulf waters, stopped the Russian merchant
vessel Volga-Neft-147 Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The suspected sanctions violator, which was tracked beginning with its
departure from Iraqi water until its interception, is believed to be carrying
petroleum products of Iraqi origin prohibited from export by U.N. sanctions,''
the Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said the vessel was boarded for inspection in accordance with
``standard operating procedure as a result of its last port of call and failure
to respond to routine inquiries regarding its intentions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense

	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,
through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cargo is still under inspection, but gasoil and information onboard
indicate that the cargo came from Iraq,'' Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck of the 5th Fleet
said in Bahrain. Gasoil is a type of crude used for diesel engines and sometimes
for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   Gradeck said that with the increase in world oil prices last year, the
smuggling of Iraqi crude had increased ``quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, some 191,000 metric tons of oil was smuggled from Iraq, he
said. In January, the figure jumped to 367,000 metric tons. As a result, the
fleet of Western warships that monitors Gulf waters for sanctions violations has
also increased its activities, Gradeck said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Protect Prairie Dog  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department decided today the black-tailed
prairie dog merits protection as a threatened species but said it is too busy
dealing with higher-priority plants and wildlife to take steps to preserve the
rodent that has long been a pest to ranchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The prairie dog will be added to a list of candidates for threatened status
under the Endangered Species Act, but there will be no restrictions placed on
landowners to protect it. Its status will be reviewed annually, however, and it
could move up the priority list if voluntary conservation efforts are
unsuccessful, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Colonies of prairie dogs once were found on as many as 100 million acres
from Canada to Mexico, but the animal has been decimated by disease, eradication
programs and housing development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All this is, is a wakeup call that we need some purposeful management for
this species,'' said Pete Gober, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who led a
year-long study of the animal.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight western states -- Arizona, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas and Wyoming -- have agreed to come up with a plan by next year for
monitoring and protecting the animal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The black-tailed prairie dog is a very resilient species. It's handled a
lot over the years,'' Gober said. ``Hopefully we'll be able to work with those
states to avoid the necessity of listing the species.''
</P>
<P>
	   The annual reviews will look at how the prairie dog is doing and whether it
should be removed from the candidate list or moved up in priority.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fish and Wildlife Service's regional office in Denver already has
proposed several species for listing as endangered or threatened, including the
lynx, mountain plover and Colorado butterfly plant. Endangered status means that
a species is in danger of extinction; threatened status means it could become
endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Wildlife Federation, which had petitioned for listing of the
black-tailed prairie dog, said it was pleased with the department's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision ``sends an important signal from the federal government that
the prairie dog's plight is dire and that serious changes must be made in the
way we manage it,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest threat to the prairie dog is a form of the bubonic plague that
can wipe out entire colonies, Gober said. The animals have no immunity to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The plague is now widespread through much of the prairie dog's historic
range with the exception of most of South Dakota and portions of Kansas,
Nebraska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It is no coincidence that four of the seven
largest remaining colonies of the animals are in South Dakota, the study said.

<HEADLINE> PBS Takes Tour of Maine Town  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In tiny Belfast, Maine, they check their lobster traps at
the crack of dawn. They press trousers at the laundry. They make doughnuts and
take ballet.
</P>
<P>
	   They study "Moby Dick" in school. They go to church. They plead guilty in
court to stealing firewood.
</P>
<P>
	   And on it goes. In his wondrous new documentary, "Belfast, Maine," Frederick
Wiseman takes us on a private tour of this coastal community for four keenly
observed hours. A presentation of Thirteen/WNET, it premieres on PBS Friday at 9
p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wiseman's film, we see a social worker picking nits out of a woman's hair
while the woman bounces a baby in her lap. We see men talk logging over their
breakfast at Goose River Groceries. We see a rehearsal for a local production of
"Death of a Salesman." We see an infant christened.
</P>
<P>
	   What do we learn? Wiseman makes no grand pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've tried to capture some aspects -- although obviously not all, you'd
never get it all -- of what constitutes daily life in Belfast," he says. "And
that's it."
</P>
<P>
	   He even downplays the idea that his film might shed light on other small
towns. "I don't know," he declares. "I haven't made a survey."
</P>
<P>
	   "Belfast, Maine" is Wiseman's 30th documentary, his 30th look at social
institutions in a career that has produced such films as "High School,"
"Welfare," "Hospital," "Basic Training" and his first, "Titicut Follies," which
in 1967 brought viewers into the State Prison for the Criminally Insane at
Bridgewater, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   For his labors, Wiseman has received three Emmy awards and a Peabody, as
well as a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. A retrospective of all 30 films is
under way this month at the Lincoln Center Film Society, which has brought him
from his home in Cambridge, Mass., to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The subject of "Belfast, Maine," he tells a reporter during his visit, "is
normal behavior, different aspects of contemporary life. Frequently, that's very
complicated. I try to include in the film reflections of the complexity I
observe."
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe that's why Wiseman spent eight weeks among the 6,474 residents of
Belfast in the fall of 1996, and shot a copious 110 hours of film. Maybe that's
why it took him 14 months at the editing table to shape that raw footage into
episodes of real life, unfolding as if in real time.
</P>
<P>
	   And maybe that's why he resists the simple answers, the easy conclusions.
That just wouldn't be his style.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like to make didactic films," he says. "I don't want to fall victim
to ideological blinders, so that I'm only seeing one thing."
</P>
<P>
	   A soft-voiced man with soulful eyes and a mouth that curls into a
mischievous smile, Wiseman has the heedful detachment of a psychotherapist,
gently turning a question back on itself to find the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider the sequence at the tin-roofed factory that churns out baked
stuffed potatoes. This eight-minute interlude begins with a fork-lift truck
hefting great sacks of spuds, and concludes with the grocery-ready product being
packed into boxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In between, some 70 shots add up to what might seem a steamy, clanging
purgatory. Or might not -- particularly to these Penobscot Frozen Foods
wage-earners, whose county suffers Maine's highest unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
	   So which is it? What is Wiseman trying to say with the scene? What was he
thinking when he shot it?
</P>
<P>
	   "This may seem like I'm giving you an evasive answer," he admits. "But what
I think is what you see in the movie. My point of view is expressed --
indirectly and obliquely -- by the way I edit individual sequences, and by the
way I link them together.
</P>
<P>
	   "The film is my report on what I found."
</P>
<P>
	   With his cameraman John Davey, director-soundman Wiseman found a group of
seniors in a flower-arranging class. He found a man who traps, puts down and
skins a coyote.
</P>
<P>
	   He found prison inmates getting instruction about HIV: "If it's warm,
slippery and not yours -- don't touch it," they're advised.
</P>
<P>
	   "My technique, when it works, places viewers in the middle of the events,"
says Wiseman, "and asks them to think through their own relationships with what
they're seeing and hearing."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Belfast Coin Laundry, we see and hear a washer leaking sudsy water
onto the floor. A woman kicks the washer, then kicks it again.
</P>
<P>
	   "Weird," she murmurs, passing judgment in a way that Wiseman's films never
would.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Count of Illegal Immigrants  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   In 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated there were 5
million illegal immigrants living in the United States. That number was expected

<HEADLINE> Census To Include Illegals in Count  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A census worker at the front door often means one thing to
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people think, `Hey, who's this guy coming to my door? Probably
Immigration,''' says Alejandro Lopez, a Chicagoan who is one of many people
being asked to spread the word about the census in the nation's often
undercounted minority communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The word is this: Whether you are here legally or not, you should fill out
the questionnaire when it arrives in April. Officials at the Census Bureau say
they don't care if you're here illegally. In fact, they won't even ask.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Census doesn't exist to do law enforcement,'' says Dianne Schmidley, a
census demographer. ``Our job is to get a body count.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau asks whether those in the household are U.S. citizens. But
it has never distinguished between non-citizens who are in this country legally
and those who are here illegally, because the U.S. Constitution simply calls for
a head count. The counting of illegal immigrants was not even an issue until
their numbers began swelling in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidley says singling out illegal immigrants would only lower a response
rate that already is expected to be the lowest in history -- 61 percent,
compared with 75 percent of households in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   It is largely poor people and minorities who get missed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, census officials estimate they undercounted Indians on reservations
by 12.2 percent; Hispanics 5.5 percent; blacks 4.4 percent; and Asian Americans
2.3 percent. They estimate that only 0.7 percent of non-Hispanic whites were not
counted. The estimates were based on intensive second interviews with members of
300,000 households.
</P>
<P>
	   Undercounting can be costly to communities, because they can lose out on
funding for everything from schools to fire stations. It can also mean the loss
of political representation.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why activists like Ana Maria Soto spend many nights and weekends
talking to community groups and church congregations about the census.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not getting our piece of the pie, and that needs to change --
because we're hungry,'' says Soto, regional census director for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Education Fund in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Some immigration-reform groups fear the slice is already too big when it
comes to political representation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federation for American Immigration Reform has twice sued the Census
Bureau to get it to stop including illegal immigrants in numbers used to
apportion seats in Congress. Both lawsuits were thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a matter of fairness, it's hard for folks whose ancestors built this
country to understand how they could be losing political representation to
people who just crashed our borders and entered illegally,'' says Dan Stein,
executive director of the lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
	   Stein points to California, which got six new U.S. representatives after the
1990 census. That state is thought to account for 2 million of the more than 5
million illegal immigrants believed to be in this country in 1996, the most
recent figures available. Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service estimate that more than half the total are from Latin American
countries, usually Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Census officials are worried that language barriers and fear of the
government will keep immigrants -- even those here legally -- from answering the
census.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last thing the Census wants is for people to be afraid,'' says
Schmidley, the census demographer.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the assurances, some immigrants remain wary.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them is a 30-year-old construction worker from Brazil who lives in
South River, N.J. He is a legal resident but asked that his name not be used
because his girlfriend and a family friend who lives with them are both in this
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   He says he would fill out a census form truthfully only if he got an
absolute guarantee that the information would not come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But getting a guarantee, that's the difficult part, isn't it?'' he says.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A section of the Capitol was closed for two hours Thursday
after a woman was seen pouring an unidentified liquid down a grate, a Capitol

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Protect Prairie Dog  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department decided today the black-tailed
prairie dog merits protection as a threatened species but said it is too busy
dealing with higher-priority plants and wildlife to take steps to preserve the
rodent that has long been a pest to ranchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The prairie dog will be added to a list of candidates for threatened status
under the Endangered Species Act, but there will be no restrictions placed on
landowners to protect it. Its status will be reviewed annually, however, and it
could move up the priority list if voluntary conservation efforts are
unsuccessful, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Colonies of prairie dogs once were found on as many as 100 million acres
from Canada to Mexico, but the animal has been decimated by disease, eradication
programs and housing development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All this is, is a wakeup call that we need some purposeful management for
this species,'' said Pete Gober, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who led a
year-long study of the animal.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight western states -- Arizona, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas and Wyoming -- have agreed to come up with a plan by next year for
monitoring and protecting the animal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The black-tailed prairie dog is a very resilient species. It's handled a
lot over the years,'' Gober said. ``Hopefully we'll be able to work with those
states to avoid the necessity of listing the species.''
</P>
<P>
	   The annual reviews will look at how the prairie dog is doing and whether it
should be removed from the candidate list or moved up in priority.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fish and Wildlife Service's regional office in Denver already has
proposed several species for listing as endangered or threatened, including the
lynx, mountain plover and Colorado butterfly plant. Endangered status means that
a species is in danger of extinction; threatened status means it could become
endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Wildlife Federation, which had petitioned for listing of the
black-tailed prairie dog, said it was pleased with the department's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision ``sends an important signal from the federal government that
the prairie dog's plight is dire and that serious changes must be made in the
way we manage it,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest threat to the prairie dog is a form of the bubonic plague that
can wipe out entire colonies, the Fish and Wildlife Service study said. The
animals have no immunity to the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The plague is now widespread through much of the prairie dog's historic
range with the exception of most of South Dakota and portions of Kansas,
Nebraska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It is no coincidence that four of the seven
largest remaining colonies of the animals are in South Dakota, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision marks a middle ground between environmentalists who want the
prairie dog listed and developers and ranchers who do not.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Skiba, a biologist for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, ``What this
does is give both Fish and Wildlife and the state some breathing room to do some
things to rectify problems.''

<HEADLINE> 'Crook and Chase' Making a Comeback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Country talk show host Lorianne Crook and her
husband have paid $4 million to buy the Crook and Chase Theater in hopes of
reviving her canceled cable program.
</P>
<P>
	   Crook and husband Jim Owens unveiled plans Tuesday to turn "Crook and
Chase," a longtime staple of The Nashville Network, into a daily stage show and
broadcast several live "Crook and Chase" prime-time specials.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really, really wanted to come back here," Crook said. "It's
disappointing we're not broadcasting from Myrtle Beach, but our deal is we want
to entertain people, and we wanted to come back here and do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Crook and co-host Charlie Chase had been affiliated with TNN for 17 years.
But in August, TNN said "Crook and Chase" and "Crook and Chase Tonight" were
among shows it would not renew for the next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The first Crook and Chase prime-time special will appear March 18 on TNN.
Owens said the new "Crook and Chase" morning stage show would debut March 20.

<P>
    LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It's been 10 years since Siegfried and Roy placed their
biggest bet, spending $35 million of their own money to create a show unlike
anything ever seen in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   The gamble has paid off handsomely. The German-born illusionists have raked
in $1 billion at The Mirage, playing before some 10 million people since they
opened their stage spectacular at the Strip resort Feb. 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Wynn, who signed the pair to a record $58 million contract in 1987 to
headline at his hotel-casino, recalled their bold plans Tuesday at a party
marking the start of the illusionists 11th year at The Mirage.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the two enlisted some of Broadway's finest talent to design a show
that would set a new standard. Then they pitched Wynn on putting up their own
millions to produce it, and sharing in the profits.
</P>
<P>
	   ""We didn't think about the money. We just wanted to give the world the
wonderment," Siegfried said.
</P>
<P>
	   The illusionists have two years remaining on their current Mirage contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look back and appreciate what we've accomplished, but it's what's ahead
that brings excitement, the unknown of year 11 and beyond," said Roy.

<HEADLINE> Senators Concerned Over TV-Fed Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers expressed concern Thursday about a government
deal to insert anti-drug messages into prime-time television programs, while a
White House official denied the arrangement was an attempt to restrict free
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the deal was disclosed last month, there have been ``unfair
allegations of attacks on the First Amendment, Big Brother. Nothing could be
further from the truth,'' said Alan Levitt, director of the anti-drug media
campaign for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not done this in secret. We are doing it because it is the way you
change behavior,'' Levitt told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
Treasury and general government.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers said the deal raised questions despite its good intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no problem with all of the ads you mentioned,'' said the
subcommittee chairman, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. ``The question is
how we go about doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Added Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., ``I think it does raise real serious
questions about the government's role.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, has said he
wants to hold hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, the government gave financial credits to TV networks that
included anti-drug messages in their shows. In some cases, the White House drug
policy office even reviewed the scripts before the programs aired.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, has put new rules into practice since January and said the government
will not review program episodes in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   The office also plans to keep separate its process for granting financial
credits from its role in advising networks and producers on how to portray
situations involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval to spend $1 billion
over five years on anti-drug ads. Newspapers, magazines and other media outlets
were asked to match each commercial spot bought by the government with a free
one.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the program started, however, the government has agreed to give up
some of its ad time on television -- as long as the networks demonstrate that
some programs convey anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
	   To date, Levitt said, the government has received television programming
messages worth $21.8 million on 130 different types of shows.

<HEADLINE> Haider Coalition To Be Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president today approved a new coalition
government that includes Joerg Haider's extreme right-wing Freedom Party,
despite threats of international ostracism and sanctions over Haider's
anti-foreigner views and praise of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil's office said the swearing-in ceremony will take
place at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Approval came shortly after Haider and his coalition partner, Wolfgang
Schuessel of the centrist Austrian People's Party, renounced the nation's Nazi
past and promised to respect European values.
</P>
<P>
	   But the announcement is likely to trigger a series of diplomatic measures
against Austria. Israel already has banned Haider from visiting. The rest of the
European Union warned Vienna that its EU membership could be suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's office confirmed Schuessel will be chancellor and Freedom
Party official Susanne Riess-Passer will be vice chancellor. Haider has no
Cabinet post, but never tried for one.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider and Schuessel signed the declaration in front of Klestil, who
demanded the move before he would approve their government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out of the tragic history of
the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the National Socialist regime,''
the statement said. ``Our country is facing up to the light and dark sides of
its past and to the deeds of all Austrians, good and evil, as its
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement of principles did not address comments that won Haider
international notoriety. About a decade ago he praised Adolf Hitler's
``orderly'' employment policies and lauded veterans of the murderous Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.'' He also has opposed the European Union's
expansion and urged a near halt on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's statement declared that the government reaffirms its ``unswerving
adherence to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of the
peoples of Europe.'' And both leaders declared their coalition strives for a
tolerant society for all ``in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism have no
place.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unlikely that the declaration would convince the rest of the European
Union. The European Parliament today overwhelmingly passed a resolution
condemning a Haider-linked government and warned it would negatively
``legitimize the extreme right in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel said today it would ban Haider from entering the Jewish state. A day
earlier, Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Haider ``dangerous'' to democracy and
recalled Israel's ambassador from Vienna for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
	   As Haider arrived at the president's office, hundreds of protesters chanted
``Haider is a fascist.'' Someone scrawled the slogan ``Against a Freedom Party
government'' on the walls of a nearby building in the downtown government
complex.
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage over the proposed coalition spilled into the streets in Austria on
Wednesday. Police said some 15,000 people rallied in the evening in front of the
People's Party headquarters to protest the coalition deal. Another 2,000 people
rallied today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prove yourself to be a patriot,'' theater producer Andre Heller told
Wednesday's crowd in remarks directed to Schuessel. ``No alliance with meanness.
No alliance with right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   But no one seemed able to stop the players involved.
</P>
<P>
	   In a meeting that ended early today, the executive committee of Schuessel's
Austrian People's Party adopted the coalition agreement with only one dissenting
vote. The Freedom Party had endorsed it unanimously a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's office said the president rejected two proposed Freedom party
Cabinet nominees who were responsible for anti-foreign posters which were
displayed in Vienna during the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider will remain governor of Carinthia province and not take a government
post. But critics fear that through his strong influence over the party, he will
be able to influence national policy and manipulate Schuessel, whose grip on his
own People's Party is not strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published today, Klestil took the unusual step of sharply
criticizing Haider and Schuessel. Still, he said he had to follow the results of
Oct. 3 parliamentary elections, in which the Freedom Party won 52 of the 183
seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The left-wing Social Democrats took 65 seats -- too few to govern alone. The
People's Party also won 52 seats but coalition talks with the Social Democrats
broke down.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil had the power to reject the coalition and even to call new
elections, although such a move would have been unprecedented in Austria's
post-World War II history.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 17.37; Nasdaq Up 85.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were mostly higher today as an optimistic
profit forecast from Amazon.com prompted a wave of buying, but blue-chip shares
lost early momentum and turned lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 17.37 at 10,985.83.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators fared better. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 7.49 at 1,416.61, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 85.99 at 4,159.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks were pressured at midday by rumors that the Federal Reserve bank of
New York had called an emergency meeting to discuss market volatility. The
Nasdaq pared much of its early gain, and the Dow fell as much as 160 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spokesman for the bank denied the rumors, stocks recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Online retailer Amazon.com led the Nasdaq, rising 11 15/16 from its 4 p.m.
close to 81 3/8. The company said late Wednesday that while it posted its worst
losses ever during the fourth quarter of 1999, sales more than doubled.
Investors today were also enticed by the company's claim that losses will narrow
significantly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other large-capitalization technology stocks also advanced. Cisco Systems
rose 2 15/16 to 116 13/16 and Intel rose 3 7/16 to 103 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Other semiconductor makers also soared, with Texas Instruments gaining 7
11/16 to 127 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "The action and performance is still being placed on the shoulders of the
heavily indexed stocks," said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum &AMP; Co. Those companies -- the market's best performers in 1999 --
are now so widely held and so coveted that investors see them as the safest bets
for 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Weakness in old-fashioned industrials derailed the Dow. Alcoa fell 2 9/16 to
72 and Exxon Mobil fell 2 3/4 to 81 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks were benefiting from a continued rally in the bond market. Long-term
Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week, soared on
Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part of the
Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.16 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market also drew some support from the Federal Reserve's
widely anticipated decision Wednesday to raise interest rates by a
quarter-point, its fourth hike since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan won Senate confirmation today
for a fourth term as head of the nation's central bank. Greenspan was praised as
a key architect of the current 107-month long economic expansion, the longest in
history.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an
8-to-5 margin. NYSE volume came to 768.82 million shares, well ahead of
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.93 to 516.82.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Suspend Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain will strip power from Northern Ireland's fledgling
Protestant-Catholic administration unless the Irish Republican Army promises to
disarm, the government announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said he would introduce
legislation Friday transferring power back to London from Belfast. But the
process would take several days and could be stopped if developments warranted,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson's statement was delivered to the House of Commons in London and
watched closely by politicians in Belfast and Dublin. It was designed to buy a
little more time for those struggling day and night to defuse the crisis that is
on the verge of derailing Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot partially implement the Good Friday agreement,'' Mandelson said.
``It is all or it is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis threatens the new four-party coalition Cabinet that has given
Northern Ireland a measure of local rule after years of direct rule by Britain.
The Ulster Unionists agreed in November to accept the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party
as colleagues in the Cabinet established as part of 1998's Good Friday peace
accord -- but only on condition that IRA disarmament would follow.
</P>
<P>
	   To win over skeptical colleagues, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
promised he would resign this month as the Cabinet's senior minister if the IRA
wasn't delivering on its end of the bargain. He backed that promise up by
drafting a resignation letter and scheduling an internal party meeting for Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
	   To try to save the coalition, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has been
working urgently to secure a clear-cut IRA disarmament statement. But Trimble
suggested today that such a statement wouldn't be sufficient at this late hour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had so many forms of words,'' he said before Mandelson's
announcement. ``There's only one thing that's going to carry any credibility,
and that's the IRA actually doing things and not talking about them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams appealed for an urgent meeting with Trimble.
Adams sought to play down the significance of a disarmament commission report
delivered Monday to the British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's contents have not been made public, but officials have said it
concludes that the IRA has not yet begun scrapping any arms. Adams said it was
``essentially a progress report'' that the British government and Ulster
Unionists ought to accept.
</P>
<P>
	   He has warned that if the British government takes back powers from the
Cabinet even temporarily, ``it will be difficult to put things back together
again'' and IRA disarmament ``is unlikely ever to be achieved.''

<HEADLINE> Schoolgirl Kidnap Shakes Japan  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- It was a nightmare beyond belief: A schoolgirl grabbed off the
street, stuffed into the trunk of a car and imprisoned in the second floor of
her captor's house -- for nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime, which has dominated Japan's talk shows and tabloids, emerged last
week when the victim was discovered after her abductor took her out of the house
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with disbelief at its sheer cruelty, the kidnapping is raising
questions about police incompetence, the breakdown of communities and the
complex relationship between captor and captive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was not only confined physically,'' said Hiroaki Iwai, an expert in
criminal sociology at Tokyo's Toyo University. ``Her soul was also in chains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Fusako Sano's ordeal were still hazy this week, and police refuse
to say whether there is evidence she was physically or sexually abused by the
man who kidnapped her.
</P>
<P>
	   But the little information available has fascinated -- and horrified --
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 13, 1990, Sano -- then 9 years old -- was grabbed off the street in
Sanjo, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, and shut up in a second-floor bedroom
in a small town 35 miles away, said Sanjo police official Bunyu Oshima.
</P>
<P>
	   Her unemployed captor -- who has not been identified -- fed her, dressed her
in men's clothing and cut her hair short, police say. Media reports have said
blurry, thick windows helped keep outsiders from seeing what was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   It's still not clear what her life was like in captivity. The man's mother
lived on the first floor and has denied knowing about Sano, police said, though
newspapers say investigators now doubt that.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were called last week about a man making a disturbance at a hospital.
When they got there, a woman with him stepped up and identified herself as Sano.
Later, she was reunited with her family, who said they never lost hope that she
would be found.
</P>
<P>
	   The kidnapping is the longest of its kind in Japan. A man who had been
missing for 23 years was discovered in 1970, Iwai said, but he had been raised
by his abductor as a son -- not confined to a room.
</P>
<P>
	   Sano's kidnapper was hospitalized, apparently for emotional problems, and
police say they have not questioned him. Sano also was hospitalized, and police
say she is recovering.
</P>
<P>
	   The questions have mounted.
</P>
<P>
	   How, for example, could the man have eluded police detection for nine years?
He was arrested in 1989 for trying to kidnap another girl and was on probation
at the time of Sano's disappearance, but police apparently never investigated
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lack of communication between local police departments,'' said
Iwai. ``If the prefectural police had taken charge, they might have been able to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese are also asking how the neighbors could have failed to get an
inkling something was wrong, especially in a small town. For some, the crime
showed how community ties have broken down in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanjo police, who are heading the investigation, have refused to discuss how
Sano's abductor kept her hidden for so long. Kyodo News agency quoted a police
official this week as saying the handling of the case would be examined later.
</P>
<P>
	   Sano's behavior is also under scrutiny. She told police she was not allowed
out of the house for nine years, Oshima said, but reports say she apparently had
opportunities to escape. For example, the man sometimes left the house without
locking the doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Japanese have speculated the girl was just too young to take action to
free herself, while some experts interviewed on talk shows think that over time
she -- like many hostages -- developed an emotional bond with her captor.
</P>
<P>
	   For other Japanese, there's still too little information to go beyond
speculation that she may have been simply terrified by a violent captor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was extremely scary, so she was obedient to him,'' said Akira Yoda, a
developmental psychology professor at Tokyo's Showa Women's University. ``She
was told not to run away, and she listened to him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the attention has fixed on the suffering of a young girl robbed of a
crucial period of growth in her life. While her friends were at school, playing
sports and turning into adults, her world was limited to a small room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you are confined during that time, you can't learn how to interact with
others or live in the world,'' said Yoda. ``It's going to take a long time for
her to return to society.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Swaps Reporter for POWs  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian authorities on Thursday exchanged a Radio Liberty
reporter for Russian prisoners of war being held by Chechen militants, a
presidential aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-financed radio station claimed the swap was a Russian ploy to get
rid of a reporter whose critical coverage of the Chechnya war has angered
authorities. ``Later, (Russians) will say that the Chechens have killed him, or
something else,'' said Radio Liberty lawyer Genri Reznik.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporter, Andrei Babitsky, was detained in Chechnya in mid-January. The
formal grounds for his detention was a lack of a government permission to work
in the war zone. But some Russian officials accused him of involvement in
Chechen rebel gangs. Some pro-government media labeled him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential aide in charge of information on the
Chechnya war, said Thursday that a rebel field commander had offered to trade
Babitsky for POWs, and that the reporter agreed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the exchange was made for two or three Russian soldiers and that
precise details would be known on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky showed a news conference what he said was a copy of Babitsky's
written agreement, which said the reporter ``wanted to cooperate in the
liberation of soldiers being held by force.'' Yastrzhembsky said federal
authorities disclaimed any further responsibility for Babitsky's welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila Babitskaya, said she thought that statement was a
fake, or written under duress. She said she has not heard from her husband since
he called Jan. 15 and does not believe he is alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Reznik expressed similar doubts. ``If he gave written consent to the
exchange, why wasn't he allowed to call home?'' he told the news agency
Interfax.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Keep Control Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy decided today to divert and retain control
of a Russian tanker stopped in the Persian Gulf, pending a decision on whether
to seize oil U.S. officials believe came from Iraq in violation of a U.N.
embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials said the oil came from Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian-flagged commercial ship is to be diverted to a
yet-to-be-determined anchorage in international waters and then possibly turned
over to a third country, said Pentagon spokesman Adm. Craig Quigley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not an insignificant action,'' Quigley said. He said U.S. Navy
personnel assigned to an international inspection operation boarded the ship
Wednesday by helicopter without resistance and have gathered ``enough evidence
to say we believe this vessel is carrying contraband.''
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey, operating as part of an
international force monitoring Persian Gulf waters, stopped the Russian merchant
vessel Volga-Neft-147 Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The suspected sanctions violator, which was tracked beginning with its
departure from Iraqi water until its interception, is believed to be carrying
petroleum products of Iraqi origin prohibited from export by U.N. sanctions,''
the Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said the vessel was boarded for inspection in accordance with
``standard operating procedure as a result of its last port of call and failure
to respond to routine inquiries regarding its intentions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Russian officials have been kept
informed of the process. ``I don't know if they've formally protested,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said inspectors had boarded ships 700 times last year and diverted them
to port for further investigation 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who want to engage in smuggling certainly will use whatever ways or
whatever methods are available to them,'' Lockhart said. ``It's the U.N.'s
responsibility to make sure we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian officials denied that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said the tanker was carrying fuel
oil from Iran to various ports in the Emirates. ``Judging from the ship's
documents, there can be no talk of Iraqi oil,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told Interfax that the tanker did not
enter either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports and must be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,
through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cargo is still under inspection, but gasoil and information onboard
indicate that the cargo came from Iraq,'' Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck of the 5th Fleet
said in Bahrain. Gasoil is a type of crude used for diesel engines and sometimes
for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   Gradeck said that with the increase in world oil prices last year, the
smuggling of Iraqi crude had increased ``quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, some 191,000 metric tons of oil was smuggled from Iraq, he
said. In January, the figure jumped to 367,000 metric tons. As a result, the
fleet of Western warships that monitors Gulf waters for sanctions violations has
also increased its activities, Gradeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping a Russian ship was ``not new but it is unusual,'' said Jim Kout,
another Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said
U.S. officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal
diplomatic channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.

<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said in October that Navy ships had diverted at least five
ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems searching for
contraband in the preceding month. The United States and Britain are the main
enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until the U.N. Security Council lifted the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports on
Dec. 17, Iraq had been unable to sell its oil on the open market because of
sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Bus Bombs Wound 32  </HEADLINE>
   By ASIF ANSAR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Three bombs ripped through buses in Sri Lanka on
Thursday, wounding 32 people -- including an 8-year-old girl whose legs had to
be amputated, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, but police suspected the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels. Sri Lanka's 17-year-old civil war is
mainly fought in the north and east of the country, but the rebels have carried
out frequent attacks in the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, three passengers were wounded when a bomb exploded inside a bus
as it pulled up at a gas station five miles from Colombo, officials said. The
explosive device had been placed behind the front seats of the bus.
</P>
<P>
	   The day's second blast wounded at least seven people on a bus in Kadawatha,
about eight miles northwest of Colombo, Sub Inspector A.P. Ratnapala said.
</P>
<P>
	   A third bus explosion wounded 22 people in Kurunagala, 40 miles northeast of
the capital, a doctor at the local hospital said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. She said most suffered deep gashes, burns, and shrapnel wounds to
their legs and faces. Some had difficulty hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor said surgeons were forced to amputate both legs of an 8-year-old
girl because of her severe wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, military officials said they had received unconfirmed reports
that 75 rebels were killed when troops pounded their bunkers with artillery,
mortars and rockets in the Jaffna peninsula, 185 miles north of Colombo. They
said about 130 rebels apparently were wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dec. 18, the rebels have been blamed for three major attacks in
Colombo that killed 50 people and injured President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east for
the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people. An
estimated 61,000 people have been killed since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Cites Horn of Africa Fears  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN LINNEE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- President Daniel arap Moi called a rare news
conference Thursday to express Kenya's concern that instability in the Horn of
Africa poses a serious threat to peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crisis has implications well beyond the borders of the conflict areas,
due to the circulation of illegal arms and refugees into neighboring
countries,'' said the 75-year-old politician, Kenya's president since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear why conflicts like the one between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, which began in 1998, or the 17-year civil war in southern Sudan or the
decade of lawlessness in Somalia, would occasion a news conference now.
</P>
<P>
	   But a diplomatic official close to Moi said later that the point of his
message was to express backing for a peace plan for Somalia set forth by
Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh at the U.N. General Assembly last
September.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, one of half a dozen floated since 1991, calls for Somali
warlords to turn their factions into political parties, to disarm and to submit
to the primacy of law as well as the inclusion of women and intellectuals in the
process.
</P>
<P>
	   Djibouti, a tiny former French colony in the crook of the Horn, is the
headquarters of the seven-nation Intergovernmental Authority on Development, or
IGAD, under whose auspices the Guelleh plan is being discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the ouster of Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre in 1991,
neighboring Kenya has received hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees, and the
flow of small arms and semiautomatic weapons into Kenya is fueling a growing
tide of violent cattle rustling and armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   Moi called on the United States and Europe to do something to halt the flow
of arms into the region and Africa as a whole because ``they certainly do not
come from Africa.''
</P>
<P>
	   The diplomatic official said Kenya, the only country in the region that has
not suffered from full scale internal strife, wanted to avoid the proliferation
of peace initiatives for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Ethiopia and Egypt -- traditional rivals for influence in Somalia --
have undertaken peace initiatives for the wishbone-shaped nation, but none has
prospered. Ethiopia now backs the Guelleh plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt, together with Libya, has offered its offices as an alternative to
IGAD for both Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation in the Horn has continued to worsen. Kenya can no longer sit
quietly and watch while the situation gets worse,'' Moi said.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Suspend Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Britain will strip power from Northern Ireland's fledgling
Protestant-Catholic administration within days unless the Irish Republican Army
promises to disarm, the government announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said he would introduce
legislation Friday transferring power back to London from Belfast. But the
process would take several days and could be stopped if developments warranted,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson's statement was delivered to the House of Commons in London and
watched closely by politicians in Belfast and Dublin. It was designed to buy a
little more time for those struggling day and night to defuse the crisis that is
on the verge of derailing Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   As Parliament heard the announcement, Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern left
Dublin for southern England to discuss the peace process with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot partially implement the Good Friday agreement,'' Mandelson said.
``It is all or it is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis threatens the new four-party coalition Cabinet that has given
Northern Ireland a measure of local rule after years of direct rule by Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists agreed in November to accept the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party as colleagues in the Cabinet established as part of 1998's Good Friday
peace accord -- but only on condition that IRA disarmament would follow.
</P>
<P>
	   To win over skeptical colleagues, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
promised he would resign this month as the Cabinet's senior minister if the IRA
wasn't delivering on its end of the bargain. He backed that promise up by
drafting a resignation letter and scheduling an internal party meeting for Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA apparently has made no move to disarm in the nine weeks since
the Cabinet was formed.
</P>
<P>
	   To try to save the coalition, Ireland's Ahern has been working urgently to
secure a clear-cut IRA disarmament statement. That statement would confirm
whether the IRA accepts that it is supposed to scrap its weapons under terms of
the Good Friday accord, which proposed a May deadline for the IRA's total
disarmament. The outlawed group repeatedly has refused to make that commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble suggested today that even if Ahern could procure such a statement,
it wouldn't be sufficient at this late hour. The Ulster Unionist leader, who won
only narrow backing from his party to enter the Cabinet in the first place,
faces a potential revolt at the Feb. 12 party meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had so many forms of words,'' he said before Mandelson's
announcement. ``There's only one thing that's going to carry any credibility,
and that's the IRA actually doing things and not talking about them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams appealed for an urgent meeting with Trimble.
Adams sought to play down the significance of a disarmament commission report
delivered Monday to the British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's contents have not been made public, but officials have said it
concludes that the IRA has not yet begun scrapping any arms. Adams said it was
``essentially a progress report'' that the British government and Ulster
Unionists ought to accept.
</P>
<P>
	   He has warned that if the British government takes back powers from the
Cabinet even temporarily, ``it will be difficult to put things back together
again'' and IRA disarmament ``is unlikely ever to be achieved.''

<HEADLINE> Navy To Keep Control Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy decided today to divert and retain control
of a Russian tanker stopped in the Persian Gulf, pending a decision on whether
to seize oil U.S. officials believe came from Iraq in violation of a U.N.
embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials said the oil came from Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian-flagged commercial ship is to be diverted to a
yet-to-be-determined anchorage in international waters and then possibly turned
over to a third country, said Pentagon spokesman Adm. Craig Quigley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not an insignificant action,'' Quigley said. He said U.S. Navy
personnel assigned to an international inspection operation boarded the ship
Wednesday by helicopter without resistance and have gathered ``enough evidence
to say we believe this vessel is carrying contraband.''
</P>
<P>
	   The guided missile cruiser USS Monterey, operating as part of an
international force monitoring Persian Gulf waters, stopped the Russian merchant
vessel Volga-Neft-147 Wednesday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The suspected sanctions violator, which was tracked beginning with its
departure from Iraqi water until its interception, is believed to be carrying
petroleum products of Iraqi origin prohibited from export by U.N. sanctions,''
the Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said U.S. officials have been in
regular contact with Russian authorities for almost a month about the activities
of Russian vessels in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have said the detained ship was was privately owned and that an
investigation is under way, the spokesman said. He said the last time a Russian
vessel was boarded because of suspected smuggling activities occurred in August
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley added that illicit oil exports via the Persian Gulf averaged about
50,000 barrels a day for much of 1998 but increased sharply last fall and now
average about 100,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said the Russian vessel was boarded for inspection in accordance
with ``standard operating procedure as a result of its last port of call and
failure to respond to routine inquiries regarding its intentions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The captain of the tanker has been cooperating, and if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to bring in the ship and dispose of the contraband oil, Defense
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Russian officials have been kept
informed of the process. ``I don't know if they've formally protested,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said inspectors had boarded ships 700 times last year and diverted them
to port for further investigation 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who want to engage in smuggling certainly will use whatever ways or
whatever methods are available to them,'' Lockhart said. ``It's the U.N.'s
responsibility to make sure we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian officials denied that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said the tanker was carrying fuel
oil from Iran to various ports in the Emirates. ``Judging from the ship's
documents, there can be no talk of Iraqi oil,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told Interfax that the tanker did not
enter either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports and must be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, this situation does not suit us at all,'' he said. ``We
expressed our surprise over the incident through our embassies in Washington and
Abu Dhabi.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of Hormuz,
through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cargo is still under inspection, but gasoil and information onboard
indicate that the cargo came from Iraq,'' Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck of the 5th Fleet
said in Bahrain. Gasoil is a type of crude used for diesel engines and sometimes
for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   Gradeck said that with the increase in world oil prices last year, the
smuggling of Iraqi crude had increased ``quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, some 191,000 metric tons of oil was smuggled from Iraq, he
said. In January, the figure jumped to 367,000 metric tons. As a result, the
fleet of Western warships that monitors Gulf waters for sanctions violations has
also increased its activities, Gradeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping a Russian ship was ``not new but it is unusual,'' said Jim Kout,
another Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said
U.S. officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal
diplomatic channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said in October that Navy ships had diverted at least five
ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems searching for
contraband in the preceding month. The United States and Britain are the main
enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until the U.N. Security Council lifted the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports on
Dec. 17, Iraq had been unable to sell its oil on the open market because of
sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 122.53; Dow Up 24.82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were sharply higher today as an
optimistic earnings forecast from Amazon.com and a continuing rally in the bond
market prompted a wave of buying.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 122.53 at 4,196.49.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 24.82 at 11,028.02, and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13.36 at 1,422.48.
</P>
<P>
	   Online retailer Amazon.com led the Nasdaq, rising 15 5/16 from its 4 p.m.
close to 84 3/4. The company said late Wednesday that while it posted its worst
losses ever during the fourth quarter of 1999, sales more than doubled.
Investors today were also enticed by the company's claim that losses will narrow
significantly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's influential Internet analyst, raised his
near-term rating on the stock from "accumulate" to "buy."
</P>
<P>
	   Other large-capitalization technology stocks also advanced. Cisco Systems
rose 4 to 117 7/8 and Intel rose 3 3/4 to 103 13/16, leading a wave of strong
gains by semiconductor makers. Texas Instruments gained 10 1/4 to 129 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "The action and performance is still being placed on the shoulders of the
heavily indexed stocks," said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum &AMP; Co. Those companies -- the market's best performers in 1999 --
are now so widely held and so coveted that investors see them as the safest bets
for 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Weakness in old-fashioned industrials derailed the Dow. Alcoa fell 2 9/16 to
72 and Exxon Mobil fell 2 13/16 to 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks were benefiting from a continued rally in the bond market. Long-term
Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week, soared on
Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part of the
Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.16 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market also drew some support from the Federal Reserve's
widely anticipated decision Wednesday to raise interest rates by a
quarter-point, its fourth hike since June. Today, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan won Senate confirmation for a fourth term as head of the nation's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks were pressured at midday by rumors that the Federal Reserve bank of
New York had called an emergency meeting to discuss market volatility. The
Nasdaq pared much of its early gain, and the Dow fell as much as 160 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spokesman for the bank denied the rumors, stocks recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an
8-to-5 margin. NYSE volume came to 893.35 million shares, well ahead of
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.37 to 519.26.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Electing New Beauty Queen  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela, arguably the beauty queen capital of
the world, has decided to hold a special national pageant to solve a dilemma:
Its regular beauty queen was in such demand this year that she caused confusion
in international pageant regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   To fix the problem, organizers are putting together a last-minute pageant to
pick a representative to send to the Miss Universe contest in May. The new queen
will be selected Feb. 26 and will be crowned Miss Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela usually has one major national pageant. The runner-up goes to the
Miss World contest and the winner represents her nation in the Miss Universe
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   But last year, Miss World officials insisted that Venezuela send its winner
to them, too. It did, and the Venezuelan contestant, 24-year-old Martina
Thorogood, was named first runner-up in the contest in London in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Thorogood was also to have competed in the Miss Universe pageant in Cyprus.
But Miss Universe officials objected, saying Thorogood wasn't eligible because
she can't be both Miss Universe and Miss World at the same time. That could
happen if the current Miss World were to abdicate her crown.
</P>
<P>
	   Given Venezuela's record in past beauty contests, preparing for a Venezuelan
victory in any pageant is smart thinking. Venezuela has won 11 top international
beauty titles in the last two decades, more than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers are handpicking about 15 outstanding former Miss Venezuela
contestants to compete for Miss Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   From now on, pageant organizer Osmel Sousa said, Venezuela will hold two
beauty pageants every year -- a Miss Universe Venezuela and a Miss World
Venezuela. Many other nations also hold two contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Sousa said the new pageant's name coincides with Venezuela's new name,
pushed through by President Hugo Chavez, a former military coup leader whose
idol is 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar.

<HEADLINE> Floor Collapses in Madrid, 161 Hurt  </HEADLINE>
   By MAR ROMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The floor collapsed under a crush of bargain hunters
Thursday in a store in southern Spain, sending dozens of shoppers and piles of
debris plunging into the basement. At least 161 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The collapse came as several hundred people jammed around a cash register to
buy one of 36 armchairs on sale for $17.65, down from the stated regular price
of $229.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muebles Peralta furniture store in the town of Dos Hermanas, on the
outskirts of Seville, had opened at 10 a.m. for the sale. The floor collapsed
about five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 13 people were in serious condition, and 138 were hospitalized for
less severe injuries, said Zacarias Cotan, a police spokesman in Seville. A
20-year-old women had to have her crushed spleen and left kidney removed, while
a pregnant woman suffered a broken pelvis.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency workers said 32 square feet of floor gave way under excess weight
and dropped shoppers and rubble 13 feet to the concrete basement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It felt as is you were standing and suddenly the floor disappeared,'' said
Aureliano Garcia, 58, who went to the sale after hearing ads for it on the
radio. ``What I saw then was people screaming, old people with their legs
fractured, bones twisted. It was a horrible spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia, speaking by telephone from a hospital, said he was trapped briefly
under the rubble and suffered bruises to his chest and back. His wife suffered
two broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Cross workers, firefighters and ambulances rushed to the scene to find
customers fleeing the building and carrying out the injured in makeshift
stretchers and wooden armchairs that had been on sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the people who were in the warehouse-style building at the time
escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Local government representative Rocio Roche said no one remained trapped in
the building. Investigators have begun probing the building's structural
soundness to avert further collapses, Roche said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Strikers: The New Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK STEVENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- They see themselves as a new generation of rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   They like ``direct action'' and collective decision-making. They oppose
entrance exams, university fees and selective admissions. They sport ski masks
and Cuban-style field caps.
</P>
<P>
	   These striking students would be just a group of 2,000 marginalized
malcontents -- if it weren't for the fact that they have the Mexican government
backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers control the sprawling main campus of the National Autonomous
University, Latin America's largest university system. For nine months they have
occupied the school, locking out 260,000 classmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Many are young anarchists. They identify with Mexico's student protesters of
1968, hundreds of whom were gunned down by soldiers in a massacre that continues
to haunt the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Largely because of memories of that massacre, the government has shied away
from moving against the strikers. Unwilling to retake the campus by force, it
has encouraged university authorities to capitulate to some of the strikers'
demands.
</P>
<P>
	   But this week, the strikers may finally have stepped over the line: On
Tuesday, they staged a bloody skirmish with anti-strike students, security
guards and adults hired to chase strikers from a university-affiliated high
school.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-seven people were injured, at least four of them critically. The
strikers were seen beating apparently unconscious guards with poles and rocks
and kicking their heads. Police arrested 251 students in or near the fighting
and reportedly filed charges ranging from assault to sabotage against 174 of
them on Thursday. Those arrested were being detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the fury, the strikers show no signs of letting up. On Wednesday, they
said the government had declared war on them and that they would keep striking
until the university gives in to all their demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Their list of grievances includes widespread poverty, high unemployment and
an ossified political system in which the ruling party has held power for 71
years. They feel isolated by adverse media coverage, abandoned even by most
leftist professors and betrayed by the government's cuts in university funding.
</P>
<P>
	   The feelings of persecution have only increased their fervor.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the barricades of window frames, logs and wire strikers have erected
at the university gates, Miguel Abraxas, a 19-year-old student at a
university-affiliated high school, vowed that ``if provocateurs try to retake
the university, there will be resistance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abraxas said that while the strikers won't allow classes to resume, ``a
learning process'' was still going on in the university's abandoned classrooms:
Striking students live, eat and sleep there and meet for marathon discussions,
many of which lead to yelling and even occasional pushing and shoving. The
students resist anyone who tries to cast himself as a leader of the movement,
Abraxas said. They often toss a coin to see who speaks for the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfredo Velarde, a 29-year-old ``anarchist-communist'' economics professor
who has joined the strikers, said the strike is justified even though the vast
majority of students voted to reopen the university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We represent the politically conscious and active fringe,'' Velarde said.
``All the students are welcome to come in here when they want to discuss the
strike with us.''
</P>
<P>
	   But few non-striking students are likely to take him up on that offer for
fear of how they would be treated. And the strikers will allow only small groups
of other students onto the campus -- too few to turn the tide in their
discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   Political science student Eduardo Rodriguez, who supports negotiating an end
to the strike, endured catcalls outside the university gates last week while he
tried to persuade strikers to let other students in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to welcome everyone in to speak. Everyone must be heard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A young woman who supports the strike disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have no arguments!'' she shouted over and over again, waving her
finger in Rodriguez's face.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Prayer Breakfast  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, praying with congressional leaders
Thursday, lamented the ``dishonest demonization'' that he said takes the place
of honest differences in political feuds in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at the 48th annual National Prayer Breakfast, a
Washington institution dating back to 1952 when a group of lawmakers gathered to
pray for newly elected President Dwight Eisenhower and his government.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was accompanied by his wife, Hillary. Former Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, who led the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations, sat
near the front of the audience and applauded politely when the president and
first lady were introduced at the Washington Hilton.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, several thousand people attended, including members of Congress,
some of whom voted to impeach Clinton, Cabinet secretaries, religious leaders,
international visitors and others.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he was troubled, looking around the world, at the
``resurgence of society's oldest demon, the inability to love our closest
neighbors as ourselves if they look or worship differently from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, the Irish peace process is strained by a lack of trust between
Republican Catholics and Protestant Unionists,'' Clinton said. ``In the Middle
East, with all its hope, we are still having to work very hard to overcome the
profoundest of suspicions between Israeli Jews and Palestinian and Syrian
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also cited discord between India and Pakistan and between Christians and
Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Here at home,'' the president said, ``we still see Asians, blacks, gays,
even in one instance last year, children at a Jewish school, subject to attacks
just because of who they are. And here in Washington, we are not blameless for
we often, too, forget in the heat of political battle our common humanity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We slip from honest difference, which is healthy, into dishonest
demonization,'' Clinton said. ``We ignore when we're all tight and in a fight
all those biblical admonitions we profess to believe, that we all see through a
glass darkly, that with St. Paul we all do what we would not, and we do not do
what we would.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president went on to recount a story about how Abraham Lincoln responded
when a group of his allies complained about politicians who would not support
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have more of a feeling of personal resentment that I have,'' Lincoln
said. ``Perhaps I have too little of it. But I never thought it paid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton added, ``Well, we know it doesn't pay.''

<HEADLINE> Floor Collapses in Spain, 161 Hurt  </HEADLINE>
   By MAR ROMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The floor collapsed under a crush of bargain hunters
Thursday in a store in southern Spain, sending dozens of shoppers and piles of
debris plunging into the basement. At least 161 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The collapse came as several hundred people jammed around a cash register to
buy one of 36 armchairs on sale for $17.65, down from the stated regular price
of $229.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muebles Peralta furniture store in the town of Dos Hermanas, on the
outskirts of Seville, had opened at 10 a.m. for the sale. The floor collapsed
about five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 13 people were in serious condition, and 138 were hospitalized for
less severe injuries, said Zacarias Cotan, a police spokesman in Seville. A
20-year-old women had to have her crushed spleen and left kidney removed, while
a pregnant woman suffered a broken pelvis.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency workers said 32 square feet of floor gave way under excess weight
and dropped shoppers and rubble 13 feet to the concrete basement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It felt as is you were standing and suddenly the floor disappeared,'' said
Aureliano Garcia, 58, who went to the sale after hearing ads for it on the
radio. ``What I saw then was people screaming, old people with their legs
fractured, bones twisted. It was a horrible spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia, speaking by telephone from a hospital, said he was trapped briefly
under the rubble and suffered bruises to his chest and back. His wife suffered
two broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Cross workers, firefighters and ambulances rushed to the scene to find
customers fleeing the building and carrying out the injured in makeshift
stretchers and wooden armchairs that had been on sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the people who were in the warehouse-style building at the time
escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Local government representative Rocio Roche said no one remained trapped in
the building. Investigators have begun probing the building's structural
soundness to avert further collapses, Roche said.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Dismisses Coup Speculation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Indonesia's president on Thursday dismissed
speculation of a coup following his dismissal of the country's powerful military
chief.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in full control,'' said Abdurrahman Wahid, who was in the
Netherlands, Indonesia's former colonial ruler, as part of a European trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, the first democratically elected Indonesian leader in over 40 years,
told Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok that he was keeping a close watch on the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know their moves, but we have to be careful of what they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rumors of a coup were rekindled after Wahid fired Gen. Wiranto, his Cabinet
minister for security affairs, on Monday. The former army chief has ignored the
orders and has attended Cabinet meetings as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto and 32 other military officials were accused of crimes against
humanity in East Timor in a government-commissioned report published Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's visit was the first official trip to the Netherlands by an
Indonesian head of state in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Dutch citizens of Moluccan origin held a protest near Kok's
office, calling on Wahid to stop the violence in the Moluccas -- also known as
the Spice Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 2,000 people have died in the last year of violence between
Christians and Muslims on the islands. About 40,000 Moluccans of both faiths
live in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There needs to be somebody who gets up and says: 'That's enough, it's time
to stop the violence,''' said Anton Suitela, 48, whose brother disappeared after
fighting in the region began. ``If not Wahid, then someone else, but he doesn't
seem capable.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Reaches Agreement on Ethnicity  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox announced an agreement with civil rights groups
Thursday to promote ethnic diversity in its TV shows and inside the company.
Among other things, it will hire a vice president of diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS was expected to announce its own agreement with groups including the
NAACP later in the day, becoming the last of the four major broadcast networks
to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with Fox differs from that reached with NBC and ABC in its
stipulation that an executive be hired to direct Fox's efforts. The network also
agreed to expand minority employee development programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox will also consider racial diversity as a "highly significant factor"
when the next opening comes up on the Fox Entertainment Group board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel it's enormously important, it's very good for business, and most of
all it's the right thing to do," said Fox Entertainment President Doug Herzog.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's lineup includes such programs as "The Simpsons," "Ally McBeal," "The
X-Files" and "Malcolm in the Middle."
</P>
<P>
	   The networks opened negotiations with the coalition after the NAACP last
summer floated the threat of a TV boycott because of the lack of minority actors
on the fall 1999 schedule of new shows.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the other network agreements, Fox's focuses on making changes in
minority representation throughout the company with the expectation that will
affect what viewers see on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "This agreement we're about to sign represents change. Real, meaningful,
lasting change," said Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   The end result, Mfume said, should be television that the public can feel
good about and new opportunities in the entertainment industry for minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also attending the news conference were representatives of the National
Latino Media Council, the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition, and American
Indians in Film and Television.

<HEADLINE> Corning drives deeper into Internet-propelled fiber-optic market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - Corning Inc. is driving deeper into a scorching,
high-tech business credited above all others with enabling the phenomenal growth
of the Internet: fiber optics.
<P>
	   The world's leading supplier of optical fiber and cable said Thursday it is
investing about $750 million to expand its global fiber-making capacity by 50
percent within three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Driven by rapid technological innovation and plunging costs, the amount of
information that fiber-optic systems can handle is estimated to be doubling
every nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   "Compare that with Moore's Law, which has microprocessors doubling in
capability every 18 months and ... you begin to get an idea of the scale of the
experience change," said Wendell Weeks, who oversees Corning's fiber and optical
equipment businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The "scientific glass company," famous for entwining glass innovations in
potent technologies from the light bulb to television's cathode-ray tube,
recently spent over $3 billion and doubled its payroll to 32,000 to solidify its
presence in optical communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning wants to begin offering its customers "one-stop shopping" by getting
a bigger foothold in the optical equipment field - making the components that
amplify and redirect the laser light pulses carrying information at hyper-speed
through fiber-optic grids.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to be able to help our customers to move fast and, to do that, you
need to be able to bring a lot of technologies to bear," Weeks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Corning acquired a leading laser producer, Oak Industries Inc.,
in a stock deal valued at about $2 billion. A month later, it paid around $1.3
billion to buy Siemens AG's fiber-optic systems business and buy out two joint
ventures with the German industrial group. Both deals were formally completed
over the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   By investing in laser and other optical components, Corning is pushing into
terrain reigned over by powerhouses like San Jose, Calif.-based JDS Uniphase
Corp. and Lucent Technologies of Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning, based in rural western New York, invented optical fiber in 1970. It
already controls an estimated 40 percent of the world's optical fiber market,
twice as much as its nearest rival, Lucent, and has fiber-making plants in
Europe, Australia and the United States, including the world's biggest one in
Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts set worldwide demand for fiber at more than 37 million miles in
1999. The market is expected to exceed 60 million miles in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning is investing $550 million to double the capacity of its
six-month-old factory near Concord, N.C., and add 500 jobs to several hundred
already there. It also is planning a $100 million expansion at the Wilmington
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Optical fiber, cable and optical devices contributed 59 percent of Corning's
revenues of $4.3 billion in 1999, and that segment will likely account for 70
percent of sales this year.

<HEADLINE> The WWF unveils its latest game: pro football?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It will be real. And it will be real fun.
<P>
	   It's football as envisioned by World Wrestling Federation mastermind Vince
McMahon, who took time out from peddling the endless line of WWF merchandise
Thursday to unveil his latest creation: the XFL, a new pro football league set
to open in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   No scripts. No sideshows. Just football.
</P>
<P>
	   No, really.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why football?" asked McMahon, echoing a question no doubt pondered from
coast to coast. "Some have suggested the NFL is the 'No Fun League.' The XFL
will be the extremely fun league. This will be a blast."
</P>
<P>
	   It's a new world for McMahon, the "sports entertainment" impresario who
converted professional wrestling from a low-brow, oft-mocked pursuit into a
low-brow, oft-mocked multi-million dollar business.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was done with writers creating wild scenarios, and bigger-than-life
characters such as Hulk Hogan and Mankind, and phony feuds and bogus
friendships.
</P>
<P>
	   The football league, McMahon promised a crowded news conference, will be
real.
</P>
<P>
	   No, really.
</P>
<P>
	   "The WWF is 100 percent entertainment," McMahon said. "But the XFL is 100
percent sports."
</P>
<P>
	   So the outcomes will not be scripted?
</P>
<P>
	   "Nooo," said McMahon, his eyes rolling skyward in the WWF's midtown
Manhattan restaurant. "Nooo."
</P>
<P>
	   You want reality? McMahon said the start-up costs for the eight-team league
will run him "somewhere south of $100 million." There are already teams in New
York, Miami, Orlando, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with two more
teams to be announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-Dallas Cowboys star Drew Pearson is on the league's football advisory
committee, and 15-time Emmy-winning broadcast executive Michael Weisman is
working on its television team.
</P>
<P>
	   There's no immediate word on a television contract, although negotiations
are continuing, league executives said. McMahon boldly predicted the league
could turn a profit within three years.
</P>
<P>
	   History doesn't support that view. Investors in the USFL, and the WFL, and
assorted other 'FLs have long since taken their balls and gone home.
</P>
<P>
	   McMahon said his league will succeed by attracting the young viewers already
tuned into the WWF, along with the football fans suffering post-Super Bowl
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   He also promised innovative television coverage, from helmet cameras to
sideline and locker room access.
</P>
<P>
	   But don't expect to see wrestlers like Triple H and the Undertaker in pads
and cleats: "Their interest in the XFL will be as fans," McMahon promised.
</P>
<P>
	   A reverse cross-over, with football players climbing into the ring, could
happen, McMahon said. That's old hat for McMahon, who paid Hall of Fame
linebacker Lawrence Taylor a reported $500,000 to appear at Wrestlemania XI - a
spectacle unseen since Wrestlemania X.
</P>
<P>
	   McMahon leveled several pot-shots at the NFL during the course of his news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The XFL would not feature "an overregulated, antiseptic brand of football,"
he promised. "The XFL will take you places where the NFL is afraid to go
because, quite frankly, we are not afraid of anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, McMahon announced, "This will not be a league for pantywaists or
sissies." Toward that goal, players on winning teams will receive bigger
paychecks than the losers.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's really the American way," said McMahon, sounding dangerously like
Don King.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite McMahon's confidence, there are many XFL skeptics, from Wall Street
experts - who wondered about the affect of the move on WWF stock - to
entertainment figures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pretty much calling it a joke," said Ryan Schinman, president of the
entertainment and marketing firm CMB Entertainment. "I look at Vince McMahon as
an innovator, a pioneer, a marketing genius. That's what baffles me. Why do
this?"

<HEADLINE> CBS To Air 'Big Brother' Series  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS hopes to make voyeurs out of TV viewers this summer
with a new show in which a group of volunteers will live for three months in a
home equipped with two dozen cameras and 59 microphones -- even in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The network won a bidding war to adapt a Dutch series, "Big Brother," for
American television and announced Thursday it will air the show five days a week
this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine or 10 people living in the house will be whittled down, week by
week, by viewers who vote on who has to leave. At the series' end, viewers
decide which character they like best, and the winner gets a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
	   It's something like MTV's long-running "Real World" series, only much more
intense: Participants cannot go anywhere within the house without being seen or
heard, and will be permitted no contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they will be on television constantly, they won't be allowed to
watch TV.
</P>
<P>
	   When the series is not on the air, fans will be able to follow the
housemates any time, day or night, through a Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   "Big Brother" was a sensation when it aired in the Netherlands last fall,
particularly among young people. Roughly one in 15 Dutch citizens tuned in
regularly to watch the housemates brush their teeth, take out the trash or just
hang out.
</P>
<P>
	   "This type of show appeals to a certain sense of voyeurism in all of us,
like listening in on a nearby conversation or walking past a house and glancing
in the window," said Paul Romer, executive producer of the Dutch show. "There is
something magical about being able to listen to and watch other people."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS will conduct a nationwide search for participants and put them through
physical and psychological screening. Volunteers can leave whenever they want,
but will be immediately replaced and forfeit their chance for a prize. The
home's location has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
	   The network paid a reported $20 million to the Dutch production company
Endemol Entertainment for rights to the series, outbidding Fox, ABC and the USA
cable network.
</P>
<P>
	   By airing "Big Brother" so often, CBS hopes to duplicate ABC's success at
adapting the British game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." ABC put
"Millionaire" on over several nights last August and suddenly had the hit of the
TV season.
</P>
<P>
	   Also this summer, CBS is airing a similar reality-based show, "Survivor," in
which 16 contestants are thrown together on a deserted island off Borneo. The
winner of the endurance test gets $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are bold moves for CBS, which usually doesn't risk shocking an audience
whose average age is over 50. The summer rerun season is the perfect time to be
a little daring, said CBS President Leslie Moonves.
</P>
<P>
	   "Viewers are looking for new forms of programming and this is an attempt to
be ahead of the curve in finding the next form," spokesman Chris Ender said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox is planning its own real-life soap opera this summer, "High School,"
created by a documentary filmmaker who is following a high school class from
suburban Chicago throughout the school year.
</P>
<P>
	   Romer, who admitted "Big Brother" is "a little cruel," said participants in
the Netherlands were instructed to be themselves. They must work together to
survive the experience, but all know there is ultimately only one winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands Institute of Psychologists called the show "irresponsible
and unethical."
</P>
<P>
	   Some Dutch critics just found it a little dull.

<HEADLINE> MDs Criticize Pregnancy Supplements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new government rule threatens pregnant women and their
babies by allowing dietary supplements to treat morning sickness without
evidence the products are safe, says a petition filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration "seems to have thrown caution to the wind
and appears willing to endanger unborn babies," said the consumer advocacy group
Public Citizen and well-known birth defects expert Dr. Godfrey Oakley of Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition urges FDA to rescind its ruling last month allowing dietary
supplements to sell as treatments for "ordinary" morning sickness and
pregnancy-related leg swelling.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA rule "runs counter to medical understanding and practice," Dr.
Philip Landrigan of New York's Mount Sinai Hospital wrote FDA separately. "This
decision has the potential to put pregnant women and their offspring at serious
risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Dietary supplements do not undergo government scrutiny for safety or
effectiveness before selling.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law does prohibit supplements from claiming to treat diseases. The
FDA, however, ruled that morning sickness and leg swelling are not diseases, so
supplements can claim to treat them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pregnant women are told to avoid chemicals in which fetal safety has not
been proven, and these supplements contain untested ingredients, said Public
Citizen's Dr. Sidney Wolfe. Some supplement ingredients, such as ephedrine,
actually are considered risky in pregnancy, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, leg swelling sometimes signals a life threatening condition, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA officials declined comment on the petition. When asked if such products
are safe, FDA spokesman Brad Stone said pregnant women should consult a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy should not be confused with prenatal vitamins and folic
acid, dietary supplements that are important in pregnancy, cautioned Annette
Dickinson of the industry's Council for Responsible Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   As for morning-sickness supplements, "the manufacturer would certainly have
an obligation to consider very carefully the safety," she said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court upholds lethal injection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Supreme Court Thursday ruled that the
use of lethal injection is constitutional because it is the most humane method
of execution.
<P>
	   The 5-2 ruling came in the case of death row inmate Daniel Webb, who had
challenged lethal injection as cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice Francis M. McDonald Jr., writing for the majority, said "there
is no objective evidence ... that unnecessary pain is inherent in execution by
lethal injection."
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled that proper administration of lethal injection would result
in a quick and painless death and "did not offend current standards of decency."
</P>
<P>
	   Webb is on death row for the 1989 murder of banker Diane Gellenbeck. She was
kidnapped from a downtown parking garage, taken to Hartford's Keney Park and
shot seven times.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Rademacher, Webb's public defender, had argued that lethal injection
could meet constitutional standards if practiced by proper medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   But under the state's plan, either emergency medical technicians, paramedics
or nurses would be used to set up the intravenous tube that administers the
deadly doses of medication. A team of correction officers administer the
execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Rademacher argued that an anesthesiologist needs to be present to ensure the
defendant receives the proper dosage and is kept unconscious throughout the
execution. He said a person without medical training will not be able to tell if
the prisoner can feel pain.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court says that argument is irrelevant until there's a history of
botched executions in the state," Rademacher said Thursday. "They're taking a
wait-and-see approach, so people are going to have to go through painful
executions before they do anything about it."
</P>
<P>
	   The justices ruled that the possibility of a "botched execution is extremely
remote" under Connecticut's procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors argued that the drugs the prisoner would receive are five times
the amount necessary to cause sleep, and take effect almost instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Constitution makes no direct reference to "cruel and unusual
punishment." The subject is alluded to when the document deals with due process
issues, but the high court rejected arguments that using medical procedures to
killing inmates is so abhorrent that it would be a violation of due process
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Flemming Norcott Jr., one of the two dissenting justices, said in a
short written statement said his previous opposition to the death penalty is
well documented.
</P>
<P>
	   The other dissenter, Justice Joette Katz, questioned the right of the state
to kill.
</P>
<P>
	   "The issue for me is not whether the defendant who has committed such
hideous atrocities has the right to life, but whether we as a society have the
right to kill," Katz wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court had reviewed Webb's case once before. The court in 1996
upheld Webb's conviction and death sentence but allowed him to return to
Superior Court to argue that lethal injection was cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Webb is among seven men currently on the state's death row. The state has
not executed an inmate since 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Webb has also filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the conditions on death
row at the maximum-security Northern Correctional Institution constitute cruel
and unusual punishment.

<HEADLINE> State GOP leaders eye surrender in anti-McCain effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Top New York Republican leaders, backing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's candidacy, appeared ready Thursday to wave the white flag of
surrender in their battle to keep John McCain off the state's presidential
primary ballot.
<P>
	   Keeping the pressure on, McCain sent letters to Gov. George Pataki and state
GOP Chairman William Powers calling for them to "do the right thing for New York
Republicans."
</P>
<P>
	   "The system that is responsible for this sad situation cannot be defended
any longer," McCain added. "It is an embarrassment to a wonderful state, a
disappointment to a proud party and an affront to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, appearing in Dover, Del., said "put him on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent shift came after Bush, stung by McCain's big New Hampshire
primary win Tuesday and unhappy about handing McCain an issue tailor-made for
his "outsider" campaign, signaled his New York supporters their fight to keep
McCain off primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's congressional
district had gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, one of the Texas governor's top strategists, told the top
echelons of the party in New York on Wednesday that Bush would prefer his
supporters not appeal if McCain wins a federal court challenge, said a Bush
adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A top adviser to Pataki and Powers, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said "they're leaning toward not appealing."
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling in that case could come as early as Friday and lawyers on both
sides said they expect it to be a victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In Delaware, Bush said he didn't think his campaign would be hurt by a court
ruling in New York for McCain. "I'd be happy for him to be on the ballot if the
judge so decides," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was even talk Thursday that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case. McCain's New York
campaign manager, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, said he knew
nothing about that.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Powers, but one of his lawyers, Lawrence
Mandelker, said, "there obviously is enormous political pressure for a
settlement. I'm not involved in those discussions. They are several pay grades
above me, as we used to say in the military."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized the Texas governor for not calling off the
effort to block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary
because he lacked enough petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush runningmate, has also come
under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they're smart, they just throw open the door and let McCain come
crashing through now," Nelson Warfield, a veteran political operative who worked
on Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's Governor Pataki trying to build a national image and now he runs the
risk of being seen as that governor who's pro-choice on abortion and anti-choice
for president," Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in the wake of McCain's New Hampshire victory, New York Republicans who
backed Bush are getting nervous, Republican operative Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of people in the last 24 hours not sleeping well on the
Republican side in New York," Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
district. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you sow, so shall you reap," McCain supporter Molinari, a former
congressman, crowed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker, while confirming Rove had discussed
the McCain lawsuit with New York party leaders, said any decision about an
appeal is "not a decision for us to make."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to New York's the state Republican committee,
said Thursday that the party had not decided how it would react to a loss in
court. "No decision will be made until we read the (judge's) decision," Buley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Deutch in Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch may have been careless in
putting classified material on a home computer connected to the Internet, but no
one thinks he was engaged in espionage, CIA Director George Tenet told Congress
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet made that assertion after Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., likened Deutch's
actions to those of former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee -- now jailed on an
indictment for comparable computer practices -- and questioned why Deutch was
being treated differently.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Justice Department lawyers will review a CIA inspector general's
report on the Deutch investigation, but based on information now available,
there are no plans to reopen it, a Justice official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet disputed a parallel between Deutch and Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In one instance, there is an intent to do harm to the United States.
That's a legal judgment that's been made. In the other instance, a similar legal
judgment was not made,'' Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``I
don't think the cases are similar.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Lee was not charged by the government with espionage. Instead, he
was indicted on 59 counts related to the alleged mishandling U.S. nuclear
secrets, including transferring top-secret files from a secured computer to one
that was not secure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has denied any role in alleged attempts by China to steal U.S. nuclear
secrets at the weapons laboratory. He is being held without bond and could face
life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Deutch has not been prosecuted, Tenet stripped him of his security
clearances last August -- nearly three years after he left the job he held from
1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, who previously was deputy secretary of defense, is a chemistry
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Calls by The Associated
Press to his office at MIT and messages left at his home were not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Allard contended there were similarities between the two cases, saying Lee
and the former CIA director ``both made similar mistakes in the fact that they
both had information that was very important to this country on unsecured
computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet said Deutch was merely working from his home, not engaged in
transferring classified material from a secured computer to an unsecured one, as
Lee is alleged to have done.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not to say that this case involving the former director is not
serious,'' said Tenet, who has called his predecessor's computer behavior
``sloppy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's criminal division investigated Deutch's computer
use and declined last spring to prosecute, referring the case back to the CIA
inspector general for administrative discipline, according to Justice officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The division found the lapses were careless
rather than nefarious.
</P>
<P>
	   When Deutch left his post in December 1996, CIA investigators discovered he
had put large quantities of classified material on a CIA-supplied but unsecured
computer in his home.
</P>
<P>
	   The same computer was used by Deutch and other members of his household to
send and receive e-mail and to access Internet sites, according to congressional
and intelligence-community officials familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, disclosed Wednesday that
someone in the household had used the same computer to access pornographic
sites, although not at times when Deutch was home; and that an e-mail message to
Deutch from a Russian scientist was found on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by Armed Services Chairman John Warner, R-Va., to comment on these
latest revelations, Tenet said, ``I can't and I won't.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he regretted the material had become public, and said the CIA was
cooperating with Senate and House intelligence committee investigations. ``Let
the matter rest there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner agreed, but told Tenet he found the potential security breach ``very
disturbing and indeed tragic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet has said there is no evidence Deutch's home computer had been hacked
into by foreign adversaries or otherwise compromised. But neither is there any
way to be certain it hadn't been, given that the technology exists for such
intrusions, he said. The computer contained ``enormously sensitive material ...
at the highest levels of classification,'' Tenet told the Senate Intelligence
Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under CIA policy, only a few officials, including the director, are
authorized to work at home with classified material. In those cases, they must
use special CIA computers with lockable hard drives. Laptops must be returned to
special CIA-provided safes after use. And there is a blanket ban on connecting
to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Insurer Cigna Censured Tobacco News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cigna, one of the nation's largest health insurers,
eliminated negative references to smoking in a newsletter it produced for
employees of tobacco giant Philip Morris, Cigna confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose was to shield Philip Morris employees from information they
would consider offensive, officials of the tobacco company and Cigna HealthCare
said. The censorship continued until last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The censoring became public as documents were released as part of the
discovery process in a lawsuit filed against cigarette makers by dozens of Blue
Cross and Blue Shield health plans. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis first
reported the censuring in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents showed that between 1996 and 1999 the two companies shared
information about the content of upcoming health articles, and that Cigna agreed
to drop or edit pieces that Philip Morris found objectionable, the Star Tribune
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We worked with Cigna to take out some of the references in the newsletters
that we thought could be offensive or annoying to our employees," Philip Morris
spokeswoman Mary Carnovale said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigna, the country's third-largest health insurer, was paid by Philip Morris
to produce a special edition of its quarterly Well-Being newsletter for Philip
Morris, which includes Kraft Foods and Miller Beer. Its edited newsletters were
distributed only to Philip Morris and Kraft employees that elected to be insured
by Cigna.
</P>
<P>
	   "Philip Morris was paying for a product that is specific to them and in that
regard we have to listen to their requests," Cigna spokesman Howard Drescher
said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the documents, the two companies discussed how to handle
references to smoking in articles on ear infections, osteoporosis, asthma, heart
disease, pregnancy, addiction, healthy lifestyles and even safe behavior around
gas-powered lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The health effects of smoking are obviously very well known; this was done
really in response to the employee concerns," Carnovale said. "Many who have
worked here many, many years took those references very personally."

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Illness From Eggs Drops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of salmonella from eating raw or undercooked eggs
dropped by more than one-third between 1996 and 1998, the government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention credited better safety
measures for egg production and preparation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see this as a triumph of a collaborative effort between CDC, state
health departments, industry, commercial food preparers and consumers," said Dr.
David Swerdlow, a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   For reasons not fully understood, the rate of a type of salmonella illness
associated with raw or undercooked eggs soared in the 1980s and '90s from 0.6
cases per 100,000 people in 1976 to 3.6 in 1996. But the rate dropped to 2.2 per
100,000 from 1996 to 1998, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s, health officials began a push to educate people about the
dangers of raw or undercooked eggs in such things as Caesar salads, homemade ice
cream and eggnog.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms of salmonella illness include nausea, diarrhea, fever, abdominal
cramps and chills. Most infected people recover in a few days, but the illness
can be fatal for infants, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC estimates that 600 people die from the illness each year.

<HEADLINE> Breakthroughs in Insulin Delivery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A technique that allows insulin hormone to be stored in
cells and then released as needed by a pill eventually may offer a treatment for
diabetes that does not require daily injections, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The experiments, thus far, have been performed only on mice, but researchers
say a system using an implanted insulin gene may be ready for human testing
within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, researchers at
Ariad Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Mass., and at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York said the cell engineering technique was able to
control diabetes in a group of laboratory mice and is now being tested on larger
animals.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Clackson, senior author of the study, said that the technique causes
insulin, or some other protein, to clump inside a cell with another protein,
forming a molecule that is too large to leave the cell. A drug, given as a pill,
breaks up the clump, allowing the insulin to flow into the blood stream in a way
that mimics the spurt of hormone normally secreted by the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amount of protein (such as insulin) that gets released is directly
related to the amount of drug that is given," said Clackson. "The more drug you
give, the more protein gets released into circulation."
</P>
<P>
	   In diabetes, the technique theoretically would allow a patient to precisely
control insulin levels in the blood by a pill. Many diabetics now must control
insulin levels by injection.
</P>
<P>
	   A common type of diabetes is caused by the failure of the pancreas to
produce an appropriate amount of insulin to metabolize glucose, or sugar, levels
in the blood stream. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin in response to the
detected level of glucose.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Furlanetto, scientific director of the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation, said the experimental technique "is very clever science" but might
fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   "To be truly useful, it would have to be coupled to a system that would
release the hormone in direct response to the levels of glucose in the blood,"
said Furlanetto.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Furlanetto said the technique could be very useful in treating
conditions that require periodic secretion, or pulsed release, of some needed
protein, such as growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   In the experiment, Clackson and his colleagues inserted into laboratory
cells genes that produce insulin and a protein that naturally clumps, or
aggregates, with insulin. Once inside the cells, the genes produce the two
proteins. They form clusters that are too large to pass through pores in the
walls of the cell compartments.
</P>
<P>
	   The engineered cells were then injected into the muscles of mice that are
diabetic and normally develop high levels of glucose in the blood.
</P>
<P>
	   When these mice were fed a drug that caused the protein clusters to split
apart, insulin was released into the bloodstream and glucose levels dropped to
normal.
</P>
<P>
	   In control mice, which had the engineered cells but were not given the oral
drug, insulin did not appear in the bloodstream and glucose levels stayed high.
</P>
<P>
	   "The insulin stays in the compartments of the cell and has no toxicity or
adverse effects. It just sits there," said Clackson. "Only when the animal
receives the drug do the aggregates break apart and then flow into the
circulation."
</P>
<P>
	   Clackson said the experiment was only a "proof of concept" for the
technique. The next step is to transfer genes directly into body muscle cells, a
common gene therapy technique. To do this, the target genes will be put into a
virus that would be injected and deliver the genes into muscle cells, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the initial target of the research is diabetes, Clackson said the
protein clustering technique could also be used to deliver any protein that the
body needs in spurts. For instance, the technique could be used to administer
growth hormone, or proteins that would provide pain relief, appetite control or
correct brain chemistry, he said.

<HEADLINE> One year later: Life goes on  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The "Donny and Marie" show drones on at the nail salon;
Spanish-language soap operas pulsate through the laundromat.
<P>
	   A vigil will be held in the place where Amadou Diallo lived - and where, one
year ago Friday, he died. But in this Bronx neighborhood, called Soundview, the
workaday world goes on.
</P>
<P>
	   Outward appearances refract the horror that erupted in the tiny vestibule,
no bigger than two phone booths, of the two-story brick building where Diallo
lived.
</P>
<P>
	   Some bullet holes remain just below the four mail slots; but most have been
covered with plaster. The outside door lock doesn't work, making it easy for
people to come in and scribble odes to Diallo on the vestibule's yellow walls.
</P>
<P>
	   "It isn't good to stay in a white, racist country too long," wrote one
person. "Rest in peace, Amadou," wrote another.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of Diallo, an unarmed, African immigrant, by four white police
officers churned up the bile of suspicion in New Yorkers who feel that people of
color are often unfairly targeted. Police said it was a tragedy that occurred as
they sought to keep all people safe.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officials tried to quell accusations of brutality by meeting with
black leaders to discuss reforms. A committee now oversees diversity training at
the Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, residents at 1157 Wheeler Avenue, including Diallo's roommate at
the time of the shooting, were besieged by unwanted attention. They try hard now
to keep to themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am trying to sleep," pleaded the roommate, Abdou Diallo - no relation -
when awakened at noon Wednesday, the day the trial began. "I need to sleep."
</P>
<P>
	   Abdou Diallo told the New York Post recently that he wakes up screaming and
shaking from nightmares.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not easy living with a pain in your heart; it never goes away," said
Abdou Diallo, 25, who comes from the same village in Guinea as Diallo. "Every
day, I wake up screaming and I have headaches."
</P>
<P>
	   He is further reminded of the shooting every time he must pass through the
vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   The neighborhood is made up of working class people - mostly minorities -
who also keep to themselves. Many have not lived in the area for long.
</P>
<P>
	   On the day of the shooting, most residents interviewed said they had never
met Diallo or heard the barrage of 41 bullets aimed at him. An elevated subway
track runs along the neighborhood's main thoroughfare and trains rumble by at
all hours.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, shops were busy on neighboring Westchester Avenue, and the street
bustling with people. Residents knew the trial had started, but most didn't know
it was on television.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure we get Court TV," said Belinda Evans, a hairdresser at
Ashley's Beauty Touch. "A few customers talk about Diallo, but it's mostly
business as usual here."
</P>
<P>
	   Further down the street, none of the TVs at Cam Electronics were tuned into
the trial. But owner Tony Rojas remembers.
</P>
<P>
	   He remembers meeting Diallo two nights before the shooting. "He came in to
buy an iron for his mother," Rojas said. "He was very nice."
</P>
<P>
	   In Diallo's other world, the lower Manhattan street where he sold scarves,
hats, socks and videotapes off a folding table, his fellow vendors had closed up
shop for the winter.
</P>
<P>
	   But a convenience store worker, reading a newspaper story on the trial,
recalled Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "He worked hard every day so he could have a better life in America," said
Jose Ramirez, who came to New York from the Dominican Republic six years ago. "I
hope the city will remember him and all the other hard-working immigrants
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
	   An "Interfaith Service for Healing," featuring Islamic, Christian, Jewish,
Hindu, Buddhist and Native American observances, will be held at 2 p.m. Friday
at Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's relatives and their supporters were planning a vigil for him in
Soundview on Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Placido Domingo: Bridging catastrophe and splendor with music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - On this night, Placido Domingo co-starred with a
3-year-old girl. And it was a love story.
<P>
	   The tenor and other Metropolitan Opera stars sang for Sophia Forshtay, a
smiling waif of a child suffering from the monstrous "living statue" disease
that freezes the body by turning tissue into bone.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very important to find a solution quickly. We are here singing for
love," Domingo said at the Waldorf-Astoria benefit Wednesday for research on FOP
- fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia's mother, Constance Green, is a member of the Met chorus whose voice
has accompanied Domingo's for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   After the child was diagnosed at 14 months, "Placido asked me, 'What can I
do?"' said the soprano.
</P>
<P>
	   What he did Wednesday was to lead a star-studded cast in "Songs for Sophia"
- a medley of Broadway and opera tunes delivered by some of the world's most
beautiful voices, including Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel and sopranos Federica von
Stade and Heidi Grant Murphy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia was stiffly romping around the golden Waldorf ballroom, a smiling,
delicate child in a pink silk gown getting cranky in a crowd, and impishly
telling Domingo as he hummed her a song, "No singing!"
</P>
<P>
	   The evening was an encounter of splendor and catastrophe, linked by those
fighting the incurable disease that affects one out of 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   With tickets starting at $500 and individual contributions reaching $25,000,
several hundred guests - including Ivana Trump - contributed about a quarter of
a million dollars for the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center's FOP
research team.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this disease, we know what the bomb looks like, but we don't know what
triggers the bomb. We have to disarm it," said Dr. Fred Kaplan, head of the
university's world-class Division of Metabolic Bone Diseases and Molecular
Orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
	   They are challenging a disease that turns the body's connective tissue to
bone. Kaplan's team is trying to create drugs that would inhibit the
bone-forming protein that produces the wild growths that invade the body inch by
inch.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks could hold the key to a treatment, says the doctor, who is testing a
new drug made from cells in the sea creature.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that solving the mystery of FOP could lead to progress in treating
more common bone-linked conditions such as osteoporosis, arthritis and
degeneration of the heart valves.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, for Sophia and her mother, it's a daily struggle at home in Fort
Lee, N.J. "The lumps appeared on her head," says Green. "She woke up one morning
not able to move the right arm, and another morning she couldn't move the left
arm, then it was the head."
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia almost died last fall, when the tissue around her neck began
swelling, threatening to strangle her.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday night, her biggest fear was the massive chandeliers over
her tiny head that she eyed suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 90-minute show, as Domingo offered "Yours is my heart alone" from
the operetta "Land of Smiles," Green's eyes gleamed with tears in the light of
hundreds of candles illuminating the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Sophia's mother got up and sang, "Grace for the Moment."
</P>
<P>
	   And later, she shared a different kind of hope: "This disease points up how
the spirit is separate from the body. You see an intact human being inside, and
you realize there is something more than just this body."

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Adding Legroom  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even the cheapest seats on American Airlines will offer
passengers several more inches of legroom under a $70 million fleet overhaul
announced Thursday by the air carrier, the first such major airline upgrade
benefiting everyone who flies coach class.
</P>
<P>
	   American, the nation's second-largest airline, will eliminate two rows of
coach-class seats from every plane in its 700-jet fleet to give each coach
passenger 3 to 5 inches more legroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "American is going to be able to provide more room for more coach passengers
than any other airline anywhere," Chairman Don Carty said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Business rivals and Wall Street analysts alike suggested the carrier's move
may put pressure on the rest of the industry to do the same, giving travelers
frustrated by cramped quarters the relief for which they've long clamored.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the whole industry is going to have to follow suit," said Ray
Neidl, an aviation analyst for ING Barings. "It is a competitive item."
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Air Travelers Association, a passenger advocacy group,
welcomed American's action as "a very significant development for passengers."
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope that will be a bellwether change that all airlines with follow
through with," said David Stempler, the association's president.
</P>
<P>
	   American plans to remove 7,200 seats from its fleet -- representing 6
percent of its coach capacity -- in an overhaul that began this week. It should
be completed by November for domestic flights and by mid-2001 for international
flights.
</P>
<P>
	   While American said no fare increases will result directly from the move,
some suggested a reduction in airline capacity ultimately may translate into
higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fares may drift up a little bit," Stempler said. "And that may be the price
you have to pay. We are at historically low pricing in terms of airline fares."
</P>
<P>
	   American's announcement came with an unusual mea culpa from American
executives, who acknowledged the industry has long ignored passengers'
complaints about cramped quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   "To some degree, this is an industry that has lately been in denial," Carty
said. "In an environment where many customers are questioning the value of air
travel, we hope this effort tells loudly and clearly that American listens and
American responds to its customers."
</P>
<P>
	   Carty conceded, however, that American's interest in improving passenger
conditions resulted from congressional interest last year in imposing mandatory
changes on the industry. "We came to the conclusion that we weren't as focused
as we needed to be on our customers," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   American posted the industry's second highest rate of customer complaints
over everything from mishandled bags to flight delays last year, according to
Transportation Department figures issued this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach seats will increase from the industry standard of a 31- or 32-inch
seat pitch, which represents the amount of living space, to a minimum 34 inches
and as much as 36 inches depending on the plane model, American said.
</P>
<P>
	   The carrier touted its new legroom campaign by bringing a mockup of a coach
cabin to Washington to show members of Congress and the media what the extra
seat room will look like. The 6-foot-3 Carty's knees were firmly wedged against
the seat back under the current configuration but had a few inches of legroom
with the expanded arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   Convinced the added legroom will give American a competitive advantage over
its rivals, the airline will roll out a print and TV advertising blitz beginning
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   American executives said their program goes well beyond rival United
Airlines' announcement of an "economy plus" program last year, which offers
seats with added legroom in the front third of domestic coach cabins to
full-fare passengers and the most frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
	   But United, the nation's largest airline, accused American of playing
catch-up.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure where they were last year when we launched 'economy plus',"
said Graham Atkinson, United's senior vice president for marketing. "We are sort
of somewhat amused in American's spin of events today."
</P>
<P>
	   Atkinson acknowledged that American's move "changes the geography of
competition a little" -- and didn't rule out the possibility that United would
extend legroom throughout its coach cabins.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't for a minute say we won't look at this, we won't respond,"
Atkinson said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak End Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Less than a month after one much-touted
Israeli-Arab peace initiative crumbled, another dissolved Thursday into mutual
recriminations -- and the comprehensive Mideast peace Prime Minister Ehud Barak
promised by year's end seems further away than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians said peace talks were in ``crisis'' after Barak refused to
budge on terms for an interim territory withdrawal during a tense two-hour
summit with Yasser Arafat at this Israeli military outpost on the Israel-Gaza
border.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second peace blow for Barak in three weeks -- talks with Syria
went into deep freeze in mid-January -- and he scrambled to deflect Palestinian
talk of a dead end.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that this barrier will be overcome,'' Barak told senior
officials of his Labor Party. ``There is a deep interest by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the pullout from 6.1 percent of the West Bank outlined
in an interim agreement signed in September to include populous Arab suburbs of
Jerusalem. The Israelis refuse, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once the confidence and credibility and integrity of the peace process
become absent, the element of trust disappears and both sides find themselves in
a crisis situation, and that's where we are now,'' lead Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel says it alone determines what land goes back in the withdrawals,
although it will take Palestinian considerations into account.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is concerned the Palestinians will use total control of the suburbs,
currently under joint control, as the first stake in a claim to Jerusalem, the
city both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said Arafat suggested using U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross, who
is in the region, as an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope that through the good offices of the American administration ...
we can restore the confidence and credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Foreign Minister David Levy rejected that idea, accusing the
Palestinians of engineering the dispute in order to invite U.S. intervention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No outside force can do the work instead of us,'' Levy said, pledging the
pullout would go ahead next week as planned. ``No one can do this instead of the
sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Israelis and Palestinians see President Clinton as eager for a
legacy as his presidency winds down, and likely to press Israel into
concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat also accused Israel of wanting to delay a Feb. 13 deadline for an
outline of a final status agreement, due to be in place by September.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy said Feb. 13 was ``not sacred,'' but denied plans for a delay. Barak's
office said marathon talks aimed at meeting the deadline would resume on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinians are now operating under the assumption that Barak is shelving the
talks to focus on reviving talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-brokered talks with Syria broke down after Israel refused to meet a
Syrian condition to withdraw to the border before the 1967 Mideast war, when
Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights. Israel also balked at Syria's
insistence on equivalent demilitarized zones.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic militants in southern Lebanon have since stepped up their attacks on
Israeli forces, killing three Israeli soldiers and a senior officer of an allied
militia this week. Barak accused Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, of
allowing the violence to increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is additionally in trouble because of a growing scandal over how his
party financed his election campaign in May. Sensing his weakness, some partners
in his fragile coalition are flirting with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak denied that domestic considerations have led him to neglect his
ambitious Mideast peace plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a government that is looking for excuses not to progress,'' he
said. ``It is rather a government ... determined to move toward agreements with
all the neighbors around.''

<HEADLINE> State GOP leaders eye surrender in anti-McCain effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Top New York Republican leaders, backing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's candidacy, appeared ready Thursday to wave the white flag of
surrender in their battle to keep John McCain off the state's presidential
primary ballot.
<P>
	   Keeping the pressure on, McCain sent letters to Gov. George Pataki and state
GOP Chairman William Powers calling for them to "do the right thing for New York
Republicans."
</P>
<P>
	   "The system that is responsible for this sad situation cannot be defended
any longer," McCain added. "It is an embarrassment to a wonderful state, a
disappointment to a proud party and an affront to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, appearing in Dover, Del., said "put him on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent shift came after Bush, stung by McCain's big New Hampshire
primary win Tuesday and unhappy about handing McCain an issue tailor-made for
his "outsider" campaign, signaled his New York supporters their fight to keep
McCain off primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's congressional
district had gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, one of the Texas governor's top strategists, told the top
echelons of the party in New York on Wednesday that Bush would prefer his
supporters not appeal if McCain wins a federal court challenge, said a Bush
adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A top adviser to Pataki and Powers, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said "they're leaning toward not appealing."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case said Thursday that no ruling would be issued before
Monday, at the earliest. Lawyers on both sides said they expect it to be a
victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In Delaware, Bush said he didn't think his campaign would be hurt by a court
ruling in New York for McCain. "I'd be happy for him to be on the ballot if the
judge so decides," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was talk Thursday that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case and the delay until
Monday for a possible court ruling seemed in line with that.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign manager, Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, said he knew nothing about that.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Powers, but one of his lawyers, Lawrence
Mandelker, said, "there obviously is enormous political pressure for a
settlement. I'm not involved in those discussions. They are several pay grades
above me, as we used to say in the military."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized the Texas governor for not calling off the
effort to block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary
because he lacked enough petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush runningmate, has also come
under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they're smart, they just throw open the door and let McCain come
crashing through now," Nelson Warfield, a veteran political operative who worked
on Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's Governor Pataki trying to build a national image and now he runs the
risk of being seen as that governor who's pro-choice on abortion and anti-choice
for president," Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in the wake of McCain's New Hampshire victory, New York Republicans who
backed Bush are getting nervous, Republican operative Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of people in the last 24 hours not sleeping well on the
Republican side in New York," Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
district. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you sow, so shall you reap," McCain supporter Molinari, a former
congressman, crowed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker, while confirming Rove had discussed
the McCain lawsuit with New York party leaders, said any decision about an
appeal is "not a decision for us to make."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to New York's the state Republican committee,
said Thursday that the party had not decided how it would react to a loss in
court. "No decision will be made until we read the (judge's) decision," Buley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> Haider Coalition To Be Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president agreed Thursday to swear in a
coalition government that includes a far-right party whose leader has applauded
aspects of the Nazi empire.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaction was swift. Israel recalled its ambassador and banned rightist Joerg
Haider from visiting. European Union nations started making good on threats to
politically isolate Austria, something the United States has backed. The EU also
warned it may suspend the Alpine nation's membership.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, protesters took to the streets for a second straight night
Thursday. The crowd, however, numbered about 2,000 -- far fewer than the 15,000
who rallied Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil said the results of the Oct. 3 parliamentary
elections give him little choice but to go ahead with the swearing in ceremony
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil did reject two Cabinet nominees from Haider's Freedom Party. The
president also demanded that Haider and his coalition partner, Wolfgang
Schuessel of the centrist Austrian People's Party, sign a statement renouncing
the nation's Nazi past and promising to respect European values.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety -- and later apologized -- for statements
praising Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of
the Waffen SS as ``decent people of good character.'' He has also opposed EU
expansion and urged a near halt to immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel will become chancellor and Freedom Party official Susanne
Riess-Passer will be vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider will remain governor of Carinthia state and hold no Cabinet
post, he has a strong grip on the Freedom Party. Critics doubt Schuessel, whose
hold on his own party is less firm, can control the mercurial Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   The declaration that the two leaders signed did not specifically refer to
Haider's previous comments. However, Haider and Schuessel pledged to work for a
democratic Austria where ``xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism have no place.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out of the tragic history of
the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the National Socialist regime,''
the statement said. ``The singularity of the crimes of the Holocaust, which are
without precedent in history, are an exhortation to permanent alertness against
all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a press conference after the signing ceremony, Haider insisted his party
was committed to defending the rights of ``ethnic and religious minorities'' in
Austria and could even serve as an example for the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said during a visit to Israel that
the declaration ``sounds like lip service'' and that Austria is making ``a
historic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France called the
Austrian developments a ``political shame without precedent in Europe since the
end of the second World War.''
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense; Portugal's president planned to call off a state visit in March.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Haider ``dangerous'' to
democracy and recalled the Jewish state's ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not post an ambassador to Austria from 1986 to 1992, during the
presidency of Kurt Waldheim, who was dogged by allegations of involvement in
Nazi persecution in the Balkans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party won 52 seats in the 183 member parliament, as did the
center-right People's Party. The Social Democrats, the main party in the
outgoing coalition, took 65 seats -- too few to govern alone.

<HEADLINE> Insurer Cigna Censured Tobacco News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cigna, one of the nation's largest health insurers,
eliminated negative references to smoking in a newsletter it produced for
employees of tobacco giant Philip Morris, Cigna confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose was to shield Philip Morris employees from information they
would consider offensive, officials of the tobacco company and Cigna HealthCare
said. The censorship continued until last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The censoring became public as documents were released as part of the
discovery process in a lawsuit filed against cigarette makers by dozens of Blue
Cross and Blue Shield health plans. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis first
reported the censoring in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents showed that between 1996 and 1999 the two companies shared
information about the content of upcoming health articles, and that Cigna agreed
to drop or edit pieces that Philip Morris found objectionable, the Star Tribune
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We worked with Cigna to take out some of the references in the newsletters
that we thought could be offensive or annoying to our employees," Philip Morris
spokeswoman Mary Carnovale said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigna, the country's third-largest health insurer, was paid by Philip Morris
to produce a special edition of its quarterly Well-Being newsletter for Philip
Morris, which includes Kraft Foods and Miller Beer. Its edited newsletters were
distributed only to Philip Morris and Kraft employees that elected to be insured
by Cigna.
</P>
<P>
	   "Philip Morris was paying for a product that is specific to them and in that
regard we have to listen to their requests," Cigna spokesman Howard Drescher
said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the documents, the two companies discussed how to handle
references to smoking in articles on ear infections, osteoporosis, asthma, heart
disease, pregnancy, addiction, healthy lifestyles and even safe behavior around
gas-powered lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The health effects of smoking are obviously very well known; this was done
really in response to the employee concerns," Carnovale said. "Many who have
worked here many, many years took those references very personally."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Closely Watching Austrian Gov't  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will keep a close watch on Austria's new
coalition government, which includes Joerg Haider's extreme right-wing Freedom
Party, a State Department spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While it's premature to talk about our actions at this stage, we will
determine what steps are appropriate based on what happens,'' James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States remains concerned even though Haider and his coalition
partner, Wolfgang Schuessel of the centrist Austrian People's Party, renounced
the nation's Nazi past and promised to respect European values.
</P>
<P>
	   Any suggestion ``our concerns would evaporate simply on the basis of a
statement is not credible,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeated Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's statement from Wednesday
that the Austria people have the right to choose their own government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the international community has its own rights and obligations to be
on the watch, to be concerned about the fate and future of democracy in a fellow
democracy in Austria,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright expressed the U.S. position in a telephone conversation Wednesday
with Schuessel and rebutted suggestions that Schuessel had ignored her and
joined Haider in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said statements Haider made in the past ``have caused deep concern.
... The words may indicate the direction people may take in practice. The
international community has to be vigilant when things are said which can
trivialize what happened 50, 60 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   About a decade ago, Haider praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly'' employment
policies and lauded veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent people of good
character.'' He also has opposed the European Union's expansion and urged a near
halt on immigration.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Prairie Dog Is Threatened  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said the black-tailed prairie
dog warrants protection as a threatened species but stopped short Thursday of
imposing politically controversial restrictions on developers and ranchers while
states work on ways to preserve the rodent.
</P>
<P>
	   A pest to many but a beloved critter to others, the prairie dog will be
added to a list of candidates for threatened status under the Endangered Species
Act and its status will be reviewed annually.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fish and Wildlife Service said it is dealing with too many other
plants and wildlife that are in more danger, such as the lynx and mountain
plover, to take on protecting the prairie dog.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The black-tailed prairie dog is a very resilient species. It's handled a
lot over the years,'' said Pete Gober, an agency biologist who led a year-long
study of the prairie dog. ``Hopefully we'll be able to work with those states to
avoid the necessity of listing the species.''
</P>
<P>
	   Colonies of prairie dogs, so named because of the barking sound that they
make, once were found on as many as 100 million acres from Canada to Mexico, but
the animal has been decimated by disease, eradication programs and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   Biologists don't know how many prairie dogs there are but say their habitat
has been reduced to about a million acres.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight western states -- Arizona, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas and Wyoming -- have agreed to come up with a plan by next year for
monitoring and protecting the animal. Colorado, where the prairie dog is
particularly controversial, is considering its own plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fish and Wildlife Service's annual reviews will look at how the prairie
dog is doing and whether it should be removed from the candidate list or moved
up in priority.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has already proposed several species for listing as endangered or
threatened in the region, including the lynx, mountain plover and Colorado
butterfly plant. Endangered status means that a species is in danger of
extinction; threatened status means it could become endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Wildlife Federation, which had petitioned for listing of the
black-tailed prairie dog, said it will work with the states on protection
measures. Among other things, the group wants states to classify the prairie dog
as wildlife, not a pest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision sends an important signal from the federal government that
the prairie dog's plight is dire and that serious changes must be made in the
way we manage it,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest threat to the prairie dog is a form of the bubonic plague that
can wipe out entire colonies, the Fish and Wildlife Service study said. The
animals have no immunity to the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The plague is now widespread through much of the prairie dog's historic
range with the exception of most of South Dakota and portions of Kansas,
Nebraska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It is no coincidence that four of the seven
largest remaining colonies of the animals are in South Dakota, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the decision say the prairie dog isn't endangered and that
putting it on the candidate list could lower property values because of the
possibility of future restrictions. Prarie dogs burrow extensive tunnel
networks, killing grass and destroying hay fields, and in recent years they have
become a nuisance near Denver and other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any rancher or farmer can tell you that this is one of the most hardy
species on the face of the earth,'' said Bob Schaffer, R-Colo. ``No matter how
hard you try to eradicate them they keep coming back in greater numbers.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gary Skiba, a biologist for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, said the
Fish and Wildlife Service's decision not to immediately list the prairie dog
gives federal and state officials ``some breathing room to do some things to
rectify problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have put a moratorium on
poisoning prairie dogs on the grazing lands that they manage.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students Charged in Skirmish  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Prosecutors have filed criminal charges against 174
radical student leaders of a strike that has shuttered Latin America's largest
university for the last nine months, local news media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers face a variety of charges -- including rioting, sabotage,
terrorism and assault -- stemming from a Tuesday skirmish in which they fought
anti-strike students and security forces at a university-affiliated high school.
Some could be sentenced to as much as 40 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The students and 76 minors also arrested Tuesday were being detained. Fellow
strikers, who remain in control of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico's huge main campus, have added the release of their comrades to their
list of demands for ending the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The minors' fate has yet to be decided. They are being held at a juvenile
detention facility and cannot be charged as adults, but they could be sent to
reform facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, prosecutors requested arrest warrants for another 430 members
of leftist ``community groups'' who have joined student strikers in occupying
the sprawling main campus, local media reported. Prosecutors said they want to
arrest the leftists on illegal-occupation charges. It was unclear whether courts
would grant the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike at the university began in April to protest the university's
plans to raise annual tuition from a few cents to $140. Administrators withdrew
the fee increase, but students later demanded sweeping policy changes. They
refuse to reopen the university until officials meet their demands for
guaranteed admissions and a loosening of academic standards.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies some motions in Michael Ross case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - With three weeks to go until serial killer
Michael Ross' penalty hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers argued Thursday
over the kinds of testimony and evidence that should be admitted.
<P>
	   The issues included the meaning of state Supreme Court decisions, a
videotaped competency evaluation of Ross, medical experts' testimony and the
relevance of a Roman Catholic bishop's testimony about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The penalty hearing, scheduled to start Feb. 22, will determine whether Ross
should be executed or sentenced to life in prison for killing four young women
in Eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross has received life sentences for killing two other young women in
Connecticut and has admitted to killing two others in New York, although he has
not been prosecuted for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Thomas Miano granted defense lawyers' request to have the Most Rev.
Daniel Hart, Bishop of Norwich, to testify about his knowledge of Ross'
character and background through their correspondence.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano, however, said Hart's testimony about the church's opinion of the
death penalty and the concept of mercy was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross' lawyer, Karen Goodrow, said the testimony should be allowed because
Ross was baptized Catholic and was confirmed in prison. She said she would like
Hart's testimony to be on the record for appellate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano said he may reexamine the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also heard a prosecution request to see a videotaped competency
examination of Ross performed in 1995. Assistant State's Attorney Peter McShane
said prosecutors first learned of the tape last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was made by Dr. Michael Norko, the director of the Whiting Forensic
Institute, for education and training purposes. Ross signed a waiver to allow
the tape to be shown to Norko's classes at Yale Medical School and to "officers
of the court", McShane said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what's on it. I think we're entitled to review it," McShane
said. "The fact is everyone else has seen it but us."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Barry Butler objected, saying the tape was made at a time
when Ross was representing himself and did not foresee a penalty hearing. Butler
said the waiver does not allow the tape to be released to anyone other than
people in medical, legal or mental health training.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're fishing," Butler said of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano did not immediately rule on the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he would allow testimony from a defense expert about a brain
abnormality in Ross, over the state's arguments that there is no proof Ross
suffered the abnormality when he killed the women.
</P>
<P>
	   The expert, psychiatrist James Merikangas, said tests show Ross' cerebellum
is smaller than average. Other parts of his brain show signs of the loss or
shrinkage of brain tissue, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano also agreed to consider arguments about the meaning of Supreme Court
rulings on the death penalty, especially a December ruling in the case of
Sedrick Cobb. The dispute centers on the state's burden to prove the killer's
specific intent.
</P>
<P>
	   On direction of the state Supreme Court in an appeal prosecutors brought in
October, Miano reversed his previous ruling on the rules the prosecution must
follow in presenting evidence at the penalty hearing. The rules now will be the
same for the prosecution and the defense.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was under intense pressure for months from investors and Mattel's
board of directors to explain big losses at the company's newly acquired
Learning Company software division and other troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership rolls, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, slipped 6 1/4 cents Thursday to $11.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Word of the resignation came in the final moments of trading on the
Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60
percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To Protect Financial Data  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Thursday proposed new rules
spelling out how consumers' personal data will be protected as barriers between
banks, investment firms and insurance companies come down.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules, proposed by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury Department
division, will make it tougher for financial companies to share even seemingly
innocuous information, such as customers' names, addresses and telephone
numbers, with outside marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators take the view that such basic information is ``non-public''
information when it is taken from sources such as customers lists -- even if the
names and addresses also are available from a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
	   As ``non-public'' information, the names and addresses -- as well as more
personal financial data such as account balances -- cannot be shared with
outside telemarketers if customers expressly ask their banks, brokerages or
insurance companies not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the onus is on consumers. They must ask, in a letter or standard
form, financial companies with whom they do business not to share or sell their
data.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, under the new law, banks, brokerages and insurers that join
together under the same corporate roof are entitled to share customers' personal
financial data with each other. In that case, customers do not have the right to
block such sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and privacy advocates have said the new law's privacy
protections fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not good enough for consumers, who won't get real privacy
protection,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director U.S. Public
Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for the American Bankers Association didn't immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment. Some bankers privately objected to the new
rules, saying they took an overly broad interpretation of privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who won Senate confirmation Thursday for a
fourth term, expressed approval of the new privacy rules at an open meeting at
which he and the other central bank governors voted to propose them for 30 days
of public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, so good,'' Greenspan told the Fed staff attorneys, who had drafted
the rules and negotiated with other federal agencies to make the regulations
consistent for different financial industries and sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   While most people think of the Federal Reserve as regulating the nation's
money supply and controlling interest rates, the central bank also oversees some
categories of banks, including those organized in a holding company structure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed is among a group of agencies that have been drafting privacy rules
for the industries and sectors they regulate, because of legislation enacted in
November that allowed banks, investment firms and insurance companies to get
involved in each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The other agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission; the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Department division that
regulates national banks; the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National
Credit Union Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for insurance companies
and agents and a panoply of other businesses outside of banks and securities
firms -- including travel agencies, mortgage companies, tax preparation
services, check-cashing outlets, credit bureaus and department stores that issue
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The agencies have been working under a tight deadline. Under the new law,
final regulations must take effect by November.
</P>
<P>
	   The Comptroller's office also published its rules Thursday, and the other
agencies are expected to follow in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important advance in privacy protections for consumers,''
Julie Williams, the agency's chief counsel, said in a telephone interview.
``This is a winning situation for consumers and potentially a new competitive
(feature) for banks'' that offer strong privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules, financial companies will have to disclose their privacy
policies to customers at least once a year.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Co. Buying Filene's Basement  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Filene's Basement, the legendary discounter that earned its
reputation with cluttered clothing racks, a unique pricing policy and a frenzied
annual wedding gown sale, has found a buyer to pull it from the financial
cellar.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio-based Value City Department Stores said it was paying $89 million to
buy the bankrupt retailer that had risen from the bowels of a venerable Boston
department store into a street-level chain with 51 stores -- before falling on
hard times.
</P>
<P>
	   "Filene's Basement has been a sinking ship with a great name," said Kurt
Barnard, a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
"But they will now function under some competent management."
</P>
<P>
	   Buoyed by its takeover, Filene's Basement officials predicted a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are delighted with the sale to Value City," said Sam Gerson, chairman
and CEO. "We will now focus on re-energizing our core stores and filling them
with the high-quality, bargain priced, brand name merchandise that made us a
retailing legend."
</P>
<P>
	   Founded 90 years ago in the basement of the Filene's department store as a
way to get rid of leftover merchandise, the cramped store slashed prices the
longer that items remained on the racks.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers in the basement often struggled over the same item. Its wedding
gown sale attracts hundreds of brides-to-be rushing into the store just after
dawn, fighting for bargains and trying on dresses in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
	   While the flagship store still maintains its unique pricing policy and
bridal sale, other stores in the chain are less idiosyncratic and operate
similar to other bargain retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Filene's Basement is separate now from its parent store, which is owned by
St. Louis-based May Company.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the agreement, Base Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Value City Department Stores, will acquire 14 remaining Filene's
Basement stores and may reopen three previously closed stores in Washington,
D.C. But the company's eight Aisle 3 stores, open only on weekends, are not part
of the agreement and will be closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Filene's Basement will be run as a subsidiary of Value City and will keep
its well-recognized name. Gerson was expected to stay on as its CEO and
chairman.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 137.06; Dow Up 10.24  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks bounded higher today as investors decided
that those companies are growing quickly enough to dodge the threat of rising
interest rates. Old-fashioned blue-chip shares were little changed.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 137.06 to 4,211.02, its
third biggest point gain in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24 to 11,013.44. Broader indicators
were also modestly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 15.85 to 1,424.97.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,063 up, 1,071 down and 403 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.10 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.03 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.90 to 519.79.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after the Federal Reserve imposed its fourth interest-rate increase
since June 1999, investors poured money into shares of technology companies to
the exclusion of all other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors are shaking off suggestions that the often slim
profits of growing technology companies may be squeezed by rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "These companies have the momentum," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment
strategist with Advest Inc. "Higher interest rates will only become a problem if
the momentum of companies like IBM, like Cisco Systems, appears to slow down."
</P>
<P>
	   Both of those companies rose yesterday. Technology bellwether Intel rose as
well, accounting for most of the Dow's gain.
</P>
<P>
	   But perhaps the greatest example of investors' faith in technology stocks
was Amazon.com. The online retailer said late Wednesday that while it posted its
worst losses ever during the fourth quarter of 1999, sales more than doubled.
Amazon.com officials also claimed that losses will narrow significantly by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's influential Internet analyst, raised his
near-term rating on the stock from "accumulate" to "buy."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that with the interest-rate picture still somewhat murky,
investors are gravitating toward the stocks that performed best in 1999. Since
the Fed began raising rates last June, the blue-chip Dow has risen just 4
percent, while the Nasdaq has soared 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The action and performance is still being placed on the shoulders of the
heavily indexed stocks," said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Weakness in old-fashioned industrials derailed the Dow. Alcoa and Exxon
Mobil fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, stocks were benefiting from a continued rally in the bond market.
Long-term Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week,
soared on Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part
of the Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.15 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market was lifted a bit after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
won Senate confirmation for a fourth term as head of the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, we have a proactive Fed that is willing to gradually nudge up
rates to slow down the economy, but not break its back," Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet investors clearly remained nervous. Stocks were pressured at midday by
rumors that the Federal Reserve bank of New York had called an emergency meeting
to discuss market volatility. The Nasdaq pared much of its early gain, and the
Dow fell as much as 160 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spokesman for the bank denied the rumors, stocks recovered.

<HEADLINE> Computer upgrades would cost up to $75 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State Comptroller Nancy Wyman and Gov. John G.
Rowland said Thursday they want to spend between $60 million and $75 million to
upgrade the state's computer system.
<P>
	   The three-year plan was announced seven months after Rowland nixed his $1.5
billion plan to privatize Connecticut's computers. Rowland said in late June he
was not convinced that better service could be guaranteed if the state turned
its operations over to Texas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyman and state workers had opposed the 7-year privatization plan, which
they said would not meet its efficiency targets and could cost state jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no secret that the governor and I had a little disagreement last
summer over how to handle this issue," Wyman said. "But even though we differed
on the solution, the governor and I always agreed on the scope of the problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new proposal, improvements will be targeted for the accounting,
payroll and personnel tracking systems. Wyman said the upgrade will allow the
state to track how tax dollars are spent and make it easier for companies to do
business with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The upgrade will effect every state agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be replacing the complicated maze we have now with a simple,
integrated system that will deliver services in a more effective and efficient
manner," Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland wants to use about $8 million of the state's $240 million surplus to
start the upgrades.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we have more surplus dollars throughout the year, we perhaps could use
more of that this year or next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the remaining costs - including buying software and hardware,
system setup and training - would be paid for through bonding, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   That spending plan likely will win approval in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   "The price tag is pretty impressively low," said Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin Sullivan. "It's a perfectly legitimate expenditure out of the
surplus."
</P>
<P>
	   While outside vendors will be needed to get the new system in place, Rowland
and Wyman said their plan is a far cry from privatization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe we could do most everything in-house with our state employees,"
Wyman said.

<HEADLINE> Jury selected for second Louima case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A jury that is racially mixed but dominated by women was
chosen on Thursday for the federal court trial of three police officers accused
of conspiring to obstruct justice in the Abner Louima police-torture case.
<P>
	   Testimony is to begin next Monday before U.S. District Judge Eugene
Nickerson, who has said the trial - the second in the racially charged case -
should last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury of six blacks, five whites and one Hispanic, was chosen from an
original pool of 500 citizens, winnowed down to 75. Six alternates were added
later.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, women dominated the panel eight to four, with the alternates split
evenly as to gender. The alternates were five whites and one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers declined to comment on the jury's makeup. "Twelve people,
tried and true, U.S. citizens. We're ready to go," said Ron Fischetti, the
attorney for ex-officer Charles Schwarz. "It looks like a jury that can be fair.
That's all both sides want."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's wife, Andra, said she would have preferred more male jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish it was a lot more even, between women and men," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She added that after a long wait, her husband is "very anxious to get going,
very anxious to have the statements heard that were not heard in the first
trial. There is a lot more to this case than was first thought."
</P>
<P>
	   The trial stems from the 1997 incident in which Louima, a Haitian immigrant,
was brutalized by officers at a Brooklyn precinct house after his arrest on a
minor charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendant Schwarz already faces a possible life sentence after conviction
last year for violating Louima's civil rights. The key witness is expected to be
former officer Justin Volpe, who is serving 30 years after pleading guilty on
the civil rights charge. He now claims Schwarz did not take part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Schwarz said the case was "never about race in the first place," but
was triggered by Volpe's anger.
</P>
<P>
	   "People can see clearly that it was an act of rage and not race," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson earlier questioned would-be jurors closely on their knowledge of
the highly publicized case, their experiences with racism and their views toward
the so-called "blue wall of silence" by which cops supposedly shield each other
from allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury will remain anonymous and escorted to and from the courthouse by
federal marshals, but not sequestered in a hotel, as is the case in some high
tension trials.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, all of whom are white, face five years in prison on the
conspiracy charge. Louima is black.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 35, Thomas Wiese, 37, and Thomas Bruder, 34, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's purported role in the
assault on Louima, who was beaten and sodomized with a broom handle by Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted last year of holding Louima down during the attack.
Volpe has said since that Wiese, not Schwarz, was in the bathroom in Brooklyn's
70th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart London and Joseph Tacopina, attorneys for Bruder and Wiese,
respectively, say their clients contend that Schwarz was never in the bathroom.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was under intense pressure for months from investors and Mattel's
board of directors to explain big losses at the company's newly acquired
Learning Company software division and other troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership rolls, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, slipped 6 1/4 cents Thursday to $11.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Word of the resignation came in the final moments of trading on the
Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60
percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. With a flashy style and an aggressive marketing
savvy, Barad helped make Mattel into the dominant toymaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others include
Andrea Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's day-to-day operations will be managed by a newly formed office
of the chief operating officer, comprised of executives who manage Mattel's
major brands. That team will report to Loeb.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Earnings Rise Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Higher prices and continued strong beer sales helped push
the profits of Anheuser-Busch Cos. up 13 percent in the fourth quarter, matching
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest brewery -- the maker of Budweiser, Bud Light and other
beers -- said Thursday that it earned $190.6 million, or 41 cents a share, in
the October-December period, compared with $168.6 million, or 35 cents a share,
a year earlier. That matched the expectation of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 4.2 percent to $2.72 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.61
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon trading, shares in Anheuser-Busch were priced at $67.75,
down $2.06 1/4 or nearly 3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anheuser-Busch had a great year in 1999, selling over 100 million barrels
of its beer brands worldwide -- the first time in history this has been
accomplished," company president and chairman August A. Busch III said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's share of the domestic beer market for 1999 was 47.4 percent,
an increase of 0.6 percentage point from 1998. Busch said that price increases
are being implemented in much of the United States on brands and packages
representing about 40 percent of volume.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Anheuser-Busch earned $1.4 billion, or $2.94 per share, up
from $1.23 billion, or $2.53 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $11.7 billion, up 4 percent from $11.25 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide, Anheuser-Busch's beer volume was essentially level for the fourth
quarter and up 1.2 percent for the year.

<HEADLINE> Couple in Spy Ring Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A couple in a spy ring were sentenced to more than three years
in prison for attempting to infiltrate U.S. military installations for the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask forgiveness from this country for all the opportunities it gave me
and for what I've done,'' said Amarylis Silverio Santos, 37, who was given a 3
1/2-year sentence Wednesday. Her husband, 38-year-old Joseph Santos, was
sentenced to four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the couple attempted to infiltrate the U.S. Southern
Command, which controls U.S. military activity in Latin America. Although State
Department officials have said their efforts were largely unsuccessful, the
couple filed at least one report.
</P>
<P>
	   They pleaded guilty in October 1998 to one count each of conspiracy to act
as an agent for a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney
general. They faced a maximum of five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 14 people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations. Authorities describe the spy ring as the largest Cuban espionage
operation uncovered in the United States in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Three others besides the couple have pleaded guilty; others are scheduled to
go on trial in May.

<HEADLINE> Chad's Former Dictator Indicted  </HEADLINE>
   By CHIKELUBA KENECHUKU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- A Senegalese court on Thursday indicted Chad's exiled
former dictator, Hissene Habre, on torture charges in what human rights
activists called a warning to African despots.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time that a former African head of state has been charged
with human rights violations by the court of another country, the New York-based
Human Rights Watch group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Backed by the United States and France as a buffer against Moammar Gadhafi's
Libya, Habre ruled the central African nation from 1982 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   A commission established by the government of Chad's current president,
Idriss Deby, has accused Habre's regime of 40,000 political murders and 200,000
cases of torture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's indictment is a wake-up call to dictators in Africa and elsewhere,
that if they commit similar atrocities they could also be brought to justice one
day,'' said Reed Brody of the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was inspired by charges of human rights abuses brought against
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet by a Spanish judge, Brody said. Pinochet
was arrested during a visit to Britain in October 1998 and has been fighting
extradition to Spain since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Senegal is a signatory to the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which obliges
states to either prosecute or extradite alleged torturers who enter their
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Habre has lived in Senegal since he fled Chad in 1990, after his ouster by
Deby.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Demba Kandji of the Dakar Regional Court opened a judicial
investigation last week into whether Habre was responsible for torture and
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
	   Kandji heard evidence from six witnesses, five of whom were tortured during
Habre's regime and one whose brother was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   While the investigation continues, the charges brought Thursday open the way
for Habre to be brought to trial. The court placed him under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Human Rights Watch led a group of rights organizations, including the
Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights, in a complaint
filed last week against Habre for alleged abuses during his rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups filed papers detailing 97 political killings, 142 cases of
torture and 100 ``disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
	   Seven Chadians and one Frenchwoman whose Chadian husband was killed under
Habre's regime are identified as plaintiffs, along with the Chadian Association
of Victims of Political Repression and Crime, which represents 792 alleged
victims.
</P>
<P>
	   They include Samuel Togoto, 53, who says his hands and legs were bound
behind his back for so long he became temporarily paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our pleas have been answered,'' Togoto said Thursday. ``This is one of the
happiest days of my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Habre, who appeared in court Thursday to hear the charges against him,
remains in his villa on the outskirts of Dakar, which is now guarded by
Senegalese police.
</P>
<P>
	   Habre, 57, is a French-trained military tactician from northern Chad. The
United States and France gave him millions of dollars in weapons and equipment.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Pushes Wireless Internet  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's communications chief said Thursday he wants
to spread wireless technology across the country quickly to revolutionize
Americans' daily life, from the Internet and movies to cars and kitchen
appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard said to achieve that goal, the FCC will auction more
slices of the airwaves for wireless technology and draft new standards for
digital TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The delivery of Internet access to wireless devices, such as cellular phones
or hand-held computers, opens new doors for American consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to further democratize the Internet. It's going to make it
available to people who can't afford a $5,000 PC in their home,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   To promote that goal, the commission has set a spring date to auction
valuable portions of the airwaves that many companies see as ``prime real
estate'' for delivering wireless Internet service to people on the road and in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The goal is to get as much competition out there as possible,'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with the AP, Kennard also predicted a change in the way
Americans watch TV. He cited the introduction of personal video recorders, which
allow people to record shows to a hard drive and assemble channels based on
their viewing preferences, as evidence of how the model of traditional TV
programming is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, television is sort of a passive exercise,'' Kennard said. ``That's
going to be seen as very much of an anachronism in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers will have greater ability to sort and arrange their shows,
dissolving the current structure of time slots and scheduled programming, the
FCC chief said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole economic model of the network is going to change pretty
dramatically,'' Kennard said, ``because it's not going to be a world in which
networks compete to get a certain audience level at a certain period of time.
It's going to be about delivering a certain quality of demographics
24-hours-a-day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The revolution will be pushed along as the industry makes its transition
from analog to digital television, Kennard added. Digital TV allows broadcasters
to squeeze more video and data into existing channel space. They could use it to
provide sharper pictures or offer additional TV channels for sports or movies,
or stock quotes and other data transmitted to home computers.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far, the road to digital TV has been rocky, because of wrangling over
standards to make the new digital systems compatible with cable. That's
important because most Americans get their TV via cable. Kennard has set an
April 1 deadline for the industry to arrive at a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Kennard told the AP he has drafted rules, which he is now
circulating to his fellow commissioners, that would force the industry's hand if
they aren't able to devise standards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans need digital TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing the unprecedented wave of mergers in the communications industry,
Kennard said his agency must be ``very, very vigilant'' about the repercussions
of such mammoth deals. The FCC is currently looking at combinations between
long-distance giants MCI and Sprint, cable companies AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, and
local phone powerhouses Bell Atlantic and GTE, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of pressure on our agency to just rubber stamp them all,''
Kennard said. ``We can't do that because these mergers are fundamentally
restructuring the telecommunications industry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard also said he has asked his staff to look into the history of a rule
that forbids companies from owning two or more networks in certain combinations.
If the FCC decides to relax that limit, it could ease the way for the proposed
merger between media titans CBS and Viacom -- which also owns a half-interest in
the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC chief also expressed hope that new ways for accessing multichannel
programming would help drive down cable rates, which the commission stopped
regulating in March.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, high-speed Internet connections will make it more viable for
people to watch movies and TV shows on their home computer, bypassing the
typical cable TV outlet, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to really accelerate a decrease in pricing that people pay for
video programming,'' Kennard predicted.

	   The breakthrough in the hostile takeover battle followed intense last-minute
negotiations between Gent and Esser in a meeting that stretched from Wednesday
night into Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offer would give Mannesmann investors close to an equal stake in the
combined company, settling a major stumbling block in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann had demanded no less than a 50 percent share in the new company,
but Gent as recently as Wednesday ruled such an option out, insisting that
Vodafone was much larger than Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies had been locked in a stalemate since Nov. 14, when
Mannesmann's supervisory board rejected Vodafone's unsolicited overture.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the Thursday's agreement was announced, Mannesmann shareholders were
facing a Monday deadline on whether to accept a Vodafone offer worth about $165
billion.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
time in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad, one of the highest ranking women in business, was under intense
pressure from investors and Mattel's board of directors to explain big losses at
the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and other
troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership rolls, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, slipped 6 1/4 cents Thursday to $11.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Word of the resignation came in the final moments of trading on the
Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60
percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. With a flashy style and an aggressive marketing
savvy, Barad helped make Mattel into the dominant toymaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others include
Andrea Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's day-to-day operations will be managed by a newly formed office
of the chief operating officer, comprised of executives who manage Mattel's
major brands. That team will report to Loeb.
</P>
<P>
	   Loeb, a lawyer, has been a member of Mattel's board since 1970. Rollnick,
who is retired as chairman and a director from Genstar Rental Electronics, has
been on the board since 1984.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Talent Scouts Settle Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The operators of a model and talent operation that did
business from Connecticut to Florida have been banned from selling their
``screen test services'' as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   They also will pay $972,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC said Screen Test U.S.A. misled consumers into believing they stood a
better chance of catching on with talent agencies by buying the firm's services.
The firm's founder, Fred Vanore, of Wayne, N.J., spearheaded the scam, the FTC
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanore has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Another defendant in the case was American Child Actor and Modeling
Association of Wayne, which the FTC said was a sham corporation created by
Vanore to add credibility to Screen Test U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
	   The association was promoted as a ``leading independent, nonprofit
organization formed to protect consumers from unethical business practices.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC has filed a string of charges against what it says are phony talent
scouts that use the promise of modeling deals to coerce people into paying for
expensive classes and photo shoots.
</P>
<P>
	   It accused Screen Test U.S.A., through offices in New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, New York and Florida, of using a screen test for children to con
parents into buying company products.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents who saw television, radio or Internet ads and called the company
were told to bring their children in for a $45 screen test. After the company
informed parents that their children had passed the screen test, scouts put
pressure on the families to buy packages of photographs ranging from $495 to
$795.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a federal court in New Jersey temporarily halted the company's
operations and froze its assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Other defendants in the case were Premier Marketing Inc. and Alice McManus,
based in Kenilworth, N.J.; R.J. Ims Corp., Richard J. Ims, Jr. and Angela Ims,
based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.; Premier Marketing Inc., Show Biz Central of
Westchester Inc. and John Yannielli, based in Cheshire, Conn.; Tomorrow's Stars
Inc., Edward J. Bauer and Helen J. Bauer, based in Boca Raton, Fla.; Jeffrey C.
McManus and JCM Marketing Inc., based in Miami; and Thomas J. Yannielli of New
York.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Greenspan for 4th Term  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hailed as the "greatest central banker in the history of
the world," Alan Greenspan overwhelmingly won confirmation Wednesday for a
fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 89-4 to approve President Clinton's nomination of the
Republican Greenspan, 73, for a four-year term that will run until June 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   His confirmation came one day after the Federal Reserve voted to boost a key
interest rate for a fourth time since June in an effort to slow down the U.S.
economy down and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was first nominated to the Fed job, often called the second most
powerful in the country because of the central bank's control over interest
rates, by Ronald Reagan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   He subsequently was nominated for three more four-year terms -- once by
George Bush in 1992 and twice by Clinton, first in 1992 and then again in
January.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision to nominate Greenspan again was widely expected. It was
unlikely a Democratic president could have gotten anyone else confirmed by the
Republican-controlled Senate so close to the end of the presidential term.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Senate vote, Clinton said in a statement that "Greenspan's wise
and steady leadership has inspired confidence here in American and around the
world. ... He has made a truly remarkable contribution in helping lead our
nation to the longest economic expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's Senate supporters also cited the current 107-month economic
expansion, which this week became the longest in U.S. history, as evidence
Greenspan's tenure has been successful.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe a strong case can be made that Alan Greenspan is the greatest
central banker in the history of the world," said Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, citing various economic statistics, from the low
unemployment rate to the soaring stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   The small group of liberal Democratic senators who opposed Greenspan's
nomination complained about the Fed rate increase, announced just as the Senate
debate began Wednesday. They said the rise was evidence Greenspan has been
overly worried about inflation at the expense of average Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan called the rate increases "a tax on every single American
citizen" while Sen. Tom Harkin said of the four quarter-point increases since
June: "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding
pretty badly."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Dorgan, D-N.D., and Harkin, D-Iowa, the other two senators
voting against Greenspan's nomination were Democrats Harry Reid of Nevada and
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Clinton said he hoped the Senate would "move quickly" to confirm
his other two pending nominations to the Fed.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, Clinton nominated Carol Parry, a former executive at Chase
Manhattan Bank, to fill a vacancy on the seven-member Fed board that has existed
since June 1998, when Susan Phillips resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also also nominated current Fed vice chairman, Roger Ferguson, to a
full 14-year term.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramm told reporters Wednesday he wanted to exercise special care in a
presidential election year in approving nominations for terms as long as the 14
years that a Fed board member serves.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Ferguson's current term as a board member expired at the end of
January, he can continue serving on the board until Clinton or another president
nominates a successor who is confirmed by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Placido Domingo: Bridging catastrophe and splendor with music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - On this night, Placido Domingo co-starred with a
3-year-old girl. And it was a love story.
<P>
	   The tenor and other Metropolitan Opera stars sang for Sophia Forshtay, a
smiling waif suffering from the monstrous "second skeleton" disease that freezes
the body by turning tissue into bone.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very important to find a solution quickly. We are here singing for
love," Domingo said at the Waldorf-Astoria benefit Wednesday for research on FOP
- fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia's mother, Constance Green, is a member of the Met chorus whose voice
has accompanied Domingo's for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   After the child was diagnosed at 14 months, "Placido asked me, 'What can I
do?"' said the soprano.
</P>
<P>
	   What he did Wednesday was to lead a star-studded cast in "Songs for Sophia"
- a medley of Broadway and opera tunes delivered by some of the world's most
beautiful voices, including Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Heidi Grant
Murphy and mezzo-soprano Federica von Stade.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia was stiffly romping around the golden Waldorf ballroom, a delicate
child in a pink silk gown getting cranky in a crowd, and impishly telling
Domingo as he hummed her a song, "No singing!"
</P>
<P>
	   The evening was an encounter of splendor and catastrophe, linked by those
fighting the incurable disease that affects one out of 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   With tickets starting at $500 and individual contributions reaching $25,000,
several hundred guests - including Ivana Trump - contributed about a quarter of
a million dollars for the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center's FOP
research team.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this disease, we know what the bomb looks like, but we don't know what
triggers the bomb. We have to disarm it," said Dr. Fred Kaplan, head of the
university's world-class Division of Metabolic Bone Diseases and Molecular
Orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
	   They are challenging a disease that turns the body's connective tissue to
bone. Kaplan's team is trying to create drugs that would inhibit the
bone-forming protein that produces the wild growths invading the body inch by
inch.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks could hold the key to a treatment, says the doctor, who is testing a
new drug made from cells in the sea creature.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that solving the mystery of FOP could lead to progress in treating
more common bone-linked conditions such as osteoporosis, arthritis and
degeneration of the heart valves.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, for Sophia and her mother, it's a daily struggle at home in Fort
Lee, N.J. "The lumps appeared on her head," says Green. "She woke up one morning
not able to move the right arm, and another morning she couldn't move the left
arm, then it was the head."
</P>
<P>
	   Sophia almost died last fall, when the tissue around her neck began
swelling, threatening to strangle her.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday night, her biggest fear was the massive chandeliers over
her tiny head that she eyed suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 90-minute show, as Domingo offered "Yours is my heart alone" from
the operetta "Land of Smiles," Green's eyes gleamed with tears in the light of
hundreds of candles illuminating the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Sophia's mother got up and sang "Grace for the Moment."
</P>
<P>
	   And later, she shared a different kind of hope: "This disease points up how
the spirit is separate from the body. You see an intact human being inside, and
you realize there is something more than just this body."

<HEADLINE> Virginia winery sues New York over Internet wine sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) - A Virginia vineyard is hoping to put a cork on
state laws that restrict Internet wine sales by challenging a New York law that
makes it illegal for out-of-state wineries to ship to consumers.
<P>
	   Swedenburg Estate Vineyards in Middleburg is the lead plaintiff in the
lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "These direct-shipment prohibitions are hurting small family-run wineries,
and may drive them out of business," said owner Juanita Swedenburg.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit is the fifth to be filed across the country as small wineries seek
to overturn state laws that have clamped down on the estimated $500 million
Internet wine sales industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Other states being sued include Virginia, Indiana, Texas and Florida,
according to the Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization that is
pushing the case on Swedenburg's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also seeks to overturn New York laws that limit Internet
advertising of wines, which the plaintiffs argue violate the First Amendment
right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty states have laws that prohibit the direct sale of wine from
out-of-state wineries to consumers, and direct sales are a felony in Florida,
Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, according to
the Institute for Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Many states require wineries to sell to wholesalers, who then sell to stores
after collecting any excise taxes and charging a commission. Internet sales cut
out the liquor wholesalers, a powerful lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   But Craig Wolf, counsel for the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America,
argued that Internet sales make it impossible for states to collect excise and
sales taxes and allow underage drinkers to order wine. He said Internet sales,
which he called "illegal bootlegging," continue anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   State laws do not violate interstate commerce protections because the
Constitution gives states more authority to regulate liquor than other products,
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Alcohol is different from jeans. It is different from books. It is a
constitutionally regulated product," Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal lawsuit was filed in November in Richmond by two Virginia wine
lovers and several out-of-state wineries, claiming that Virginia Alcoholic
Beverage Control laws violate the Constitution by restricting interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   The Virginia case is being supported by the Coalition for Free Trade and
Free the Grapes, two San Francisco-based groups of wineries and e-commerce
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is also being debated in Congress. Many states are pushing federal
legislation that would give them power to ask federal courts to block direct
wine shipments to consumers. States argue that wineries can violate their
shipment bans without fear of consequence.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is this illegal bootlegging going on regardless of the state laws,"
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Association for Interactive Media, which represents America Online and
other Internet companies, opposes the federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Direct sales by phone or Internet are estimated to account for $500 million
of the $17 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedenburg's lawsuit also names as plaintiffs three wine consumers in New
York and the Lucas Winery in Lodi, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedenburg, whose winery produces about 2,500 cases of pinot noir,
chardonnay and Riesling annually, said tourists often buy a few bottles and ask
if more can be shipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I say 'No, that's illegal,' they think I'm crazy," Swedenburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the New York attorney general's office did not immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann, Vodafone Set To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Mannesmann AG of Germany is poised to accept a sweetened
takeover bid of $180 billion from Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC, forming the
world's No. 1 wireless company in the biggest buyout ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann head Klaus Esser, speaking Thursday alongside Vodafone chief
executive Chris Gent in their first side-by-side appearance, said he would
recommend that the company's supervisory board accept the deal at a meeting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough in the hostile takeover battle followed intense last-minute
negotiations between Gent and Esser in a meeting that stretched from Wednesday
night into Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offer would give Mannesmann investors close to an equal stake in the
combined company, settling a major stumbling block in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new proposal, Mannesmann shareholders would get 58.96 Vodafone
shares for each of their Mannesmann shares, giving them a combined 49.5 percent
stake in the merged company.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone shareholders would hold a controlling stake with 50.5 percent of
the stock in the new company, which would be the biggest wireless communications
concern in the world with market-leading operations in Europe and the United
states.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company would have 42 million customers in 25 countries with an
especially strong presence in Europe, controlling the No. 1 or No. 2 position in
11 European countries with 29 million customers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   If accepted, the deal would easily eclipse both America Online's planned
$135 billion merger with Time Warner and MCI WorldCom's $115 billion deal with
Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann, which also owns a major engineering and automotive business,
operates the largest mobile calling business in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone business about a year ago
by acquiring AirTouch Communications, a major wireless operator in the western
and midwestern United States. Now, Vodafone is set to link up AirTouch with Bell
Atlantic's wireless unit in a joint venture that will create the biggest U.S.
wireless service.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company's large coverage area would make it easier for mobile phone
users to take their service with them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company also would likely play a dominant role in implementing
the next generation of wireless technology, which will allow high-speed Internet
access from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, European Union monopoly regulators said earlier Thursday they
would have to review any merger between the two firms.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been looking at it since we were first notified and we will
continue to look at it," said EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny. He said
the Commission is expected to issue a first-phase decision on the case on Feb.
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have each spent millions of dollars on media campaigns trying
to persuade Mannesman's shareholders. Each insisted it had a better strategy for
a rapidly changing telecom industry -- especially in Europe, where deregulation
has sparked a frenzied race to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
	   Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in Germany, and politicians and
labor leaders here have decried Vodafone's attempt even though Mannesmann
recently acquired Orange PLC, a Vodafone rival in Britain. If the merger goes
through, the new company would likely spin off Orange to avoid conflict with
anti-monopoly laws in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Vodafone took the upperhand in the battle by announcing a
European Internet and telephone venture with the French conglomerate Vivendi SA,
a company Mannesmann had been trying to partner with.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has said no jobs will be cut as a result of any merger. However,
according to earlier reports, Mannesmann's Esser would step down as part of the
deal.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Oil Prices Will Drop  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank said Thursday it expects oil prices that
have been edging close to $30 a barrel to decline to under $20 later this year,
which would be good news for motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to meet March
27 to decide whether to continue production cuts imposed last February that have
boosted crude oil prices from a low of $10.80 a barrel in December 1998. OPEC
has hinted the cuts might be extended, but the World Bank is predicting
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market needs more oil, and if it's not forthcoming, the prices will go
up," said Shane Streitfel, a bank energy economist. "We're anticipating that
(OPEC) will raise production at its March meeting."
</P>
<P>
	   A decline in the price of oil would also be good news for the Clinton
administration, which has expressed concern at the steep increase and has been
under pressure to ask OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to boost
production.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Bank's forecast on oil prices was contained in the latest issue of
Global Commodity Markets, which is published four times a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stocks will continue to decline throughout the winter, and in the absence
of higher production prices could soar," the report said. "At some point OPEC
will raise production and prices are expected to eventually settle back below
$20 a barrel."
</P>
<P>
	   If prices remain high, the report said, this "would dampen demand and
stimulate development of competing supplies, making it more difficult for OPEC
to raise production in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The report said demand is likely to pick up starting in April as refiners
replenish depleted stocks and prepare for the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thus the combination of high prices, low stocks and strong demand is
expected to bring forth higher OPEC production," the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge for OPEC, the report continued, "is to raise production in a
coordinated manner" so that prices stay just above the $20 a barrel level its
members say they want to maintain.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of a barrel of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed
Thursday at $28.23
</P>
<P>
	   Using projections from the International Energy Association, the bank said
world oil demand in the first three months of 2000 will exceed supply by around
2.5 million barrels a day, provided OPEC production remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if OPEC boosts production, demand for oil is expected to increase in
2000, surpassing last year's 1.2 million barrels a day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Spice Conglomerate Settles With FTC  </HEADLINE>
    By SHEILA HOTCHKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- McCormick &AMP; Co. said Thursday that the spice and food
conglomerate had settled a price discrimination complaint with the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC had accused the company of violating the Depression-era
Robinson-Patman Act, which requires manufacturers to offer all retailers the
same fees and discounts unless they are trying to match prices by the
competition. The agreement was signed by the company on Wednesday, but still
requires final approval by the FTC, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is not an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, the company agrees not to violate the price
discrimination section of the Robinson-Patman Act and to provide detailed
documentation of all the reasons for making an offer under the "meeting
competition" defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will not incur any fines or penalties under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   McCormick vice president Robert Skelton said he was uncertain about how long
it would take for the FTC to sign the deal, but did not anticipate any problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "From an investment standpoint, this certainly makes (McCormick) more
attractive to investors -- this was sort of a black cloud hanging over the
company," said Kurt Funderburg, an analyst with Baltimore-based investment
banking firm Ferris, Baker Watts Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency began investigating the Sparks-based company in 1996, following a
price war with Burns Philp Food Inc. that stretched through the early 1990s.
McCormick successfully fended off the Australian company during the early 1990s,
reportedly spending millions of dollars to secure its place in grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC questioned three contracts the company negotiated in 1994 and 1995,
during the height of the price war, Skelton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials have denied wrongdoing, arguing that the contracts are
covered by the section of the Robinson-Patman Act that allows them to meet their
competition's offers to specific retailers. But they said the investigation has
hurt the company and a settlement was in the company's best interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of McCormick rose $1.25 to $26 in afternoon trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Greenspan for 4th Term  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hailed as the "greatest central banker in the history of
the world," Alan Greenspan overwhelmingly won confirmation Thursday for a fourth
term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 89-4 to approve President Clinton's nomination of the
Republican Greenspan, 73, for a four-year term that will run until June 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   His confirmation came one day after the Federal Reserve voted to boost a key
interest rate for a fourth time since June in an effort to slow down the U.S.
economy down and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was first nominated to the Fed job, often called the second most
powerful in the country because of the central bank's control over interest
rates, by Ronald Reagan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   He subsequently was nominated for three more four-year terms -- once by
George Bush in 1992 and twice by Clinton, first in 1996 and then again in
January.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision to nominate Greenspan again was widely expected. It was
unlikely a Democratic president could have gotten anyone else confirmed by the
Republican-controlled Senate so close to the end of the presidential term.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Senate vote, Clinton said in a statement that "Greenspan's wise
and steady leadership has inspired confidence here in American and around the
world. ... He has made a truly remarkable contribution in helping lead our
nation to the longest economic expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's Senate supporters also cited the current 107-month economic
expansion, which this week became the longest in U.S. history, as evidence
Greenspan's tenure has been successful.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe a strong case can be made that Alan Greenspan is the greatest
central banker in the history of the world," said Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, citing various economic statistics, from the low
unemployment rate to the soaring stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   The small group of liberal Democratic senators who opposed Greenspan's
nomination complained about the Fed rate increase, announced just as the Senate
debate began Wednesday. They said the rise was evidence Greenspan has been
overly worried about inflation at the expense of average Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan called the rate increases "a tax on every single American
citizen" while Sen. Tom Harkin said of the four quarter-point increases since
June: "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding
pretty badly."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Dorgan, D-N.D., and Harkin, D-Iowa, the other two senators
voting against Greenspan's nomination were Democrats Harry Reid of Nevada and
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Clinton said he hoped the Senate would "move quickly" to confirm
his other two pending nominations to the Fed.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, Clinton nominated Carol Parry, a former executive at Chase
Manhattan Bank, to fill a vacancy on the seven-member Fed board that has existed
since June 1998, when Susan Phillips resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also also nominated current Fed vice chairman, Roger Ferguson, to a
full 14-year term.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramm told reporters Wednesday he wanted to exercise special care in a
presidential election year in approving nominations for terms as long as the 14
years that a Fed board member serves.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Ferguson's current term as a board member expired at the end of
January, he can continue serving on the board until Clinton or another president
nominates a successor who is confirmed by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann, Vodafone Set To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Mannesmann AG of Germany is poised to accept a sweetened
takeover bid of $180 billion from Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC, a deal that
would create the world's No. 1 wireless company through the biggest merger in
history.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann head Klaus Esser, speaking Thursday alongside Vodafone chief
executive Chris Gent in their first side-by-side appearance, said he would
recommend that the company's supervisory board accept the deal at a meeting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough in the hostile takeover battle followed intense last-minute
negotiations between Gent and Esser in a meeting that stretched from Wednesday
night into Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offer would give Mannesmann investors close to an equal stake in the
combined company, settling a major stumbling block in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann had demanded no less than a 50 percent share in the new company,
but Gent as recently as Wednesday ruled such an option out, insisting that
Vodafone was much larger than Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   "The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann, a great
company, would be better together with Vodafone Airtouch," Gent told reporters
in Duesseldorf. "I look forward to coming back to Duesseldorf in the middle of
next week to have further talks with (Esser) and members of his team."
</P>
<P>
	   The companies had been locked in a stalemate since Nov. 14, when
Mannesmann's supervisory board rejected Vodafone's unsolicited overture.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the new proposal was announced, Mannesmann shareholders were facing a
Monday deadline on whether to accept a Vodafone offer worth about $165 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new proposal, Mannesmann shareholders would get 58.96 Vodafone
shares for each of their Mannesmann shares, giving them a combined 49.5 percent
stake in the merged company.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone shareholders would hold a controlling stake with 50.5 percent of
the stock in the new company, which would be the biggest wireless communications
concern in the world with market-leading operations in Europe and the United
states.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company would have 42 million customers in 25 countries with an
especially strong presence in Europe, controlling the No. 1 or No. 2 position in
11 European countries with 29 million customers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   If accepted, the deal would easily eclipse both America Online's planned
$135 billion merger with Time Warner and MCI WorldCom's $115 billion deal with
Sprint Corp. as the biggest corporate marriage in history
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann, which also owns a major engineering and automotive business,
operates the largest mobile calling business in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone business about a year ago
by acquiring AirTouch Communications, a major wireless operator in the western
and midwestern United States. Now, Vodafone is set to link up AirTouch with Bell
Atlantic's wireless unit in a joint venture that will create the biggest U.S.
wireless service.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company's large coverage area would make it easier for mobile phone
users to take their service with them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company also would likely play a dominant role in implementing
the next generation of wireless technology, which will allow high-speed Internet
access from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, European Union monopoly regulators said earlier Thursday they
would have to review any merger between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been looking at it since we were first notified and we will
continue to look at it," said EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny, adding
that the Commission is expected to issue a first-phase decision on the case on
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have each spent millions of dollars on media campaigns trying
to persuade Mannesman's shareholders. Each insisted it had a better strategy for
a rapidly changing telecom industry -- especially in Europe, where deregulation
has sparked a frenzied race to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
	   Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in Germany, and politicians and
labor leaders here have decried Vodafone's attempt even though Mannesmann
recently acquired Orange PLC, a Vodafone rival in Britain. If the merger goes
through, the new company would likely spin off Orange to avoid conflict with
anti-monopoly laws in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Vodafone took the upperhand in the battle by announcing a
European Internet and telephone venture with the French conglomerate Vivendi SA,
a company Mannesmann had been trying to partner with.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has said no jobs will be cut as a result of any merger. However,
according to earlier reports, Mannesmann's Esser would step down as part of the
deal.

<HEADLINE> Money flows early in Senate race, Giuliani criticizes first lady's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attacked Hillary
Rodham Clinton's air travel on Thursday, saying newly released campaign finance
records show the first lady has not fully reimbursed taxpayers for her travel on
Air Force jets she uses while campaigning.
<P>
	   The Clinton camp paid the federal government $34,000 for dozens of trips to
New York in recent months related to her U.S. Senate campaign, the records show.
Giuliani's campaign said that is well below the actual costs of travel.
Estimates place the cost of Air Force C-20's, like the one Clinton uses to
travel to New York, at about $20,000 per trip.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like that deal," Giuliani said in Brooklyn. "If you can get that deal
for you and your family, take it, because Disneyland, here I come!"
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign is required by law to reimburse the government at the
rate of first-class commercial travel, spokesman Howard Wolfson has said. The
Secret Service advised the first lady to continue to use government jets for her
travel for security reasons, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the fact that he's running his campaign out of City Hall at taxpayer
expense it's hard to take his latest tantrum seriously," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The voluminous campaign reports, which run thousands of pages and together
measure more than a foot high, also showed that both candidates spent a huge
amount on direct-mail fund-raising efforts. Giuliani, whose mailers have taken
shots at the first lady by calling her "leader of the ultra-left wing," spent
about $1.3 million on six Virginia-based companies for direct-mail services. The
largest amount, more than $800,000, went to American Target Advertising, a
Manassas, Va.-based firm. It is operated by Richard Viguerie, who is renowned
for his fund raising on behalf of conservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spent more $500,000 on direct mailing of her own and close to $1
million on political and fund-raising consultants.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Clinton raised $8 million over six months and has $4.7 million
cash on hand. She spent $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani took in $8.8 million in the last six months, which combined with
the money he had already raised brought him to $11.5 million. He has $7.4
million cash on hand and he spent $4.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual donors to each candidate read like a who's who list. In a sign of
the clear national interest in the race, contributions poured in from all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew heavily from Hollywood types - Tom Cruise, Sean "Puffy" Combs,
Barbara Streisand and Tom Hanks were among her contributors. Giuliani's donor
list was a bit less star-studded but contained business heavyweights such as
General Electric Chairman Jack Welch and Revlon billionaire Ronald Perelman.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual donors may contribute up to $2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns benefitted from political action committees that can give up
to $10,000. Giuliani received $245,311 and Clinton $219,925.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani received lots of checks from the financial services industry which
call New York City home, including Arthur Anderson, Chase Manhattan, Keycorp and
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. He also took in a hefty amount of cash from the
pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Glaxo Wellcome all
contributed thousands of dollars. Log Cabin Republicans, a group supporting gays
in the GOP, gave Giuliani the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor, who had supported an unsuccessful attempt to have gambling on
Governor's Island, also drew large contributions from the gambling industry on a
fund-raising jaunt to Las Vegas. Mirage Resorts donated $9,870 and Harrah's
chipped in $2,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Through leadership committees, Republican lawmakers also padded Giuliani's
bank accounts. Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato gave the mayor $2,000.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott gave him $1,000 and Republican National
Senatorial Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell chipped in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of Clinton's PAC money came from a laundry list of unions. Giving
the maximum $10,000 were the Amalgamated Transit Union, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communication Workers of America. Also
contributing were the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees; the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Letter Carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Association of Trial Lawyers also gave Clinton the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democratic lawmakers donating to Clinton's campaign were
Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, who gave $1,000 and New York Reps. Gary
Ackerman and Carolyn Maloney, who each donated $1,000. Clinton has held fund
raisers for both New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Giuliani and Clinton campaigns got money from General Electric and
Ernst and Young. GE gave $4,225 to Giuliani and $2,500 to Clinton. Ernst and
Young gave $10,000 to each.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is set to formally enter the Senate race Sunday and kick off her
campaign with a tour around the state. It is unclear when Giuliani will
officially enter the race.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill
Barad resigned today after coming under fire for months for failing
to revive falling sales and profits at the world's biggest
toymaker. Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based
Mattel reported a steep loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing
Wall Street analysts for the third consecutive quarter. With her
resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. For the quarter
ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million, or 4
cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents
a share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 25 cents a
share. Shares of Mattel were at 11 15/16, up  1/8.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks bounded higher today as
investors decided that those companies are growing quickly enough
to dodge the threat of rising interest rates. Old-fashioned
blue-chip shares were little changed. The tech-dominated Nasdaq
composite index rose 137.06 to 4,211.02, its third biggest point
gain in history. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24 to
11,013.44. Broader indicators were also modestly higher. A day
after the Federal Reserve imposed its fourth interest-rate increase
since June 1999, investors poured money into shares of technology
companies to the exclusion of all other sectors. Analysts said
investors are shaking off suggestions that the often slim profits
of growing technology companies may be squeezed by rising interest
rates.

	   Greenspan Wins 4th Term at Fed
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan for another four-year term today by a vote of 89-4.
The approval came a day after the Fed raised a key interest rate a
quarter of a percentage point to stave off harmful inflation as the
economy continues record growth. Greenspan, 73, got bipartisan
support. But a small group of liberal senators opposed the
nomination on grounds the Fed is too secretive and Greenspan has
been overly worried about inflation and insensitive to the impact
higher interest rates have on American families.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to American factories had their
biggest increase in seven years in December, up 3.3 percent, the
Commerce Department said today. The rise helped make all of 1999
the strongest year manufacturers have seen since 1995. Greater
demand for airplanes and electronic helped the rise. Meanwhile,
retailers said better than expected December sales rounded out what
has been the strongest fiscal year for the nation's retailers since
the early 1990s. Wall Street analysts raised their fourth-quarter
earnings estimates for many retailers, including Neiman Marcus and
May Department Stores.

was $260.6 million, or 41 cents a share, in the final three months

after European interest rates were raised one-quarter percentage
point today, but the central bank's president said the weak
currency was just one contributing factor in the inflation-fighting
move. The euro was trading just below 99 U.S. cents this afternoon
in the United States, up from its late New York rate yesterday of
97.57 cents and the record low of 96.68 cents reached Tuesday. The
strong bounce came in part because many analysts did not expect the
European Central Bank to act so quickly to raise rates.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
time in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad, 48, one of the highest ranking women in business, was under intense
pressure from investors and Mattel's board of directors to explain big losses at
the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and other
troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership rolls, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, gained 12 1/2 cents more as of 5:15 p.m. EST Thursday to
$11.93 3/4 for the New York Stock Exchange-listed company. Word of the
resignation came in the final moments of trading on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60
percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. With a flashy style and an aggressive marketing
savvy, Barad helped make Mattel into the dominant toymaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others are Andrea
Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Learning Company lost $183 million in the quarter and $206
million for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel said that it is reviewing the Mattel Interactive division, which
includes the Learning Company, and upon completion of that review, the company
will undertake a restructuring program and will take a restructuring charge of
between $75 million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's day-to-day operations will be managed by a newly formed office
of the chief operating officer, comprised of executives who manage Mattel's
major brands. That team will report to Loeb.
</P>
<P>
	   Loeb, a lawyer, has been a member of Mattel's board since 1970. Rollnick,
who is retired as chairman and a director from Genstar Rental Electronics, has
been on the board since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Mattel lost $86.35 million, or 21 cents a share, compared
with earnings of $198 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period a year
ago. Sales for the year were $5.5 billion, down from $5.62 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> State GOP leaders surrender on anti-McCain effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, George W. Bush's top New York
backer, waved the white flag of surrender Thursday in the battle to keep John
McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   "I believe that John McCain should be on the ballot," Pataki said in a
statement. "This should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not
technicalities. I'm confident that George Bush will win that campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said Bush agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
	   With growing signs that New York's GOP hierarchy was ready to buckle, McCain
had sent letters to Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers earlier
Thursday calling for them to "do the right thing for New York Republicans."
</P>
<P>
	   "The system that is responsible for this sad situation cannot be defended
any longer," McCain wrote. "It is an embarrassment to a wonderful state, a
disappointment to a proud party and an affront to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, appearing in Dover, Del., had said "put him on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The shift came after Bush, stung by McCain's big New Hampshire primary win
Tuesday and unhappy about handing McCain an issue tailor-made for his "outsider"
campaign, signaled his New York supporters their fight to keep McCain off
primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's congressional district had
gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, top New York Republicans were told that Bush would prefer his
supporters not appeal if McCain won a federal court challenge to open up the New
York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case said Thursday that no ruling would be issued before
Monday, at the earliest. Lawyers on both sides said they expect it to be a
victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that if the judge happened to rule
against McCain, Pataki was then ready to "take the appropriate steps to ensure
that (McCain) is on the ballot." Mucha said she could not elaborate on what
those steps would be.
</P>
<P>
	   In Delaware, Bush said he didn't think his campaign would be hurt by a court
ruling in favor of McCain. "I'd be happy for him to be on the ballot if the
judge so decides," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was talk Thursday that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case and the delay until
Monday for a possible court ruling seemed in line with that.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign manager, Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, said he knew nothing about that.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Powers, but one of his lawyers, Lawrence
Mandelker, said, "there obviously is enormous political pressure for a
settlement. I'm not involved in those discussions. They are several pay grades
above me, as we used to say in the military."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized the Texas governor for not calling off the
effort to block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary
because he lacked enough petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush runningmate, has also come
under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they're smart, they just throw open the door and let McCain come
crashing through now," Nelson Warfield, a veteran political operative who worked
on Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's Governor Pataki trying to build a national image and now he runs the
risk of being seen as that governor who's pro-choice on abortion and anti-choice
for president," Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in the wake of McCain's New Hampshire victory, New York Republicans who
backed Bush are getting nervous, Republican operative Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of people in the last 24 hours not sleeping well on the
Republican side in New York," Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
district. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you sow, so shall you reap," McCain supporter Molinari, a former
congressman, crowed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> State: Fatal Ocean City roller coaster crash caused by faulty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A faulty replacement brake installed on an Ocean
City roller coaster caused a crash in which a New York woman and her 8-year-old
daughter were killed last year, state investigators said Thursday.
<P>
	   Officials with the state Department of Community Affairs also cited problems
with a safety restraining bar that allowed the victims to be hurled from the car
as it sped backward down an inclined track after coming loose from a chain that
was pulling it toward the summit.
</P>
<P>
	   William Connolly, director of the Division of Codes and Standards, said the
state has fined the Italian manufacturer of the Wild Wonder roller coaster
$30,000 and the owners of Gillian's Wonderland Pier $25,000 for safety
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   He also proposed legislation giving the state authority over amusement ride
manufacturers, and a 10-fold increase in fines for safety violations.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-month investigation into the Aug. 28 accident centered on the brake,
called an anti-rollback device, that's designed to prevent the roller coaster
cars from moving backwards on the ride's track.
</P>
<P>
	   The car on the ride, which had just opened to the public on July 1, came
loose from the chain that was dragging it up a steep incline, where it was to be
released at the top and glide down the other side, powered by gravity.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-rollback device was designed for just such a situation, meant to
keep the car from rolling backward by applying brakes with sharp steel teeth
that bite into the rails and prevent slippage.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the night of the accident, the teeth on the device were badly worn.
They were made of steel that was much weaker than the hardened metal that was
supposed to be used, Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
	   The park's owners had replaced the original part on Aug. 17 with a new one
made by a metal shop in neighboring Somers Point, but did not get permission
from the state to make the switch, Connolly said. He also said the device was
improperly installed, riding slightly off-center along the rails, which
contributed to its inability to grip the rail and stop the car from sliding
backward.
</P>
<P>
	   When the device failed, the car in which Kimberly Bailey of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter, Jessica were riding hurled backward down the track and around
a sharp curve.
</P>
<P>
	   The extreme centrifugal force of the curve, the speed of the descent (about
30 mph) and an improperly adjusted restraint bar that flew open caused the pair
to be thrown from the car. They died shortly afterward from internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The restraint bar's locking mechanism was improperly adjusted and had a weak
part, Connolly said. But that flaw was not visible to state inspectors who
examined the roller coaster on July 21.
</P>
<P>
	   The park's general manager, Jay Gillian, did not return a telephone message
left at his office Thursday afternoon. A woman who answered the telephone at his
home said Gillian was not present, and refused to take a message for him.
</P>
<P>
	   The coaster was built by an Italian company, Zamperla, specially for
Gillian's. Connolly said anti-rollback devices on other roller coasters in New
Jersey use more secure technology that should not be subject to the same
failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ocean City park wanted the manufacturer to design a device that was
quieter than the brakes and chains on most roller coasters that produce a
"clack-clack-clack" sound as the cars are pulled up the incline, Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This device was unique to the Wild Wonder," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zamperla was fined $30,000 for, among other things, failing to provide
maintenance schedules and other information to the amusement park owners. The
park owners were fined $25,000 for making the unauthorized repairs and
modifications to the ride and for the incorrect lap bar adjustment.
</P>
<P>
	   The fines are civil penalties. Connolly said the Department of Community
Affairs has forwarded the results of its investigation to the Cape May County
Prosecutor's Office. But Acting Prosecutor David Blaker said there is no
criminal probe into the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to be a tragic accident that may or may not have been caused by
negligence," he said. "Certainly it does not rise to the level of recklessness
required for a criminal prosecution."
</P>
<P>
	   Connolly said New Jersey's 1,700 amusement rides are generally safe, and
noted that accidents resulting in serious injuries have been steadily declining
in recent years. Of an estimated 100 million rides taken last year, 12 resulted
in serious injuries, down from 15 in 1998 and 24 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're safer on the ride than you are driving to the amusement park," he
said. "You're safer on the ride than you are on the stairs of your own home."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Connolly called for legislation giving the state authority over
ride manufacturers. New Jersey currently has authority only over ride operators.
Oversight of manufacturers would enable the state to review design and safety
specifications of equipment and parts before they are installed at parks.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for a 10-fold increase in fines for violating ride safety
regulations, to $50,000 per incident. The current $5,000 fine was increased from
$500 just two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To Protect Financial Data  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Thursday proposed new rules
spelling out how consumers' personal data will be protected as barriers between
banks, investment firms and insurance companies come down.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules, proposed by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury Department
division, will make it tougher for financial companies to share even seemingly
innocuous information, such as customers' names, addresses and telephone
numbers, with outside marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators take the view that such basic information is ``non-public''
information when it is taken from sources such as customer lists -- even if the
names and addresses also are available from a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
	   As ``non-public'' information, the names and addresses -- as well as more
personal financial data such as account balances -- cannot be shared with
outside telemarketers if customers expressly ask their banks, brokerages or
insurance companies not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the onus is on consumers. They must ask, in a letter or standard
form, financial companies with whom they do business not to share or sell their
data.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, under the new law, banks, brokerages and insurers that join
together under the same corporate roof are entitled to share customers' personal
financial data with each other. In that case, customers do not have the right to
block such sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and privacy advocates have said the new law's privacy
protections fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not good enough for consumers, who won't get real privacy
protection,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director U.S. Public
Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said
the group will ``look more closely at these regulations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some bankers privately objected to the new rules, saying they took an overly
broad interpretation of privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who won Senate confirmation Thursday for a
fourth term, expressed approval of the new privacy rules at an open meeting at
which he and the other central bank governors voted to propose them for 60 days
of public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, so good,'' Greenspan told the Fed staff attorneys, who had drafted
the rules and negotiated with other federal agencies to make the regulations
consistent for different financial industries and sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   While most people think of the Federal Reserve as regulating the nation's
money supply and controlling interest rates, the central bank also oversees some
categories of banks, including those organized in a holding company structure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed is among a group of agencies that have been drafting privacy rules
for the industries and sectors they regulate, because of legislation enacted in
November that allowed banks, investment firms and insurance companies to get
involved in each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The other agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission; the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Department division that
regulates national banks; the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National
Credit Union Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for insurance companies
and agents and a panoply of other businesses outside of banks and securities
firms -- including travel agencies, mortgage companies, tax preparation
services, check-cashing outlets, credit bureaus and department stores that issue
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The agencies have been working under a tight deadline. Under the new law,
final regulations must take effect by November.
</P>
<P>
	   The Comptroller's office also published its rules Thursday, and the other
agencies are expected to follow in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important advance in privacy protections for consumers,''
Julie Williams, the agency's chief counsel, said in a telephone interview.
``This is a winning situation for consumers and potentially a new competitive
(feature) for banks'' that offer strong privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules, financial companies will have to disclose their privacy
policies to customers at least once a year.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive Co., the nation's top seller of
toothpaste and a leader in the dishwashing soap market, said Thursday its
profits rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter, beating Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based company said net income was $260.6 million, or 41 cents a
share, in the final three months of 1999. That compared 1998's fourth quarter
profit of $234.2 million, or 36 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results beat most projections by Wall Street analysts by a penny,
according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in the final quarter of 1999 totaled $2.34 billion, up 2.3 percent
from $2.29 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Colgate's stock fell $1.31 1/4 to $60 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New

from $848.6 million, or $1.30 a share, in 1998. Sales were $9.12 billion for
1999, up 1.7 percent from $8.97 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Keep Control Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the Navy detained a Russian oil tanker in the
Persian Gulf, the Clinton administration disclosed Thursday that it has been in
contact with Russian officials for almost a month about the smuggling of Iraqi
oil in violation of the U.N. economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker called attention to what the administration
described as a recent mushrooming of illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports
average 100,000 barrels a day, compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil
prices were much lower, said State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
	   These exports are separate from the carefully controlled, U.N.-approved
Iraqi oil sales that pay for food, medicine and other humanitarian items for the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates by the
guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said cooperation from the
ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force (MIF)
that enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the MIF has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the MIF's suspicions
regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians told U.S. officials that the ship is privately owned and that a
Russian investigation is under way, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say whether the issue arose this week in Moscow when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with acting Russian President
Alexander Putin and other officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley stopped short of criticizing Russia, noting than an investigation was
going on. He added that the national flag flown by a merchant ship does not
necessarily mean the country's government is behind the transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to dock the ship and dispose of the contraband oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The normal procedure would be for the contraband to be sold, with the
profits used partly to offset the costs of the nation that agrees to take the
vessel and partly to pay for the MIF operation, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message we'd like to send out to the international community and
would-be smugglers is that we're watching,'' he said. ``Every vessel that's in
the Arabian Gulf is monitored by the MIF force --every one.

<HEADLINE> Ad Growth Boosts New York Times  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Strong advertising growth and lower newsprint costs drove
fourth-quarter profits sharply higher at The New York Times Co., the company
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding one-time gains and losses, earnings rose 24 percent to $108.4
million compared, or 61 cents per share, to $87.3 million, or 47 cents per
share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The results easily beat analyst expectations of 57 cents per share, as
reported by First Call/Thomson Financial, sending the company's shares up $1.75
to $47.62 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The quarterly profits did not include charges of $5.3 million in 1999 and
$5.4 million in 1998 for work force reductions. Including the charges, net
income rose 25 percent to $105.3 million from $84.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 13 percent to $882.5 million from $782.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Ad growth in the company's newspaper division, which also includes The
Boston Globe and several regional newspapers, jumped 19 percent during the
quarter, the highest quarterly growth rate in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said in a release that its two main newspapers had strong ad
growth from technology businesses, Internet companies and ads for the online
businesses of established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues from its own Internet operations in the newspaper division more
than doubled to $12.5 million from $5.1 million. In addition to a news site for
its main newspaper, nytimes.com, the company also operates nytoday.com, a city
guide for New York, and Boston.com, an offshoot from The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to take advantage of the high valuations that investors bestow on
Internet stocks, the New York Times announced plans last week to issue separate
shares to track its online operations. The company hopes to raise at least $100
million with the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, income before special items rose 13 percent to $319.1
million from $282.6 million. Overall, net income rose 11 percent to $310.2
million from $278.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for all of 1999 rose 9 percent to $2.25 billion from $2.07 billion.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Pushes Wireless Internet  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's communications chief said Thursday he wants
to spread wireless technology across the country quickly to revolutionize
Americans' daily life, from the Internet and movies to cars and kitchen
appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard said to achieve that goal, the FCC will auction more
slices of the airwaves for wireless technology and draft new standards for
digital TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The delivery of Internet access to wireless devices, such as cellular phones
or hand-held computers, opens new doors for American consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to further democratize the Internet. It's going to make it
available to people who can't afford a $5,000 PC in their home,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   To promote that goal, the commission has set a spring date to auction
valuable portions of the airwaves that many companies see as ``prime real
estate'' for delivering wireless Internet service to people on the road and in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The goal is to get as much competition out there as possible,'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard also predicted a change in the way Americans watch TV. He cited the
introduction of personal video recorders, which allow people to record shows to
a hard drive and assemble channels based on their viewing preferences, as
evidence of how the model of traditional TV programming is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, television is sort of a passive exercise,'' Kennard said. ``That's
going to be seen as very much of an anachronism in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers will have greater ability to sort and arrange their shows,
dissolving the current structure of time slots and scheduled programming, the
FCC chief said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole economic model of the network is going to change pretty
dramatically,'' Kennard said, ``because it's not going to be a world in which
networks compete to get a certain audience level at a certain period of time.
It's going to be about delivering a certain quality of demographics
24-hours-a-day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The revolution will be pushed along as the industry makes its transition
from analog to digital television, Kennard added. Digital TV allows broadcasters
to squeeze more video and data into existing channel space. They could use it to
provide sharper pictures or offer additional TV channels for sports or movies,
or stock quotes and other data transmitted to home computers.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far, the road to digital TV has been rocky, because of wrangling over
standards to make the new digital systems compatible with cable. That's
important because most Americans get their TV via cable. Kennard has set an
April 1 deadline for the industry to arrive at a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Kennard told the AP he has drafted rules, which he is now
circulating to his fellow commissioners, that would force the industry's hand if
they aren't able to devise standards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans need digital TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing the unprecedented wave of mergers in the communications industry,
Kennard said his agency must be ``very, very vigilant'' about the repercussions
of such mammoth deals. The FCC is currently looking at combinations between
long-distance giants MCI and Sprint, cable companies AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, and
local phone powerhouses Bell Atlantic and GTE, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of pressure on our agency to just rubber stamp them all,''
Kennard said. ``We can't do that because these mergers are fundamentally
restructuring the telecommunications industry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard also said he has asked his staff to look into the history of a rule
that forbids companies from owning two or more networks in certain combinations.
If the FCC decides to relax that limit, it could ease the way for the proposed
merger between media titans CBS and Viacom -- which also owns a half-interest in
the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC chief also expressed hope that new ways for accessing multichannel
programming would help drive down cable rates, which the commission stopped
regulating in March.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, high-speed Internet connections will make it more viable for
people to watch movies and TV shows on their home computer, bypassing the
typical cable TV outlet, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to really accelerate a decrease in pricing that people pay for
video programming,'' Kennard predicted.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices tumbled Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade as timely rains continued to pelt southern Brazil
during a key period for crop moisture. Grains also fell.
</P>

	   Soybeans retreated to their lowest level since mid-January as
forecasts called for more rain into next week in leading growing
regions of South America.

and from wet weather forecasts for much of the U.S. winter wheat

<HEADLINE> Britain May Suspend Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Embarking on a risky strategy to save the
peace process, Britain warned Thursday that it will strip power from Northern
Ireland's new Protestant-Catholic administration unless the IRA quickly pledges
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson announced he would introduce a
bill Friday that within days would allow London to reclaim the substantial
authority it handed nine weeks ago to the province's four-party Cabinet. But the
process could be stopped if the situation changes, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis threatens the new administration that has given Northern Ireland
a measure of local rule after years of direct rule by Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the coalition powerless would increase the chances it could
survive. Protestants have otherwise threatened to resign their posts over the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson appealed for the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, to
be patient as the British and Irish governments spend the next week trying to
persuade the IRA to announce publicly that it will scrap its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord made disarmament and the
Cabinet's survival ``interdependent,'' he declared: ``We cannot partially
implement the Good Friday agreement. It is all or it is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson emphasized he would be extremely reluctant to suspend the
administration's powers, which would also mean suspending policy-coordinating
committees between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, another important
plank of the agreement. But he said that might be the only way ``to preserve
them from collapse.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Mandelson spoke, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern flew to Cornwall,
southwest England, to tell British Prime Minister Tony Blair about his daylong
discussions in Dublin with officials of the IRA and its allied Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, as part of an American-brokered deal, the Ulster Unionists
dropped their demand for IRA disarmament before the Cabinet's formation and
accepted Sinn Fein into two of the 12 posts -- but in expectation that the IRA
would finally start disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   To win over skeptical colleagues, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble even
promised he would resign this month as the Cabinet's senior minister if the IRA
wasn't delivering on its end of the bargain. He backed that promise up by
drafting a resignation letter and scheduling an internal party meeting for Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA did agree to meet Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, chairman of the
province's disarmament commission. But the general's report has confirmed that
no disarmament had taken place.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson indicated the IRA hadn't even said when, if ever, it would start,
although the accord expected total disarmament by May. This was ``simply
unacceptable, and a betrayal of the entire community in Northern Ireland,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA has defied years of pressure for a start to disarmament. The
outlawed group spent decades acquiring its tons of weaponry and has stored its
most sophisticated equipment in bunkers in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   In the IRA's most recent statement Tuesday, it insisted that its 1997
cease-fire ought to be sufficient proof of its peaceful intent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, speaking before Mandelson's announcement, said
that if the powers are taken away ``it will be difficult to put things back
together again, and (weapons) decommissioning -- which the unionists make such a
great fuss about -- is unlikely ever to be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to those sentiments, Mandelson said: ``Nobody wants to do
anything that will make decommissioning any harder to achieve. But there comes a
moment when we have to express our impatience, and indeed our intolerance, that
decommissioning is failing to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio Congressman Expects Indictment  </HEADLINE>
   By M.R. KROPKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Campaign appearances usually include the candidate
extolling his virtues and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
	   For U.S. Rep. James Traficant Jr., recent stops on the trail to re-election
include pronouncements about possible indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrat said last weekend he is sure the Justice Department wants to
link him to organized crime and an indictment appears inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But as much as they want to, they have been unable to link me in any way
to organized crime or any criminal acts,'' he said in a statement. ``The reason
why they have not been able to tie me to any illegal activity is very simple: I
have done nothing wrong. End of story.''
</P>
<P>
	   The congressman refuses to be put on the defensive by a federal corruption
probe that may be targeting him, even though he faces a strong challenge in the
March 7 primary in his district in northeast Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Traficant told a Democratic club in Niles, a Youngstown suburb, that the
FBI, the Treasury and the Justice departments had put themselves on the spot by
investigating him just before an election, and ``they'll have to come up with
something.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Morford, who has headed the probe of
mob-linked corruption in the Youngstown area, said Thursday he could not confirm
or deny a Traficant investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The organized crime probe has resulted in more than 50 convictions. Among
the defendants was Charles O'Nesti, of Youngstown, former district director for
Traficant who in 1998 pleaded guilty to perjury and racketeering conspiracy
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But O'Nesti's conviction hasn't slowed Traficant, who has fought federal
charges before.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1983, a federal jury acquitted Traficant of charges that he took $163,000
in mob money as Mahoning County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
	   He served as his own attorney -- even though he is not a lawyer -- and
argued he took only money he intended to use as evidence in making criminal
cases against mobsters. Traficant rode a wave of popularity from his
self-defense to election to Congress in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Political observers in his home district say he remains a legendary figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a cat with nine lives,'' said William Binning, a former Mahoning
County Republican chairman who is now a political science professor at
Youngstown State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other well-known public figures in Youngstown are challenging Traficant
in the primary: state Sen. Robert F. Hagan and Mahoning County Auditor George
Tablack.
</P>
<P>
	   They have tried to portray Traficant as an outdated politician who has
failed to bring this blue-collar region back from rash of steel plant closings
in the late 1970s.

	   The news came as the state released the findings of its investigation into
the hospital's conduct surrounding a Sept. 7, 1999 incident in which Dr. Allan
Zarkin carved the letters "A" and "Z" into 31-year-old Liana Gedz, whose baby he
had just delivered by Caesarian section.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state Health Department has now obtained the permanent surrender of Dr.
Allan Zarkin's license to practice the art of medicine. Dr. Zarkin signed the
surrender order yesterday and the chairman of the board for professional medical
conduct signed it today," Novello told reporters. "It is my hope that Dr. Zarkin
will not practice medicine in the state of New York ever again."
</P>
<P>
	   "The failure of Beth Israel was not reporting the incident as required," she
said. "We found that there were clear signs (before the incident) that Dr.
Zarkin's behavior was totally inappropriate ... There were many moments in the
system when this could have been halted."
</P>
<P>
	   A year before the incident, nurses and physicians at the hospital reported
incidents in which Zarkin, 61, "screamed" at staff members and the fathers of
newborns and pulled the arms of newborn babies, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no quality assurance documentation or follow up, and Beth Israel
hospital failed to take appropriate action with respect to Dr. Zarkin's
practice," Novello said, noting that $2,000 per violation of public health law
and the state hospital code is the highest monetary penalty allowable under
state law.
</P>
<P>
	   Beth Israel is required to come up with a "plan of correction" describing
how each of the identified deficiencies will be addressed and what corrective
action will be taken. For one year, the hospital must submit quarterly reports
to the health department detailing the corrective measures and their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the hospital is required to hire an independent consultant
group acceptable to the health department to analyze the management and
oversight of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department and provide a
detailed report of problems and suggested solutions within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
	   A consultant also must complete a hospital-wide study of quality assurance
and credentialing within 120 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Once these findings have been reported and approved by the department of
health, they must be implemented within 30 days, Novello said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement later Thursday, the medical center said it "again expresses
its deep regret over the egregious incident involving a former staff member, Dr.
Allan Zarkin. We will continue to work cooperatively, as we have from the
outset, with the patient, her family and her representatives."
</P>
<P>
	   With regard to the health department's report, it said, "We will implement
promptly all of its recommendations."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin's lawyer, Kenneth Platzer, declined to comment on the health
department's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, his private practice New York Gyn/Ob Associates, and the hospital
are being sued by Liana Gedz for $5 million. In addition, Gedz's husband is
suing Zarkin for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Platzer has said Zarkin suffers from a frontal-lobe disorder called Pick's
disease, a progressive form of Alzheimer's-like dementia characterized by
personality changes and inappropriate behavior.

<HEADLINE> Euro Rebounds on Interest Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The beleaguered euro rebounded sharply after
European interest rates were raised one-quarter percentage point Thursday, but
the central bank's president said the weak currency was just one contributing
factor in the inflation-fighting move.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro climbed to 98.95 cents in late trading Thursday in New York from
97.57 cents Wednesday and the record low of 96.68 cents reached during European
trading on Tuesday. The strong bounce came in part because many analysts did not
expect the European Central Bank to act so quickly to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with its surge, the euro remained nearly 17 percent below the high it
reached on its debut Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro's slide was one of the factors stoking inflation fears because it
made imported goods more expensive to the 11 European nations that share the
euro as a common currency.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said there
were several factors behind the decision to raise rates and attempt to cool
inflationary pressures. A recovering economy, higher oil prices and an increase
in the amount of money in circulation, all added to pressures that push up
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Inflation rates are now approaching higher levels than expected earlier,"
Duisenberg warned. "In order to maintain price stability, monetary policy needs
to act in a forward-looking manner."
</P>
<P>
	   In response, the bank -- which adjusts interest rates in an attempt to keep
the region's economy growing while holding inflation below 2 percent -- raised
its main refinancing rate to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time in the short history of the bank that it raised
the interest it charges commercial banks for buying back short-term securities
when they need cash. The first increase was in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising interest rates can cool off an overheated economy by making it more
expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money. But it also has the
added effect of buoying the local currency because it increases returns on
investments in euro-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB's rate hike followed a similar move Wednesday by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board. Some economists said the year-old ECB -- which is struggling to
establish itself as an independent financial entity on par with the Fed --
wouldn't act so soon to avoid the impression it is mimicking its American
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB was not alone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Canada, saying it was worried about the risk of inflation
spreading from the United States, raised short-term rates one-quarter point.
Denmark's central bank raised one short-term rate 0.30 point and another by
one-quarter point. The Swiss National Bank adopted a half-point increase in a
key rate.
</P>
<P>
	   While economists and bankers were expecting the European Central Bank to
raise rates, many thought the ECB would hold off until late February or March,
saying Duisenberg hadn't done enough to prepare investors.
</P>
<P>
	   But Germany's stock market, the biggest in the euro region, rallied. The DAX
index of the country's 30 biggest companies rose 2.5 percent Thursday, supported
mostly be strong gains in Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg insisted he had signaled a rate increase in comment's Monday at a
meeting of European finance ministers in Belgium, when, for the first time, he
said that the euro's weakness was troubling because it threatened to increase
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This time, no one can say we didn't give indications or warnings that
something was going to happen," he said. "We were afraid to wait because in the
future, we could have been forced to do more than we're currently doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the rate hike of only a quarter point is a departure from
the ECB's previous two adjustments -- once when it cut rates by half a point,
and again when rates rose last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ECB seems to be now resorting to a fine-tuning the economy, trying to
get better control with smaller rate moves," said Peter Dixon, an economist with
Commmerzbank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixon also expects the higher interest rate to have little long-term affect
on the value of the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weakness of the euro is a function of the strength of the U.S. economy,
not a function of how weak the European economy is," Dixon said. "The
fundamental growth of the European economy is actually quite good, and this rate
hike has been expected so long, it could have no impact on the currency."
</P>
<P>
	   In the countries using the euro, the economy is expected to grow around 3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg remained optimistic about the euro's ability to rebound, saying
it was closely tied with Europe's fragile recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course we are being influenced by the startling and continued high rate
of growth in the United States that underscores the strength of the dollar
compared with the euro," he said. "But we are rapidly coming in step with the
U.S. economy and that should affect exchange rates as well. A strong economy
goes along with a strong currency."

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 137.02; Dow Up 10.24  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks bounded higher Thursday as investors
decided that those companies are growing quickly enough to dodge the threat of
rising interest rates. Old-fashioned blue-chip shares were little changed.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 137.02, or 3.3 percent,
to 4,210.98, its third biggest point gain in history. In percentage terms, the
gain didn't crack the top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24 to 11,013.44, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 15.85 to 1,424.97.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after the Federal Reserve imposed its fourth interest-rate increase
since June 1999, investors poured money into shares of technology companies to
the exclusion of all other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors were shaking off suggestions that the sometimes slim
profits of growing technology companies may be squeezed by rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "These companies have the momentum," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment
strategist with Advest Inc. "Higher interest rates will only become a problem if
the momentum of companies like IBM, like Cisco Systems, appears to slow down."
</P>
<P>
	   IBM rose 3 5/8 to 117 1/2, Hewlett-Packard gained 2 15/16 to 113 1/2 and
Intel was up 4 5/32 to 104 3/16, more than accounting for the Dow's gain. Cisco
rose 3 15/16 to 117 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   But perhaps the greatest example of investors' faith in technology stocks
was Amazon.com, which soared 14 3/4 to 84 3/16. The online retailer said late
Wednesday that while it posted its worst losses ever during the fourth quarter
of 1999, sales more than doubled. Amazon.com officials also claimed that losses
will narrow significantly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's influential Internet analyst, raised his
near-term rating on the stock from "accumulate" to "buy."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that with the interest-rate picture still somewhat murky,
investors are gravitating toward the stocks that performed best in 1999. Since
the Fed began raising rates last June, the blue-chip Dow has risen just 4
percent, while the Nasdaq has soared 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The action and performance is still being placed on the shoulders of the
heavily indexed stocks," said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Weakness in old-fashioned industrials contained the Dow's advance. Alcoa
fell 2 5/16 to 72 1/4 and Exxon Mobil fell 1 7/16 to 82 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, stocks benefited from a continued rally in the bond market.
Long-term Treasury prices, which have been edging higher for more than a week,
soared on Wednesday after the government said it would sell fewer bonds as part
of the Clinton administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.13 percent, down
from 6.28 percent late Wednesday. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the
long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Rising bond yields are
generally bad for stocks, because more lucrative returns on bonds can present
investors with an appealing alternative to stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts also said the market was lifted a bit after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan won Senate confirmation for a fourth term as head of the nation's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, we have a proactive Fed that is willing to gradually nudge up
rates to slow down the economy, but not break its back," Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet investors clearly remained nervous. Stocks were pressured at midday by
rumors that the Federal Reserve bank of New York had called an emergency meeting
to discuss market volatility. The Nasdaq pared much of its early gain, and the
Dow fell as much as 160 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spokesman for the bank denied the rumors, stocks recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.35 billion shares as of 4 p.m.,
compared with 1.24 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.90 to 519.79.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index gained 2.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.3 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was up 3.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> State GOP leaders surrender on anti-McCain effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, George W. Bush's top New York
backer, waved the white flag of surrender Thursday in the battle to keep John
McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   "I believe that John McCain should be on the ballot," Pataki said in a
statement. "This should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not
technicalities. I'm confident that George Bush will win that campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said Bush agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
	   With growing signs that New York's GOP hierarchy was ready to buckle, McCain
had sent letters to Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers earlier
Thursday calling for them to "do the right thing for New York Republicans."
</P>
<P>
	   "The system that is responsible for this sad situation cannot be defended
any longer," McCain wrote. "It is an embarrassment to a wonderful state, a
disappointment to a proud party and an affront to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, appearing in Dover, Del., had said "put him on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The shift came after Bush, stung by McCain's big New Hampshire primary win
Tuesday and unhappy about handing McCain an issue tailor-made for his "outsider"
campaign, signaled his New York supporters their fight to keep McCain off
primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's congressional district had
gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, top New York Republicans were told that Bush would prefer his
supporters not appeal if McCain won a federal court challenge to open up the New
York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case said Thursday that no ruling would be issued before
Monday, at the earliest. Lawyers on both sides said they expect it to be a
victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that if the judge happened to rule
against McCain, Pataki was then ready to "take the appropriate steps to ensure
that (McCain) is on the ballot." Mucha said she could not elaborate on what
those steps would be.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign director, Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, said he was pleased with Pataki's move, but called it "too little, too
late." The former congressman said, "they've hurt Governor Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   But Mucha said, "We believe McCain is hiding behind the issue of ballot
access ... When ballot access is off the table, it's clear he has nothing to
talk about in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   There was talk Thursday that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case and the delay until
Monday for a possible court ruling seemed in line with that.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said he knew nothing about that. While there was no immediate
comment from Powers, one of his lawyers, Lawrence Mandelker, said, "there
obviously is enormous political pressure for a settlement. I'm not involved in
those discussions. They are several pay grades above me, as we used to say in
the military."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized the Texas governor for not calling off the
effort to block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary
because he lacked enough petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush runningmate, had also come
under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they're smart, they just throw open the door and let McCain come
crashing through now," Nelson Warfield, a veteran political operative who worked
on Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's Governor Pataki trying to build a national image and now he runs the
risk of being seen as that governor who's pro-choice on abortion and anti-choice
for president," Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in the wake of McCain's New Hampshire victory, New York Republicans who
backed Bush are getting nervous, Republican operative Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of people in the last 24 hours not sleeping well on the
Republican side in New York," Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
district. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you sow, so shall you reap," McCain supporter Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann, Vodafone Set To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Mannesmann AG of Germany is poised to accept a sweetened
takeover bid of $180 billion from Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC, a deal that
would create the world's No. 1 wireless company through the biggest merger in
history.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann head Klaus Esser, speaking Thursday alongside Vodafone chief
executive Chris Gent in their first side-by-side appearance, said he would
recommend that the company's supervisory board accept the deal at a meeting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough in the hostile takeover battle followed intense last-minute
negotiations between Gent and Esser in a meeting that stretched from Wednesday
night into Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offer would give Mannesmann investors close to an equal stake in the
combined company, settling a major stumbling block in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann had demanded no less than a 50 percent share in the new company,
but Gent as recently as Wednesday ruled such an option out, insisting that
Vodafone was much larger than Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   "The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann, a great
company, would be better together with Vodafone Airtouch," Gent told reporters
in Duesseldorf. "I look forward to coming back to Duesseldorf in the middle of
next week to have further talks with (Esser) and members of his team."
</P>
<P>
	   The companies had been locked in a stalemate since Nov. 14, when
Mannesmann's supervisory board rejected Vodafone's unsolicited overture.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the new proposal was announced, Mannesmann shareholders were facing a
Monday deadline on whether to accept a Vodafone offer worth about $165 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new proposal, Mannesmann shareholders would get 58.96 Vodafone
shares -- currently worth about $350 -- for each of their Mannesmann shares,
giving them a combined 49.5 percent stake in the merged company.
</P>
<P>
	   Esser pointed out that his vigorous defense against the hostile takeover had
resulted in a deal almost double Vodafone's original offer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This change of 90 percent is certainly something that came about through
this discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone shareholders would hold a controlling stake with 50.5 percent of
the stock in the new company, which would be the biggest wireless communications
concern in the world with market-leading operations in Europe and the United
states.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company would have 42 million customers in 25 countries with an
especially strong presence in Europe, controlling the No. 1 or No. 2 position in
11 European countries with 29 million customers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   If accepted, the deal would easily eclipse both America Online's planned
$135 billion merger with Time Warner and MCI WorldCom's $115 billion deal with
Sprint Corp. as the biggest corporate marriage in history
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann, which also owns a major engineering and automotive business,
operates the largest mobile calling business in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone business about a year ago
by acquiring AirTouch Communications, a major wireless operator in the western
and midwestern United States. Now, Vodafone is set to link up AirTouch with Bell
Atlantic's wireless unit in a joint venture that will create the biggest U.S.
wireless service.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company's large coverage area would make it easier for mobile phone
users to take their service with them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company also would likely play a dominant role in implementing
the next generation of wireless technology, which will allow high-speed Internet
access from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, European Union monopoly regulators said earlier Thursday they
would have to review any merger between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been looking at it since we were first notified and we will
continue to look at it," said EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny, adding
that the Commission is expected to issue a first-phase decision on the case on
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have each spent millions of dollars on media campaigns trying
to persuade Mannesman's shareholders. Each insisted it had a better strategy for
a rapidly changing telecom industry -- especially in Europe, where deregulation
has sparked a frenzied race to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
	   Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in Germany, and politicians and
labor leaders here have decried Vodafone's attempt even though Mannesmann
recently acquired Orange PLC, a Vodafone rival in Britain. If the merger goes
through, the new company would likely spin off Orange to avoid conflict with
anti-monopoly laws in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Vodafone took the upperhand in the battle by announcing a
European Internet and telephone venture with the French conglomerate Vivendi SA,
a company Mannesmann had been trying to partner with.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite earlier reports that Mannesmann's Esser would step down, he said
Thursday that he'd stay on for five months to help with the transition. The two
executives provided few details on the proposed structure of the new company.
Vodafone had said previously that no jobs will be cut as a result of any merger.

<HEADLINE> Patients' Rights Debate Coming  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators intend to begin formal talks
next week on a compromise patients' rights bill, possibly including a provision
to permit lawsuits of HMOs, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think everything's on the table,'' Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., told
reporters after key GOP lawmakers met privately to discuss widely different
versions of legislation passed last year by the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Both bills offer new rights to patients, but differ in important areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate bill, drafted by Republicans and passed on a largely party-line
vote, applies to an estimated 61 million individuals with insurance, and does
not permit lawsuits in state courts for denied care.
</P>
<P>
	   The House-passed measure, backed by the White House and supported by
Democrats with some GOP backing, would apply to all 161 million Americans with
insurance and enable them to seek damages in state courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist said he hoped a final bill could be placed on President Clinton's desk
this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see any intransigence on anybody's part on any issue,'' he said,
although he added he didn't want the measure to become a ``litigation lottery''
that trial lawyers would love.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans reached out quickly this week to St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman
after learning that veteran Democratic Rep. Bruce Vento plans to leave Congress
at the end of the term. But Coleman, a Democrat-turned-Republican, passed the
word that he's not interested in a race for the House. ``Mayor Coleman loves his
job,'' said his spokesman, Mike Zipko.
</P>
<P>
	   Vento, who is in his 12th term, disclosed on Wednesday that he has lung
cancer and will not run again so he can devote his energies to treatment.

<HEADLINE> Investigators focus on collapse of steel arch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - State and federal investigators on Thursday were
trying to determine the sequence of events that brought an 80-foot steel arch
crashing down at a construction site, killing two workers and injuring two
others.
<P>
	   Inspectors from the state Department of Public Safety, including fire
marshals, crane inspectors, building inspectors and state troopers toured the
site, as did inspectors and engineers from the U.S. Occupational Health and
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   They drew up maps and reviewed witness accounts of the accident to come up
with a clearer picture of what happened when. The investigation was expected to
take some time.
</P>
<P>
	   "Out of the respect for the victims and the safety of future workers, we
will make sure we cover all the bases before calling it quits with this
investigation," Deputy Public Safety Commissioner George Luther said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators confirmed that the arch, made out of several hundred tons of
steel, crashed down onto a crane that was sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Some witnesses initially told investigators that it looked like the crane
collapsed and took the steel arch with it. Part of the latticed arm of the crane
ended up on top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
	   The feet of the arch remained where they were when the arch was upright,
bolted into concrete. Some bolts were broken and some of the 18-inch steel beams
were bent along the length of the structure.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the accident Wednesday morning were Kevin Winslow, 43, of
Newington and Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford, both boilermakers on the
construction job.
</P>
<P>
	   The crane operator, Robert Fitch, 62, of North Branford, survived being
pinned in the wreckage for eight hours. His legs were severely crushed, and
doctors Thursday amputated one leg just above the knee - an operation necessary
to save his life, Bridgeport Hospital spokesman John Cappiello said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Previous surgical attempts failed to restore blood flow to the desired
level making amputation necessary," Cappiello said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitch, who was in critical condition after the surgery, improved to serious
condition Thursday evening. With steady improvement, Fitch's doctors expect he
could leave the hospital within a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Another injured worker, George Scrivner, 36, of East Haddam, was treated at
the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven and released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 544-megawatt plant was being built by Houston-based El Paso Energy Corp.
and Power Development Co. of Auburn, Mass., with El Paso having a 95 percent
stake in the plant. Construction of the $235 million plant started in March and
was scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Black &AMP; Veatch, the consulting engineering firm that was overseeing the
project, said in a written statement Thursday that it was fully cooperating with
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Black &AMP; Veatch places a high importance on the safety and health of its
employees and the employees of its subcontractors during performance of work.
Our safety records support the commitment to excellence in the industry," the
Kansas City, Mo.-based company said.

<HEADLINE> NASA: We'll Launch if Russia Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said the U.S. will launch
its own service module to the International Space Station late this year if
Russia fails to put up a module by this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin, in an interview with journalists Thursday, said he hopes the
Russians, who are more than a year behind schedule, will complete and launch a
service module to the space station by July. But if they fail, he said, the U.S.
will be ready.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian part of the space station initially fell behind schedule because
the government failed to provide the funds to meet the commitment. The effort
was further delayed recently by two failures of Proton rockets, the launcher the
Russians will use to put the modules in orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the Russians have diverted some equipment that was supposed to go to
the space station for use in maintaining the aged Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that he is waiting to see if the Russians are serious about
fixing the Proton and then launching the service module before the U.S. puts the
final touches on an American service module. He said the Russians will have a
launch readiness review later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to see if they have a fire in the belly about getting the service
module up,'' said the space agency administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that if Russia has not launched the service module by July, then
NASA will do the final work on its own service module and would launch it by
December.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the Russians to be there, but we felt we had to be responsible
custodians to keep the program on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. service module will cost about $200 million when it is finished and
in place on the space station.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that even if the Russians do launch their service module, the
U.S. module will still be useful. He said it would be sent to the space station
next year. Using both service modules ``makes the station much more robust.''
</P>
<P>
	   The multibillion-dollar International Space Station is a joint effort by 16
nations, with the U.S. taking the lead role.

<HEADLINE> Haider Coalition To Be Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president agreed Thursday to swear in a
coalition government that includes a far-right party whose leader Joerg Haider
has applauded aspects of the Nazi regime and who campaigned on an anti-immigrant
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaction was swift. Israel recalled its ambassador and banned Haider from
visiting, even though the right-wing leader has repeatedly apologized for
pro-Nazi remarks made years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   European Union nations started making good on threats to politically isolate
Austria, something the United States has backed. The EU also warned it may
suspend the Alpine nation's membership.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect of Haider's Freedom Party in government prompted about 2,000
protesters to take to the streets of Vienna late Thursday for a second straight
night.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of them pushed their way into the city's historic Burgtheater and
stormed the stage in the middle of a performance, calling on the audience to
join a protest rally Friday before fleeing the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the outcry both at home and abroad, President Thomas Klestil said
the results of the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections give him little choice but to
go ahead with the swearing-in ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil did reject two Cabinet nominees from Haider's Freedom Party,
including one who authorized distribution of campaign posters in Vienna warning
of ``over-foreignization,'' a term that harkened back to the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also demanded that Haider and his coalition partner, Wolfgang
Schuessel of the centrist Austrian People's Party, sign a statement renouncing
the nation's Nazi past and promising to respect European values.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety -- and later apologized -- for statements
praising Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of
the Waffen SS as ``decent people of good character.'' He has also opposed EU
expansion and urged a near halt to immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel will become chancellor and Freedom Party official Susanne
Riess-Passer will be vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider will remain governor of Carinthia state and hold no Cabinet
post, he has a strong grip on the Freedom Party. Critics doubt Schuessel, whose
hold on his own party is less firm, can control the mercurial Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   The declaration that the two leaders signed did not specifically refer to
Haider's previous comments. However, Haider and Schuessel pledged to work for a
democratic Austria where ``xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism have no place.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out of the tragic history of
the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the National Socialist regime,''
the statement said. ``The singularity of the crimes of the Holocaust, which are
without precedent in history, are an exhortation to permanent alertness against
all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a press conference after the signing ceremony, Haider insisted his party
was committed to defending the rights of ``ethnic and religious minorities'' in
Austria and could even serve as an example for the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the irrepressible Haider later criticized Klestil for making him
sign the declaration, terming it ``an affront to the Austrian public.'' During
an interview with a German television network, Haider said his foreign and
domestic critics should realize ``that we are a very democratic party that
stands upon the foundations of the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a State Department spokesman said Thursday that the Clinton
administration would keep a close watch on the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While it's premature to talk about our actions at this stage, we will
determine what steps are appropriate based on what happens,'' James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said during a visit to Israel that
the declaration ``sounds like lip service'' and that Austria is making ``a
historic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France called the
Austrian developments a ``political shame without precedent in Europe since the
end of the second World War.''
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense; Portugal's president planned to call off a state visit in March.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Haider ``dangerous'' to
democracy and recalled the Jewish state's ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not post an ambassador to Austria from 1986 to 1992, during the
presidency of Kurt Waldheim, who was dogged by allegations of involvement in
Nazi persecution in the Balkans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party won 52 seats in the 183 member parliament, as did the
center-right People's Party. The Social Democrats, the main party in the
outgoing coalition, took 65 seats -- too few to govern alone.

<HEADLINE> Thursday's Commodities  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Heating oil and crude oil futures surged Thursday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as a cold snap in the Northeast revived prices in a skittish, tightly
supplied market.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, platinum and palladium pushed to new highs and
soybeans fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the rally in most energy futures resulted from a general sense
that the previous day's pullback was overdone. Freezing or near-freezing
temperatures in much of the East also supported prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil for March delivery rose 2.37 cents to 77.90 cents a gallon,
while March crude rose 48 cents to $28.03 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   With new data showing U.S. crude supplies tighter than they've been since
1976, the oil market remains highly volatile and prices could skyrocket if
anything disrupts the dwindling supplies, said energy analyst Phil Flynn.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the pieces are in place for crude to make a dramatic rise," said Flynn,
of Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very delicate balance. With supplies that tight, if one little thing
goes wrong it's going to tip the applecart and apples are going to fly all over
the place," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   March unleaded gasoline rose 1.88 cents to 76.68 cents a gallon. March
natural gas fell 10 cents to $2.659 per 1,000 cubic feet in a day of
rollercoaster price swings affected by forecasts for above-average temperatures
ahead for much of the northern and central United States and speculation about
changes in OPEC production levels.
</P>
<P>
	   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, March Brent crude from the
North Sea rose 73 cents to $26.66 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Platinum and palladium extended their historic rally on the New York Merc on
continued demand in a fast-tightening market for both metals.
</P>
<P>
	   April platinum rose 2 percent, settling up $8.60 to $474.80 an ounce, a 9
1/2-year high for the second straight day. March palladium jumped 3 percent,
climbing $11.80 to finish at its latest all-time high, $514.05 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Both metals' prices continue to be driven higher by Russia's strategic
absence from the market. Russia supplies about two-thirds of the world's
palladium, used heavily in automobile catalytic converters, and 25 percent to 30
percent of platinum, which is currently in big demand by jewelers.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the absence of any metal from Russia, there isn't much likelihood of the
(platinum) price going down," said Tim Gardiner, head of precious metals trading
for Mitsui &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia hasn't made any platinum exports since April, and has supplied only
limited amounts of palladium.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean prices sank on the Chicago Board of Trade as timely rains continued
to pelt southern Brazil during a key period for crop moisture. Soybeans fell
back to their lowest level in two weeks as forecasts called for more rain into
next week in top growing regions of South America.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans fell 6 1/2 cents to $5.01 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Content's Editor, Brill, Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Brill stepped down Thursday as editor in chief of a
media watchdog magazine he founded, Brill's Content, a day after announcing a
business arrangement with several media companies scrutinized by his
publication.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kuhn, who had been hired last fall from Tina Brown's Talk magazine to
head up the new online venture, will take over as editor in chief of the
magazine. Brill will remain as chairman and CEO of the New York-based Brill
Media Holdings, the parent company that controls both the magazine and the
online business.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Brill announced a partnership with CBS, NBC and several other
media companies to launch a Web site called Contentville.com that would
recommend books, magazine articles and other material for readers to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement was unusual because of Brill's self-styled role as an
arbiter of fairness and honesty in the media industry. Brill had previously come
under fire for his donations to certain Democrats in light of a lengthy article
in the magazine's first issue that was critical of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill declined to comment for this story. But a spokeswoman, Cindy
Rosenthal, said that questions over conflict of interest had nothing to do with
Brill's decision to step down as editor of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can't do everything. He's going to focus on the business side and have
someone else focus on the editorial side," Rosenthal said. As of Wednesday,
however, Brill was in charge of both editorial and business operations for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal also said she did not believe Kuhn's position as both top editor
of the watchdog magazine and of the Web site linked with the media companies
posed a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the Contentville.com venture Wednesday, Brill said the site
would provide "informed, disinterested recommendations" to readers for books and
magazines to buy, and that the Web site and magazine would remain separate.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a world where everything is marketed and hyped, we want to create a
place online that is like an old-time magazine stand, bookstore, or library,"
Brill said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to NBC and CBS, other partners in Contentville.com included
Primedia, a major publisher of special-interest and enthusiast magazines; Ingram
Book Group, a leading book distributor; Ebsco, a major provider of magazine
subscription services; and Jim Cramer, an investment manager and founder of the
financial news site TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Any of Contentville's business partners could be considered fair game for
scrutiny in the Brill's Content. The magazine has already written about NBC and
ran a cover story last year on CBS and CNN. CBS will have a 35 percent stake in
Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, the cash and promotion being put into the venture was valued at
more than $100 million. The Web site is expected to launch in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content, which carries the slogan "Skepticism is a Virtue" on its
cover, takes a critical view of the media world, holding the news business and
media companies up for scrutiny on questions of coverage, privacy, and media
ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what his motive is for resigning, but on its face there's
certainly the appearance of a conflict," said Sig Gissler, a professor at
Columbia University's School of Journalism. "The watchdog should try to keep an
arm's length relationship with the media they're watching, and it sounds to me
like they were getting a little close."
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content made a big splash when in it started in June 1998,
especially with the article on Starr and information leaks to reporters during
the Monica Lewinsky affair. Since then, however, it has maintained a lower
profile.
</P>
<P>
	   Before starting Brill's Content, Brill founded Court TV and American Lawyer
Magazine.

<HEADLINE> Casinos' contractors sue over state's minority set-asides program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A group of casino industry contractors who are
challenging minority set-asides went to court Thursday in a bid to have the
anti-discrimination measures stricken as unconstitutional.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Stephen Orlofsky reserved decision on a request by the
Association for Fairness in Business Inc. for a preliminary injunction banning
state regulators from enforcing the set-aside program. He is expected to rule
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Casino Control Commission requires that Atlantic City casinos set
aside up to 15 percent of the $4 billion a year they spend on goods and services
for contracts with businesses owned by women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, which is made up of an undetermined number of companies that do
business with the casinos, filed a federal lawsuit in December in which it said
the set-aside program discriminates against businesses not owned by minorities
or women.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is improper because federal courts have held that such
anti-discrimination measures cannot be instituted legally unless there is proof
that discrimination has occurred in that field before, the group says.
</P>
<P>
	   In a four-page affidavit submitted with the lawsuit, Fabi Construction Inc.
president Allen Zappone said his company had bid on two casino contracts in the
last six months and lost out to a women-owned business in one of them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Zappone's companies represent a microcosm of the universe of thousands of
companies doing business with casinos on a daily basis," the group's attorney,
Salvatore Perillo, said in a brief filed in conjunction with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 30-minute session Thursday, Orlofsky entertained arguments from
Perillo, Deputy Attorney General Mark Holmes and commission attorney David
Missimer.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmes did not refute Perillo's assertions but said the request for an
injunction was premature because Perillo had not proved that Zappone and the
other association members would suffer irreparable harm if the program weren't
stopped immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Missimer said commission officials expect only that casinos make a
good-faith effort to meet the 15 percent standard, but that reaching it is not
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
	   But Perillo said casinos could lose their licenses to operate - "the
ultimate sanction, the death penalty" he called it - if they do not strive for
the 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The court case marks the latest in a series of challenges to affirmative
action in the Atlantic City casino industry. Among them:
</P>
<P>
	   -In November, a state Superior Court judge said the state Casino
Reinvestment Development Authority's minority business set-aside policies were
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   -Later that month, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the
affirmative action plan of Resorts Atlantic City was discriminatory. The ruling
came in a lawsuit filed by a white former stage technician who lost out to a
black man for a job in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   -Last month, a former pit manager sued Tropicana Casino and Resort for what
he said is discrimination against white men. John D. Rudolph, an 18-year
employee fired a year ago, filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court
saying the casino's affirmative action plan was not established to remedy
discrimination and was therefore legally insufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   The casinos are keeping a close eye on the proceedings in the federal court
case because of the potential ramifications of it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're caught in the middle," said Tropicana attorney Jerry Tanenbaum, who
sat in on Thursday's hearing as an observer.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls in Jittery Market  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) --The dollar fell broadly Thursday as turbulent markets and
rising interest rates made holders of the U.S. currency skittish.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 107.71 yen in trading late Thursday in New York,
down from 108.26 yen Wednesday. The euro was quoted at 98.95 cents, up from
97.57 cents late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro has fallen more than 17 percent from its peak the day it was
introduced a year ago January. Central bankers have maintained for most of the
year that they weren't worried about the fall of the new currency that replaces
those of 11 nations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the euro has endured several new lows in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank raised interest rates Thursday, a day after the
U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates.
</P>
<P>
	   ECB president Wim Duisenberg said the quarter percentage point interest rate
rise was needed to tamp down the risk of inflation.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Bond Prices Soar  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new investment landscape for U.S. government securities
was apparent Thursday as traders for a second straight day bid up the price of
the no-longer benchmark 30-year Treasury bond as if it were an Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-term bond held its strongest rally in two years amid fears of a
supply crunch in the wake of the U.S. government's decision to pay off the
national debt, reducing the number of Treasury bonds in circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond soared 2 1/32 points, or $20.31 1/4 per $1,000
in face value. The surge came atop Wednesday's gain of 1 27/32 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.13 percent
Thursday from Wednesday's 6.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Jan. 18, the yield on the long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year
high of 6.75 percent. With the latest rally, yields on 30-year Treasurys are
below 1-year Treasury bills, which closed at 6.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 10-year bond, which many are now viewing as the replacement
bellwether government security, also soared Thursday, climbing 29/32 point, or
by $9.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department's pay-down program could eventually remove the
extremely popular 30-year bond from the market entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   "Folks are kind of shocked. Treasuries have become a scarce commodity," said
Gary Hunt, a mutual fund manager who oversees bond portfolios for Nationwide
Insurance in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's 'wild, wild stuff,' as Johnny Carson used to say. It's definitely a
new environment for everybody. We're all trying to figure out what this means
for the future," Hunt added.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's rally came on top of similarly spectacular gains on Wednesday,
when the Treasury Department announced it would scale back by $5 billion the
amount of intermediate and long-term bonds it will sell at next week's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Treasury also said it would sell fewer 30-year bonds at its
next auction in August.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bellwether issue is no longer a bellwether," said Robert Parks, a
long-time Wall Street economist, author and finance professor at Pace University
in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks said the 30-year bond is probably the most liquid -- meaning the
easiest to trade -- low risk, fixed income securities contract available to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "These highly attractive instruments are becoming scarcer and scarcer so
people are rushing to get these things," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But not to worry. Should the government pay off the 30-year bond debt
altogether, investors seeking long-term, low risk investments can always switch
to other types of government-backed debt, including bonds from mortgage market
companies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing bond sales is part the federal government's strategy to make use of
the huge budget surplus to pay down the national debt. Treasury officials said
they plan to buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to Thursday's mayhem was a widespread rumor that the dramatic decline
in bond yields had wiped out a large unnamed financial institution and that a
rescue meeting was being held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The rumor
prompted a statement from the New York Fed denying there was a meeting to
discuss market volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up  1/8 to  1/4 point, while
intermediate maturities rose 9/16 to 29/32 point, according to Bridge Telerate
news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.60
percent, with the discount falling 0.03 percentage point from late Wednesday to
5.44 percent. Six-month yields were 5.84 percent as the discount fell 0.06
percentage point to 5.59 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.14 percent, with
the discount dropping 0.06 percentage point to 5.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 23/32 point to 92 5/32. The
yield was 6.24 percent, down from Wednesday's 6.30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Army Launches Recruitment Programs  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army launched two education programs Thursday aimed
at boosting recruitment by offering prospects help in getting the equivalent of
a high school degree or going to college before active duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs are expected to have the biggest impact in attracting more
Hispanics, who make up about 40 percent of those eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a catch to both plans: Since they are test programs, they are being
offered only to recruits in limited areas of the country. Nothing, however, will
prevent applicants from picking cities where they enlist.
</P>
<P>
	   The new incentives can bring ``motivated young men and women back into the
world of learning and the world of success,'' said Education Secretary Richard
Riley, who endorsed both programs.
</P>
<P>
	   One program, GED Plus, offers non-graduates help in getting a General
Equivalency Diploma, which is considered equal to a high school degree, before
they serve.
</P>
<P>
	   The other, College Plus, offers $150 a month or reserve training pay,
depending on where they enlist, to recruits who want to complete a two-year
college degree before serving. As part of the test reserve service will be
mandatory at some enlistment centers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army has had difficulty selling the graduate equivalency program to the
Pentagon because other services are reluctant to use any incentive that might
decrease the quality of recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   But Army Secretary Louis Caldera and retired Gen. Colin Powell, who also
endorsed the plans, insisted that won't happen, because recruits will still have
to qualify through strict screening and will go on active duty only when they
have the equivalent of a degree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should have no fear that in any way are we going to lower the standards
of the U.S. Army,'' said Powell at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In a reverse of the GI bill which rewards service with help in education,
the programs offer education up front as an incentive for enlistment --
something previously offered mainly to officer candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera, outlining the plans, said they expected to add about 500 recruits a
month, which is just about exactly the shortfall the Army had in meeting its
recruiting goal last year. Its expected to cost about $6 million a year,
including $100 per non-graduate recruit and $150 a month for those to be helped
through a two-years college course.
</P>
<P>
	   To be eligible for help in obtaining the General Equivalency Diploma,
recruits must score in the top 50 percent on a uniform military eligibility
exam, score well in a motivational test, have no waiver for drug or alcohol
abuse and must have voluntarily left high school and be too old to return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not creating incentives for any young person to drop out of high
school,'' Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said about 500,000 men and women would be eligible for the program. The
high school equivalency program is limited to 6,000. The two-year college aid
program has no limit but is expected to attract up to 5,000, double the Army's
current enlistment of college students.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army will maintain its current level of 90 percent of its personnel with
a high school degree or equivalent, Caldera said. That was reduced from 95
percent to aid recruitment, but officials say only a handful of recruits are
accepted each year without at least a degree equivalent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army advises that potential recruits check with their local recruiters
to find out which programs are available in their area.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
time in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad, 48, one of the highest ranking women in business, was under intense
pressure from investors and Mattel's board of directors to explain big losses at
the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and other
troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership rolls, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, gained 12 1/2 cents more as of 5:15 p.m. EST Thursday to
$11.93 3/4 for the New York Stock Exchange-listed company. Word of the
resignation came in the final moments of trading on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   In after-hours trading on Instinet, however, shares had fallen to $10.75.
Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60 percent
from its 52-week high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. With a flashy style and an aggressive marketing
savvy, Barad helped make Mattel into the dominant toymaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others are Andrea
Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Learning Company lost $183 million in the quarter and $206
million for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel said that it is reviewing the Mattel Interactive division, which
includes the Learning Company, and upon completion of that review, the company
will undertake a restructuring program and will take a restructuring charge of
between $75 million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's day-to-day operations will be managed by a newly formed office
of the chief operating officer, comprised of executives who manage Mattel's
major brands. That team will report to Loeb.
</P>
<P>
	   Loeb, a lawyer, has been a member of Mattel's board since 1970. Rollnick,
who is retired as chairman and a director from Genstar Rental Electronics, has
been on the board since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Mattel lost $86.35 million, or 21 cents a share, compared
with earnings of $198 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period a year
ago. Sales for the year were $5.5 billion, down from $5.62 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Content's Editor, Brill, Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Brill stepped down Thursday as editor in chief of a
media watchdog magazine he founded, Brill's Content, a day after announcing a
business arrangement with several media companies scrutinized by his
publication.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kuhn, who had been hired last fall from Tina Brown's Talk magazine to
head up the new online venture, will take over as editor in chief of the
magazine. Brill will remain as chairman and CEO of the New York-based Brill
Media Holdings, the parent company that controls both the magazine and the
online business.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Brill announced a partnership with CBS, NBC and several other
media companies to launch a Web site called Contentville.com that would
recommend books, magazine articles and other material for readers to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement was unusual because of Brill's self-styled role as an
arbiter of fairness and honesty in the media industry. Brill had previously come
under fire for his donations to certain Democrats in light of a lengthy article
in the magazine's first issue that was critical of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill declined to comment for this story. But a spokeswoman, Cindy
Rosenthal, said that questions over conflict of interest had nothing to do with
Brill's decision to step down as editor of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can't do everything. He's going to focus on the business side and have
someone else focus on the editorial side," Rosenthal said. As of Wednesday,
however, Brill was in charge of both editorial and business operations for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal also said she did not believe Kuhn's position as both top editor
of the watchdog magazine and of the Web site linked with the media companies
posed a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the Contentville.com venture Wednesday, Brill said the site
would provide "informed, disinterested recommendations" to readers for books and
magazines to buy, and that the Web site and magazine would remain separate.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a world where everything is marketed and hyped, we want to create a
place online that is like an old-time magazine stand, bookstore, or library,"
Brill said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to NBC and CBS, other partners in Contentville.com included
Primedia, a major publisher of special-interest and enthusiast magazines; Ingram
Book Group, a leading book distributor; Ebsco, a major provider of magazine
subscription services; and Jim Cramer, an investment manager and founder of the
financial news site TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Any of Contentville's business partners could be considered fair game for
scrutiny in the Brill's Content. The magazine has already written about NBC and
ran a cover story last year on CBS and CNN. CBS will have a 35 percent stake in
Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, the cash and promotion being put into the venture was valued at
more than $100 million. The Web site is expected to launch in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content, which carries the slogan "Skepticism is a Virtue" on its
cover, takes a critical view of the media world, holding the news business and
media companies up for scrutiny on questions of coverage, privacy, and media
ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what his motive is for resigning, but on its face there's
certainly the appearance of a conflict," said Sig Gissler, a professor at
Columbia University's School of Journalism. "The watchdog should try to keep an
arm's length relationship with the media they're watching, and it sounds to me
like they were getting a little close."
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content made a big splash when it started in June 1998, especially
with the article on Starr and information leaks to reporters during the Monica
Lewinsky affair. Since then, however, it has maintained a lower profile.
</P>
<P>
	   Before starting Brill's Content, Brill founded Court TV and American Lawyer
Magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market mutual funds
rose by $3.60 billion in the latest week to $964.02 billion, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose by $2.63
billion to $799.82 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund assets rose by $971.1 million to

</P>
<P>
	   Total money market assets stood at $1.660 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.673 trillion to reflect
reporting errors and a change in the number of funds reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week
ended Tuesday to 5.14 percent from 5.11 percent the previous week, said IBC's
Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial
Data Inc. The 30-day average yield rose to 5.13 percent from 5.07 percent, IBC
Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.28 percent from 5.24 percent the
previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 5.26 percent from 5.20

<P>
	   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 45 days, up
from 44 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10
largest markets showed the annual percentage yield available on money market
accounts remained unchanged at 2.07 percent as of Wednesday from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp. said the
annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts held
steady at 0.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.72 percent on six-month
certificates of deposit, up from 4.71 percent the previous week. Yields were
5.08 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.05 percent; 5.32 percent on 2 1/2-year
CDs, up from 5.30 percent; and 5.63 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To Protect Financial Data  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Thursday proposed new rules
spelling out how consumers' personal data will be protected as barriers between
banks, investment firms and insurance companies come down.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules, proposed by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury Department
division, will make it tougher for financial companies to share even seemingly
innocuous information, such as customers' names, addresses and telephone
numbers, with outside marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators take the view that such basic information is ``nonpublic''
information when it is taken from sources such as customer lists -- even if the
names and addresses also are available from a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
	   As ``nonpublic'' information, the names and addresses -- as well as more
personal financial data such as account balances -- cannot be shared with
outside telemarketers if customers expressly ask their banks, brokerages or
insurance companies not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the onus is on consumers. They must ask, in a letter or standard
form, financial companies with whom they do business not to share or sell their
data.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, under a financial overhaul law enacted in November, banks,
brokerages and insurers that join together under the same corporate roof are
entitled to share customers' personal financial data with each other. In that
case, customers do not have the right to block such sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and privacy advocates have said the new law's privacy
protections fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the new rules
proposed by the regulators ``have a broad definition of what kind of information
... (is) covered by privacy requirements, which is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, we do have some concerns,'' he added. ``It's unfortunate that
these rules are constrained by the financial services law passed last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said
the group will ``look more closely at these regulations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some bankers privately objected to the new rules, saying they took an overly
broad interpretation of privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who won Senate confirmation Thursday for a
fourth term, expressed approval of the new privacy rules at an open meeting at
which he and the other central bank governors voted to propose them for 60 days
of public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, so good,'' Greenspan told the Fed staff attorneys, who had drafted
the rules and negotiated with other federal agencies to make the regulations
consistent for different financial industries and sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   While most people think of the Federal Reserve as regulating the nation's
money supply and controlling interest rates, the central bank also oversees some
categories of banks, including those organized in a holding company structure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed is among a group of agencies that have been drafting privacy rules
for the industries and sectors they regulate, because of legislation enacted in
November that allowed banks, investment firms and insurance companies to get
involved in each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The other agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission; the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Department division that
regulates national banks; the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National
Credit Union Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for insurance companies
and agents and a panoply of other businesses outside of banks and securities
firms -- including travel agencies, mortgage companies, tax preparation
services, check-cashing outlets, credit bureaus and department stores that issue
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The agencies have been working under a tight deadline. Under the new law,
final regulations must take effect by November.
</P>
<P>
	   The Comptroller's office also published its rules Thursday, and the other
agencies are expected to follow in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important advance in privacy protections for consumers,''
Julie Williams, the agency's chief counsel, said in a telephone interview.
``This is a winning situation for consumers and potentially a new competitive
(feature) for banks'' that offer strong privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules, financial companies will have to disclose their privacy
policies to customers at least once a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At least 10 inmates died in a violent shootout
between prisoners in Bogota on Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were attempting to restore order at the La Picota federal
penitentiary, prisons spokesman Rocio Devia said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloody outbreak appeared to be a turf war between prisoners in two wards
housing a mix of leftist guerrillas, common criminals and drug traffickers,
Devia added.

<P>
	   Gang fights are common in the South American country's filthy and
overcrowded prisons. Guns and knives are easily smuggled past corrupt guards.
</P>

	   More than 300 prisoners have been killed and about 900 have escaped from
Colombian prisons since 1997, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Flee To Mountains  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-KALA, Russia (AP) -- Rebels fleeing the smoking ruins of the Chechen
capital pushed through snowy forests Thursday toward the southern mountains,
hoping to join comrades in a guerrilla war against Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel exodus this week from Grozny, the biggest political prize in the
5-month-old Chechen war, has boosted morale among Russian troops. But a rebel
leader claimed that by fleeing Grozny, the rebels had strengthened their hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was much better for the Russians when we were concentrated in Grozny,''
said Khizir Khachukayev, a Chechen commander. ``Now that we are going to be in
the mountains, they will face more trouble.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many of the estimated 3,000 rebels in Grozny made it out
of the city alive in the flight that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said on Russia's ORT television channel that
more than 1,500 were killed this week in the attempt to break through Russian
troops around Grozny. Khachukayev said that more than 3,000 rebels had left
Grozny in recent days. The claims could not be confirmed, and Russia is believed
to often exaggerate its casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest, large group of rebels fled overnight and arrived in nearby
Alkhan-Kala early Thursday, then slipped through Russian lines to head for rebel
strongholds in the mountains, Alkhan-Kala residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost all the rebels had left Alkhan-Kala by daylight, and the Russians
took control of the village. It was unclear what happened to the hundreds of
wounded rebels who reportedly took refuge there; some were believed too badly
maimed to be moved.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin official in charge of Russia's information
campaign on Chechnya, said Thursday that federal forces had killed about 100
militants and taken 129 prisoners over the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian mortars pounded parts of Grozny on Thursday as troops closed in on
the last scattered bands of Chechen defenders, and Sergeyev said the Russian
forces were advancing through Grozny at twice their previous speed. The troop
progress was largely impeded by mines planted in buildings, the military said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky cautioned that centers of resistance remained in the capital.
He told reporters in Moscow that federal forces now controlled more than 50
percent of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pitched battles for individual buildings still lie ahead,'' he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting was fierce around the city's main cannery and an oil refinery, the
Interfax news agency quoted the military command as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   But other parts of the city were quiet. Russian television broadcast footage
of Russian soldiers picking their way through muddy, debris-filled streets. Some
high-rise apartment buildings were perforated with shell holes, while others
leaned at strange angles.
</P>
<P>
	   The military claimed Thursday that 400 rebels in Grozny had given up over
the past 24 hours. That figure could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who had escaped Grozny were mostly heading west, then south into the
mountains, where thousands of fighters are believed to be based. Occasional
clashes broke out in villages en route, but no large-scale fighting was
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 fighters left Grozny in the first wave on Monday and Tuesday.
But hundreds were killed when they stumbled into a minefield and were blasted by
Russian artillery, rebels said.
</P>
<P>
	   The military had sought to play down the breakout, but has now begun
claiming that the rebels' flight -- and alleged annihilation -- was the result
of a carefully planned strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What happened is the result of painstaking planning and brilliant
operations,'' ITAR-Tass quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   A top regional commander, Gen. Vladimir Shamonov, said on Russian television
that the operations had included telling some rebels that the Russians would
show them a safe corridor out of Grozny for $100,000. The rebels then were
killed in Alkhan-Kala, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not specify whether the rebels had paid the money, and his account
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, and
deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Corning drives deeper into Internet-propelled fiber-optic market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - Corning Inc. is driving deeper into a scorching,
high-tech business credited above all others with enabling the phenomenal growth
of the Internet: fiber optics.
<P>
	   The world's leading supplier of optical fiber and cable said Thursday it is
investing about $750 million to expand its global fiber-making capacity by 50
percent within three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Driven by rapid technological innovation and plunging costs, the amount of
information that fiber-optic systems can handle is estimated to be doubling
every nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   "Compare that with Moore's Law, which has microprocessors doubling in
capability every 18 months and ... you begin to get an idea of the scale of the
experience change," said Wendell Weeks, who oversees Corning's fiber and optical
equipment businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The "scientific glass company," famous for entwining glass innovations in
potent technologies from the light bulb to television's cathode-ray tube,
recently spent over $3 billion and doubled its payroll to 32,000 to solidify its
presence in optical communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning wants to begin offering its customers "one-stop shopping" by getting
a bigger foothold in the optical equipment field - making the components that
amplify and redirect the laser light pulses carrying information at hyper-speed
through fiber-optic grids.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to be able to help our customers to move fast and, to do that, you
need to be able to bring a lot of technologies to bear," Weeks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Corning acquired a leading laser producer, Oak Industries Inc.,
in a stock deal valued at about $2 billion. A month later, it paid around $1.3
billion to buy Siemens AG's fiber-optic systems business and buy out two joint
ventures with the German industrial group. Both deals were formally completed
over the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   By investing in laser and other optical components, Corning is pushing into
terrain reigned over by powerhouses like San Jose, Calif.-based JDS Uniphase
Corp. and Lucent Technologies of Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning, based in rural western New York, invented optical fiber in 1970. It
already controls an estimated 40 percent of the world's optical fiber market,
twice as much as its nearest rival, Lucent, and has fiber-making plants in
Europe, Australia and the United States, including the world's biggest one in
Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts set worldwide demand for fiber at more than 37 million miles in
1999. The market is expected to exceed 60 million miles in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning is investing $550 million to double the capacity of its
six-month-old factory near Concord, N.C., and add 500 jobs to several hundred
already there. It also is planning a $100 million expansion at the Wilmington
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Optical fiber, cable and optical devices contributed 59 percent of Corning's
revenues of $4.3 billion in 1999, and that segment will likely account for 70
percent of sales this year.

<HEADLINE> Study Links El Nino To Diarrhea  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- After linking El Nino with illnesses such as malaria, cholera
and dengue fever, scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an
increase in childhood diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
	   The research led by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health also suggests
for the first time that gradual temperature increases related to global warming
could foster outbreaks of diarrhea in children living in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Diarrhea kills as many as 3 million children under the age of 5 worldwide
every year and sickens millions more, mostly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
	   It normally is more prevalent during the warmer seasons but, until now,
experts didn't know whether a change in temperature could play a role.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 57,331 children in Lima, Peru, found that an increase in
diarrhea cases between 1993 and 1997 was linked to even small rises in
temperature, regardless of whether it was summer or winter. In fact, the effect
was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the study, published this week in The Lancet medical journal, found
that for every 1 degree centigrade (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal
it became, 8 percent more children arrived at a local clinic for treatment of
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were similar for the 1997-1998 El Nino period.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of children brought to the clinic each day that winter was double
what would have been expected for that time of year had El Nino not occurred,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up,
creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter
temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit).
</P>
<P>
	   A similar increase in temperatures brought on by El Nino in the summer was
still connected to more diarrhea than usual, but the effect was not as strong,
accounting for only a 50 percent rise in diarrhea cases, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
	   "The potential effect of global warming on disease is controversial," said
William Checkley of Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins, who led the study. "This
study suggests there may be something to it for diarrhea."
</P>
<P>
	   It's plausible the researchers' findings could apply in countries other than
Peru, said Dr. Tony McMichael, an epidemiology professor at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who studies the effects of climate on disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "In general, a large proportion of infectious disease agents are very
sensitive to slight changes in climate," said McMichael, who was not involved in
the research. "This would give us a reasonable indication of how diarrhea agents
react to changes in temperature in general, whether in water or in food."
</P>
<P>
	   Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that
the types of diarrhea common in winter and summer are different.
</P>
<P>
	   In hot weather, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is more likely.
Cooler temperatures appear to enhance the transmission of viral diarrhea, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the winters are hotter than normal, it could be that children are
exposed to more sources of diarrhea, including the bacterial and parasite sort.
El Nino also may prompt diarrhea-promoting behavior more common in the summer,
such as more demand for water, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Olivier Fontaine, a diarrhea expert at the World Health Organization,
said the observed link makes sense.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be useful for developing strategies to combat the disease by
intervening to prevent it," Fontaine said. "If we can predict a change in the
weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions
in place before the weather changes."

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Moscow May Exploit Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen predicted Thursday
that Russia and China would try to exploit differences between the United States
and its European allies on the contentious issue of missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Russia and China are strongly opposed to U.S. efforts to develop a
network of radars and missile interceptors that could defend all 50 states
against a limited attack by ballistic missiles. Many European governments are
lukewarm to the project, and some suggest it could weaken U.S. ties to Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview en route to Munich from Washington, Cohen acknowledged the
NATO allies' misgivings. He said some fear the project could lead to a
dismantling of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He predicted Russia and
China will use that issue to drive a wedge between Washington and its allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would anticipate that the Russians and Chinese will try to dissuade our
European allies from endorsing or embracing the project, to try to find
weaknesses and differences of opinion and try to exploit those,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he nonetheless remained hopeful of winning Russian agreement to
amend the ABM treaty to permit deployment of a national missile defense. If the
Russians did not agree to such changes, the Clinton administration will be faced
with the choice of withdrawing from the Cold War-era treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is scheduled to decide this summer whether to commit the
United States to deploying a missile defense. The earliest it could be operating
would be 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, accompanied by his wife, Janet, was in Munich to attend a weekend
conference on European security. Among the expected topics of discussion among
government officials and private security experts is the U.S. missile defense
plan, as well as lessons learned from NATO's war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen was scheduled to deliver a speech to the Munich conference on Saturday
and hold separate meetings with his Italian and German counterparts. He said he
intended to raise with the Europeans the problem of a time and money lag in
building up police and other civilian institutions in Kosovo. The slow pace of
civilian reconstruction is putting an undue strain on the U.S. peacekeeping
troops there, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message is coming in very loud and clear from the (U.S. Congress) that
European members must make their contributions'' as originally promised, Cohen
said. ``Otherwise we're going to have a successful military campaign and then
have the mission ultimately fail for lack of civilian implementation.''

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s embattled chief executive Jill Barad resigned
Thursday after coming under fire for months for failing to revive falling sales
and profits at the world's biggest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure comes as the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a steep
loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third
time in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad, 48, one of the highest ranking women in business, was under intense
pressure from investors and Mattel's board of directors to explain big losses at
the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and other
troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership roles, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares, which surged 14 percent Wednesday on speculation that Barad
was on her way out, gained 12 1/2 cents more as of 5:15 p.m. EST Thursday to
$11.93 3/4 for the New York Stock Exchange-listed company. Word of the
resignation came in the final moments of trading on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
	   In after-hours trading on Instinet, however, shares had fallen to $10.75.
Disappointing results have pushed Mattel's stock down by more than 60 percent
from its 52-week high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. With a flashy style and an aggressive marketing
savvy, Barad helped make Mattel into the dominant toymaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others are Andrea
Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Learning Company lost $183 million in the quarter and $206
million for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel said that it is reviewing the Mattel Interactive division, which
includes the Learning Company, and upon completion of that review, the company
will undertake a restructuring program and will take a restructuring charge of
between $75 million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's day-to-day operations will be managed by a newly formed office
of the chief operating officer, comprised of executives who manage Mattel's
major brands. That team will report to Loeb.
</P>
<P>
	   Loeb, a lawyer, has been a member of Mattel's board since 1970. Rollnick,
who is retired as chairman and a director from Genstar Rental Electronics, has
been on the board since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Mattel lost $86.35 million, or 21 cents a share, compared
with earnings of $198 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period a year
ago. Sales for the year were $5.5 billion, down from $5.62 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Prairie Dog Is Threatened  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said the black-tailed prairie
dog warrants protection as a threatened species but stopped short Thursday of
imposing politically controversial restrictions on developers and ranchers while
states work on ways to preserve the rodent.
</P>
<P>
	   A pest to many but a beloved critter to others, the prairie dog will be
added to a list of candidates for threatened status under the Endangered Species
Act and its status will be reviewed annually.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fish and Wildlife Service said it is dealing with too many other
plants and wildlife that are in more danger, such as the lynx and mountain
plover, to take on protecting the prairie dog.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The black-tailed prairie dog is a very resilient species. It's handled a
lot over the years,'' said Pete Gober, an agency biologist who led a yearlong
study of the prairie dog. ``Hopefully we'll be able to work with those states to
avoid the necessity of listing the species.''
</P>
<P>
	   Colonies of prairie dogs, so named because of the barking sound that they
make, once were found on as many as 100 million acres from Canada to Mexico, but
the animal has been decimated by disease, eradication programs and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   Biologists don't know how many prairie dogs there are but say their habitat
has been reduced to about a million acres.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight Western states -- Arizona, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas and Wyoming -- have agreed to come up with a plan by next year for
monitoring and protecting the animal. Colorado, where the prairie dog is
particularly controversial, and North Dakota are considering their own plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fish and Wildlife Service's annual reviews will look at how the prairie
dog is doing and whether it should be removed from the candidate list or moved
up in priority.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has already proposed several species for listing as endangered or
threatened in the region, including the lynx, mountain plover and Colorado
butterfly plant. Endangered status means that a species is in danger of
extinction; threatened status means it could become endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Wildlife Federation, which had petitioned for listing of the
black-tailed prairie dog, said it will work with the states on protection
measures. Among other things, the group wants states to classify the prairie dog
as wildlife, not a pest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision sends an important signal from the federal government that
the prairie dog's plight is dire and that serious changes must be made in the
way we manage it,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest threat to the prairie dog is a form of the bubonic plague that
can wipe out entire colonies, the Fish and Wildlife Service study said. The
animals have no immunity to the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The plague is now widespread through much of the prairie dog's historic
range with the exception of most of South Dakota and portions of Kansas,
Nebraska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It is no coincidence that four of the seven
largest remaining colonies of the animals are in South Dakota, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the decision say the prairie dog isn't in any danger and that
putting it on the candidate list could lower property values because of the
possibility of future restrictions. Prairie dogs burrow extensive tunnel
networks, killing grass and destroying hay fields, and in recent years they have
become a nuisance near Denver and other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any rancher or farmer can tell you that this is one of the most hardy
species on the face of the earth,'' said Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo. ``No matter
how hard you try to eradicate them they keep coming back in greater numbers.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gary Skiba, a biologist for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, said the
Fish and Wildlife Service's decision not to immediately list the prairie dog
gives federal and state officials ``some breathing room to do some things to
rectify problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have put a moratorium on
poisoning prairie dogs on the grazing lands that they manage.

<HEADLINE> Has old DMV privatization encouraged auto 'title laundering'?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - As Gov. Christie Whitman struggles with the
problems caused by her decision to use a private firm to conduct auto
inspections formerly operated by state workers, the governor's first effort at
motor vehicle privatization is also coming under fire.
<P>
	   State officials said Thursday they have stepped up efforts to cut down on
automobile "title laundering." But they played down published comments from the
nation's leading expert on odometer fraud that New Jersey has become an emerging
mecca for dishonest auto brokers since Whitman switched nearly two dozen DMV
offices to private control four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Morse, chief of odometer fraud investigations for the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told The Star-Ledger of Newark that motor
vehicle offices are so lax in spotting altered documents that fraud rings from
around the Northeast use this state to pass off forged vehicle titles.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Jersey has become a title-laundering state," Morse told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, on Thursday said Morse was ill and not available for comment.
Hurd would not comment about Morse's remarks, only saying that "such fraud cases
are a difficult problem for consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Morse told the newspaper that since the state turned over about two dozen
Motor Vehicles offices to private operators in 1995, New Jersey no longer had a
uniform system of detecting sham vehicle documents. Another two dozen stations
were already under private control when Whitman took her action.
</P>
<P>
	   Out-of-state wholesale used car dealers from throughout the Northeast now
use New Jersey DMV offices to obtain new titles reflecting altered odometer
readings. It is happening because the newly privatized DMV staffs have been lax
in spotting forged titles from other states, Morse said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when staffers have rejected a title, the dealers sometimes just take
the document to another DMV office until one accepts it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vehicles can be sold for thousands of dollars more after crooks fraudulently
change mileage readings, especially if the figure is reduced by 100,000 miles.
Laundering, in the case of titles, means that a new title reflects the lower
reading. Therefore, anyone who buys the vehicle is handed a state government
document confirming a false count.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators have targeted five major New Jersey wholesale auto
dealers suspected of laundering more than 1,000 titles annually, the newspaper
reported, citing law enforcement sources it did not name.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they are aware of such problems, but deny that
conditions are worse in New Jersey than in other states, or that Whitman's
privatization is to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   "We reject the notion that privatization is somehow to blame for title fraud
problems," said Department of Transportation spokesman John Dourgarian. "The
controls that were in place before privatization remain in place after
privatization. This is a national problem, and we recognize that."
</P>
<P>
	   Dourgarian said federal officials had not provided statistics to back up any
claims that title fraud is worse in New Jersey, or that it became worse after
the DMV offices were privatized. However, he also could provide no statistics
that would dispute the claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the state has recently taken action to look into such problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A New Jersey State Police unit has begun a major investigation of fraudulent
odometer readings and titles.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always going to be individuals who attempt to wash licenses or
registrations, who attempt to get documents that they cannot get normally
through the legitimate process," said State Police spokesman John Hagerty.
"These are not new scenarios. But certainly the State Police response is due to
the recognition of a problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Dourgarian said DMV officials have instituted new rules. He said beginning
this month, used-car dealers presenting out-of-state titles are no longer able
to get new titles over the counter. From now on, new titles will be mailed after
officials review the old title closely. He said DMV officials will improve
training.
</P>
<P>
	   The Whitman administration is currently struggling with problems with long
lines after privatizing centralized inspection lanes. The privatization of the
two dozen DMV offices several years ago was bitterly opposed by state employee
unions. Whitman then pitched it as an example of "smaller, smarter government."

<HEADLINE> Money flows early in Senate race, Giuliani criticizes first lady's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attacked Hillary
Rodham Clinton's air travel on Thursday, saying newly released campaign finance
records show the first lady has not fully reimbursed taxpayers for her travel on
Air Force jets she uses while campaigning.
<P>
	   The Clinton camp paid the federal government $34,000 for dozens of trips to
New York in recent months related to her U.S. Senate campaign, the records show.
Giuliani's campaign said that is well below the actual costs of travel.
Estimates place the cost of Air Force C-20's, like the one Clinton uses to
travel to New York, at about $20,000 per trip.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like that deal," Giuliani said in Brooklyn. "If you can get that deal
for you and your family, take it, because Disneyland, here I come!"
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign is required by law to reimburse the government at the
rate of first-class commercial travel, spokesman Howard Wolfson has said. The
Secret Service advised the first lady to continue to use government jets for her
travel for security reasons, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the fact that he's running his campaign out of City Hall at taxpayer
expense it's hard to take his latest tantrum seriously," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The voluminous campaign reports, which run thousands of pages and together
measure more than a foot high, also showed that both candidates spent a huge
amount on direct-mail fund-raising efforts. Giuliani, whose mailers have taken
shots at the first lady by calling her "leader of the ultra-left wing," spent
about $1.3 million on six Virginia-based companies for direct-mail services. The
largest amount, more than $800,000, went to American Target Advertising, a
Manassas, Va.-based firm. It is operated by Richard Viguerie, who is renowned
for his fund raising on behalf of conservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spent more $500,000 on direct mailing of her own and close to $1
million on political and fund-raising consultants.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Clinton raised $8 million over six months and has $4.7 million
cash on hand. She spent $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani took in $8.8 million in the last six months, which combined with
the money he had already raised brought him to $11.5 million. He has $7.4
million cash on hand and he spent $4.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual donors to each candidate read like a who's who list. In a sign of
the clear national interest in the race, contributions poured in from all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew heavily from Hollywood types - Tom Cruise, Sean "Puffy" Combs,
Barbara Streisand and Tom Hanks were among her contributors. Also donating to
the maximum $2,000 to Clinton's campaign was Walter Kaye, a Whitewater grand
jury witness who recommended Monica Lewinsky for her job as a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's donor list was a bit less star-studded but contained business
heavyweights such as General Electric Chairman Jack Welch and Revlon billionaire
Ronald Perelman.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns benefitted from political action committees that can give up
to $10,000. Giuliani received $245,311 and Clinton $219,925.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani received lots of checks from the financial services industry which
call New York City home, including Arthur Anderson, Chase Manhattan, Keycorp and
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. He also took in a hefty amount of cash from the
pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Glaxo Wellcome all
contributed thousands of dollars. Log Cabin Republicans, a group supporting gays
in the GOP, gave Giuliani the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor, who had supported an unsuccessful attempt to have gambling on
Governor's Island, also drew large contributions from the gambling industry on a
fund-raising jaunt to Las Vegas. Mirage Resorts donated $9,870 and Harrah's
chipped in $2,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Through leadership committees, Republican lawmakers also padded Giuliani's
bank accounts. Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato gave the mayor $2,000.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott gave him $1,000 and Republican National
Senatorial Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell chipped in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of Clinton's PAC money came from a laundry list of unions. Giving
the maximum $10,000 were the Amalgamated Transit Union, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communication Workers of America. Also
contributing were the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees; the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Letter Carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Association of Trial Lawyers also gave Clinton the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democratic lawmakers donating to Clinton's campaign were
Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, who gave $1,000 and New York Reps. Gary
Ackerman and Carolyn Maloney, who each donated $1,000. Clinton has held fund
raisers for both New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Giuliani and Clinton campaigns got money from General Electric and
Ernst and Young. GE gave $4,225 to Giuliani and $2,500 to Clinton. Ernst and
Young gave $10,000 to each.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is set to formally enter the Senate race Sunday and kick off her
campaign with a tour around the state. It is unclear when Giuliani will
officially enter the race.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Head Warns on Corruption  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- World Bank President James Wolfensohn warned a
gathering of financial ministers Thursday not to ignore the lessons of last
year's protests in Seattle, pointing in particular to Latin America's poverty
and corruption,
</P>
<P>
	   Finance ministers from across the Americas here for an economic summit
continued to offer strong support for free trade, and International Monetary
Fund managing director Michel Camdessus forecast a growth rate of nearly 4
percent for Latin America this year, "almost one point above our projections a
year ago."
</P>
<P>
	   But Wolfensohn told the 34 ministers gathered in this Mexican resort town
that they can't afford to ignore underlying social problems that limit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests during the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle were
"not something which is just a group of radicals that have been pulled together
from a training camp to come and disrupt our meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is something that is playing on the fears of people. Without
addressing the issue of poverty, there is no way we can have long-term growth
because social instability will kill it."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfensohn said progress has occurred on several fronts: Life expectancy in
the region has grown to 69 years from 60 years in 1970; literacy is at 88
percent; infant mortality has fallen from 84 to 31 deaths per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the "persistent problem of poverty" remains a challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the last 20 years, the number of poor has risen by 40 million to 175
million, equaling 36 percent of the total population, he said. Of those, 15
percent live in extreme poverty, unable to afford even a basic daily diet.
</P>
<P>
	   The poverty rate is 80 percent among the region's 30 million indigenous
people, who are concentrated in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.
"This is not a record that any of us is proud of," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To address the problem, Wolfensohn said governments can no longer think only
in terms of money, but must systematically work with churches, non-governmental
organizations, trade unions and the private sector. The "inner resources" of the
poor also must be put to use, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased trade is also a solution, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must not let radicals in Seattle scare us from the task of adjusting to
globalization and giving greater opportunities to our people," Wolfensohn said.

<HEADLINE> Whale researchers propose new gear over fishermen's objections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Tired of watching right whales die from fishing gear
entanglements, several prominent whale researchers are pushing for new
mammal-friendly fishing technology.
<P>
	   Fishermen and lobstermen, however, say the proposals are unrealistic and
unworkable - another onerous burden for an already struggling industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the collision between two endangered species - the fishermen of the
New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts and the right whale, both clearly in a
precarious position," said Charles "Stormy" Mayo, a whale specialist at the
Center for Coastal Studies and one of the authors of a report calling for new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   With an estimated population between 300 and 350, the right whale is
hovering close to extinction. Researchers at Woods Hole have predicted the
species could be wiped out in 191 years if nothing improves.
</P>
<P>
	   With a population this small, the right whale can't afford to lose any
animals to unnatural deaths. But in the last year alone, three of the
slow-moving mammals have perished, almost certainly from man-made reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Staccato, a longtime favorite of whale researchers, died last summer after
colliding with a ship. And two other whales, known by numbers rather than names,
are believed to have died after becoming entangled in gear.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them perished off the New Jersey coast in October. She was virtually
cut in half by fishing line that dug into her bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Another dead female was spotted off Rhode Island last month. She was seen
with fishing gear wrapped around her, but scientists can't say for certain what
killed her because her carcass was never found.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers know of 31 entanglements since 1970, at least three of which
were fatal. Eleven other entanglements were believed to have contributed to
death. The New England Aquarium estimates 62 percent of right whales have scars
indicating fishing gear entanglements.
</P>
<P>
	   A task force was convened by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1997
to try to reduce the number of right whale fatalities due to fishing gear. (The
agency has little control over the shipping industry.)
</P>
<P>
	   In the last two years, however, little has changed to improve the right
whale's plight, said Sharon Young, a marine mammal consultant with the Humane
Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Young, Mayo and others who devote their lives to right whales submitted a
series of proposed regulations to the NMFS committee last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those regulations would absolutely close down the commercial fishery," said
Bonnie Spinazzola, executive director of the Atlantic Offshore Lobsterman's
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, she said, lobstermen wouldn't comply with such "unrealistic"
regulations "and that would do no good for the whales whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the proposals:
</P>
<P>
	   - Eliminate the vertical fishing lines used for lobster buoys and gill nets
that trap groundfish such as cod, flounder and skate.
</P>
<P>
	   - Use lighter lines that will break apart at 200 pounds or dissolve over
time if wrapped around a whale.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen, however, said a strong wave would break apart such a weak line.
</P>
<P>
	   - Develop gear retrieval devices, similar to automatic garage door openers,
that will rise to the surface when lobstermen are in place to pull up their
traps.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad-hoc task force set a time frame of five years.
</P>
<P>
	   "These animals are in deep trouble," Young said. "There needs to be some
action."
</P>
<P>
	   The report, she said, was meant to be a wake-up call, not a command to
fishermen to change.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen aren't seeing it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is that the technology is not available," said Dick Allen, a
Rhode Island lobsterman.
</P>
<P>
	   One Portsmouth, N.H., fisherman, who wouldn't give his name, said whale
entanglement isn't serious enough to burden fishermen with more new regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the problem with this whole system - all the laws and regulations
that they're (imposing) on the fishermen here are based on ignorance," the
36-year-old said. "Everything they do is costing us money."

<HEADLINE> Navy To Keep Control Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the Navy detained a Russian oil tanker in the
Persian Gulf, the Clinton administration disclosed Thursday that it has been in
contact with Russian officials for almost a month about the smuggling of Iraqi
oil in violation of the U.N. economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker called attention to what the administration
described as a recent mushrooming of illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports
average 100,000 barrels a day, compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil
prices were much lower, said State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
	   These exports are separate from the carefully controlled, U.N.-approved
Iraqi oil sales that pay for food, medicine and other humanitarian items for the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and allied ships are tightening enforcement of the U.N. embargo to
counteract a surge in Iraqi oil smuggling, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian vessels increasingly have been involved, there is no immediate
indication of a direct connection to the Russian government, Cohen said in an
interview en route to Munich, Germany, where he will attend a weekend conference
on European security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates by the
guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said cooperation from the
ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force (MIF)
that enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the MIF has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the MIF's suspicions
regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians told U.S. officials that the ship is privately owned and that a
Russian investigation is under way, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say whether the issue arose this week in Moscow when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with acting Russian President
Alexander Putin and other officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that if the oil is found to
have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would request permission from an
Emirates port to dock the ship and dispose of the contraband oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The normal procedure would be for the contraband to be sold, with the
profits used partly to offset the costs of the nation that agrees to take the
vessel and partly to pay for the MIF operation, Quigley said.

<P>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- Poverty and corruption will continue to impede
economic growth in Latin American unless governments take much stronger steps to
help the poor, the World Bank president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   James Wolfensohn warned the 34 ministers, who are gathered for an economic

	   The region's income distribution is the worst in the world, he said, with
the poorest 20 percent earning 4.5 percent of wealth. The figure is 5.2 percent
in Africa, and 8.8 percent in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.

	   ``We compare very badly,'' Wolfensohn said.

nongovernmental organizations, trade unions and the private sector. The ``inner

Seattle scare us from the task of adjusting to globalization and giving greater

forecast a growth rate of nearly 4 percent for Latin America this year, ``almost

<HEADLINE> Judge rules out-of-state trash restrictions unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Laws to curb the flow of out-of-state garbage into
Virginia are an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce, a federal
judge ruled Thursday.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge James Spencer invalidated the laws, which had been
challenged by Houston-based Waste Management Inc. The laws were to take effect
July 1, but Spencer issued in injunction in June putting them on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer ruled that the laws violate the constitutional provision that says
only Congress can regulate commerce between states. Attorney General Mark Earley
said the state will appeal the decision to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   The new laws would have capped landfill growth, banned garbage barges from
three state rivers, prohibited barge facilities from receiving municipal waste
and more tightly regulated trash trucks on Virginia highways.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 General Assembly passed the laws at the urging of Gov. Jim Gilmore,
who was alarmed by a report that Virginia ranked second only to Pennsylvania in
the amount of trash it receives from other states. After learning that New York
City intended to increase the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) it was
sending to Virginia, Gilmore declared that "the home state of Washington,
Jefferson and Madison has no intention of becoming New York's dumping grounds."
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer cited Gilmore's comments and remarks by legislators in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "The record demonstrates that Virginia acted to staunch the importation of
MSW in a knee-jerk response to reports that increased levels of out-of-state MSW
would soon be flowing into the Commonwealth, which - while perhaps advantageous
politically, or commendable socially - is impermissible constitutionally," he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Earley said the language of the statutes, not political rhetoric, should
ultimately determine the fate of the statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "The key is what the law says, not what someone said on the House floor or
at a news conference," Earley said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the judge's ruling, Gilmore again made it clear that other states'
trash was the target of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all very concerned at the increasing amounts of out-of-state trash
streaming into the Commonwealth and we will continue our efforts to restrict
such imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But state Sen. Bill Bolling, R-Hanover and chief sponsor of the legislation,
said the legislature "tried hard to make certain that this legislation did not
discriminate between in-state and out-of-state waste imports."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Spencer's decision "effectively prevents any state that receives
waste imports from another state from adopting a comprehensive solid waste
management program, for no such program can be implemented without having an
indirect impact on waste imports. Surely this was not the intent of the Commerce
Clause."
</P>
<P>
	   John Skoutelas, eastern region vice president and general counsel for Waste
Management, said the company was pleased with the ruling and remained committed
"to the protection of the environment and the citizens of Virginia."

<HEADLINE> Fox Reaches Agreement on Ethnicity  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Seven months after the NAACP threatened lawsuits and
boycotts over the lack of minorities on TV series, Fox and CBS became the last
major broadcasters to sign commitments to make the picture more ethnically
diverse.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been a long, arduous process," Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The
agreements will bring "real, meaningful, lasting change," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fox and CBS will add executives in charge of diversity who will
implement and monitor network efforts, it was announced at separate news
conferences held by the NAACP and other civil rights groups that took part in
the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   The network agreements, much like those signed by NBC and ABC last month,
focus on changes in minority representation throughout the companies -- both
on-screen and off. Minority recruitment will be considered in executive job
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel it's enormously important, it's very good for business, and most of
all it's the right thing to do," Fox Entertainment President Doug Herzog said of
his network's initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   Leslie Moonves, CBS Television president and chief executive officer, said
the CBS agreement reflected commitments he made in November at a Los Angeles
hearing on diversity held by the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not only putting it in writing, we're putting our money where our
mouth is," Moonves said, citing such programs as the upcoming Latino Grammy
Awards and the drama series "City of Angels," with many black writers and a
largely black cast.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS promised to increase the number of development deals with minority
writers, producers and "other talent for the 2000 fall season and beyond."
</P>
<P>
	   Like the Fox agreement, the CBS pact was virtually devoid of numbers that
might provide measurements of success. But the network executives said they were
committed to the effort -- and Mfume said biannual evaluations were planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a matter of having come a long, long way, but of still having a
long way to go," Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
	   The end result, Mfume said, should be creation of television that consumers
can feel good about and new opportunities in the entertainment industry for men
and women of color.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most criticism was directed at the four major broadcast networks,
Mfume said he hoped cable channels and other broadcasters would use the
agreements as a basis for self-examination and change.
</P>
<P>
	   The networks opened negotiations with civil rights groups after the NAACP
last summer floated the threat of a TV boycott or legal action because of the
lack of minority actors on the fall 1999 schedule of new shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In the spring, Mfume said the coalition intends to expand its focus to
include the motion picture industry. He expects conversations with studio heads
to be held after coalition members have had a chance to evaluate their goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Attending news conferences at the Fox studio lot and at CBS' offices were
representatives of the National Latino Media Council, the Asian Pacific American
Media Coalition, and American Indians in Film and Television.

<HEADLINE> Revised Dietary Guidelines for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eat, drink and be merry -- in moderation.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposed new dietary guidelines released by the government Thursday describe
eating as ``one of life's greatest pleasures,'' while urging Americans to avoid
too much saturated fat, sugars, salt or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines, developed by a panel of 11 nutrition experts, do not make
any major changes in current recommendations. But, for the first time, they
include special sections on whole grains and food safety and expanded advice on
weight control.
</P>
<P>
	   They also attempt a more upbeat approach -- for example, urging consumers to
``be flexible and adventurous'' in selecting foods -- and offer more specific
choices of foods and ways to prepare them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since there are many foods and many ways to build a healthy diet and
lifestyle, there is lots of room for choice,'' according to the introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research. Federally funded
nutrition programs are required to adhere to the recommendations, which also are
used widely by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services will seek
public comment on the revised version before making it final later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new guidelines include some subtle changes in wording meant to make it
easier for consumers to adhere to the maximum recommended fat intake while
emphasizing that consumers should cut down on the saturated fats found in meat
and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
	   The current guidelines on fat recommend people follow a diet low in total
fat. The new recommendation is for a diet that is ``moderate in total fat,'' but
low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they're trying to do is come up with wording that is positive and has
some degree of hope,'' said Cyndi Thompson, a nutrition expert at the University
of Arizona who was not involved in writing the guidelines. ``They're trying to
say: be moderate, be sensible, that all foods can fit into a healthy diet, you
just can't overconsume.''
</P>
<P>
	   The meat industry does not like the change in wording, fearing it will put a
stigma on beef and pork.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's a real unfair implication,'' said Al Tank, chief executive
officer of the National Pork Producers Council. ``The implication is that you
should avoid all foods of animal origin.''
</P>
<P>
	   Research by the food industry indicates consumers are put off by the term
low-fat and see a moderate-fat diet as easier to follow, even if the fat content
is the same. The recommended maximum fat intake still is 30 percent of total
calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000 calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities say the advisory
committee that wrote the revision is biased toward the meat and dairy
industries. The groups filed suit to block the government from using the
guidelines but a judge refused last week to block the committee's work from
being released.

<HEADLINE> New Judge in Starr Complaints  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A new federal judge was assigned Thursday to hear
complaints against former Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr, but his name was
withheld until he has a chance to review the case file.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment by Judge Roger L. Wollman, chief judge for the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, came after his previous appointee stepped down barely
two weeks into the assignment because he said his impartiality might be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   James McCormick, chief clerk for the Eastern District of Arkansas, said the
new judge serves within the jurisdiction of the 8th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't want me to release his name before he's had a chance to see the
file,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaints arose from Starr's investigation of President Clinton and his
wife. All federal judges in Little Rock removed themselves from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut attorney Francis T. Mandanici and two former Starr targets,
Stephen A. Smith and Julie Hiatt Steele, challenged Starr's prosecution of
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal and Starr's testimony before the U.S. House
Judiciary Committee on President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Among their allegations is that Starr wanted McDougal to give false
testimony against the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Prices Snag Low-cost Oil Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Citizens Energy, the nonprofit organization founded by Joseph
P. Kennedy II to provide low-cost heating oil to the poor, has been forced by
high oil prices to stop taking orders, the group announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "During the last week of the heating oil crisis, we have fielded what would
be almost a month's worth of requests under normal conditions," the group said
in a statement. "As of today, Citizens Energy will be clearing a backlog of
thousands of deliveries before we take new ones on."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the beginning of January, the average retail price of a gallon of
heating oil in the region has risen from about 99 cents per gallon to more than
$1.70 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens' customers pay 40 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, a former congressman, called for increased funding for the federal
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and he urged that
government require oil dealers to have minimum inventories on hand to avoid
price spikes during cold weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens has helped more than 8,300 Massachusetts households receive
discounted oil this winter.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Will Oppose FTC on Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By DAN JOLING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JUNEAU (AP) -- Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles said Thursday the state will go to
court to oppose a Federal Trade Commission decision to block the proposed merger
of BP Amoco and Arco.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC commissioners voted 3-2 on Wednesday to reject the merger and told its
staff to ask the courts to block the $30 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Knowles said that he and other top state officials had closely reviewed the
FTC position and found it to be flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   Prevailing FTC commissioners say the new company would have too much control
over Alaska oil production and that the merger could lead to higher gasoline
prices in California and other West Coast states.
</P>
<P>
	   Knowles said a merger agreement signed between the companies and the state
in December would ensure competition on the North Slope. He said there was no
indication that the merger would lead to higher West Coast gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "The world market clearly drives the oil price," Knowles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Knowles said uncertainty over the merger is continuing to harm the Alaska
economy and threatening the nation's oil supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Knowles said the company that acquires the assets that BP Amoco is forced to
sell would immediately become of the country's top 10 oil producers.
</P>
<P>
	   In its decision, the FTC said BP Amoco has used Alaska oil exports to
restrict supply to the West Coast and keep prices artificially high.
</P>
<P>
	   But state Attorney General Bruce Botelho said a recent General Accounting
Office study, ordered by federal legislation that lifted the ban on export of
Alaska oil, found no effect on the California market connected to exports.
</P>
<P>
	   Botelho said the request for a preliminary injunction could be argued in the
next two or three months and a decision could follow a month after that.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Suspend Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Embarking on a risky strategy to save the
peace process, Britain warned Thursday that it will strip power from Northern
Ireland's new Protestant-Catholic administration unless the IRA quickly pledges
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson announced he would introduce a
bill Friday that within days would allow London to reclaim the substantial
authority it handed nine weeks ago to the province's four-party Cabinet. But the
process could be stopped if the situation changes, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis threatens the new administration that has given Northern Ireland
a measure of local rule after years of direct rule by Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the coalition powerless would increase the chances it could
survive. Protestants have otherwise threatened to resign their posts over the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson appealed for the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, to
be patient as the British and Irish governments spend the next week trying to
persuade the IRA to announce publicly that it will scrap its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord made disarmament and the
Cabinet's survival ``interdependent,'' he declared: ``We cannot partially
implement the Good Friday agreement. It is all or it is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson emphasized he would be extremely reluctant to suspend the
administration's powers, which would also mean suspending policy-coordinating
committees between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, another important
plank of the agreement. But he said that might be the only way ``to preserve
them from collapse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern met with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in Cornwall, southwest England, to tell about his daylong
discussions in Dublin with officials of the IRA and its allied Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
	   After two hours of talks, Ahern said that some progress had been made with
the IRA, but ``we haven't made enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   In November, as part of an American-brokered deal, the Ulster Unionists
dropped their demand for IRA disarmament before the Cabinet's formation and
accepted Sinn Fein into two of the 12 posts -- but in expectation that the IRA
would finally start disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   To win over skeptical colleagues, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble even
promised he would resign this month as the Cabinet's senior minister if the IRA
wasn't delivering on its end of the bargain. He backed that promise up by
drafting a resignation letter and scheduling an internal party meeting for Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA did agree to meet Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, chairman of the
province's disarmament commission. But the general's report has confirmed that
no disarmament had taken place.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson indicated the IRA hadn't even said when, if ever, it would start,
although the accord expected total disarmament by May. This was ``simply
unacceptable, and a betrayal of the entire community in Northern Ireland,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA has defied years of pressure for a start to disarmament. The
outlawed group spent decades acquiring its tons of weaponry and has stored its
most sophisticated equipment in bunkers in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   In the IRA's most recent statement Tuesday, it insisted that its 1997
cease-fire ought to be sufficient proof of its peaceful intent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, speaking before Mandelson's announcement, said
that if the powers are taken away ``it will be difficult to put things back
together again, and (weapons) decommissioning -- which the unionists make such a
great fuss about -- is unlikely ever to be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to those sentiments, Mandelson said: ``Nobody wants to do
anything that will make decommissioning any harder to achieve. But there comes a
moment when we have to express our impatience, and indeed our intolerance, that
decommissioning is failing to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo neighbor describes gunshots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Bronx neighbor of Amadou Diallo testified Thursday
she heard a sudden burst of gunfire that was broken by a brief pause on the
morning Diallo died in a hail of 41 police bullets.
<P>
	   Taking the witness stand in the murder trial of four police officers, Debbie
Rivera told the jury she heard no voices before the shooting began. The officers
claim they ordered Diallo to stop.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shooting stopped, Rivera said she peered out the window to see a
distraught man - thought to be Officer Kenneth Boss - wearing a baseball cap and
a badge.
</P>
<P>
	   The man "took his hat and threw it in the street," then cursed, the
prosecution witness said. The defense later confronted her with an earlier
statement it said contradicted her account.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution appeared to use Rivera's testimony to try to show the
officers fired without warning and suggest they had an opportunity to realize
Diallo was not a threat. The officers allegedly continued pulling their triggers
even after the victim dropped to the floor of his apartment vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contends the gunfire from the officer's rapid-fire weapons was
continuous and lasted less than 10 seconds. It also claims Diallo - who was hit
19 times - stayed upright until the shooting stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was adjourned until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss, 28; Sean Carroll, 36; Edward McMellon, 27; and Richard Murphy, 27,
have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges in the slaying of Diallo,
22, an unarmed West African immigrant, shortly after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999.
If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protests to prompt an appeals court to move the case to
Albany, where it is being televised. The jury is made up of six men and six
women; eight of the jurors are white and four are black.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense alleges Diallo provoked the shooting by lurking around his front
door, ignoring orders to halt for questioning and pulling a black object out of
his pocket; the object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers were searching the neighborhood for violent
suspects at the time. They call Diallo's death a tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Other witnesses Thursday included a police lieutenant who arrived on the
scene minutes after the shooting, and one of Diallo's roommates.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Kevin Cantwell said he rushed to Diallo's block after hearing Boss call
for "a boss and a bus" - police parlance for a supervisor and an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Questioned by the defense, Cantwell described the officers as being stunned
and speechless, and the smell of gunpowder in the air. He found Carroll still
kneeling over Diallo's corpse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, 'Sean ... Sean ... Sean' - each time louder," Cantwell said. "He
didn't respond at all."
</P>
<P>
	   The roommate, Momodou Kujabi, said the last time he saw Diallo, the victim
was lying on their couch watching television. An hour later, police woke up
Kujabi and had him identify the body.
</P>
<P>
	   Kujabi dropped his head and gasped when prosecutor flashed Diallo's photo up
on a video screen. Sitting in the audience, Diallo's mother, Kadiatou appeared
to weep.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Rivera, 22, testified that she was changing her infant's diaper in
a second-floor bedroom when she noticed a burgundy car pull up the block. She
described four white men in street clothes getting out, then silently
approaching the Diallo front door "in slow motion."
</P>
<P>
	   The witness said she had moved away from the window when she said she heard
the blast. Asked to demonstrate the sound, Rivera rapidly tapped the witness
stand four or five times, paused perhaps one second, then resumed tapping
several more times.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, Rivera conceded the pause as "quick." She also
admitted that in an initial statement to police she described hearing about 30
shots in an unbroken succession.

<HEADLINE> Nursing-Home Chain To Pay $175M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home
chain, has agreed to pay $175 million and relinquish 10 of its nursing homes for
defrauding Medicare, the Justice Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the biggest settlement ever in a nursing home case, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arkansas-based company's California subsidiary agreed to plead guilty to
11 charges of submitting false bills to the government program between 1992 and
1998, federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Beverly inflated the number of hours nurses spent caring for
Medicare patients at 10 nursing homes in California and elsewhere, and submitted
phony nurse sign-in sheets and other fabricated documents to support the bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The subsidiary, Beverly-California, which entered the guilty plea, will pay
a $5 million criminal fine. The parent company will pay $170 million in a civil
settlement -- $25 million immediately, and the rest to be deducted from Medicare
reimbursements over eight years, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 homes to be divested are in California, Kansas, Washington, Georgia
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>

Dominick Todarello, who filed the first legal action in 1995. He will get 17

	   "This case should put the nursing home industry on notice that we will use

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;O Cruises To Spin Off Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam Navigation Co. said Thursday
that it will spin off its cruise business as a new London-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   If shareholders approve, P&AMP;O hopes to complete formation of the new company
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement is the latest step in a four-year restructuring of the
company, which has previously floated its Bovis Homes subsidiary and sold its
property portfolio.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company will include P&AMP;O Cruises, based in Britain; Princess Cruises
which operates in Alaska, Europe and the Caribbean, and the German cruise
company Aida Cruises. The new cruise company will be listed on both the London
and New York stock exchanges, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts estimated the new company could have a market value as much as $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ratcliffe, now president of Princess Cruises, will assume executive
responsibility for P&AMP;O's cruises division and will become chief executive of the
new company, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lord Sterling, the chairman of P&AMP;O, will also chair the new company.
</P>
<P>
	   "The de-merger we are announcing today ... will enable both businesses to
pursue the strategies that best meet their long term objectives and to
accelerate their future growth," Sterling said.

<HEADLINE> State GOP leaders surrender on anti-McCain effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, George W. Bush's top New York
backer, waved the white flag of surrender Thursday in the battle to keep John
McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   "I believe that John McCain should be on the ballot," Pataki said in a
statement. "This should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not
technicalities. I'm confident that George Bush will win that campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush praised any move to allow his chief rival to compete on ballots
statewide in New York, although it would give McCain another shot at competing
head to head with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the right decision. I welcome it," Bush told reporters after
campaigning in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who held a news conference in front of the Russia Embassy to
denounce the "Stalinist politics" of the New York Republican Party, joked of
Pataki: "I'll never call him comrade again."
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator was campaigning in South Carolina, where he's angling to
beat Bush in that state's Feb. 19 primary in order to maintain his momentum
after his stunning victory over Bush in New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   With growing signs that New York's GOP hierarchy was ready to buckle, McCain
had sent letters to Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers earlier
Thursday calling for them to "do the right thing for New York Republicans."
</P>
<P>
	   "The system that is responsible for this sad situation cannot be defended
any longer," McCain wrote. "It is an embarrassment to a wonderful state, a
disappointment to a proud party and an affront to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, appearing in Dover, Del., had said, "Put him on the ballot. If the
judge decides he should be on the ballot, let him be on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The shift came after Bush, stung by McCain's big New Hampshire primary win
Tuesday and unhappy about handing McCain an issue tailor-made for his "outsider"
campaign, signaled his New York supporters their fight to keep McCain off
primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's congressional district had
gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, top New York Republicans were told that Bush would prefer his
supporters not appeal if McCain won a federal court challenge to open up the New
York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case said Thursday that no ruling would be issued before
Monday, at the earliest. Lawyers on both sides said they expect it to be a
victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that if the judge happened to rule
against McCain, Pataki was then ready to "take the appropriate steps to ensure
that (McCain) is on the ballot." Mucha said she could not elaborate on what
those steps would be.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign director, Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, said he was pleased with Pataki's move, but called it "too little, too
late." The former congressman said, "they've hurt Governor Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   But Mucha said, "We believe McCain is hiding behind the issue of ballot
access ... When ballot access is off the table, it's clear he has nothing to
talk about in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   There was talk Thursday that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case and the delay until
Monday for a possible court ruling seemed in line with that.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said he knew nothing about that. While there was no immediate
comment from Powers, one of his lawyers, Lawrence Mandelker, said, "there
obviously is enormous political pressure for a settlement. I'm not involved in
those discussions. They are several pay grades above me, as we used to say in
the military."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized the Texas governor for not calling off the
effort to block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary
because he lacked enough petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush runningmate, had also come
under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they're smart, they just throw open the door and let McCain come
crashing through now," Nelson Warfield, a veteran political operative who worked
on Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's Governor Pataki trying to build a national image and now he runs the
risk of being seen as that governor who's pro-choice on abortion and anti-choice
for president," Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in the wake of McCain's New Hampshire victory, New York Republicans who
backed Bush are getting nervous, Republican operative Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of people in the last 24 hours not sleeping well on the
Republican side in New York," Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
district. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you sow, so shall you reap," McCain supporter Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> 'Black Box' Search Is in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Scuba divers searched the ocean off this coastal
city Thursday for the ``black boxes'' of Kenya Airways Flight 431, which crashed
moments after takeoff this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivorian and French search teams detected the signals of both the flight data
recorder and the voice recorder on Wednesday and returned to the site the
following afternoon to try to recover them.
</P>
<P>
	   Divers said electronic equipment they need to carry out the dives was
interfering with the signals from the black box transmitters. The interference
was making it difficult to pinpoint the devices, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   After diving past darkness, they halted operations until the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Technical Director Steve Clarke, speaking in Nairobi, Kenya,
said wreckage of the main fuselage was in 200 feet of water, about a mile off
shore.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310 with 179 people on board, crashed just minutes
after taking off Sunday night from Felix Houphouet-Boigny International Airport
for Lagos, Nigeria. Ten people survived and 86 bodies have been recovered.

<HEADLINE> 10 Dead in Bogota Prison Shootout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At least 10 inmates died in a violent shootout
between prisoners in Bogota on Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were attempting to restore order at the La Picota federal
penitentiary, prisons spokeswoman Rocio Devia said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloody outbreak appeared to be a turf war between prisoners in two wards
housing a mix of leftist guerrillas, common criminals and drug traffickers,
Devia added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gang fights are common in the South American country's filthy and
overcrowded prisons. Guns and knives are easily smuggled past corrupt guards.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 prisoners have been killed and about 900 have escaped from
Colombian prisons since 1997, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, an explosion in a neighborhood grocery store in the western
city of Cali killed four people and seriously injured six others.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had ventured no theory as to who planted the explosive or why.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students Charged in Skirmish  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Prosecutors have filed criminal charges against 174
radical student leaders of a strike that has shuttered Latin America's largest
university for the last nine months, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers face a variety of charges -- including rioting, sabotage,
terrorism and assault -- stemming from a Tuesday skirmish in which they fought
anti-strike students and security forces at a university-affiliated high school.
Some could be sentenced to as many as 40 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The students and 76 minors also arrested Tuesday were being detained. Fellow
strikers, who remain in control of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico's huge main campus, have added the release of their comrades to their
list of demands for ending the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The minors' fate has yet to be decided. They are being held at a juvenile
detention facility and cannot be charged as adults, but they could be sent to
reform facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, prosecutors requested arrest warrants for another 430 members
of leftist ``community groups'' who have joined student strikers in occupying
the sprawling main campus, local media reported. Prosecutors said they want to
arrest the leftists on illegal-occupation charges. It was unclear whether courts
would grant the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike at the university began in April to protest the university's
plans to raise annual tuition from a few cents to $140. Administrators withdrew
the fee increase, but students later demanded sweeping policy changes. They
refuse to reopen the university until officials meet their demands for
guaranteed admissions and a loosening of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, University Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente called on strike
leaders to meet with university officials on Friday to lay out their conditions
for an immediate handover of the university.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the National Human Rights Commission was also to attend the
meeting. There was no immediate response from the strikers.

<HEADLINE> Diallo neighbor describes gunshots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Bronx neighbor of Amadou Diallo testified Thursday
she heard a sudden burst of gunfire that was broken by a brief pause on the
morning Diallo died in a hail of 41 police bullets.
<P>
	   Taking the witness stand in the murder trial of four police officers, Debbie
Rivera told the jury she heard no voices before the shooting began. The officers
claim they ordered Diallo to stop.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shooting stopped, Rivera said she peered out the window to see a
distraught man - thought by attorneys to be Officer Kenneth Boss - wearing a
baseball cap and a badge.
</P>
<P>
	   The man "took his hat and threw it in the street," then cursed, the
prosecution witness said. The defense later confronted her with an earlier
statement it said contradicted her account.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution appeared to use Rivera's testimony to try to show the
officers fired without warning and suggest they had an opportunity to realize
Diallo was not a threat. The officers allegedly continued pulling their triggers
even after the victim dropped to the floor of his apartment vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contends the gunfire from the officer's rapid-fire weapons was
continuous and lasted less than 10 seconds. It also claims Diallo - who was hit
19 times - stayed upright until the shooting stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was adjourned until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss, 28; Sean Carroll, 36; Edward McMellon, 27; and Richard Murphy, 27,
have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges in the slaying of Diallo,
22, an unarmed West African immigrant, shortly after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999.
If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protests to prompt an appeals court to move the case to
Albany, where it is being televised. The jury is made up of six men and six
women; eight of the jurors are white and four are black.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense alleges Diallo provoked the shooting by lurking around his front
door, ignoring orders to halt for questioning and pulling a black object out of
his pocket; the object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers were searching the neighborhood for violent
suspects at the time. They call Diallo's death a tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Other witnesses Thursday included a police lieutenant who arrived on the
scene minutes after the shooting, and one of Diallo's roommates.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Kevin Cantwell said he rushed to Diallo's block after hearing Boss call
for "a boss and a bus" - police parlance for a supervisor and an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Questioned by the defense, Cantwell described the officers as being stunned
and speechless, and the smell of gunpowder in the air. He found Carroll still
kneeling over Diallo's corpse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, 'Sean ... Sean ... Sean' - each time louder," Cantwell said. "He
didn't respond at all."
</P>
<P>
	   The roommate, Momodou Kujabi, said the last time he saw Diallo, the victim
was lying on their couch watching television. An hour later, police woke up
Kujabi and had him identify the body.
</P>
<P>
	   Kujabi dropped his head and gasped when prosecutor flashed Diallo's photo up
on a video screen. Sitting in the audience, Diallo's mother, Kadiatou appeared
to weep.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Rivera, 22, testified that she was changing her infant's diaper in
a second-floor bedroom when she noticed a burgundy car pull up the block. She
described four white men in street clothes getting out, then silently
approaching the Diallo front door "in slow motion."
</P>
<P>
	   The witness said she had moved away from the window when she said she heard
the blast. Asked to demonstrate the sound, Rivera rapidly tapped the witness
stand four or five times, paused perhaps one second, then resumed tapping
several more times.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, Rivera conceded the pause as "quick." She also
admitted that in an initial statement to police she described hearing about 30
shots in an unbroken succession.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate campaign rolls along; Lautenberg honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - It was bound to happen, after 62 years.
<P>
	   Dueling U.S. Senate candidates came up with the same gimmick, a free lunch,
on the 63rd New Jersey Chamber of Commerce train ride to Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, a likely gubernatorial hopeful and a New Jersey business both
passed out miniature basketballs to the roughly 1,700 passengers on the annual
schmooze and booze cruise on rails.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm told my lunches are the best," said GOP Senate candidate James
Treffinger.
</P>
<P>
	   One lobbyist disagreed. Hoagies made by an Atlantic City sub shop and handed
out by Treffinger foe state Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, were far better,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sandwich debate was about as serious as it got on the four hour trek,
which started in Newark midday and climaxed here with a dinner honoring retiring
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Treffinger and Gormley, who are in a crowded Republican field to replace
Lautenberg, weren't the only politicians lobbying the crowd on the train.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Robert Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, who is also running for Senate,
and Democratic hopefuls Jon Corzine and Jim Florio, also braved the grueling
"walk to Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Treffinger, the county executive in Essex County, is a train
veteran, this was his first foray as a statewide candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm having fun ... so far. Ask me again when we get to Washington," he said
soon after the train left Trenton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley said no serious candidate can afford to miss the chamber train.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you run statewide, you need to have a presence on the train. If not,
you're conspicuous by your absence," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Few minds will be made up so early in the campaign cycle, Gormley
acknowledged. Even competing campaign staffs have fun at the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The business crowd also had fun. One company brought a boom box and
delighted fellow passengers with constant Bruce Springsteen songs. On another
train, a bottle of Bushmills Irish Whiskey could be seen in the baggage rack
decorated with white Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
	   One train novice, salesman Jed Hoban, said he volunteered for train duty to
meet possible clients from throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He also hoped to corner some legislators. His company Consumer Health
Network is keeping a close eye on how state lawmakers regulate managed care,
Hoban said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyist Judy Shaw escorted a client who was looking to drum up insurance
business during the upcoming legislative debate over school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no such thing as a substantive conversation here," said the
co-owner of The GluckShaw Group. "Still, this is a people business and people
feel more comfortable here."
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, he of the miniature basketballs, chose to sit
still and let the Senate and Congressional candidates who face elections this
year wear our their shoe leather. The next gubernatorial election isn't until
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've got a seat. That's what everybody else is looking for," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin was another candidate giving away
trinkets. In her case, she continued a tradition of giving away candy. This
year's treat was a chocolate train.
</P>
<P>
	   "People know I'm a candidate, and they're coming up to me, offering help,
fund-raising," said Levin, who is running for Congress in the 3rd District.
"Also, they want my candy."

<HEADLINE> Belgians Arguing in Cable Car Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- The relatives of five Belgians killed when a
low-flying Marine jet sliced through ski gondola cables in Italy argued Thursday
for the right to sue the U.S. government for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Belgians were among 20 people killed in the Feb. 3, 1998 accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Government lawyers said damages in such cases are handled exclusively under
a NATO treaty and cannot be addressed in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Malcolm Howard said he would rule early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' attorney, Torrence Armstrong, said he would seek $6 million
to $6.5 million for each of the five victims if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the relatives appeared at the hearing, held on the second
anniversary of the accident in Cavalese, Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said the government hasn't yet compensated any of the families.
The Italian Senate in December approved up to $2 million for each, with the U.S.
government paying $1.5 million of each settlement, but Armstrong said the claims
process hasn't begun yet.
</P>
<P>
	   A military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard
Ashby, of manslaughter, but he served several months in prison and was dismissed
from the Marine Corps for helping destroy a videotape of the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also was dismissed from the
Marines over the videotape. Charges were dropped against two back-seat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> German Leader: Democracy Is At Risk  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- As Germany's Christian Democrats prepared to reveal new
details in a slush fund scandal, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday met
with a party official who is trying to shed light on the sources of secret
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
	   ARD public television reported that Kohl traveled to party headquarters in
Bonn to talk with party general manager Willi Hausmann, who earlier quizzed
former Kohl aides about their knowledge of the web of secret accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Results of the meeting were expected to be disclosed Friday, after Christian
Democrat leaders discuss a report by the party's former longtime tax adviser
Horst Weyrauch, who detailed how he managed the slush funds in a six-hour
session with party officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The party refused to comment on the reported meeting with Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has come under criticism for his stubborn refusal to identify the
sources of up to $1 million in anonymous campaign donations, even in the face of
party leaders' insistence that it would clear up allegations that government
favors had been sold.
</P>
<P>
	   With party leaders tightlipped, German media swirled with speculation
Thursday on the sources of the covert campaign funds. The mass-circulation Bild
Zeitung reported that Weyrauch identified at least one donor under questioning
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   And the influential Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing party sources, identified
one donor as German media tycoon Leo Kirch in a report to appear in Friday's
editions. But the party and Kirch's spokesman both adamantly denied the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither he nor any unit of the Kirch group have made donations to Helmut
Kohl,'' said Johannes Schmitz, a spokesman for Kirch's Munich-based company,
Kirch-Gruppe.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirch already figured in the scandal after Kohl acknowledged last week that
he accepted six free flights from Kirch last year, when he was no longer
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   A magazine report linked the flights to Kohl's backing for a planned pay TV
venture by Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom while he was in office, but
Kohl denied any connection.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices moved higher early Friday, leading the
benchmark average to its highest level in 2 1/2 years. The dollar fell against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 206.78 points, or 1.05
percent, to hit 19,993.20 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed up 207.51 points, or 1.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.49 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
down 0.45 yen from its level of 107.94 late Thursday and below 107.71 yen posted
late in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei briefly moved above the critical
20,000-point threshold for the first time since Aug. 1, 1997 as high-technology
issues were in strong demand, largely on the back of the sector's gains on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 137.02
points, or 3.4 percent, to close Thursday at 4,210.98, its third-biggest point
gain. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24 points to 11,013.44.
</P>
<P>
	   "With Nasdaq's gains, the big high-technology names like Sony and Advantest
had strong buy orders from the opening," said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Gainers in the first hours of trading included Matsushita Electric
Industrial, Sony, Softbank, and telecom giant NTT.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
19.05 points, or 1.10 percent, at 1,748.53. On Thursday, the index rose 17.62
points, or 1.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency markets, the greenback fell slightly against the euro following
the European Central Bank's decision to raise key rates, which also led the
currency to fall against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, the central bank -- which adjusts interest rates to keep
inflation below 2 percent in the region -- raised its main refinancing rate to
3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first increase since November, when the ECB raised the rate by
half a percentage point to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising interest rates tends to cool off an overheated economy by making it
more expensive to borrow money. But it also has the added effect of buoying the
local currency because it increases returns on investments in euro-denominated
bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB's rate hike followed a similar interest rate increase Wednesday by
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders were eyeing U.S. non-farm payroll figures due out later in the day
for further clues to the greenback's moves.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro traded at 106.70 yen early Thursday, above its level of 105.21 yen
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8750
from its close at 1.8500 Thursday. Its price fell 0.21 point to 98.51.

<HEADLINE> Energy America pays $280,000 to state after complaints of unclear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A utility facing charges that its marketing
materials were unclear has agreed to pay a $280,000 settlement to the state.
<P>
	   Energy America, based in Stamford, Conn., will pay the Board of Public
Utilities $140,000 and the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs $140,000 for
a fund to educate consumers on energy deregulation.
</P>
<P>
	   The utility and the BPU worked out an agreement Wednesday over the charges.
The company agreed to stop doing business in New Jersey in December after the
BPU received hundreds of complaints from consumers who said that Energy America
agents went door-to-door switching them to the utility, sometimes saying they
were from Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co. Some also complained that the agents
recruited customers who did not speak English.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy America resumed operations in the state five weeks later, but the
45,000 customers it signed up last year were in limbo.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord gives those customers the option to back out. The company on
Wednesday agreed to hire a third-party vendor to contact those customers by mail
to let them know they can switch back.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will give the BPU videotapes of its training sessions with sales
agents over the next month; provide agents with consumer education materials and
require them to give the material to prospective customers, and limit
door-to-door solicitations to hours when customer call centers are open.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a fair and equitable agreement that enables us to continue bringing
additional energy savings to New Jersey's residential and small business
customers, while educating the general public about their choices under electric
deregulation," said Energy America President David Messer.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Herr, director of the Division of Consumer Affairs, called the payment
"a landmark settlement for a landmark prosecution."
</P>
<P>
	   "It sets a precedent on how New Jersey will be tough on energy deregulation,
and it sets a gold standard for conduct," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the root of this issue is there was a lot of customer confusion," said
Alex Hemerick, a spokeswoman for Energy America. "Hopefully this will eliminate
that."

<HEADLINE> Papa John's Sues Pizza Hut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The slogan war between Papa John's and Pizza Hut is
heating up again. This time, Papa John's wants to keep Pizza Hut from obtaining
a trademark for the catchphrase, "The Best Pizzas Under One Roof."
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's has asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reject Pizza
Hut's application, contending the slogan is "deceptively misdescriptive" under
the federal Lanham Act, which deals with advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Pizza Hut, owned by Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. of Louisville, filed the
application in May 1998. The case was opened for public comment in December.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't enjoy suing competitors. We don't have fun opposing somebody's
trademark," said Papa John's spokesman Chris Sternberg. "We just felt like we
had to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest salvo comes after a federal judge-magistrate last month ordered
Papa John's to stop using the slogan, "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza." A jury
sided with Pizza Hut that the slogan and other Papa John's advertising was false
and misleading under the same Lanham Act.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel they need to be prepared to play by the same rules," Sternberg
said. "It's a little ironic and unfair that they've objected to us saying
'better' and they want the legal right to say 'best."'
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's was preparing to use a replacement slogan -- "It's the
Ingredients!" -- but it won an emergency stay of the lower court's ruling. It
can continue to use the "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza" slogan found in print
and broadcast advertising and on pizza boxes, napkins, cups, uniforms and
restaurant signs while it appeals the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Tricon spokesman Jonathan Blum called Papa John's filing a bid for
publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their slogan, in the context of their advertising, was found false,
misleading and deceptive because they made a comparison to Pizza Hut. So, the
court said they don't have better pizza," Blum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pizza Hut slogan, by contrast, is merely a "superlative statement," Blum
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at the context of our advertising, the way we use that
statement is not comparative to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's Sternberg said that argument defies logic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody believes the term 'best' is not comparative," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It could be a long time before there's a final decision on the Pizza Hut
slogan, said Sharon Marsh, trademark administrator with the Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the equivalent of a trial," Marsh said. "Depending on how the process
unfolds and what motions the parties file, it can be a year or two, easily."

<HEADLINE> MetLife Agrees To Pay Fla. $7.5M  </HEADLINE>
    By JACKIE HALLIFAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has agreed to pay
Florida $7.5 million in the wake of its agreement to spend $1.7 billion to
settle a national lawsuit by customers who accused the insurer of deceptive
sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement announced Thursday by the state insurance department is the
second largest with an insurer in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America, the nation's largest life insurer,
paid a $15 million penalty to Florida three years ago to settle similar
allegations. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. paid $6 million that fall.
Eight American General Corp. insurance companies paid Florida $5.5 million last
May.
</P>
<P>
	   The state started investigating MetLife nearly three years ago as part of a
broader probe into industry-wide practices such as churning. That's when the
value of a life insurance policy is drained in order to finance the sale of a
new policy -- and the agent's commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Three MetLife companies were involved: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.,
Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity Co. and Metropolitan Tower Life Ins.
</P>
<P>
	   MetLife denies any wrongdoing, company spokesman John Calagna said from his
New York office. The company has not agreed to pay penalties in any other state,
Calagna said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the state penalty, MetLife will use a state program to help
victims seek restitution. That will take place in conjunction with the $1.7
billion settlement of the national lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   That settlement was approved by a federal judge in Pittsburg two months ago.
As part of that settlement, MetLife will enhance the value of the policies of
all seven million people across the country who bought or held policies from
1982 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 433,000 of those policy-holders lived in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers who believe they were misled by MetLife agents must file claims
and go through an arbitratror.

<HEADLINE> UConn recruits include troubled Cheshire running back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STORRS, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-one high school and prep football players
have signed letters of intent to attend UConn next fall, including a former
Cheshire High School running back with a history of legal troubles.
<P>
	   Jason Dellaselva is currently on probation for trying to cover up his role
in a controversial traffic accident and ensuing domestic dispute. He was
sentenced two years probation last February and fined $501 on charges including
criminal mischief, breach of peace, interfering with police and several motor
vehicle violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The most serious charges stemmed from Dellaselva's arrest in January 1999
following a family fight at his home.
</P>
<P>
	   After being arrested, and while in the department's holding cell, police
said Dellaselva spit on the closed circuit camera and urinated on the walls,
sink and bunk, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, Dellaselva was arrested and charged with evading
responsibility, driving without an operator's license, speeding and failure to
maintain the proper lane. Dellaselva, then 17, and his girlfriend, Tiffany St.
Hillaire, then 18, were arrested after concocting a false story about who was
driving her car when it crashed following a party at which alcohol was served,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyle Muncy, a spokesman for the athletic department, said the school would
have no comment on its decision to recruit Dellaselva.
</P>
<P>
	   Reached at home, Dellaselva said he didn't want to talk about his past.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn football coach Randy Edsall said Thursday he was excited by the
quality of the players who have agreed to attend UConn, which will step up to
the NCAA's Division I-A next season and play football in the Big East
Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The four new Connecticut recruits are: Dellaselva; Davion Dixon of Hartford,
who played at Weaver High School, Tyler King of North Attleboro, Mass., who
played ball at Bishop Feehan High School in Avon Old Farms; and Sean Mulcahy of
Westport, who played at Staples High School.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn also signed eight high school standouts from the state of Florida, and
players representing the states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,
Pennslyvania and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Pushing for Delaware Repeat  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Steve Forbes began a four-day bus campaign across
Delaware on Thursday, pushing for a repeat of his 1996 primary victory and
saying New Hampshire proved ``there's nothing inevitable now.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush also was campaigning in the state, saying, ``If somebody runs
for president of the United States they need to run in all the states. I don't
think they ought to be picking and choosing what state to run in.''
</P>
<P>
	   That was aimed at GOP rival John McCain, who won the New Hampshire primary
by a big margin this week after skipping the Iowa caucuses. McCain is bypassing
Delaware as well.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky, with his candidate in South Carolina,
responded, ``I don't think a 50-state strategy is good if you can't win the
nomination. When we win the nomination, we'll be president of all 50 of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Basil Battaglia, Delaware's Republican state chairman, criticized
McCain, saying GOP candidates for president should run national campaigns, ``not
targeted appeals'' that ignore voters. ``John McCain's cafeteria-style approach
in the primaries is a wrongheaded short cut to winning the White House in
November,'' Battaglia said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware's 12 delegates to the Republican convention are at stake in
Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Encouraged by Bush's loss to McCain on Tuesday, Forbes told a lunch crowd of
about 200 Rotary Club members that he had something in common with the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One thing I do share with Senator McCain is that the Republican
establishment is not very fond of us,'' Forbes said. ``I am an independent
outsider. Washington has no hooks in me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes later carried that message to northern Delaware, where 153 people
traveled through snowfall to hear his conservative message at the Talleyville
Fire Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to an audience question, Forbes, an abortion opponent, said he
would seek stricter federal regulation of abortion clinics, which he said are
just as dangerous as before the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   After New Hampshire, where he came in third, ``the polling is being put
aside,'' Forbes said. ``In this election year, there is going to be no
coronation, there is going to be no pre-appointment of presidential nominees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was greeted by the Dover High School
marching band and about 50 supporters when he landed at the Kent County Airport
in Dover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm coming to your state and I'm going to come back to your state because
I want your vote,'' he said. ``You didn't see me skipping anything. You know
why? Because the people in this state, they're part of America. They ought to
have a voice in the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Rotary lunch, Forbes returned to the same audience that heard him
speak before the primary four years ago. The group, sitting under the giant
mirrors and chandeliers of the ornate Gold Ballroom inside the Hotel du Pont,
applauded his message.
</P>
<P>
	   Frequently quoting former President Reagan, Forbes urged more military
spending, school choice and adoption of his flat federal tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   George Harry, who heard Forbes speak to the Wilmington Rotary Club in 1996,
said many of Forbes' themes are familiar -- but said that is because many of his
ideas have been adopted by the Republican Party.

<HEADLINE> Five Dead in Bogota Prison Shootout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Inmates at a Bogota prison clashed Thursday in a
shootout that left at least five people dead and seven wounded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence at La Picota federal penitentiary appeared to be a turf war
between prisoners in two wards housing a mix of leftist guerrillas, common
criminals and drug traffickers, prisons spokeswoman Rocio Devia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials initially reported 10 prisoners were killed. But after authorities
restored order, they discovered that half of the men believed to be killed were
unconscious or playing dead, Devia added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gang fights are common in the South American country's filthy and
overcrowded prisons. Guns and knives are easily smuggled past corrupt guards.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 prisoners have been killed and about 900 have escaped from
Colombian prisons since 1997, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, an explosion in a neighborhood grocery store in the western
city of Cali killed four people and seriously injured six others.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had ventured no theory as to who planted the explosive or why.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff: Fatal Fire Was Revenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARVEY, La. (AP) -- Revenge was the motive when a man angry at being sold
phony cocaine set a suburban New Orleans apartment building on fire, killing
four children, a sheriff said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said he does not think Whitney
Spencer, 54, intended to kill the children, ranging in age from 14 months to 7
years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't imagine anybody being that mean,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer was booked on four counts of first-degree murder, four of attempted
first-degree murder, and one of aggravated arson in connection with Wednesday
night's blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputies believe Spencer poured a flammable liquid from a soft drink bottle
and ignited it as a 10-year-old girl, one of seven children living in the
apartment, watched.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-year-old and two others, aged 9 and 8, ran upstairs, shouting about
the fire. They hurried downstairs with their grandfather as thick smoke rose up
the stairwell.
</P>
<P>
	   They got out, but the grandfather was unable to save four others.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said Spencer told investigators that he wanted to force Benjamin Kent,
who is in his early 20s, out of the house so he could beat him up. Spencer
accused Kent of taking $20 for what turned out to be a rock of fake cocaine, Lee
said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. May Send Observers To Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By RAVI NESSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council on Thursday condemned reports of
renewed violence in the Congo as diplomats debated authorizing a 5,500-member
U.N. observer force to monitor a cease-fire agreement in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels reported last week that the Congolese government had waged offensives
against them in eastern and northwestern Congo, despite the cease-fire
agreement. The government has also complained about repeated rebel violations of
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Members of the council expressed their deep concern over reports of recent
massacres in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,'' said
Argentine Ambassador Arnoldo Listre, the current council president.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which devoted its presidency of the council last month to
Africa, has taken the lead in drafting a resolution to beef-up the international
monitoring force.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial U.S. draft resolution, expected to be circulated shortly to
council members, would expand the current U.N. mission in Congo from 79 military
liaison officers to 5,537 military personnel, including at least 500 military
observers. The mission would also include civilian support staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The mission would monitor the shaky, and often violated, cease-fire in
Congo, Africa's third-largest country. The accord was signed last summer in
Lusaka, Zambia, by the Congo government and its supporters -- Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia. Rebels who rose up in August 1998 to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila and their backers -- Uganda and Rwanda -- also signed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lusaka agreement envisions an eventual U.N. peacekeeping force. But the
U.S. draft only calls for monitors, and some council members are concerned about
sending them while the cease-fire is being regularly violated.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Congress must also approve any expansion of the current U.N. force
there.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., urged his colleagues to support
the expanded force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our interests in global peace and stability, the rule of law and respect
for basic human rights are in part bound up in Congo's future,'' said Feingold,
the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting has killed untold numbers of people and uprooted close to 1
million from their homes.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Debate Leadership  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUMTER, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush battled Thursday for
support from South Carolina's large military population, each casting himself as
best qualified to command the nation's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   A new poll suggested that Bush's big lead in South Carolina surveys may have
vanished after McCain's win in New Hampshire. McCain, campaigning in high
spirits, shrugged off the Zogby poll figures suggesting the race is now very
close, saying, ``The polls will bounce up and down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Internal polling by McCain's camp suggests a deadheat, while Bush pollsters
say the Texas governor maintains a double-digit lead, although the margin is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was more serious about the prospect of leading the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am fully prepared to be commander in chief,'' McCain, a former Navy
pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war, told an audience outside a waterfront home in
Beaufort. ``I do not need on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning later with Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford in
Charleston near the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Yorktown, said ``the
world is still a dangerous place'' and cited tensions with terrorists and in
Iraq, North Korea and China. He talked about improving military benefits and
said ``there's no more patriotic state than South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, showed off endorsements from a parade of veterans' groups,
Medal of Honor winners and retired generals. And the Texas governor made a
pointed reference to McCain as potential leader, saying, ``There is a big
difference between being somebody who had a distinguished military record and
being someone who's trying to lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush sharpened his rhetoric against McCain on several fronts two days after
the Arizona senator trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For somebody who's talking about campaign funding reform ... I'm going to
let him explain how ... his receiving people in front of his committee who have
been contributing to his campaign is consistent,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the Texas governor also criticized McCain by name for
running a TV ad in South Carolina in which the senator says the difference
between the other GOP candidates and him is that ``I won't take every last dime
of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who would mandate that $2 trillion in payroll taxes destined for the
Social Security trust fund over the next 10 years not be borrowed for other
purposes, said the ad was ``Washington-style politics.'' McCain responded that
Bush is clearly not setting aside enough to protect the system, and said he
would target 62 percent of the surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush leveled his criticism of McCain after a star-spangled campaign
appearance at the Sumter Courthouse, just down the road from Shaw Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want our future military to be lighter, more lethal, more agile, harder
to find,'' Bush said. ``We have the opportunity to redefine how war is fought
and won.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also pledged to reduce bureaucracy in veterans' affairs, saying, ``We're
not going to have lines of people who served our country asking, 'What about
me?'''
</P>
<P>
	   One Bush supporter was Adm. Thomas Moorer, who served as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Nixon administration. Another was Thomas Burch
Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Burch said of McCain: ``He came home and forgot us.'' Afterward, Burch said
the senator hadn't supported his group's efforts on Agent Orange, Gulf War
Syndrome and support for families of soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain fired back that some other veterans' groups have backed him and given
him their highest awards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Have I fooled the veterans' organizations, or is there a little
foolishness going on here?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, his campaign released a statement from veterans who support
McCain, asking Bush to repudiate Burch's comments. The campaign also noted that
McCain had raised more than $1 million over the Internet since his New Hampshire
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain has earned the support of thousands of veterans for his years
of service to our nation and to welfare of our veterans,'' said Orson Swindle, a
former Vietnam POW. ``He has stood at the forefront of nearly every serious
effort to preserve our nation's commitment to our veterans.''
</P>
<P>
	   And McCain and his staff seemed to relish the idea of a campaign
concentrating on veterans' issues, where he has focused much of his early South
Carolina campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why don't we have a real good debate on national security and foreign
policy, any time?'' McCain said, while riding in the back of his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cruised down the highways of coastal South Carolina, he chortled at
editorial cartoons that lampooned Bush's description of the New Hampshire loss
as ``a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his arguments that he is more qualified than McCain, Bush has pointed out
that 33 of McCain's Republican Senate colleagues -- including local favorite
Strom Thurmond -- have endorsed Bush. The same is true of most of the nation's
Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
	   During both days in South Carolina, Bush said the McCain camp had succeeded
in misdefining him for New Hampshire voters -- something he vowed to not let
happen in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the sudden in the course of the debate, I'm tagged as the guy who's
kind of a Washington guy,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to let that happen to me
in South Carolina, because the reality is he is the person who's been the
Washington insider.''

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran Ease Movie Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Salvadoran authorities Thursday reversed
their decision to ban the U.S. film "Stigmata," and will allow it to be shown
with limited hours and advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of this predominantly Catholic country had banned the film
Wednesday, calling it an attack on public order. The film depicts a woman
suffering puncture wounds through the wrist, like those in Christ's crucifixion,
and questions the Catholic church's teachings.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's Public Performances office lifted the ban after meeting
with owners of movie chains. The owners signed an agreement to bar anyone under
18 from seeing the film, reduce the number of showings and "drastically" reduce
advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 film stars Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate campaign rolls along; Lautenberg honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - It was bound to happen, after 62 years.
<P>
	   Dueling U.S. Senate candidates came up with the same gimmick, a free lunch,
on the 63rd New Jersey Chamber of Commerce train ride to Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, a likely gubernatorial hopeful and a New Jersey business both
passed out miniature basketballs to the roughly 1,700 passengers on the annual
schmooze and booze cruise on rails.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm told my lunches are the best," said GOP Senate candidate James
Treffinger.
</P>
<P>
	   One lobbyist disagreed. Hoagies made by an Atlantic City sub shop and handed
out by Treffinger foe state Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, were far better,
she said. Treffinger and Gormley are in a crowded Republican field to replace
retiring Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The sandwich debate was about as serious as it got on the four hour trek,
which started in Newark midday and climaxed here with a dinner-roast of
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Roasters poked fun at Lautenberg's age - 76 - and his notoriously sour
relations with fellow New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
	   But they paid tribute to Lautenberg's record of securing federal money for
New Jersey. And Lautenberg touted legislative successes, including his bill that
raised the national minimum drinking age to 21.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've loved working for New Jersey in the United States Senate and I hope
you feel I've passed the test and done the job well," he told the dinner
audience of more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Robert Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, who is also running for Senate,
and Democratic hopefuls Jon Corzine and Jim Florio, also braved the grueling
"walk to Washington" on board the train.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Treffinger, the county executive in Essex County, is a train
veteran, this was his first foray as a statewide candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm having fun ... so far. Ask me again when we get to Washington," he said
soon after the train left Trenton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley said no serious candidate can afford to miss the chamber train.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you run statewide, you need to have a presence on the train. If not,
you're conspicuous by your absence," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Few minds will be made up so early in the campaign cycle, Gormley
acknowledged. Even competing campaign staffs have fun at the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The business crowd also had fun. One company brought a boom box and
delighted fellow passengers with constant Bruce Springsteen songs. On another
train, a bottle of Bushmills Irish Whiskey could be seen in the baggage rack
decorated with white Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
	   One train novice, salesman Jed Hoban, said he volunteered for train duty to
meet possible clients from throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He also hoped to corner some legislators. His company Consumer Health
Network is keeping a close eye on how state lawmakers regulate managed care,
Hoban said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyist Judy Shaw escorted a client who was looking to drum up insurance
business during the upcoming legislative debate over school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no such thing as a substantive conversation here," said the
co-owner of The GluckShaw Group. "Still, this is a people business and people
feel more comfortable here."
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, he of the miniature basketballs, chose to sit
still and let the Senate and Congressional candidates who face elections this
year wear our their shoe leather. The next gubernatorial election isn't until
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've got a seat. That's what everybody else is looking for," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin was another candidate giving away
trinkets. In her case, she continued a tradition of giving away candy. This
year's treat was a chocolate train.
</P>
<P>
	   "People know I'm a candidate, and they're coming up to me, offering help,
fund-raising," said Levin, who is running for Congress in the 3rd District.
"Also, they want my candy."

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines' Black Boxes Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators found the second ``black box''
recorder from Alaska Airlines Flight 261 on Thursday, quickly locating the
devices that could tell them why the plane flipped upside down and plummeted
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews off Southern California recovered Flight 261's cockpit flight
data recorder. It should show the positions of the plane's controls and whether
a problem with the horizontal stabilizer was merely a symptom of a larger
failure that led to Monday's crash and the deaths of all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims gathered
along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel, where the MD-83 jetliner
corkscrewed and then nose-dived into the chilly, Pacific waters.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-83 jetliner's other ``black box'' was recovered Wednesday. It
recorded cockpit communications and showed the crew had problems with the
horizontal stabilizer, a device on the tail of the plane which keeps the
aircraft level.
</P>
<P>
	   It captured the voices of the pilots trying to gain control of the jetliner
as it rolled, flipped and spiraled nose-first into the water, confirming what
witnesses saw.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crew made references to being inverted,'' National Transportation
Safety Board Chairman James Hall said in Washington, referring to the contents
of the recorder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy used an underwater robot to locate the boxes about 200 feet apart
and roughly 640 feet beneath the surface of the Pacific. The remotely operated
submersible Scorpio 1 found the boxes in the debris zone, about 10 miles off the
Ventura County coast within 20 hours of each other.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Thursday, John Hammerschmidt detailed interviews with
Alaska mechanics, who described helping the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway
stabilizer,'' which forced the plane's nose down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. Others made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing at the tail end of an aircraft, is designed to adjust
-- or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose. The device's movement,
controlled by two motors, is restricted so that the plane does not react
violently.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``It's out of limit for the autopilot.
You're handflying it and having to maintain a considerable amount of pressure on
the controls to keep the plane straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though horizontal stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave
airlines 18 months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of
corrosion. An error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no usual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

Premiers Send Dear Jean Letter to Ottawa on Health Care
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEBEC (AP) -- Canada's premiers have sent Prime Minister Jean Chretien a
carefully crafted letter stressing the future of the country's health care
system is in his hands -- and checkbook.
</P>
<P>
	   The premiers ended their one-day meeting on Thursday with their ``personal
and urgent'' message to Ottawa, expecting their request for increased health
spending to be heeded in the coming federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Canadians and Quebecers share the common concern that our health system is
threatened,'' Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard said at the closing news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now, what is pressing, what is most urgent is a rescue operation and
the integrity of the system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The seriousness of the issue even prompted Bouchard to express some rare
confidence in the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced Mr. Chretien is aware of the situation and will change his
mind,'' said Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about human health, it's about suffering, it's about disease,
sickness and the demand that the elected people take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders also briefly mentioned their support for the tax cuts Chretien
has already committed to. And they called for the government's ``immediate
attention'' in addressing the financial crisis facing farmers. ---
Muslim Man Arrested Trying To Cross Border Released From Custody
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A British Columbia man was released from
U.S. custody Thursday after being held for a week without charges following his
arrest as he tried to cross the border into Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   But Youssef Karroum, 35, was immediately rearrested by U.S. Immigration
authorities, said his lawyer Gene Grantham.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration authorities planned to drive Karroum to the Canadian border,
Grantham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum's car was ``somewhat torn apart'' by FBI officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they would try to put it back together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was detained Jan. 27 by U.S. Customs agents at the border crossing
in Blaine, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. magistrate judge ordered Karroum held without bail as a material
witness. A material witness can be held in order to provide testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   All records connected to Karroum's arrest, detention and release are sealed
and no further details will be released, according to the U.S. attorney
general's office in Washington state. ---
Police union calls off controversial political fundraising campaign
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto's powerful police union has bowed to public
disapproval and abandoned a controversial scheme to raise cash in its bid to
defeat unfriendly politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The union, which last week stopped selling windshield stickers as part of
the so-called True Blue campaign after police Chief David Boothby condemned the
practice, went further Thursday and halted the drive altogether. ---
Chretien Untroubled by Top Bureaucrat's Delay
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien says he doesn't mind that his
top bureaucrat did not brief him six months ago about a looming storm over
$1-billion worth of government grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Mel Cappe, the clerk of the Privy Council, was told in July about
preliminary findings of an audit at the Human Resources Department. But no
information was passed to the prime minister until Jan. 11, a week before the
audit was to be made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Chretien dismissed the delay as normal government procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's doing his job,'' the prime minister said Thursday outside a Liberal
caucus meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to be, I cannot be, informed of every problem in every
department every day. When they receive a problem they have to do their own
work. And when the solution is ready they come to me and I accept or do not
accept. So I'm not upset at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The audit examined 459 job-creation, training, literacy and other grants
chosen at random from programs that together account for $1 billion a year in
federal spending.
</P>
<P>
	   It found that, in many cases, there were no adequate administrative checks
on how the money was spent or whether it achieved its objectives. ---
Bank Rate Rises, Pushing Up Consumer Borrowing Costs
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Consumer borrowing costs are going up as central banks nudge
interest rates higher to ward off troublesome inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Canada raised its trendsetting interest rate by one-quarter of a
percentage point to 5.25 per cent Thursday, following the lead of the U.S.
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Major chartered banks followed, raising their prime lending rates to 6.75
per cent effective today.
</P>
<P>
	   That means mortgages and other types of credit costs will rise.
</P>
<P>
	   But economists say that won't significantly damage consumer confidence or
slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's rate hike came one day after the Fed increased its federal funds
rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 per cent. It cited an
overheated American economy and the risk of inflation. ---
Budget Likely on Feb. 28, Chretien Suggests
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The prime minister broke with tradition Thursday and
announced the date of the federal budget to a crowd of reporters. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The budget is exactly Monday in three weeks from now, or four weeks,''
Jean Chretien said following the Liberal government's two-day caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   That would make it Monday, Feb. 28. Or Monday, March 6. But March 6 is
unlikely, since Parliament is not scheduled to sit that week.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget date is usually announced by the finance minister inside the
House of Commons. But guessing when Finance Minister Paul Martin will table his
hasn't been difficult -- five of six have been in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Reid, a spokesman in Martin's office, would not comment on specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll make a formal announcement in due course,'' Reid said. ``But I think
that you can do the math as suggested by the prime minister on your own quite
fully.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chretien's office declined comment. ---
Alliance Opponents Say a No Committee Doesn't Exist in Referendum
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Grassroots Reformers have been duped if they think there will
be Yes and No campaigns in an upcoming referendum on merging the party into a
larger coalition, say opponents of the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform officials have told the rank and file there would be committees set
up to provide a balanced debate over the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's news to those supposedly running the No camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Stubbs, named as a chairman the No committee by the party, said he was
told only days before a weekend Reform assembly that there would be room for two
formal campaigns in the referendum debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformers are scheduled to vote on adopting the policies and constitution of
the proposed Canadian Alliance over the next month. A two-thirds vote in favor
would fold Reform into the new organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stubbs and other members of GUARD, Grassroots Reformers Against Reform's
Demise, said they refuse to participate in any sort of campaign committee --
particularly since they won't get any funding for it.
</P>
<P>
	   They say the playing field is already skewed in favor of the Canadian
Alliance since Reform Leader Preston Manning and other MPs and staffers have
been able to use party resources to promote it. ---
Canada Post Policy Angers Those Who Want Queen Mother on Stamp
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Bruce Knapp is so furious that Canada isn't honoring the
Queen Mother's 100th birthday with a stamp he's encouraging Canadians write
their MPs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's outrageous to me,'' says Knapp, 81, of Peterborough, Ontario
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a totally unique situation -- please God that she live -- she will
be 100 years old.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Queen Mother's centennial birthday is on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stamps for 2000, announced in December, rural mailboxes, a church and
the Pacific loon, among other images, have won over the Queen Mother for a spot
on Canadians' envelopes and stamp collectors' notebooks. ``I'm not advocating
replacing any of them,'' John Aimers, of the Monarchist League of Canada, said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's a question that the post office can only do so many in a year, I
would think that the loon and or the mailboxes could be postponed.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Ready To Deal With Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Asked to defend the administration's spotty record of
working with Congress, Vice President Al Gore suggested Thursday that his resume
makes him better prepared for the White House than Bill Clinton was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic rival Bill Bradley, working the other end of California, kept up
his focus on differences between Gore and himself. At a San Francisco rally, he
said national health care ``has been a part of the Democratic platform for 50
years'' and is ``one of those issues in this campaign that distinguishes me from
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, he said, ``doesn't have any plan to get to universal health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's hopes for a spectacular bayside rally with the Golden Gate Bridge
as backdrop fell through because of rain. Instead, more than 1,000 people jammed
a restaurant to hear his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was in southern California with Gov. Gray Davis, touring Digital Domain
and inspecting the firm's special-effects technology being used to put together
``The Red Planet,'' a Val Kilmer film due in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore noted with a bit of envy: ``Must be a fun place to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Californians, he said, ``will have a very decisive voice in picking the
Democratic nominee.'' The state, which holds its primary on March 7, has 367 of
the 2,170 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In a question-and-answer session with employees, film editor Bill Brier told
the vice president he was disappointed with the Clinton-Gore administration's
record with a resistant Congress, particularly on comprehensive health care
reform and lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, noting his 16 years in the House and Senate, suggested he would bring
more experience than Clinton did in 1993 when he went straight from the Arkansas
governor's mansion to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A governor who comes to the White House without previous experience in the
Congress brings certain strengths. Someone who has served in the House and the
Senate brings certain other strengths,'' Gore told Brier and a couple of dozen
others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have experience in both chambers and long-standing friendships and
personal relationships on both sides of the aisle in both in the House and the
Senate,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In serving in the Congress I was known quite frequently for a willingness
to cross party lines in order to put together bipartisan coalitions in support
of the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   As examples, he cited his work on national security matters and on pushing
investments in the Department of Defense research that helped spawn the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   From the start of Clinton's first term, critics faulted him for not learning
``Washington's ways'' and forging closer personal relationships with Capitol
powerbrokers.
</P>
<P>
	   Brier, a Democrat who said he remains undecided in the primary, said after
Gore's presentation, ``I was disappointed he didn't outline a strategy for
getting comprehensive health reform passed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friendships in Congress aside, Brier added, Gore ``doesn't have Clinton's
charisma and I have my doubts he can do any better.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, one of Bradley's most active Senate supporters, Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, said the former New Jersey senator took too long to respond to
criticism from Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From the word go, I was saying, 'Don't let them attack you without
responding,''' said Wellstone, who spent much of January campaigning in Iowa and
New Hampshire for Bradley. ``You can fight back in a principled way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a big mistake not to -- and it hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another Bradley supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said he had asked --
and that Bradley had agreed -- to stop insisting that Gore apologize for
volunteers who insulted Kerrey during a weekend rally in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Gore was not responsible for this incident, would never
condone it and does not need to extend me an apology,'' Kerrey said in a
statement that the Gore campaign distributed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Before returning to Washington late Thursday, Gore spoke to an overflow
rally of more than 1,000 in Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking credit for the strong economy, he said the Republican presidential
candidates are wedded ``to the old Reagan-Bush approach'' that produced the
1980s recession.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a bunch that is so rooted in the long-ago, obsolete point of view
that they deserve to be overwhelmingly rejected by the American people,'' Gore
said.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Thrown into Serb Cafe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Violence erupted across this Kosovo
city violence Thursday night with two grenade attacks against Serb cafes that
left at least 20 people wounded and shootings that claimed the lives of three
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence began when the two Albanian men were shot to death, the
multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Half an hour later, a grenade was thrown into a Serb cafe, wounding between
10 and 15 customers, said Lt. Col. Henning Philipp, spokesman for the
multinational force known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, an ethnic Albanian woman was shot to death. That killing was
followed shortly afterwards by a grenade attack on another Serb cafe that
wounded 10 customers, Philipp said.
</P>
<P>
	   A day before, a rocket attack on a U.N. bus carrying Serb civilians left two
Serbs dead and three injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacks comes as ethnic tensions remain high in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say many ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists
here. After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic
Albanians began attacking Serbs as revenge.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Boosted in Early Runs  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The contestants in these beauty contests don't wear
sashes or tiaras, and there's nothing even close to a swimsuit competition. The
prizes don't carry any glamour, just a little momentum for the competitors -- if
they're lucky.
</P>
<P>
	   In the world of politics, beauty contests are presidential primaries or
straw polls that allow voters to express their opinions but have nothing to do
with the delegate selection process. A political beauty pageant in Delaware this
weekend is an example.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's Democratic Party is having a primary Saturday but won't actually
allocate its 22 delegates until March 27 caucuses held throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still believe the primary is a way to gauge public opinion and we're
asking Democrats to participate,'' said Jim Purcell, executive director of
Delaware's Democratic party. ``And being that it is a few days after New
Hampshire, it may have a little more bearing than people think.''
</P>
<P>
	   Or it may not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's really been no history that beauty contests and straw polls have
been president makers,'' said Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at
American University. ``If you look at the history of presidential nominations,
the front-runners almost always get nominated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beauty contest participants are usually second-tier candidates hoping to
gain a little publicity to boost a sagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Steve Forbes, trailing far behind George W. Bush, nearly tied the
front-runner in an Alaska Republican presidential straw poll last week. The
publisher made several campaign trips to Alaska prior to the nonbinding contest,
while Bush and rival Sen. John McCain did not show up.
</P>
<P>
	   Curt Achberger, executive director of Alaska's Republican Party, said the
state holds the straw poll to grab attention it wouldn't receive otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Alaska gets forgotten a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Front-runners generally tend to ignore beauty contests, since they have
nothing to gain in the way of delegates, said Barbara Norrander, a political
science professor at the University of Arizona. Lesser-known candidates often
participate to get name recognition without having to compete against major
candidates with deeper pockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a front-loaded election calendar this year, nominees for both
parties should be known by the end of March. Last year's resulting scramble for
earlier dates -- and increased influence -- on the 2000 calendar resulted in a
number of beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington state Democrats, for example, have scheduled a beauty contest
primary for Feb. 29 -- but won't allocate their delegates until a week later.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona and Michigan, taxpayers will pay for a Feb. 22 presidential
primary in which only Republicans can participate. State Democrats instead will
hold party-run contests the following month because of a national rule that
allows only Iowa and New Hampshire to hold caucuses or primaries before March 7
without penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no question that having a caucus run by the state party is going
to cost us some money,'' said Dennis Denno, a spokesman for Michigan Democrats.
``But we're trying to make sure that, in the end, it's a better product.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norrander wondered how Bill Bradley would try to gain momentum in the runup
to the March 7 contests after his loss Tuesday in New Hampshire's Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He might end up looking around for a beauty contest,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> UConn recruits include troubled Cheshire running back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STORRS, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-one high school and prep football players
have signed letters of intent to attend UConn next fall, including a former
Cheshire High School running back with a history of legal troubles.
<P>
	   Jason Dellaselva is currently on probation for trying to cover up his role
in a controversial traffic accident and ensuing domestic dispute. He was
sentenced two years probation last February and fined $501 on charges including
criminal mischief, breach of peace, interfering with police and several motor
vehicle violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The most serious charges stemmed from Dellaselva's arrest in January 1999
following a family fight at his home.
</P>
<P>
	   After being arrested, and while in the department's holding cell, police
said Dellaselva spit on the closed circuit camera and urinated on the walls,
sink and bunk, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, Dellaselva was arrested and charged with evading
responsibility, driving without an operator's license, speeding and failure to
maintain the proper lane. Dellaselva, then 17, and his girlfriend, Tiffany St.
Hillaire, then 18, were arrested after concocting a false story about who was
driving her car when it crashed following a party at which alcohol was served,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyle Muncy, a spokesman for the athletic department, said the school would
have no comment on its decision to recruit Dellaselva.
</P>
<P>
	   Reached at home, Dellaselva said he didn't want to talk about his past.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn football coach Randy Edsall said Thursday he was excited by the
quality of the players who have agreed to attend UConn, which will step up to
the NCAA's Division I-A next season and play football in the Big East
Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The four new Connecticut recruits are: Dellaselva; Davion Dixon of Hartford,
who played at Weaver High School, Tyler King of North Attleboro, Mass., who
played at Bishop Feehan High School there, before playing prep school football
at Avon Old Farms; and Sean Mulcahy of Westport, who played at Staples High
School.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn also signed eight high school standouts from the state of Florida, and
players representing the states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,
Pennslyvania and Virginia.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   So far, searchers have spotted a piece of the fuselage with four windows,
several large pieces up to six feet wide and numerous smaller pieces less than
three feet wide. Searchers saw the airline's logo on the tail, which still has

</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt declined to say whether searchers had found any of the bodies,
some of which are believed trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews have recovered both ``black boxes,'' which should show the
positions of the plane's controls and whether a problem with the horizontal
stabilizer was merely a symptom of a larger failure that led to Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims
gathered along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel, where the jetliner
crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy used an underwater robot to locate the boxes about 200 feet apart
and roughly 640 feet beneath the surface of the Pacific. The remotely operated
submersible Scorpio 1 found the boxes in the debris zone, about 10 miles off the
Ventura County coast within 20 hours of each other.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it. On Thursday,
Hammerschmidt detailed interviews with Alaska mechanics, who described helping
the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway stabilizer,'' which forced the plane's nose
down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. Others made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing at the tail end of an aircraft, is designed to adjust
-- or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``You're handflying it and having to
maintain a considerable amount of pressure on the controls to keep the plane
straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave airlines 18
months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of corrosion. An
error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no usual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Woman Gives Birth To Triplets, Again  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GAMBRELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Think triplets are a challenge? Try two sets.
</P>
<P>
	   Think that's difficult? Try giving birth to all six children before you're
20.
</P>
<P>
	   A Maryland woman this week gave birth to triplets for the second time in
less than two years, defying odds of about one in 50 million, hospital officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crystal Cornick, 19, gave birth at 35 weeks to Ariel, Tyler and Tyree on
Tuesday at the University of Maryland Hospital. The babies weighed from 3 pounds
14 ounces to 5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike many instances of unusual multiple births, Cornick did not use
fertility drugs for either pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as remarkably, said Ira Gewolb, director of neonatology at the
University of Maryland Hospital for Children, Cornick delivered both sets
virtually at full term. She carried all six babies for 35 weeks -- and all were
delivered naturally.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview from her hospital room, Cornick said she and her fiance,
Richard Williams, 22, have been overwhelmed by the international attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm still in shock,'' Cornick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornick was attending Goucher College where she had majored in economics and
is planning on a career as a financial analyst. Williams had attended Baltimore
Community College, but had to leave to take a job as a truck driver, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornick said she was planning to take a year off from school to find day
care for her older triplets when she discovered she was pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornick said her mother will be with her, as well as Williams' parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornick said her pastor also helped calm her after she suddenly went from
childless to the mother of six in under two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said your children are a blessing and you should feel lucky to have
them, because some people can't have children,'' she said. ``That kind of put me
at ease.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. GOP Leaders Give in To McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki, the top New York backer of
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, waved the white flag of
surrender Thursday in the battle to keep Sen. John McCain off the state's
presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that John McCain should be on the ballot,'' the governor said in
a statement. ``This should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not
technicalities. I'm confident that George Bush will win that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said Bush agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
	   With growing signs that New York's GOP hierarchy appeared ready to buckle,
McCain had sent letters to Pataki and state GOP chairman William Powers earlier
in the day urging them to ``do the right thing for New York Republicans'' by
putting him on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent shift among state GOP leaders came after Bush, stung by
McCain's big New Hampshire primary win and unhappy about handing McCain an issue
for his ``outsider'' campaign, signaled New York supporters that their fight to
keep McCain off primary ballots in more than one-third of the state's
congressional districts had gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, one of the Texas governor's top strategists, told state GOP
leaders that Bush would prefer his supporters not appeal if McCain wins a
federal court challenge, a Bush adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush himself, asked about the situation during a Dover, Del., stop, said,
``Put him on the ballot. If the judge decides he should be on the ballot, let
him be on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case said Thursday that no ruling would be issued before
Monday at the earliest. Lawyers on both sides said they expected it to be a
victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that if the judge happened to rule
against McCain, Pataki was ready to ``take the appropriate steps to ensure that
(McCain) is on the ballot.'' Mucha said she could not elaborate on what those
steps would be.
</P>
<P>
	   Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, director of McCain's campaign
in New York, said he was pleased with Pataki's statement, but called it ``too
little, too late.'' The former congressman said, ``they've hurt Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mucha said, ``We believe McCain is hiding behind the issue of ballot
access ... When ballot access is off the table, it's clear he has nothing to
talk about in New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also was talk that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case. Molinari said he knew
nothing about that.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Powers, but one of his lawyers, Lawrence
Mandelker, said, ``There obviously is enormous political pressure for a
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly criticized Bush for not calling off the effort to
block his access to the New York ballot for the March 7 primary. The argument
has been over McCain's petitions, which lacked the required number of signatures
to get him on the ballot in some congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush running mate, has also
come under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when Bush's delegate slate was
knocked off the ballot by a state judge in one of the state's 31 congressional
districts. Lawyers for Powers conceded there were fraudulent signatures on Bush
petitions in the district. They had been challenged by lawyers for publisher
Steve Forbes, who is also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you sow, so shall you reap,'' Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather party members'
signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts to get their
delegate slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back
on the ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Maker Recalls Toy Chests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Arizona furniture maker is recalling about 400 toy
chests because of faulty lids that could injure children, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries have been reported, by the commission said an investigator for
the Georgia Office of Consumer Affairs discovered that the lids could fall onto
a child's head or neck.
</P>
<P>
	   The oak toy chests are made by Thornwood Furniture Manufacturing of Phoenix
and have model number 841LQ or 1814LQ on the rear panel. They are 35 inches
long, 19 inches high and 19 inches deep and have one adjustable lid support. The
Thornwood Furniture name and address are on the product sticker on the rear
panel of the chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Furniture stores nationwide, including Rooms To Go, Bedroom Superstores and
MN Goldstein, sold the toy chests from January 1999 through November 1999 for
about $170.
</P>
<P>
	   The product safety commission said consumers should immediately stop
children from using the toy chest and contact the store where it was purchased
for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call toll-free 1-877-351-0067 between 9
a.m. and 7 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Accused carjacker of trooper's cruiser and second vehicle arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A 29-year-old Union County man has been arrested on
charges that he carjacked a State Police cruiser and another vehicle on the New
Jersey Turnpike during a snowstorm last month, State Police said Thursday.
<P>
	   Tyrone Montgomery, of Hillside, is being held in the Essex County Jail on
$100,000 bail after being charged with aggravated assault of a police officer,
two counts of carjacking, plus receiving stolen property and weapons and other
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police Sgt. Timothy Vanak thought he was helping a motorist stranded
in the snow along the turnpike in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, on Jan. 25
when he came upon Montgomery, who was a suspect in an armed robbery that had
occurred 2 1/2 hours earlier at the James Fenimore Cooper service area on the
turnpike in Mount Laurel.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say Montgomery was placed in the rear of an unmarked trooper car when
Vanak called for a second trooper. When the second trooper arrived, Vanak got
out of his car and left the man inside. Montgomery jumped behind the wheel and
took off, police say. Vanak jumped into the back seat to try to stop Montgomery,
but he shoved a gun in Vanak's face. The trooper later jumped out of the moving
car.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the cruiser later slid off the road. Police say Montgomery then
commandeered a minivan at gunpoint from two good Samaritans who stopped to help
him.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Montgomery remains a suspect in the
Mount Laurel armed robbery but has not been charged. He said he is also under
suspicion for crimes in a "number of other police jurisdictions throughout north
Jersey."

<HEADLINE> Beach Memorial for Alaska Air Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- With most of the 88 passengers and crew still
missing with the sunken wreckage of Alaska Flight 261, friends and relatives
gathered Thursday for a subdued memorial, wading into the water and strolling
along a beach.
</P>
<P>
	   The group of about 200 met midday inside the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons
Station in a remote area out of view of Monday's crash site off the Southern
California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Some friends and family members cradled bouquets of white roses and baby's
breath in their arms on the way to the beach. Others carried white carton boxes
filled with a lunch, sunscreen, tissues and pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of it is to allow them to ... either keep a journal, write a
note and leave it or maybe communicate their feelings to each another,'' said
Barbara Jean, a Red Cross worker, who helped organize three of the buses from
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Cross spokesman Chris Thomas said the trip was ``one step in the
recovery process.'' Reporters were kept out of the military compound, which is a
few miles from Port Hueneme.
</P>
<P>
	   At the base, a few mourners roamed the base's shore alone, some clustered in
small groups and others waded into the chilly, Pacific waters.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, a bright orange Coast Guard helicopter dropped flowers and
photographs of the dead into the shimmering waters where the plane corkscrewed
then nose-dived. Searchers have recovered only four bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines employees and National Transportation Safety Board officials
helped arrange the caravan to the private site with the Red Cross. California
Highway Patrol motorcycles and patrol cars escorting the six buses to the base.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines employees traveled separately to a beach near the crash
site, where they laid flowers and grabbed one another's arms as they walked in
the sand.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country, the airline, which retired Flight 261, held a minute of
silence for the victims. The employees stopped working at 4:36 p.m., near the
time of the crash. At Burbank Airport, employees held hands in a large circle on
the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   A local pastor and business owners held a public memorial later in the day
at Port Hueneme Pier, where a few hundred residents placed balloons, flowers and
candles at the base of three palm trees. The group prayed and sang ``Ave Maria''
and ``Time to Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to pray for the family and friends who lost loved ones, and we
want to give people in the community who are dealing with their own mortality a
process to grieve, too,'' said the Rev. Tracy Cook of Park View Baptist Church
in Port Hueneme.

<HEADLINE> Pieces of Downed Airline Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers found the intact tail of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 and recovered the flight data recorder Thursday, two pieces
key to determining why the jetliner plummeted into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Underwater robots exploring the ocean floor found where the wreckage came to
rest after the MD-83 crashed Monday, killing all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A submersible sent up video images of a piece of the fuselage with four
windows, several large pieces up to six feet wide and numerous smaller pieces.
The airline's logo -- the smiling face of an Alaskan Eskimo -- is clearly
visible on the tail, said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt declined to say whether searchers had found any bodies, some
of which are believed trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews had earlier salvaged the cockpit voice recorder from about 640
feet of water. The flight data recorder recovered Thursday about 200 feet away
would show the positions of the plane's controls and whether a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer on the tail was merely a symptom of a larger failure that
led to Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims gathered
along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel for a private memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it. On Thursday,
Hammerschmidt detailed interviews with Alaska mechanics, who described helping
the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway stabilizer,'' which forced the plane's nose
down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. The rest made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing on the tail of an aircraft, is designed to adjust --
or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``You're handflying it and having to
maintain a considerable amount of pressure on the controls to keep the plane
straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave airlines 18
months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of corrosion. An
error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no unusual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose Friday morning as Japan's key stock
index hit its highest level in 2 1/2 years. The dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 108.59 points, or 0.55
percent, to end the morning session at 19,895.01. On Thursday, the average
closed up 207.51 points, or 1.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.60 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
down 0.34 yen from late Thursday and below its late New York level of 107.71
yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei briefly moved above the critical
20,000-point threshold for the first time since Aug. 1, 1997 as high-technology
issues were in strong demand, largely on the back of the sector's gains on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 137.02
points, or 3.4 percent, to close Thursday at 4,210.98, its third biggest point
gain. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24 points to 11,013.44.
</P>
<P>
	   "With Nasdaq's gains, the big high-technology names like Sony and Advantest
had strong buy orders from the opening," said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet-related Softbank and electronics giant Sony posted some of the
morning's biggest gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies rose
18.34 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,747.82. On Thursday, the index rose 17.62
points, or 1.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the greenback fell slightly against the euro following
the European Central Bank's decision to raise key rates, which also led the U.S.
currency lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, the central bank -- which adjusts interest rates to keep
inflation below 2 percent in the region -- raised its main refinancing rate to
3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first increase since November, when the ECB raised the rate by
half a percentage point to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising interest rates tends to cool off an overheated economy by making it
more expensive to borrow money. But it also has the added effect of buoying the
local currency because it increases returns on investments in euro-denominated
bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB's rate hike followed a similar interest rate increase Wednesday by
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Currency traders were eyeing U.S. non-farm payroll figures due out later in
the day for further clues to the greenback's moves.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro traded at 106.35 yen early Thursday, above its level of 105.21 yen
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unchanged
from Thursday at 1.8500. Its price was flat at 98.51.

<HEADLINE> High Level of Tritium Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A groundwater sample shows the presence of tritium at
400 times the federal drinking water standard in a monitoring well 3.6 miles
from the Columbia River at the Hanford nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal Hanford memo, obtained by the Tri-City Herald, says it could
take the underground plume as little as three years or as many as 30 years to
reach the river.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and
the state officials will begin conducting additional tests on Monday at the
site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hopping on this,'' Mike Thompson, DOE's official in charge of
groundwater monitoring, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes to know better in a couple of weeks the concentration of the
tritium and how serious a threat it poses to the river.
</P>
<P>
	   A tritium concentration of 20,000 picocuries of radiation in one liter of
water is the federal drinking water limit. The reading at the monitoring well
was 8 million picocuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanford was established as part of the secret Manhattan Project to build an
atomic bomb during World War II. Today, the mission at the 560-square-mile site
in southeast Washington state is cleaning up the radioactive and hazardous waste
created during 40 years of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear
arsenal.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Debate Leadership  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUMTER, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush battled Thursday for
support from South Carolina's large military population, each casting himself as
best qualified to command the nation's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   A new poll suggested that Bush's big lead in South Carolina surveys may have
vanished after McCain's win in New Hampshire. McCain, campaigning in high
spirits, shrugged off the Zogby poll figures suggesting the race is now very
close, saying, ``The polls will bounce up and down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Internal polling by McCain's camp suggests a deadheat, while Bush pollsters
say the Texas governor maintains a double-digit lead, although the margin is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was more serious about the prospect of leading the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am fully prepared to be commander in chief,'' McCain, a former Navy
pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war, told an audience outside a waterfront home in
Beaufort. ``I do not need on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning later with Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford in
Charleston near the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Yorktown, said ``the
world is still a dangerous place'' and cited tensions with terrorists and in
Iraq, North Korea and China. He talked about improving military benefits and
said ``there's no more patriotic state than South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, showed off endorsements from a parade of veterans' groups,
Medal of Honor winners and retired generals. And the Texas governor made a
pointed reference to McCain as potential leader, saying, ``There is a big
difference between being somebody who had a distinguished military record and
being someone who's trying to lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush sharpened his rhetoric against McCain on several fronts two days after
the Arizona senator trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For somebody who's talking about campaign funding reform ... I'm going to
let him explain how ... his receiving people in front of his committee who have
been contributing to his campaign is consistent,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the Texas governor also criticized McCain by name for
running a TV ad in South Carolina in which the senator says the difference
between the other GOP candidates and him is that ``I won't take every last dime
of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who would mandate that $2 trillion in payroll taxes destined for the
Social Security trust fund over the next 10 years not be borrowed for other
purposes, said the ad was ``Washington-style politics.'' McCain responded that
Bush is clearly not setting aside enough to protect the system, and said he
would target 62 percent of the surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also came under fire Thursday from rival Alan Keyes, who criticized
what he described as McCain's wavering stance on abortion. McCain said he
opposes abortion, but would make exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when
the mother's life is at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain is not pro-life, and any pro-life person who casts a vote for
John McCain betrays the principles the Republican Party espouses,'' Keyes told
about 500 people at Newberry College in Newberry, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush leveled his criticism of McCain after a star-spangled campaign
appearance at the Sumter Courthouse, just down the road from Shaw Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want our future military to be lighter, more lethal, more agile, harder
to find,'' Bush said. ``We have the opportunity to redefine how war is fought
and won.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also pledged to reduce bureaucracy in veterans' affairs, saying, ``We're
not going to have lines of people who served our country asking, 'What about
me?'''
</P>
<P>
	   One Bush supporter was Adm. Thomas Moorer, who served as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Nixon administration. Another was Thomas Burch
Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Burch said of McCain: ``He came home and forgot us.'' Afterward, Burch said
the senator hadn't supported his group's efforts on Agent Orange, Gulf War
Syndrome and support for families of soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain fired back that some other veterans' groups have backed him and given
him their highest awards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Have I fooled the veterans' organizations, or is there a little
foolishness going on here?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, his campaign released a statement from veterans who support
McCain, asking Bush to repudiate Burch's comments. The campaign also noted that
McCain had raised more than $1 million over the Internet since his New Hampshire
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain has earned the support of thousands of veterans for his years
of service to our nation and to welfare of our veterans,'' said Orson Swindle, a
former Vietnam POW. ``He has stood at the forefront of nearly every serious
effort to preserve our nation's commitment to our veterans.''
</P>
<P>
	   And McCain and his staff seemed to relish the idea of a campaign
concentrating on veterans' issues, where he has focused much of his early South
Carolina campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why don't we have a real good debate on national security and foreign
policy, any time?'' McCain said, while riding in the back of his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cruised down the highways of coastal South Carolina, he chortled at
editorial cartoons that lampooned Bush's description of the New Hampshire loss
as ``a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his arguments that he is more qualified than McCain, Bush has pointed out
that 33 of McCain's Republican Senate colleagues -- including local favorite
Strom Thurmond -- have endorsed Bush. The same is true of most of the nation's
Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
	   During both days in South Carolina, Bush said the McCain camp had succeeded
in misdefining him for New Hampshire voters -- something he vowed to not let
happen in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the sudden in the course of the debate, I'm tagged as the guy who's
kind of a Washington guy,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to let that happen to me
in South Carolina, because the reality is he is the person who's been the
Washington insider.''

<HEADLINE> Official: Help Latin American Poor  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- Poverty and corruption will continue to impede
economic growth in Latin American unless governments take much stronger steps to
help the poor, the World Bank president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   James Wolfensohn warned 34 ministers from the Americas, gathered for a
one-day economic summit in the Mexican resort town of Cancun, that they cannot
afford to ignore their nations' underlying social problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without addressing the issue of poverty,'' he said, ``there is no way we
can have long-term growth because social instability will kill it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the ministers discussed ways to combat economic crime such as money
laundering and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfensohn pointed to progress on several fronts: Life expectancy in the
region has grown to 69 years from 60 years in 1970. Literacy is at 88 percent,
and infant mortality has fallen from 84 to 31 deaths per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the ``persistent problem of poverty'' remains a challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the last 20 years, the number of poor has risen by 40 million to 175
million, equaling 36 percent of the population, he said. Of those, 15 percent
live in extreme poverty, unable to afford even a basic daily diet.
</P>
<P>
	   The poverty rate is 80 percent among the region's 30 million indigenous
people, who are concentrated in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a record that any of us is proud of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The region's income distribution is the worst in the world, he said, with
the poorest 20 percent earning 4.5 percent of wealth. The figure is 5.2 percent
in Africa, and 8.8 percent in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We compare very badly,'' Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfensohn said governments must systematically work with churches,
nongovernmental organizations, trade unions and the private sector. The ``inner
resources'' of the poor also must be put to use, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, of course, he pointed to increased trade as one answer for the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the rioting that took place at last year's World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, Wolfenson said, ``We must not let radicals in
Seattle scare us from the task of adjusting to globalization and giving greater
opportunities to our people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate development, the ministers agreed Thursday to create a task
force to fight money laundering, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said.
All 34 nations attending the summit agreed to join either the new South American
Financial Action Task Force or a similar organization already in place for
Caribbean states.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the new group will be to set standards for fighting money
laundering and to carry out review and evaluations of each country's efforts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers warned that new technology and greater integration of the world's
economies ``can bring new life to old vices,'' such as tax evasion, corruption
and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Company Recalls Faulty Engines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Briggs &AMP; Stratton Corp. is voluntarily recalling 2,600
Vanguard V-twin gasoline engines with 9-quart fuel tanks because they can leak
gasoline, posing a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs &AMP; Stratton of Milwaukee received six reports of engine fires, one
resulting in a minor burn, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The engines are used in various brands of construction, industrial, and lawn
and garden equipment, including vacuum lawn sweepers, air compressors, leaf
blowers and pressure washers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``VANGUARD V-Twin'' is written on the engines, which are red or black. There
are identification tags on the side of these engines with model number 294442,
294447, 303442, 303447, 350442 or 350447. The tags also show an eight-digit code
with the first six digits indicating the date the engine was manufactured by
month year and day.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled engines were manufactured between Feb. 15, 1999, and Nov. 17,
1999. Equipment containing the engines were sold nationwide from March 1999
through November 1999. The engines alone sold for about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Plastic fuel filters, which are also being recalled, were sold separately
for use as replacements and have the part number 808116 written on the bottom of
the filter. They were sold for Vanguard V-twin engines manufactured after Aug.
22, 1995. The company sold the filters for $5 from March 1999 through November
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission advised consumers to stop using the filters and engines even
if they do not appear to be leaking. Briggs &AMP; Stratton will install a new fuel
filter on the recalled engines free or provide a free replacement spare fuel
filter.
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call 1-800-999-9444 between 10 a.m. and
6 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Eddie Bauer Sweatshirts Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Eddie Bauer company is recalling about 2,000 men's
sweatshirts because they can catch fire too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Redmond, Wash., company hasn't received any reports of injuries, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The gray, long-sleeved, fleece sweatshirts bear the phrase ``Made in USA''
on the neckline label, and have item number 1313 or 1249 printed on the
side-seam label. These sweatshirts are labeled as being 80 percent cotton and 20
percent polyester.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie Bauer stores sold the sweatshirts nationwide from March 1999 through
May 1999 for about $38. Sweatshirts made in Singapore are not included in the
recall.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission advised consumers to immediately stop using the
sweatshirts and return them to any Eddie Bauer store for a refund.
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call Eddie Bauer at 1-800-426-6253
between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. EST any day of the week.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Allied Militia Retreats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli-allied militiamen early Friday used
dynamite to destroy one of their key outposts in southern Lebanon and retreated
to new positions, militia officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Lebanon Army's withdrawal from Sojod, a hilltop post with
commanding view of a Hezbollah guerrilla stronghold, appeared aimed at cutting
casualties ahead of the Israeli army's promised departure from Lebanon this
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes and guerrilla attacks continued for a seventh
consecutive day. The latest air raid was early Friday on a valley near Sojod,
about 15 miles north of Israel's Upper Galilee border.
</P>
<P>
	   The new front line is now at Rihan, a mountain village east of Sojod where
the SLA maintains a position.
</P>
<P>
	   The SLA withdrawal early Friday came amid the worst hostilities in southern
Lebanon in six months. Hezbollah guerrillas killed the No. 2 man in the SLA on
Sunday and three Israeli soldiers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak threatened earlier in the week to
retaliate for the losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has promised to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by July, and
hopes to obtain an agreement involving Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon,
that would guarantee security along Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
	   But the heightened violence throughout the week could hamper efforts to get
Israel-Syria peace talks, indefinitely postponed last month, back on track, thus
making a deal on Lebanon even less likely.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Parents Sue L.A. County  </HEADLINE>
   By CYNTHIA L. WEBB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The adoptive parents of a confessed killer sued Los
Angeles County on Thursday, alleging they never would have gone through with the
adoption if they knew their son's birth mother was diagnosed as a chronic
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeremy Strohmeyer, now 21, pleaded guilty in September 1998 to murder,
kidnapping and two counts of sexual assault in the strangling of a 7-year-old
girl in a Nevada casino. He was given four consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   John and Winifred Strohmeyer claim the county and several adoption
department workers engaged in ``despicable conduct,'' fraud and breach of
contract in the 1980 adoption. They are seeking more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Essentially their aim is to get compensation for the actions of the Los
Angeles County adoption agency that had fraudulently withheld information about
Jeremy's birth mother and the conditions that she had been suffering from for
quite a few years,'' said attorney Gregory Smith, who represents the
Strohmeyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents submitted an adoption intake form in 1979 that stated they did
not want to adopt a child whose parents had a history of drug addiction or
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit contends the county withheld information about Jeremy's
background and indicated that the boy's parents were not drug users and had no
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the Strohmeyers been told of his background, the suit says they ``would
not have adopted Jeremy and would not have incurred the monetary and emotional
burdens, which included the eventual cost of a legal defense of Jeremy.''
</P>
<P>
	   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he would request at Tuesday's Board
of Supervisors meeting that county lawyers brief the board on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the facts are as stated and the county did not fully inform the parents
that there were mental problems with those associated with the child they were
going to adopt, the county is liable,'' Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the family is hoping to cover costs they have spent on the legal
defense of their son, estimated at $600,000, and the cost of raising him.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Kathleen Clarey, a feature writer at The Fresno Bee
from 1971 to 1998, died Wednesday after a two-year battle with cancer. She was
55.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, she realized a lifelong dream of seeing her first book
published.
</P>
<P>
	   The mystery novel, ``Stalking Horse,'' was published online by Starlight
Writer Publications of Marlton, N.J. The company also bought five more of her
mysteries, a series set in the San Joaquin Valley and the Monterey area.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarey acted in plays and musicals for Fresno's Good Company Players and
Theatre 3. She had a strong interest in theater and movies, and wrote about both
for the Bee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kathey Clarey's passion for entertainment, particularly in film and
literature, helped the Bee's feature sections grow in sophistication and
expertise during the decades she was a staff writer,'' said Gail M. Marshall,
associate editor and former features editor.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Visalia, Clarey graduated from College of the Sequoias and then
worked at the Visalia Times-Delta before joining the Bee.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1984, she took first place in a California-Nevada journalism competition
for a feature story about a boy born without a left hand and his struggle to
overcome that disability.
</P>
<P>
	   She is survived by a brother, two nieces and a nephew.
Richard Allen Dudley
</P>
<P>
	   LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) -- Richard Allen ``Dick'' Dudley, an NBC radio and
television announcer who was among the first to broadcast news of the Pearl
Harbor attack, has died from a brain tumor. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
	   Dudley, whose career as ``The Voice of NBC'' spanned 60 years, died
Wednesday at the Essa Flory Hospice Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Casper Bernard Kuhn Jr. in Louisville, Ky., Dudley began in the
entertainment business in 1925 as an 11-year-old on a kids' show on WTNT radio
in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   He began doing voices and commercials on WSM radio. The summer after
graduating from high school, he started a small theater company in a renovated
barn, where his plays became a springboard for entertainer Dinah Shore.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1938, he moved to New York City and held numerous jobs before becoming a
pageboy at NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   He moved up the ranks and became an NBC staff announcer in 1940. On Dec. 7,
1941, he was one of the first announcers to broadcast the report of the attack
on Pearl Harbor. He was drafted in 1943 and rose to become program director of
the Armed Forces Radio Network in London, where he put on shows with bands
entertaining the troops.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, he returned to NBC in New York where he worked as an
announcer and performer for 40 years until his retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   He was one of the original emcees of ``Ripley's Believe It or Not'' and
announced the Toscanini Television Concerts,'' as well as ``The Price is
Right,'' ``Not for Women Only'' and ``The Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dudley is survived by two sons and three grandchildren.
Allarakha Khan
</P>
<P>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Allarakha Khan, the best-known player of the tabla, or
Indian drum, died early Thursday, his family said. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   His family said the musician, who used only the name Allarakha, died shortly
after learning of his daughter's death. Family members said he was shocked by
the news and suffered a heart attack at his home.
</P>
<P>
	   He and his daughter Razia, 51, who had suffered from a heart ailment, will
be buried Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Allarakha made his international debut in Japan in 1964, playing with Indian
sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. The duo helped popularize Indian music abroad and
sold out concerts both in India and elsewhere.
Richard Kleindienst
</P>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Richard Kleindienst, who served as U.S. attorney general
during the Nixon administration and resigned during the Watergate scandal, died
of lung cancer Thursday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   Kleindienst died at his home in Prescott, Ariz., said his wife, Margaret
Dunbar Kleindienst.
</P>
<P>
	   Kleindienst had assisted with Richard Nixon's presidential campaign in 1968,
then stayed on as deputy attorney general, eventually replacing Attorney General
John Mitchell, who left in 1972 to head the Committee to Re-elect the President
-- the organization at the heart of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
	   Kleindienst was sworn in as attorney general in June 1972. Five days later
came the break-in of Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex in
Washington, a botched bugging attempt that sent some top Nixon aides to prison.
Nixon eventually resigned over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid allegations that White House staffers were trying to obstruct justice,
Kleindienst stepped down in April 1973 along with aides H.R. Haldeman and John
Ehrlichman and White House counsel John Dean.
</P>
<P>
	   He later pleaded guilty -- an act he said he regretted -- in 1974 to a
misdemeanor charge for failing to fully testify at his Senate confirmation
hearing about the so-called ITT affair, a major scandal that came shortly before
the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department had filed an antitrust suit against the International
Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 1971. Kleindienst was charged with failing to
tell the Senate that Nixon had ordered him to drop the suit against ITT.
</P>
<P>
	   The president rescinded the order two days later, after Kleindienst
threatened to resign.
Steve Lacy
</P>
<P>
	   JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve Lacy, a former Milligan College educator
and athletic official who held great influence in the Democratic Party in
Tennessee, died Thursday at age 91.
</P>
<P>
	   Known as ``Mr. Democrat,'' he was an adviser to many Democratic
officeholders including Vice President Al Gore, former Gov. Ned McWherter and
former U.S. Sen. Jim Sasser.
</P>
<P>
	   Lacy was named athletic director, head football coach and girls basketball
coach at Milligan College in 1933. During his 16 years there, he coached four
sports and also was a dean, teacher and vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   As a businessman, he worked in the wholesale oil business, fast-food
franchises, trucking and real estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lacy was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.
Falsum Russell
</P>
<P>
	   WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) -- Falsum ``Red'' Russell, the first female
assistant city editor at the Saint Paul Pioneer Press, died Tuesday of cancer.
She was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell joined the Pioneer Press as a reporter in 1944 after working as an
editor of a lumber trade journal in Minneapolis and a police and courthouse
reporter in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   She specialized in health and welfare reporting and became assistant city
editor in 1970. Russell was one of a handful of women in the newsroom for much
of her early career.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Russell's memorable stories was an interview with Mamie Eisenhower in
1952 aboard the campaign train for her husband and presidential candidate,
Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell retired from the newspaper in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   She is survived by two stepchildren; four grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
Francis Stuart
</P>
<P>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Francis Stuart, an Irish novelist and poet who was
accused of supporting the Nazis when he broadcast from Berlin during World War
II, died Wednesday. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said Stuart died in Fenore, County Clare. The cause of death
was not given.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Queensland, Australia, to Irish parents, Stuart grew up in County
Antrim in Northern Ireland and attended England's prestigious Rugby School.
</P>
<P>
	   His first book of poems, published when he was 21, earned him an award from
the Royal Irish Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1931, he published ``Women and God,'' the first of his 30 novels. His
most famous novel, published in 1971, was ``Black List, Section H,'' based on
his first marriage to Iseult Gonne, daughter of the Irish activist Maud Gonne.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart moved to Germany at the start of the war and made several broadcasts
from Berlin to listeners in his homeland, leading to allegations that he was a
Nazi supporter.
Masatomo Takahashi
</P>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Masatomo Takahashi, who oversaw the opening of the world's
most-visited amusement park, has died. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   The former president and chairman of Oriental Land Co. died Monday of heart
failure, company spokesman Koji Morita said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Takahashi joined the property development company in 1961 as managing
director and became president in 1978. Under his leadership, Oriental Land built
the first Disney theme park outside the United States in an eastern suburb of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983, has since become the most-visited
amusement park in the world, with more than 16 million people expected to pass
through its turnstiles this year.
Charlton W. Tebeau
</P>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Ga. (AP) -- Charlton W. Tebeau, author of numerous books and
articles on Florida history and former chairman of the history department at the
University of Miami, has died. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Tebeau, who had retired to Springfield in 1976, died Wednesday after a
prolonged illness.
</P>
<P>
	   He was a professor of history at the university for 32 years and chairman of
the department for 23 years before his retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   His book, A History of Florida, was widely regarded as the definitive
history of the state from its initial publication in 1971 until 1995. That year,
a group of scholars produced The New History of Florida, and a major update of
Tebeau's classic was published last month by the UM Press.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Issues Profit Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Troubled automaker Nissan Motor Co. warned its consolidated
operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 is likely to fall short of
its projections because of sluggish domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The company did not provide figures, but said an official revision of its
profit projection is expected in March or later.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Nissan was projecting $832 million (90 billion yen) in
consolidated operating profit on sales of $58 billion (6.2 trillion yen) for the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nissan's domestic sales plunged 14.4 percent to 773,602 in the 1999
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, in a statement Wednesday, blamed "increased competition and a
poor Nissan model mix" for the decline in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning comes as Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, has been
working to slash costs and return to profitability. The company is undergoing a
restructuring undertaken when Renault SA of France bought a 36.8 percent stake
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Euro Rebounds on Interest Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The beleaguered euro rebounded sharply after
European interest rates were raised one-quarter percentage point Thursday, but
the central bank's president said the weak currency was just one contributing
factor in the inflation-fighting move.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro climbed to 98.95 cents in late trading Thursday in New York from
97.57 cents Wednesday and the record low of 96.68 cents reached during European
trading on Tuesday. The strong bounce came in part because many analysts did not
expect the European Central Bank to act so quickly to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with its surge, the euro remained nearly 17 percent below the high it
reached on its debut Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro's slide was one of the factors stoking inflation fears because it
made imported goods more expensive to the 11 European nations that share the
euro as a common currency.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said there
were several factors behind the decision to raise rates and attempt to cool
inflationary pressures. A recovering economy, higher oil prices and an increase
in the amount of money in circulation, all added to pressures that push up
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Inflation rates are now approaching higher levels than expected earlier,"
Duisenberg warned. "In order to maintain price stability, monetary policy needs
to act in a forward-looking manner."
</P>
<P>
	   In response, the bank -- which adjusts interest rates in an attempt to keep
the region's economy growing while holding inflation below 2 percent -- raised
its main refinancing rate to 3.25 percent. It was the first increase since
November, when the ECB raised the rate by half a percentage point to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising interest rates tends to cool off an overheated economy by making it
more expensive to borrow money. But it also has the added effect of buoying the
local currency because it increases returns on investments in euro-denominated
bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank's rate increase followed a similar interest rate
increase Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, dashing expectations that
the year-old ECB would hold off so it wouldn't be seen as mimicking its American
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Duisenberg said for the first time that the euro's weakness
against the dollar was troubling because it threatens to spur inflation, which
is forecast at 1.5 percent for 2000 in the countries using the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankers estimate that every 10-percent loss in the euro's value increases
inflation by as much as 0.5 percentage points. The euro has already shed 16
percent of its worth since being launched at $1.16 on Jan. 1, 1999, and on
Tuesday the fledgling currency bottoming out at an all-time low of $0.9668.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, economists said the rate hike of only a quarter point will likely
have little long-term impact on the value of the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weakness of the euro is a function of the strength of the U.S. economy,
not a function of how weak the European economy is," said Peter Dixon, an
economist with Commmerzbank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the countries using the euro, the economy is expected to grow around 3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, however, the United States entered its longest economic
expansion ever -- 107 straight months of growth, with 1999 marking the third
straight year with annual growth of 4 percent or more.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Prevents Execution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution
Thursday to an Alabama death row inmate convicted of robbing and killing a rural
grocer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order prevented Robert Lee Tarver Jr., 52, from being executed in
the state's electric chair at Holman Prison at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver, 52, was convicted of the 1984 robbery and slaying of Hugh Sims Kite,
63, outside his bait shop and grocery in Cottonton, near the Georgia line.
Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   In his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Tarver challenged Alabama's use of
the electric chair to execute inmates, claiming it violates his Eighth Amendment
right against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The court had agreed to review Florida's use of the electric chair. But last
month the court decided not to act on the issue because Florida changed its law,
making lethal injection the primary method of execution and the electric chair
an alternative method.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama, Nebraska and Georgia are the only states with the electric chair as
the sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials, in response to Tarver's appeal, said death in the state's
electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Bryan Stevenson argued in clemency requests that blacks
were wrongly excluded from serving on Tarver's jury. A jury of 11 whites and one
black convicted the black defendant of killing Kite, a white man.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Don Siegelman had denied the clemency request Thursday evening before
the high court issued its ruling.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Parents Sue L.A. County  </HEADLINE>
   By CYNTHIA L. WEBB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The adoptive parents of a confessed killer sued Los
Angeles County on Thursday, saying they never would have gone through with the
adoption if they knew their son's birth mother was diagnosed as a chronic
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeremy Strohmeyer, now 21, pleaded guilty in September 1998 to murder,
kidnapping and two counts of sexual assault in the strangling of a 7-year-old
girl in a Nevada casino. He was given four consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   John and Winifred Strohmeyer claim the county and several adoption
department workers engaged in ``despicable conduct,'' fraud and breach of
contract in the 1980 adoption. They are seeking more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Essentially their aim is to get compensation for the actions of the Los
Angeles County adoption agency that had fraudulently withheld information about
Jeremy's birth mother,'' said attorney Gregory Smith, who represents the
Strohmeyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents submitted an adoption intake form in 1979 that stated they did
not want to adopt a child whose parents had a history of drug addiction or
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit contends the county withheld information about Jeremy's
background and indicated that the boy's parents were not drug users and had no
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the Strohmeyers been told of his background, the suit says they ``would
not have adopted Jeremy and would not have incurred the monetary and emotional
burdens, which included the eventual cost of a legal defense of Jeremy.''
</P>
<P>
	   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he would request at Tuesday's Board
of Supervisors meeting that county lawyers brief the board on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the facts are as stated and the county did not fully inform the parents
that there were mental problems with those associated with the child they were
going to adopt, the county is liable,'' Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the family is hoping to cover costs they have spent on the legal
defense of their son, estimated at $600,000, and the cost of raising him.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Elian Could Be Harmed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Hammering away at an insistent theme, mental health experts
said on state television Thursday night that Elian Gonzalez's stay in the United
States could harm his development.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was the third such discussion by Cuban mental health specialists
since the boy was discovered off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25, setting off an
international custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   One expert, Dr. Elsa Nunez, said Elian needs stability in his home and
school life for his thought processes and personality to develop. Nunez said
Elian doesn't appear to be getting either in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Nunez was among a group of child psychologists and psychiatrists who
participated in the broadcast. The panel had to base their opinions on
photographs and televised footage of Elian, since none has had the chance to
observe and talk with the child in person.
</P>
<P>
	   Nunez and the others noted that Elian had begun first grade shortly before
the accident that killed his mother and 10 others during a journey from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not until weeks after Elian's Miami relatives regained temporary
custody of the child that he was enrolled in school in the United States. Since
then, his attendance has been irregular and the child appears to have been
distracted by constant media attention and other disruptions, Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father and four grandparents, along with the Cuban government, are
demanding that the boy be returned to his homeland. Elian's relatives in Miami
are fighting to keep him in the United States, saying that they can give him a
better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   In a decision backed by President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno,
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that the child should be
reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Miami relatives have fought to block the ruling and the INS has
agreed to let the final decision be made later this month by a federal judge in
Miami.

<HEADLINE> Jeb Bush Booed on Affirmative Action  </HEADLINE>
   By VICKIE CHACHERE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush was booed and jeered as he entered a public
hearing Thursday on his plan to end affirmative action in state university
admissions and contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a difficult time for me,'' the Republican governor said.
``The last two weeks I have carried a heavy heart around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials estimated 5,000 people filed into a Miami theater throughout the
eight-hour event, the vast majority of them demanding that Bush drop his plan to
end government set-aside programs for minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd was boisterous, but otherwise peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his plan has been misunderstood: He does not want to exclude
minorities but wants to the state to be more aggressive in ensuring diversity in
ways that ill not be struck down by the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The capacity crowd at the ornate Gusman Center for the Performing Arts had
been sedate until the governor walked in. Their reaction drowned out the
pounding gavel of the hearing's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   As state Sen. Kendrick Meek and his mother, U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla.,
stood to speak out against the plan, the crowd erupted with fists pumping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pain the governor feels is a self-inflicted wound,'' Carrie Meek said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she doubted that the governor's plan would encourage diversity or
that state lawmakers would approve the $20 million to $30 million in financial
aid that would be needed to boost needy minority students' ability to go to
college.
</P>
<P>
	   The public hearings were called last month after two legislators staged a
sit-in in Bush's office. Bush agreed to delay his order ending affirmative
action until the plan was subjected to public hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would guarantee university admissions to the top 20 percent of
each high school's graduating class and use other factors besides race -- such
as socioeconomic status -- to determine who else would be admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   In state contracting, the plan would encourage including businesses owned by
women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the groups recently endorsing Bush's plan is the U.S. Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition is coming from the state's well-rooted civil rights groups and
from some black legislators.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Indiana Sex Case  </HEADLINE>
   By RICK CALLAHAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The former head of the State Excise Police was booked
Thursday after he agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from his acceptance
of sex, drinks and dinners from the owner of two Indianapolis strip clubs,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Honeycutt, who enforced Indiana's alcoholic beverage laws until he
resigned in October, reached a deal under which he agreed to plead guilty to a
felony count of ghost employment and a misdemeanor count of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   If a judge accepts the plea deal, Honeycutt could be sentenced to up to
three years in prison and a $10,000 fine on the ghost employment count and one
year in prison and a $5,000 fine on the official misconduct charge.
</P>
<P>
	   After the booking, Honeycutt was released on his own recognizance. He is
scheduled for an initial hearing March 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Scott Newman said his office's ongoing investigation found
Honeycutt essentially created a group within the excise agency for after-hours
carousing at topless bars.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman said Honeycutt, 47, committed ghost employment when he encouraged
on-duty members of the Special Investigations Unit he formed early last year to
accompany him to two strip clubs for socializing, drinks, dinner and sex with
the club's female employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The official misconduct charge arose from Honeycutt's violation of state law
by accepting gratuities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In short, they were not being paid by the taxpayers to have private booze
and sex parties with strippers on the taxpayer's time and the bar owner's
dime,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Honeycutt said in a statement he reached the plea agreement with prosecutors
to accept responsibility for his actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, I must make it clear that, at no time during my tenure, did I, my
staff, or any other member of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission give favorable
treatment to any specific bar owner or permit holder,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Damages Bolivia  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER McFARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- An oil spill in an Andean river flowing from
Bolivia's Lake Titicaca has killed wildlife and is hurting hundreds of Indian
farmers who depend on the river, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clean up crews were trying to contain damage from the spill, which occurred
Sunday when a flash flood broke a crude oil pipeline. Hundreds of barrels of oil
spilled into the Desaguadero River that flows into Lake Poopo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, dead birds and fish could be see along the river shores, which
were covered with a layer of oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Aymara Indians in the region depend on the river for fishing, for their
drinking water and as a source of crop irrigation for farming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This ecological disaster could have serious consequences for us since we
rely on the river for our food and water,'' said Julio Ticona, whose farm
touches river shores.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has deployed military and civil defense personnel to help mop
up oil. Cleanup equipment was expected to arrived from the Unites States.
</P>
<P>
	   The government sent investigators to the area, 100 miles south of La Paz, to
determine the exact amount of oil that spilled, the areas affected and what can
be done to contain the damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Minister of Sustainable Development Erick Reyes Villa said the government is
considering fining the pipeline operator, saying it did not notify the
government about the oil spill until 24 hours after it had occurred.

    PHOENIX (AP) -- Ed Belfour made 19 saves for his 48th career shutout and the
Dallas Stars beat the Phoenix Coyotes 2-0 Thursday night, leaving the teams tied
for the Pacific Division lead going into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour, who has won seven of his last eight starts, has three shutouts this
season and is the career leader among active goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour's chances were aided when Phoenix's Shane Doan was handed a
five-minute major penalty and game misconduct for checking Richard Jackman into
the boards from behind with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes managed only three shots on goal in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano scored and Brendan Morrow added a goal and an assist for the
Stars, who won for the sixth time in seven games and snapped the Coyotes'
five-game home winning streak. Phoenix had not lost at home since dropping a 5-4
decision to Edmonton on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the loss, the Coyotes entered the three-day break with a share of
the division lead for the first time in franchise history. Phoenix and Dallas
each have 65 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow did most of the damage single-handedly in the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Just over a minute into the game, he deflected Teppo Numminen's pass off the
defenseman's stick across the front of the crease. Morrow gained control of the
puck to the right of the net. Bob Essensa stopped the first shot, but Morrow
scored on the rebound to give Dallas a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow also had a hand in the Stars' second goal at 15:51 of the first
period. Morrow grabbed the puck out of the air to the left of the crease,
dropped it onto his stick and shot from close range.
</P>
<P>
	   Essensa again made the initial save, but Modano took the rebound to the left
of the net, circled back to the left faceoff circle and flipped a quick wrist
shot over the Essensa's outstretched glove for his team-leading 22nd goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes' best scoring chance came midway through the second period when
a Dallas bench minor for too many men and a delay penalty on Belfour gave
Phoenix a two-man advantage for 1:09. But Belfour, who just over a minute
earlier stopped Jyrki Lumme on a two-on-one rush, stopped both shots he faced to
preserve the shutout.

<HEADLINE> President Asks To Preserve Tropics  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying too many of the world's life forms are threatened
by logging and deforestation, President Clinton is asking Congress for $150
million to help preserve tropical forests in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget plan for fiscal 2001 sets aside $150 million for a
Greening the Globe initiative to help more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia and
Latin America conserve forests that are home to a diverse range of life forms --
and that are now threatened by logging or other activities. That figure
represents an 88 percent increase over funding in the current budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House planned to announced the initiative Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal could help countries like Indonesia, the leading exporter of
tropical timber and home to about 10 percent of the world's primate species, or
Bolivia, where deforestation is a threat to the biological diversity of the
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
	   Tropical forests support more than half of the planet's life forms. But they
are disappearing at a rate of more than 50 acres a minute due to activity such
as illegal logging or deliberate land clearing for agriculture. That means about
100 different species are lost each day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tropical forests continue to be destroyed at a disturbing rate,'' said
George Frampton, acting chairman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality. ``The president feels strongly that the United States should do more to
stem this loss and to help developing countries strengthen their economies by
preserving their forests.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan was cheered by conservationists who say it would encourage
other nations and private entities to take up the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the government states that this is a priority and invests more in it,
it sends a strong message to private donors, that they're doing the right thing,
and it catalyzes further investment,'' said Russ Mittermeier, president of
Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, $100 million would go to U.S. Agency for International
Development forest conservation programs. An additional $37 million would be
used to reduce the debt of developing nations that commit to investing local
currency in forest conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   A further $10 million would go into Forest Service research into forest fire
prevention and $3 million would be used to fund Fish and Wildlife Service
efforts to protect endangered elephants, tigers and rhinos in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose a new venture by USAID and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to compile satellite maps of tropical
forests and monitor changes in them from outer space.

<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Loren Woods blocked three shots the first time Oregon
had the ball. He was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
	   "Loren sent a message on the first possession," Arizona coach Lute Olson
said. It didn't get through.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks kept coming, Woods kept swatting them away until he had tied the
NCAA record with 14 blocks, and No. 9 Arizona pulled away over the final three
minutes to beat the 23rd-ranked Ducks 77-71 Thursday night in a showdown of two
of the Pac-10's leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods also scored 16 points, 12 in the second half, and grabbed 10 rebounds
for Arizona's first triple double since Damon Stoudamire had one against Oregon
in 1995. It was the first triple double by a Pac-10 player since UCLA's Toby
Bailey did it against Stephen F. Austin early in the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona (18-4, 7-1) trailed most of the game and never led by more than two
points until the last 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, a 7-foot-1 junior transfer from Wake Forest, gave the Wildcats the
lead for good at 73-71 on a rebound basket with 1:03 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, who had 10 blocks against Washington State earlier this season,
equaled the NCAA mark set by David Robinson of Navy in 1986 and tied by Shawn
Bradley of BYU in 1990 and Roy Rogers of Alabama in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were not afraid to bring the ball inside," Woods said. "They kept
coming at me."
</P>
<P>
	   But Ducks coach Ernie Kent said his players were too timid once they got the
ball inside.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think we came at the him with any intensity," Kent said. "It was
more of a finesse game. You can't play him that way. You need to play a power
game."
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon (15-4, 6-2) lost for the 15th consecutive time at McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks had only one field goal over the final 6:06, A.D. Smith's
3-pointer that put Oregon up for the last time, 71-69, with 3:46 to play.
Arizona scored the final eight points of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Scales led Oregon with 18 points but fouled out with three minutes to
play. Smith scored 16 points and Anthony Norwood added 11 for the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Wright had 20 points and nine rebounds as Arizona consistently
pounded the ball inside in the second half. Gilbert Arenas scored 15 points and
Jason Gardner added 10 for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats were 27-for-36 from the free throw line, compared with Oregon's
2-for-3.
</P>
<P>
	   "For Arizona to shoot 36 free throws, while we shot three, and we still had
a chance to win. Well, that says a lot about our team," said Kent, who is 0-5
against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks stayed in it from 3-point range, going 9-for-25 compared with
Arizona's 2-for-9.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner, who struggled through a 1-for-7 shooting night and is 2-for-17 in
his last two games, made one of two free throws to tie it at 71-71 with three
minutes to play, then made four in a row from the line over the final 23 seconds
to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' 14th block came on Freddie Jones' drive with 45 seconds to play.
Oregon put up a flurry of 3-point tries after that, most of them by Jones, but
couldn't connect. Jones finished 1-for-11 from the field, 0-for-5 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-pointers by Norwood and Scales capped a 14-5 run that put the Ducks up
37-27 with 2:34 left in the half. But Arizona scored the last seven points of
the half to make it 37-34.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon led by as many as five points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods already has broken the Arizona record for blocked shots in a season
with 90. The old mark of 84 was set by Anthony Cook in 1987. Woods is on track
to break Mario Bennett of Arizona State's Pac-10 mark of 115.

<HEADLINE> Iowa 77, No. 15 Kansas 69  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- During every timeout against No. 15 Kansas, Iowa
coach Steve Alford slammed his clipboard to the floor and yelled at the Hawkeyes
loud enough to be heard 12 rows up from the court.
</P>
<P>
	   And the first-year Iowa coach said he was actually having fun.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the Hawkeyes, despite being outrebounded 45-29, turned in a
defensive gem in a 77-69 victory over the Jayhawks on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought our kids did an incredible job on defense. I enjoyed watching our
defense," said Alford, whose team held Kansas to 42.4 percent shooting and
forced 22 turnovers. "Our kids understood their roles and did an excellent job."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacob Jaacks had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Rod Thompson sparked Iowa
with 14 points off the bench as the Hawkeyes beat the Jayhawks for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought their body language and motion in the last six minutes was,
'We've got a chance.' I thought our body language and motion was, 'Oh my
goodness, what are we going to do?' " Kansas coach Roy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got to congratulate Iowa, especially in the second half. When there
were key shots to be made, Iowa made them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Griffin and Dean Oliver each had 10 points for the Hawkeyes (10-10), who
withstood a career-high 21 points and 10 rebounds from Nick Collison, the
freshman from Iowa Falls who ignored the jeering crowd that yelled "sell out"
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Collison, who thought about attending Iowa but backed out during the
coaching transition from Tom Davis to Alford, didn't want to talk about the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   "I played all right, but it doesn't really matter. It doesn't make you feel
any better," said Collison, whose previous best was 20 points against Pittsburg
State in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenny Gregory finished with 12 points for Kansas (16-5), which has lost
three of four, including 74-66 at Iowa State last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike like last year's 85-81 victory in which Iowa fought back from an
18-point deficit over the final 12:52, the Hawkeyes never trailed by more than
eight points -- and that was in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks rattled Iowa with their pressure, forcing 15 turnovers over the
first 20 minutes while opening a 29-25 lead. But the Hawkeyes, who have won
three of four, settled down in the second half, turning the ball over just
twice.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Bradford's three-point play early in the second half gave Kansas a
38-33 lead, but Iowa scored nine of the next 11 points to take a 42-40 lead --
its first since the opening minutes -- with 15:12 left.
</P>
<P>
	   A right-handed hook shot by Collison over Jaacks and then a putback by
Collison fueled a 6-0 run that gave the Jayhawks a 55-51 lead with 8:50 left.
</P>
<P>
	   A jumper by Ryan Luehrsmann cut Kansas' lead to two and then Kyle Galloway
hit a 3-pointer from the left wing for a 56-55 Iowa lead with 7:35 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gooden made one of two free throws to slice the Hawkeyes' lead to one
before Galloway drilled another 3-pointer from the same spot that extended
Iowa's lead to 60-56 with 5:14 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway's shot ignited a 12-4 run, capped by Jaacks' two free throws, that
gave the Hawkeyes a 69-60 lead with 2:38 left and Kansas got no closer than six
points the rest of the way.

    SALT LAKE CITY(AP) -- Glenn Robinson's 3-pointer at the buzzer gave the
Milwaukee Bucks a 102-99 victory over Utah Thursday night, giving the Jazz a
five-game losing streak for the first time in almost six years.
</P>
<P>
	   With the score tied 99-99, Robinson took an inbounds pass from Vinny Del
Negro and stepped back and sank the shot over the outstretched arm of Adam
Keefe. Robinson was 4-for-4 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Allen, who scored a season-high 36 points for Milwaukee, made 5-of-7
3-pointers. Allen and hit three free throws in the final minute to help the
Bucks win for the first time in eight games at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone led the Jazz with 28 points. John Stockton added 18, Bryon
Russell 14 and Jeff Hornacek 12.
</P>
<P>

answered. Allen sank 3-of-4 free throws in the final minute to give the Bucks a
99-97 advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton answered with a driving layup with 2.6 seconds remaining to tie it
99-99.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, selected to join Allen as an East All-Star reserve, hit a long
jumper with 1:00 remaining to give the Bucks a 96-95 lead. Karl Malone answered
with two free throws to reclaim the advantage for Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz haven't lost five consecutive games since March 1994, a stretch of
435 games.
</P>

the right side. The Bucks are accustomed to Malone's big games, having seen him
score a season-high 40 points on Nov. 20 at Milwaukee.
</P>

	   Notes: After the opening minute of play, Hornacek reached the 30,000-minute
mark for his career. ... Malone gave Bucks coach George Karl a playful smack to
the head after inbounding the ball in front of the visitors' bench in the first

<HEADLINE> White House Presses ATF Powers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is doing on a small scale what
it has not yet convinced Congress or the gun industry to do on a large one --
crack down on gun dealers who sell a disproportionate number of the weapons used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton plans to release a report Friday backing up the White
House claim that a small number of gun dealers are responsible for putting a
large number of guns in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study shows 1 percent of gun
dealers account for 57 percent of guns the ATF can trace from use in a crime
back to the point the gun was sold, said deputy domestic policy adviser Eric
Liu.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, Liu said the administration will extend the ATF's powers
to check up on possible rogue dealers and trace stolen guns. The new powers,
which do not require congressional approval, include intense inspections of the
dealers most suspected of supplying criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a smaller number of suspect dealers will be required to provide
information on the sale of used guns in the same way they now compile data for
new guns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best thing that can be done, short of new laws ... given the
deadlock in Congress,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and one of the most
persistent voices in Congress for more gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer released two reports last year that also pointed to a relative
handful of rogue or suspect dealers as the source of many criminals' guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study showed that in 1998, 1,020 of the nation's 83,272 licensed
gun dealers and pawnbrokers were each the source of at least 10 guns later
traced to crimes, and 132 dealers were linked to 50 or more such guns. Not all
the guns were sold directly by the suspect dealers -- some were apparently lost
or stolen and some passed through multiple hands before they were used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's push for new gun control measures collapsed in Congress last year,
despite what White House attempts to use public outrage over the Columbine
shooting as leverage against the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has pledged to renew the fight this year for trigger locks
on handguns and for new laws governing the sale of guns at flea market-style gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has also made little headway in its attempt to pressure the
gun industry to negotiate with cities suing over the cost of gun violence.
Representatives of both dealers and manufacturers met separately with White
House officials after the administration threatened in December to help bring a
national lawsuit, but neither side has had much to say since.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been focused on trying to engage dealers and manufacturers who are
serious about changing the way they do business,'' Liu said. He would not
comment on whether the new ATF powers give the administration greater leverage
in those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers, said the new
rules are pointless, because the government already has broad power to police
dealers and raid those suspected of criminal conduct.

	   Tulsa (21-2, 6-1 Western Athletic Conference), normally cool under pressure,
appeared so on edge that Self found little to praise except the final score.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some good moments but we just didn't play very smart," Self said.
"All we did right tonight was we tried real hard, but we didn't show much
poise."
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Coley scored 14 points for the Golden Hurricane, who forced 23
turnovers -- 15 on steals -- and blocked eight shots while holding the Mustangs
(16-5, 4-3) to 24 percent shooting, including 1-of-18 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were lucky tonight because they missed their shots," Self said. "Other
than a win, I didn't see much good come out of this."
</P>
<P>
	   Foul trouble nearly cost the Golden Hurricane late.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulsa lost sixth-man David Shelton to fouls with 6 1/2 minutes to go, Coley
fouled out with 3:18 remaining and center Brandon Kurtz, who had 10 points, did
the same a minute later.
</P>
<P>
	   SMU (16-5, 4-3), which had second-half runs of 13-2 and 9-0, was able to get
within four points in the final minutes before Tulsa pulled away.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think for the most part, any win is a good win," Coley said. "It got ugly
out there, but we know we can play better."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Heard added 11 points and four steals for the Golden Hurricane, while
Marcus Hill had 10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeryl Sasser had 15 points for the Mustangs, who finished with a 58-42
rebound advantage, while Willie Davis added 13 points and had four steals.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Sasser and Davis fouled out in the final minutes and SMU's rally
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I admired their defense in the first half," SMU coach Mike Dement said of
Tulsa. "They really bodied us well. ... They certainly have great scorers and
have lots of guys that play. Their young guys are contributing. "I'm proud of
our guys for battling back."
</P>
<P>
	   Coley's 3-pointer with 7 1/2 minutes left in the first half made him only
the second player in Tulsa history to register 1,000 career points, 500 rebounds
and 200 steals.

<HEADLINE> Pieces of Downed Airline Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers found the tail of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 and recovered the flight data recorder Thursday, two pieces key to
determining why the jetliner plummeted into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Underwater robots exploring the ocean floor found where the wreckage came to
rest after the MD-83 crashed Monday, killing all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A submersible sent up video images of a piece of the fuselage with four
windows, several large pieces up to six feet wide and numerous smaller pieces.
The airline's logo -- the smiling face of an Alaskan Eskimo -- is clearly
visible on the tail, said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The robot also captured pictures of the horizontal stabilizer, which has
been the focus of the investigation, he said. NTSB officials said they were not
able to describe the condition of the tail and stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt declined to say whether searchers had found any bodies, some
of which are believed trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews had earlier salvaged the cockpit voice recorder from about 640
feet of water. The flight data recorder recovered Thursday about 200 feet away
would show the positions of the plane's controls and whether a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer on the tail was merely a symptom of a larger failure that
led to Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims gathered
along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel for a private memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it. On Thursday,
Hammerschmidt detailed interviews with Alaska mechanics, who described helping
the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway stabilizer,'' which forced the plane's nose
down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. The rest made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing on the tail of an aircraft, is designed to adjust --
or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``You're handflying it and having to
maintain a considerable amount of pressure on the controls to keep the plane
straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave airlines 18
months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of corrosion. An
error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no unusual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy decided Thursday to detain a Russian tanker
stopped in the Persian Gulf, pending a decision on whether to seize oil U.S.
officials believe came from Iraq in violation of a U.N. embargo. Russian
officials said the oil came from Iran. The Pentagon said the commercial ship is
to be diverted to a yet-to-be-determined anchorage in international waters and
then possibly turned over to a third country.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's president agreed Thursday to swear in a
coalition government that includes a far-right party whose leader Joerg Haider
has applauded aspects of Nazi Germany and who campaigned on an anti-immigrant
platform. The prospect of Haider's Freedom Party in government prompted about
2,000 protesters to take to the streets of Vienna late Thursday for a second
straight night. Despite the outcry both at home and abroad, President Thomas
Klestil said the results of the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections give him little
choice but to go ahead with the swearing-in ceremony Friday.
