<HEADLINE> Russian Rocket Force Ends Redeployment From Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Strategic Rocket
Force Friday completed the redeployment of the Amba testing ground
from Kazakhstan to the Kapustin Yar Central Comprehensive pad in
Astrakhan region in southwestern Russia.
</P>
<P>
The last train with personnel and equipment for the
redeployment from Kazakhstan arrived at Kapustin Yar Friday, one
and a half months ahead of schedule, Russian Strategic Rocket
Force press secretary Ilshat Baichurin said.
</P>
<P>
The move was conducted in keeping with a pertinent presidential
decree and government resolution, the Interfax news agency quoted
Baichurin as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Vladimir Yakovlev, the redeployment will bring
"the structure of Kapustin Yar closer to the real volume of
today's tasks."
</P>
<P>
"Military personnel will be slashed by over 2,000 people
without hurting the quality of arms tests. The cost of renting the
ground and maintaining troops abroad was cut by approximately 8
million U.S. dollars per year," Yakovlev said.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Lodges Fresh Protest With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgia lodged a protest with
Russia Friday against an alleged violation of its air space by a
Russian fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
It came just two days after a previous protest over an earlier
incident that allegedly involved three Russian helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Avtandil Napetvaridze said
a Russian Su-25 attack plane flew some 15 kilometers in and around
Shatili on the Chechen section along the Georgian-Russian border
Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported in a dispatch from
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
The note contained a resolute protest and a demand to find and
reprimand persons who had planned and carried out the violation,
otherwise Georgia would appeal to the world community against
Russia's ignoring Georgia's sovereignty, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are conducting a major campaign against
rebels in Chechnya. Moscow has said repeatedly that arms supply
and fighters find their way into Chechnya through the border with
Georgia, an allegation denied by Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Georgian Foreign Ministry said that three
Russian combat helicopters shot at Georgian territory, also near
the village of Shatili.
</P>
<P>
"The said action which cannot be described otherwise than a
direct aggression against a sovereign state is a continuation of a
planned anti-Georgian propaganda campaign waged by certain circles
in Russia's top echelons of power to involve Georgia by any means
in the war in the Caucasus," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Russian leadership "to stop aggressive actions
against sovereign Georgia and also to find and hold responsible
the officials who planned and carried out the criminal action."
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Defense Ministry Thursday denied the
charges as deliberate misinformation aimed at harming the
traditional and friendly Russian-Georgian relations and misleading
the world public in its views of the Russian troops' actual moves
to eliminate bandits and terrorists in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Celebrate Opening of World Longest Narrow-Gauge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- People in Switzerland's largest
canton, Graubunden, began their three-day celebrations Friday to
mark the opening of the longest narrow gauge rail tunnel in the
world, Vereina Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
After eight years of construction, the 19.5-kilometer-long
tunnel will connect the Lower Engadine Valley and the southern Val
Muestair with the northern part of the canton located in eastern
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Braubunden authorities hope that the tunnel, built with 571
million Swiss francs (about 400 million U.S. dollars) will bring
several improvements to local people, tourists and local
companies.
</P>
<P>
The trains are constructed especially for the car transports
through the Vereina Tunnel and there's enough space to transport
even buses and trucks up to 12 meters long and weighing 28 tons.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new line will boost tourism in the
region because the National Park can now be visited from cities
like Zurich, Basel, St Gallen or Bern in a one-day trip.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy Spokesman Slams U.S. House Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Chinese
embassy in the United States Friday expressed his "deep regret" at
a resolution adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives
criticizing the Chinese government's crackdown on the Falun Gong
cult.
</P>
<P>
"To our deep regret, some American lawmakers, by attacking
the Chinese govenment's handling of the Falun Gong case, have
chosen to associate themselves with, and indeed to act as the
apologists for, such a deadly and infamous cult," said Yu
Shuning, spokesman of the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
"While expressing our strong resentment and resolute
opposition to their act, I would like to appeal them not to
tarnish their great institution by supporting an evil cult so as
to spare China-U.S. relations from gratuitous harm," Yu said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted the concurrent
resolution late Thursday evening, asking the Chinese government to
"stop its persecution" of Falun Gong practitioners and urging the
U.S. administration to pressure China to release the detained
Falun Gong members and allow them freedom to practice.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers who supported the resolution were either biased
against China or did not know much about the situation, Yu Shuning
said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is neither an organization of religious belief nor
an organization of Qigong, a form of breathing exercise popular
among the Chinese people, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
It is an evil cult widely known for spreading heretic ideas,
causing violent deaths and massive sufferings of its followers,
disrupting public order and undermining social stability, the
spokesman said, adding that the cult has brought about 1,404
deaths in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government was compelled to act quickly and
resolutely to head off this social scourge so as to protect
human rights and interests of the Chinese people, he added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Loan Mozambique $100M for Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has promised a
loan of 100 million U.S. dollars to help finance the
reconstruction of the railway linking the central port city of
Beira through Malawi to the coal mines of Moatize in western Tete
Province.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will provide 100 million dollars for the
reinstatement of the Dondo-Moatize railway, Rui Fonseca, Chairman
of the Board of Directors of the publicly-owned Mozambican Railway
Company, told the Mozambique News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the only one of the country's major rail lines that has
not yet been rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
For Mozambique, the line is crucial since it provides the most
economic way of moving Moatize coal to port.
</P>
<P>
But from a regional point of view the line is significant
because it provides southern Malawi with its cheapest and quickest
outlet to the sea.
</P>
<P>
This railway was comprehensively sabotaged by the
apartheid-backed Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) rebels in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca estimated that the money necessary for the whole job
amounts to 300 million dollars and Mozambique is currently
negotiating with Spain, Australia and Canada to raise the
remaining amount.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction will be in stages, starting with the
254-kilometer stretch between Moatize and Mutarara, in Tete, where
it connects with the line branching into Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction should start soon, but depends on mine
clearance yet to be undertaken along the railway, Fonseca said.
</P>
<P>
A source with the National Demining Commission said that some
two million dollars are required for the demining work along the
500- kilometer of the Moatize line.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends Current U.N. Oil-For-Food  Deal In Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Friday unanimously approved the extension of
the current U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq for two weeks until
December 4.
</P>
<P>
The move came after weeks of private discussion among the five
permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant resolutions of the Security Council, Iraq
can export about 8.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the
current phase which began on May 25 and expires on November 4.
</P>
<P>
But it is estimated that Iraq can only sell about 7.2 billion
dollars worth of oil by the end of this phase, 1 billion dollars
short of the ceiling set up by the Security Council. The council
decided to give Iraq two-week extra time to reach that account.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented
in late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell 5.2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities
for its people.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Dioxin Limits For Kaolinitic Clays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that it adopted a regulation establishing as an emergency
measure a provisional maximum dioxin limit of 0.5 ng/kg product
for kaolinitic clays.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's executive body took this step after a
contamination of dioxins was found in clays originating in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The maximum limit shall be reviewed before March 1, 2000 in the
light of a complete risk assessment and/or the results of the
monitoring program, the commission said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the urgency of the matter, the measure will be
notified to the WTO as an emergency measure immediately after the
adoption of the regulation," it said.
</P>
<P>
Kaolinitic clays can be used as feed additive in feeding stuff,
as binder, anti-caking agent and coagulant. Kaolinitic clays
originating from certain mines situated in Germany have been found
to contain high levels of dioxins. The contamination is most
likely of geological origin, the EU executive said.
</P>
<P>
The contamination of the kaolinitic clay could in fact concern
also other clays authorized for use as binders, anti-caking agents
and coagulants, it is appropriate to examine in the framework of
the monitoring program the possible presence of dioxins in all
authorized clays, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that in the absence of any
monitoring data, the analytical limit of determination (0.5 ng/kg
product) will apply to all other authorized clays as from March 1,
2000, the commission added.

<HEADLINE> Beef Labeling Not Concession: British Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The idea of identifying
exported British beef with labels is not a concession to France,
the British Ministry of Agriculture said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The idea, put forward by the European Commission as a way out
of the Anglo-French beef row, is nothing new, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
"Labeling is already a condition of the Date Based Export
Scheme," the spokesman said, referring to the scheme under which
the European Union earlier this year agreed to the resumption of
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed talk of a concession to France.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said Friday Britain's beef exports
could carry labels identifying them as British.
</P>
<P>
Britain's opposition Conservative party said the labeling was
a compromise that let down British farmers.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union's single market rules, member states
cannot insist on compulsory consumer labeling for exported beef as
"made in Britain."
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission said the word British could be
allowed if it referred to the approved export scheme.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top
legislator Li Peng visited Saldanha Steel Plant outside Cape Town
on Friday, showing great interest in its combined COREX-DR process
that turns iron ore into steel sheets in just 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), was briefed on the technology in the
demonstration room of the plant by Chief Executive Officer of the
company Bernard Smith.
</P>
<P>
Smith told Li that the company's motto is to provide green
steel products at a competitive price.
</P>
<P>
Li asked about measures the plant takes to ensure a pollution
free production of steel and the coal it uses.
</P>
<P>
When he was told the plant uses coal containing12 percent of
dust, Li showed kin interest in the dedusting process of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
In the smelting shop, Li watched carefully the performance of
the furnaces, and asked about the fineness of the grains of ore
and coal in the furnaces as well as the process used to remove
sulphur.
</P>
<P>
Showing his interest in the electrodes, the volume of the
furnaces and the time needed for smelting, the NPC Chairman took
out a pad to take notes.
</P>
<P>
Company officials were astonished by Li's knowledge in
metallurgy. "His questions were specific and most of them were the
right ones," Smith said, adding that "he understands the details."
</P>
<P>
Li is on an official good-will visit to South Africa, the
second leg of his six Afro-Asian tour which will also take him to
Kenya, Israel, Palestine and Oman. His first station is Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Final-Status Talks Face Red Lines: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side has set
their "red lines" that they said can not be compromised in their
ongoing final-status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
There are "red lines" in the talks, said Secretary General of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Ahmed Abdul-Rahman here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was perhaps in response to the "red lines" set by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak early this month in Oslo, where he
conferred with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and together held
a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel will, in the talks on a permanent peace with
the Palestinians, be steadfast in keeping Jerusalem as its
capital, put Jewish settlements under its sovereignty, deny the
return of Palestinian refugees and reject any foreign troops west
of the Jordan river.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Rahman told the Palestine Television that the first
Palestinian red line is the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank,
Jerusalem and Gaza Strip to the June 4, 1967" borders.
</P>
<P>
This red line is in accordance with the U.N. Security Council
resolution 242 providing for Israel's withdrawal from all the
Palestinian and Arab territories occupied in the 1867 Mideast War,
Abdul-Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
"The second red line is the Palestinian and world rejection of
Jerusalem's annexation to Israel," he said, adding that no country
in the world recognized the annexation except for El-Salvador and
Costa Rica that backtracked on their positions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the holy city of Jerusalem was an Islamic as well
as Christian red line that could not be conceded.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth red line is the refugee issue on which the
U.N. Security Council passed the resolution 194 providing for the
return of the refugees who were forced out their homes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel failed to join the United Nations until it sent a
message to the president of the U.N. General Assembly recognizing
the resolution 194, thereby it should implement it, Abdul-Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
He referred to other Palestinian causes including water and
Jewish settlements and described them as "the core of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian stance on the settlements is as clear as the
Sun. The settlements must meet the same fate as the former Israeli
Bamit settlement, in the Egyptian Sinai" peninsula, the PNA
official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew all settlements from Sinai and returned it to
Egypt after the two signed a peace treaty in 1978, the first
between the Jewish state and an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
On November 8, the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators resumed
the final-status talks with a view to reaching a speedy final
settlement of the disputes on Jerusalem, water, borders, refugees
and Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> Clerides: Cyprus Talks Hinge on Denktash Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafoes
Clerides said on Friday in Istanbul that no result can be yielded
if Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted on his view of
confederation on Cyprus during the indirect talks to be held in
New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remark in a news conference held after he
attended the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Summit, according to Anatolian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks, which attracted attention of the
international community, the United States and the European Union,
will be different from previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference the same day in Istanbul, Denktash
said he would go to New York with the hope of reaching a
conclusion of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "real and full equality is the main element of
peace and solution," saying that he had put forward several
proposals with the aim of contributing the United Nations'
mission. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Denktash said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who was in Istanbul for the OSCE summit, wanted to meet him,
adding that he would set forth his view of the framework on the
indirect meetings in his talks with Annan.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of an aborted coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two sides on the island have
not been held over the past two years because of preconditions set
by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots for the recognition of the
breakaway republic in the north.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Denies Crisis Between Egypt, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- There is no problem between
Egypt and the U.S. on dealing with a EgyptAir flight crash despite
some complaints from Egyptians, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel or believe that there is any crisis at all
(between Egypt and the U.S.) regarding the doomed flight," Moussa
told Egyptian reporters after meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was in Istanbul attending a two-day summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Flight 990 of EgyptAir, the country's national carrier, crashed
on October 31 into the sea off the eastern coast of the U.S. less
than an hour after takeoff, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators suspected the crash may be caused by a
suicide of a co-pilot. Egyptians have been shocked and angered by
the allegation, accusing the U.S. of covering something that may
otherwise lead to the tragedy instead.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for further investigations to reveal the cause,
stressing that "intensive work is required in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Most of the reports about a crisis between Egypt and the U.S.
"were based on fact on mere speculations resting on premature
leakages," a move that "led to untrue conclusions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that the two countries will cooperate in
finding out the results that "will clarify matters" to every party
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sent senior aviation and intelligence officials to
assist the U.S. in the investigations into the crash.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here Friday evening for a 24-hour official visit to
Greece.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement upon his arrival at the Athens
international airport, Clinton said that he wanted through the
visit to demonstrate the Americans the significant role that
greece plays today in southeastern Europe in terms of stability
and economic vigor.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned both a solution to the long-standing Cyprus
problem and the notion of "building a Europe in which the Balkans
are stabilized."
</P>
<P>
A complete flight ban was in effect over Attica prefecture as
Clinton, accompanied by his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea,
arrived aboard Air Force 1. Security in and around the airport was
described as draconian.
</P>
<P>
In downtown Athens, about 6,000 demonstrators gathered in the
Syntagma square to protest against the U.S. policy toward the
Balkan region and Clinton's first-ever visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
While holding banners with slogans against imperialism, the
demonstrators chanted anti-American slogans and burnt U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the demonstrators had approved a resolution
intended to be delivered to the U.S. embassy stating they opposed
"a denial to exercise their inalienable right against the
barbarity of the new world order."
</P>
<P>
Despite the 7,000-strong police force, the demonstrators
attempted to march to the U.S. embassy and clashed with the police
force.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was due to in Athens last Saturday, has delayed
and shortened his visit to Greece amid security concern and waves
of anti-American protests.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Clinton will meet with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis and main opposition
New Democracy leader Costas Karamanlis to discuss Greek-Turkish
ties, the Cyprus problem, Greek-U.S. relations and other issues of
common interest.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the U.S. will also sign agreements to strengthen
their cooperation in tourism, copyright and intellectual rights,
natural disaster aid and earthquake forecasting during Clinton's
visit.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends Current U.N. Oil-For-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Friday unanimously approved the extension of
the current U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq for two weeks until
December 4.
</P>
<P>
The move came after weeks of private discussion among the five
permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant resolutions of the Security Council, Iraq
can export about 8.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the
current phase which began on May 25 and expires on November 4.
</P>
<P>
But it is estimated that Iraq can only sell about 7.2 billion
dollars worth of oil by the end of this phase, 100 million dollars
short of the ceiling set up by the Security Council. The council
decided to give Iraq two-week extra time to reach that account.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented
in late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell 5.2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities
for its people.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Eye Disease Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- About 400 eye experts
gathered here Friday to discuss the prevention and treatment of
eye diseases in the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the three-day conference, Nepali Prime Minister
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai said that as most people in the South
Asian countries lack modern eye treatment, the role of all eye
experts will be important in the cause of eye treatment of all
diseases.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Minister for Health Dr. Ram Baran Yadav
launched the "Vision 2020" program, which aims to treat all kinds
of blindness in South Asia by the year 2020 under the slogan
"Vision 2020: the Right to Sight".
</P>
<P>
Various eye diseases are prevalent in South Asia. Most people
developed cataract and blindness at the infant stage due to lack
of proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that nearly 50 percent of the world's blind
population falls in South Asia, whereas around 150,000 Nepalese
people are suffering from blindness. But only 70 eye specialists
are available in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The experts participating the conference came from 15 countries
of Europe, Latin America, as well as the South Asia. 200 working
papers will be presented on eye diseases.

<HEADLINE> Pak Reiterates Its Will for Good Ties with All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday reiterated
its will to develop good relations with all countries, with an
emphasis putting on ties with major powers, Islamic nations and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
This was stated when Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed
gave a detailed briefing to Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf on the country's foreign policy with particular focus on
its future direction, according to an official press statement
here.
</P>
<P>
The briefing was held in the Foreign Office where General
Musharraf stayed for the whole day and Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar was present, too.
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Pakistan's "positive" approaches to the
non-proliferation issue and the Afghan issue as well as its
continued support to the Kashmiris were also stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that Pakistan wants good relations with all
countries on the basis of sovereign equality and non-interference
in the internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said Pakistan will continue to engage
with the United States on various important issues with
sensitivity and "in the spirit of traditional friendship which has
characterized Pakistan-U.S. relations".
</P>
<P>
The improved relations with Russia were considered of great
significance. "Pakistan would continue to endeavor for enhancement
of economic and commercial ties and an across-the-board expansion
of relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
Relations with the Islamic world particularly with the Gulf
countries were considered as the key element in Pakistan's foreign
policy. "These relations would be further strengthened in all
fields," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive was informed that high priority was
accorded to reinforcing of the "traditionally friendly and close"
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Relations with China are the cornerstone of the foreign policy
of Pakistan." The enduring nature of the Sino-Pak friendship was
strongly reaffirmed. "Pakistan will further consolidate its
strategic relationship with China in the coming millennium."
</P>
<P>
However, Shamshad noted the "compulsive Indian hostility" "with
great regret". "Nevertheless, Pakistan would maintain its positive
attitude towards a purposeful dialogue with India for resolution
of all disputes including the core issue of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
It was stated that Pakistan will steadfastly continue to extend
moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris until the
attainment of their right of self-determination in accordance with
the U.N. Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the nuclear issue, the statement said "it was
agreed that Pakistan would continue its policy of responsibility
and restraint and maintain a minimum credible nuclear deterrence
in the interest of regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad reiterated that Pakistan desires durable peace,
stability and national reconciliation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"A broad-based government in Afghanistan would be in the
interest of the Afghan people," the statement said, adding that
"Pakistan would continue to cooperate with the Six Plus Two and
friendly countries for consolidation of peace in Afghanistan and
encourage greater engagement between Taliban and the international
community."

kilometers west of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and foreign rescue teams are continuing to search for

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pledges Support for Africa's Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Nations General Assembly Then-Ben Gurirab Friday pledged that the
United Nations will continue its strong support for Africa's
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of marking the Africa
Industrialization Day, November 20, Gurirab said that with the
globalization of economic activities, Africa faces a number of
challenges and it is yet to adequately define workable policies
and structures to meet the demands of the changing global business
environment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there are opportunities for African countries
to establish meaningful alliances with other countries in Europe,
Asia and the Americas, Gurirab said,
</P>
<P>
For Africa to become a competitive parter in the global
economy, concrete steps need to be taken to transform the
continent's enormous natural resources into manufactured products
that will satisfy the basic needs of its people, and in this
regard, African countries, with the support of the development
partners and the multilateral agencies, would redouble their
efforts in developing small and medium enterprises throughout the
continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The private sector is expected to play a lead role in Africa's
industrialization, yet, in most cases, it is extremely weak, has
limited access to finance and technology, and this sector's role
in Africa's industrialization has to be sustained, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization of the U.N. system, in particular, the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization, the Economic
Commission for Africa and the Food and Agricultural Organization,
must work closely together in helping Africa to successfully
produce agricultural raw material on a sustainable basis, Gurirab
stressed.
</P>
<P>
They should also assist African countries in effectively and
efficiently processing such raw material at the national and
subregional levels, to ensure a stable source of income for the
majority of the farming communities in Africa and provide
employment for both the rural and urban populations at the factory
level, he added.

HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
continue its efforts in creating a conducive political and
economic climate for investment, Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamhuyarira said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a foundation stone laying
ceremony at an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) site in Beitbridge of
south Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are urged to offer incentives for EPZs and
their budgets should provide for direct construction of industrial
parks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is pleasing to note that the EPZs industrial park
development is being spearheaded by the government, private sector
as well as local authorities. The motive behind is to provide the
necessary climate for a successful EPZ program," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EPZ Authority has so far approved at
least 112 projects with 50 of them already in operation.
</P>
<P>
The projects have created at least 11,500 new jobs and raised
export earnings of more than 82 million U.S. dollars, Shamhuyarira
said, adding that they are expected to bring in investment valued
at 189 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
LUANDA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-one people died of
hunger in Longonjo Town in the central province of Huambo, Angola,
 from early October to the first week of November, an official
source said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The victims are mainly old people and children displaced by the
over-25- year civil conflicts, gathering in villages and districts
near Longonjo, which is located 60 kilometers to the provincial
capital city of Huambo.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities, worrying about the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in the town with 41,000 displaced ones,
have made appeals for basic humanitarian goods but so far no
positive results have been registered.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian situation in Angola continues to deteriorate and
the heavy rain has dragged the displaced people into a bottomless
abyss of misery, with few alimentary goods and no materials for
building shelters.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of the displaced people in
Angola, a country with a population of 11 million, has reached two
million.

DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
said here Friday that the recognition of February 21 as
"International Mother Language Day" by the UNESCO (Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, United Nations) has
established the dignity of Bangladesh Language.
</P>
<P>
"The recognition of our mother tongue-Bangla by the world
community is a big achievement for the country," she said while
addressing a press conference on her return from the nine-day
visit from South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the glorious history of "the Language Movement" of
the country, Hasina said that there is a rare example of
sacrificing blood for the mother tongue and Bangladesh had created
the history in 1952.
</P>
<P>
She said that the world community accepted the Bangladesh's
argument that when May Day is observed internationally for
sacrificing blood and realizing eight-hour working duty in Chicago
of the United States of America, why February 21 cannot be
declared as International Mother Language Day as supreme
sacrifices were made by the people of Bangladesh for the sake of
mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina said that 27 countries sponsored the Bangladesh's
proposal to declare February 21 as International Mother Language
Day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: CRC, Milestone in Improving Children's Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that this convention has improved
the lives of millions of children and made the world a better
place," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"It has stimulated legal reform in dozens of countries around
the world, enjoined governments to take the health and well-being
of children seriously, and initiated a process of goal-setting
that keeps everyone honest about global progress -- or lack of
it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia passed a Minor's Code, for example, guaranteeing young
people the rights of expression. China passed a law granting all
citizens, regardless of ethnic group or religious belief, the
right to receive an education. The Philippines enacted legislation
protecting children from sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka raised the age of sexual consent from 12 to 16.
Brazil's national budget now shows how much money is spent, across
the board, on children. In India and South Africa, major court
decisions relating to the welfare of children have hinged on
principles embedded in the CRC.
</P>
<P>
An additional 23 states are in the process of reviews of law,
UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CRC has altered the global peace and
security agenda. By making the rights of children a paramount
issue during conflict, the CRC helped clear the way for "Days of
Tranquility" in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone,
Angola, Afghanistan and Sudan -- all countries where major
immunization campaigns have been able to reach millions of
children during cease-fires negotiated on the shoulders of the
CRC.
</P>
<P>
Against the extensive efforts, the United States is one of the
only two countries that had not yet ratified the pillar of the
human rights law, a grave concern for the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, all these collective efforts to date are no more than
a beginning. Now, a combined and determined effort is needed to
ensure that concern for child rights -- and action -- suffuses not
only all of the work of the United Nations, but the affairs of
every country, every city, every village, and every home.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the earth acquired its 6 billionth human inhabitant
-- a child who in all probability has begun a life that will be
marked by malnutrition, ill health, inadequate or no schooling,
poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water -- and gender
discrimination and abuse.
</P>
<P>
There are less than 50 days remaining before the world enters
the 21st century, and on each of those days -- today, tomorrow and
every day -- some 32,000 children under age of 5 will die of
preventable causes, brought down, in one way or another, by
poverty and inequity and its sanitation, illiteracy and the lack
of education, and by violence and exploitation, much of it
gender-based.
</P>
<P>
The certain deaths of these children -- some 12 million of them
a year -- are the ombrometer of the ongoing challenges to child
survival and well-being that we face as the old century falls away
-- threats made even more daunting by the relentless spread of
HIV/AIDS, and by the proliferation of armed conflict and
instability, which challenge us as never before.
</P>
<P>
In short, the first 10 years of the CRC have taken us to the
moment in history when the world may finally be ready to alter the
course of human development by decisively shifting national
investments to favor the best interests of children.

<HEADLINE> TD Bank Generates 3 Bln Canadian Dlrs in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A record profit of 3 billion
Canadian dollars (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) has been made by
Toronto-Dominion Bank in its fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
Announcing one of the biggest profits in this country's
corporate history, TD Chairman Charles Baillie declared its fiscal
1999 "a marvelous year" Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Half of that profit came from one-time items involving the sale
of chunks of TD's businesses, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Only two Canadian companies have ever made more than TD. Liquor
and entertainment giant Seagram Co. chalked up 3.4 billion U.S.
dollars in the year ended January 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications giant BCE Inc. generated a profit of 4.6
billion Canadian dollars (about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
TD is one of the Big Six Canadian banks, which earned a total
of 7.13 billion Canadian dollars (about 4.85 billion U.S. dollars)
in fiscal 1998.

OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Imasco Ltd. will disappear
after 87 years in operation by selling its key Shoppers Drug Mart
division at 2.55 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.73 billion U.S.

Shoppers Drug Mart has 824 stores whose annual sales amount to
4.2 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Vote on Short Extension of Oil-For-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is expected to act on a short extension of the
U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq Friday.
</P>
<P>
The current oil-for-food deal expires on November 20 and the
council may approve two-week extension until December 4.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its people who have been suffering from the
long U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United States circulated a draft resolution on the program
Wednesday among members of the Security Council in which it sought
to renew the plan quickly for six months on the same terms as the
previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Russia objected the draft resolution, urging the United Nations
to lift the ceiling on Iraqi oil export and double the oil revenue
Iraq can use to import spare parts and equipment for its shabby
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Russia also called on the United States and Britain to end
their enforcement of the no-fly zones over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that by extending the current
oil-for-food program, the Security Council is trying to gain time
and forge a comprehensive agreement on its new policy towards
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented
in late 1996, is aimed to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq since the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last
December.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Adopts "Charter for European Security" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A "Charter for European
Security" was adopted at the second day session of the two-day
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Summit here
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 13-page, 52-point document says that at the dawn of the
21st century, the heads of state or government of the OSCE
participating states "declare our firm commitment to a free,
democratic and more integrated OSCE area."
</P>
<P>
To implement the commitment, the charter says, the leaders
decided to take a number of new steps:
</P>
<P>
"Adopt the Platform for Co-operative Security, in order to
strengthen co-operation between the OSCE and other international
organizations and institutions, thereby making better use of the
resources of the international community;
</P>
<P>
"Develop the OSCE's role in peacekeeping, thereby better
reflecting the Organization's comprehensive approach to security;
</P>
<P>
"Create Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT),
thereby enabling the OSCE to respond quickly to demands for
assistance and for large civilian field operations;
</P>
<P>
"Expand our ability to carry out police-related activities in
order to assist in maintaining the primacy of law;
</P>
<P>
"Establish an Operation Center, in order to plan and deploy
OSCE field operations;
</P>
<P>
"Strengthen the consultation process within the OSCE by
establishing the Preparatory Committee under the OSCE Permanent
Council."
</P>
<P>
The charter acknowledges that OSCE will encounter many
challenges in realizing its commitment. "International terrorism,
violent extremism. organized crime and drug trafficking represent
growing challenges to security."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever its motives, terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations is unacceptable. We will enhance our efforts to
prevent the preparation and financing of any act of terrorism
on our territories and deny terrorists safe havens," the charter
emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to strengthening our protection against
these new risks and challenges; strong democratic institutions
and the rule of law are the foundation for this protection. We
are also determined to co-operate more actively and closely with
each other to meet these challenges," the charter adds.
</P>
<P>
The charter continues that acute economic problems and
environmental degradation may have serious effects in the region,
and pledged efforts to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit ended here in the afternoon after the
adoption of major documents.

<HEADLINE> Federal Troops to Liberate Chechen Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian military
official said Friday that he expects federal troops to liberate a
strategically important town in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
shortly.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to clear Argun of the bandits quite soon,"
General Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the General Staff, said.
Argun is the third largest city in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops, after a seven-week campaign against Islamic
militants, have secured control of about 40 percent of the
republic. Gudermes, the second Chechen city, is already in federal
hands.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said that the mountain village of Bamut, another
strategic point in the current military operation, will also be
put under federal control shortly.
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in a direct clash with the militants. We'll
face them and give them the choice to either leave Bamut or be
wiped out," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, the regional capital, there are 5,000-6,000 rebels
remaining, including a large number of mercenaries, the general
said.
</P>
<P>
"The city has few civilians left" and some rebels are leaving
the city for southern Chechnya, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"They feel the end is drawing near and are trying to save
themselves in the southern mountains," he said.

<HEADLINE> China On Issue of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The technical extension
on the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq by the United Nations
Security Council and its consideration of a new, comprehensive
draft resolution on the issue of Iraq are matters of two different
categories, China said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council before it took vote on the
extension of the current oil-for-food program in Iraq, Chinese
Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang
said the two matters have no direct link between them.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China has always believed that the implementation of
the oil-for-food program is conducive to improving the
humanitarian situation in Iraq and easing the unjustifiable
suffering of the Iraqi civilians under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Pending the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq, the elements
of the program should be further improved so as to have better
effectiveness, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Shen expressed the hope that the Security Council will be able
to adopt a new, comprehensive resolution on the issue of Iraq as
soon as possible on the basis of consensus.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations Friday unanimously
approved to extend the current U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq
for two weeks until December 4.
</P>
<P>
The move came after weeks of private discussion among the five
permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant resolutions of the Security Council, Iraq
can export about 8.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the
current phase which began on May 25 and expires on November 4.
</P>
<P>
But it is estimated that Iraq may only sell about 7.3 billion
dollars worth of oil by the end of this phase, 1 billion dollars
short of the ceiling set up by the Security Council. The council
decided to give Iraq two-week extra time to reach that account.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented
in late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell 5.2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities
for its people.

<HEADLINE> Solana Appointed as WEU Secretary-general </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union
(WEU) appointed European Union (EU)'s defense chief Secretary Solana
as its new secretary-general on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WEU has been a Europe's long dormant defense organization
now being folded into the EU. After leaving his office of the NATO
secretary-general last month, Solana became the 15-nation EU's
chief of foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, EU foreign ministers at their general
affairs meeting decided that Solana, Secretary General and High
Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the
Council of the European Union, will be "authorized to accept the
office and perform the duties of Secretary-general of the WEU, in
addition to his duties as Secretary General/High Representative".
</P>
<P>
Placing Solana in this additional job for the WEU is part of
the EU's effort to support its military role in Europe. The EU
Council of Ministers has noted that Solana of Spain will take up
his WEU duties on November 25, 1999 after expiration of the
mandate of the current Secretary-general, Jose Cutileiro of
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The EU is trying to put forth the common security and foreign
affairs policy to match the pace of its economic integration. EU
said the policy is to be bolstered on three fronts: by the
creation of military capabilities for EU-led crisis management
operations, by a political, security and military committee to be
set up in Brussels, and "by the tightening of consultative ties
with NATO, including non-EU NATO members and WEU associates".

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Labor Organization
(ALO) is to discuss issues pertaining to labor, development,
production, investment and transfer of technology in the Arab
world, ALO secretary general said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a four-day meeting of ALO's board of directors, which is
to open on Sunday in Cairo, the organization will deal with ways
of enhancing Arab countries' competitiveness to cope with
challenges of economic globalization, Ibrahim Qwader said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also dwell on ALO's strategy to solve the
problem of unemployment in the Arab countries, and improve the
condition of manpower in a bid to achieve the hoped-for economic
integration, Qwader was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He called for the establishment of an Arab common market to
help boost employment and upgrade economic and investment
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ALO will discuss an Arab-European Union (EU) program pertaining
to Arab workers in the EU member states, said the chief of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at forming joint mechanisms for
cooperation in seeking solutions to the social and cultural
problems facing Arab workers in Europe, Qwader said.
</P>
<P>
ALO will also discuss a program for the rehabilitation of the
Palestinian prisoners who were released recently by Israel, as
part of its contribution to upgrading the Palestinian manpower, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the Cairo-based ALO includes
representatives from the labor ministries, business owners and
workers in the Arab countries.

dismissed a report that Russia has proposed to the United States
it might support a tougher line towards Iraq arms programs if
the U.S. gave it a free hand in Chechnya.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Ethiopia Willing to Normalize Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Ethiopia expressed
desire to normalize their relations, strained since the attempt on
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa in June,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, on
Friday, Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir told reporters that he
agreed with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on the
restoration of the joint ministerial committee and that it would
convene in February 2000, in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
He added that he discussed also during his two-day visit to
Ethiopia a number of important regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached agreement on the reactivation of
political, economic, trade and cultural ties between the two
countries with emphasis on the cross-border trade as well as
exchange of visits among the provincial leaders of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of such visits is designed to maintain stability
and security of their borders.
</P>
<P>
Bashir and Zenawi also discussed the Sudanese peace process and
Ethiopia expressed keenness on preserving Sudan's stability,
security and territorial integrity, according to the Sudanese
president.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention any Ethiopian role in achieving
reconciliation between the Sudanese government and the rebels in
the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reported meeting with Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi,
leader of Sudanese opposition Nation Party, in Addis Ababa, Bashir
said "My visit to Ethiopia was official. I was informed that
Al-Mahdi would leave Kampala for Addis Ababa to meet me. I
expressed readiness for the meeting but he failed to show up."
</P>
<P>
Bashir arrived in Addis Ababa Thursday morning on a state visit
at the invitation of Zenawi. The two sides have issued a joint
statement declaring this visit a success.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Sudan Vow to Forge Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Sudan Friday
issued a joint communique, pledging to strengthen their bilateral
relations after passing through a difficult period in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Al Bashir and Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi held extensive discussion on bilateral
and regional issues of common interest, according to the
communique issued at the end of a two-day working visit by Al
Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The two state leaders noted with satisfaction the on-going
effort to normalize the relations between Ethiopia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries will forge closer ties based on the
principle of good neighborliness, mutual interest and mutual
respect, as well as on scrupulous observance of principles of
international law governing inter-state relations," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the need to promote trade and commercial relations
between the two countries, Meles and Al Bashir agreed on the
exchange of visit between the presidents and governors of the
bordering regions of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Al Bashir extended an invitation to Meles to visit Sudan at his
earliest convenience. Meles has accepted the invitation, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to regional issues, the two leaders expressed a
common view that the conflict situations of the Horn of Africa
must be resolved on the bases of charter principles of the
Organization of African Unity and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
To avoid further escalation of the conflicts, they emphasized
in particular the need for a strict observance of the principles
of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
states.
</P>
<P>
Al Bashir expressed that the Sudanese government would make
effort to find a peaceful solution within the framework of the
Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) peace process.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the constructive role being played by Ethiopia
in finding a long lasting solution to the 16-year civil war in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD is an African regional grouping which has been
mediating in Sudanese civil war which has claimed 1.5 million
lives.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Somalia, Al Bashir and Meles
expressed their support for the recent proposal put forward by
Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh, agreeing to work more
closely for the peace of Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Oil Minister Stresses Market Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Minister
of Oil and Mineral Resources Ali Al-N'aimi said Friday that focus
should be put on maintaining stability of the global oil market
when an output cuts agreement expires next March.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether we extend or not extend (the
production reduction accord) but what is important is to maintain
the market stability," N'aimi said upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
He is here for a meeting on the current oil market condition
with his Kuwaiti and Venezuelan counterparts, Sheikh Saud Nasser
Al-Sabah and Ali Rodriguez respectively.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) signed a one-year deal last March to slash
OPEC's daily output by 1.7 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
N'aimi, who reviewed the situation of the oil market with
Rodriguez and their Mexican counterpart in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh last Wednesday, said the oil market is in "excellent health
and better than in 1998 and early this year."
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to ensure the stability of the market," said
N'aimi, whose country sits on some 26 percent of the world's total
oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
But he noted the situation is not ideal, underlining that real
stability will keep the economy of the producers and consumers
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil minister, who also arrived here early in
the day, said oil ministers will exchange their viewpoints over
whether the output limits agreement should be extended.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he would visit the oil-rich Gulf states next
February to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Naimi and Rodriguez are also to attend an international oil
conference due on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Eruption Cancels Flights to Quito </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Six foreign airlines detoured to
Guayaquil their flights that should have landed in Quito, because
of the volcanic ashes fallout on this capital spewed by the Guagua
Pichincha volcano eruption.
</P>
<P>
The measure has been in force since Wednesday, when the big
eruption of the Guagua occurred, and which still continues.
</P>
<P>
This increased the flow of passengers and air operations
through the Guayaquil airport, as it had occurred during the
bigger Guagua Pichincha eruptions on October 5 and 7.
</P>
<P>
The airlines Copa, Avianca, American Airlines, Iberia, Avensa,
and Fine Air (cargo) cancelled their flights to Quito, which awoke
Friday with a new layer of volcanic ashes.
</P>
<P>
The Mariscal Sucre airport of Quito is working normally,
because according to the Civil Aviation Direction, the present
ashes fallout does not affect the air terminal operations.
</P>
<P>
The city of Quito underwent again last Tuesday and Wednesday a
volcanic ashes fallout.
</P>
<P>
A big explosion was observed Thursday at 14:20 local time,
which caused a sliding of the volcano dome toward the west of its
crater.
</P>
<P>
National Polytechnical School Geophysics Institute (IGEPN)
director Hugo Yepez did not dismiss the possibility of more ashes
spewing.

<HEADLINE> GCC Ministers Fail to Agree on Common Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries ended their one-day
meeting here on Saturday, failing to reach a consensus on the
establishment of a customs union.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers did not reach an agreement on the common
customs tariff within the GCC countries," said GCC Secretary
General Sheikh Jamil Al-Hujailan, who also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that this issue will finally be resolved
in the GCC's next summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia later this month.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have made progress so far toward integration,
Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, minister of finance and
industry of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), earlier told the
extraordinary meeting, which focused on the tariff issue.
</P>
<P>
"There is, however, a need for more efforts if we compare
these achievements to international economic developments," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar
and Bahrain - have been trying since 1983 to unify their customs
duties, which now vary between 4 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
They have set March 1, 2001 as the target date for a customs
union, aimed eventually at establishing a Gulf common market.
</P>
<P>
In May, GCC officials announced the six countries had
finalized tax categories for imported goods and the next task was
to reach an agreement on the tax ceilings.

Governor of Herat Mulla Khairullah Khairkhwa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The sides also discussed the issue of reopening of Iranian
consulate in Herat," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities recently agreed to unseal the Islam
Qila post bordering the western Afghan city of Herat, according to
a report of the Afghan Islamic Press agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the border will allow Afghanistan to receive
trade convoys from Iran and Afghan traders will also purchase
wheat from Iran to overcome the current flour shortage in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the border will not be closed again
at least over the next five years even if there is war in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran closed its border with Afghanistan last year after the
Taliban militia captured several western and northern Afghan
provinces in their war against the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Taliban further worsened in
August 1998 when at least nine Iranian diplomats were killed after
the Islamic militia seized the Iranian consulate in the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Britain Maps Out Plans to Handover Power to N.Ireland Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain mapped out plans
Saturday to push forward the Northern Ireland peace process by
handing over power to the province's politicians as early as next
month.
</P>
<P>
British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson
outlined the plans which could transfer the power from London to a
locally elected assembly, saying it was a time of the "greatest
hope" for the province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Belfast during the annual conference of the Women's
Coalition Party in Northern Ireland, Mandelson gave the formal
official response to the report published by former U.S. Senator
George Mitchell this week, a result of Mitchell's 10-week review
of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble agreed Thursday to a
deal on setting up a power-sharing government, followed by a
statement from the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, a paramilitary organization, is expected to appoint an
intermediary to talk to the international body which was set up to
supervise the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
However, Trimble has issued a stern warning to Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, not to try and double-cross him over
the decommissioning of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said if there was any indication that Sinn Fein would not
live up to its commitments, he might cancel a crucial meeting next
week of his party's decision- making council.
</P>
<P>
His warning followed a report from the United States which
suggested that Pat Doherty, a leading Republican, had cast doubt
on the possibility of eventual IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein stressed in a statement that it had not deviated
from the party's position on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Ulster Unionist council will be vital in
paving the way towards a devolved administration in Northern
Ireland, with the unionists and nationalists sharing power for the
first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he would convene a meeting of the Northern Irish
Assembly at Stormont, Belfast, on November 29 to begin nominating
ministers to an executive.
</P>
<P>
Once ministers have been nominated, the Devolution Order will
be laid before the parliament on November 30 with devolution
taking place two days later on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson's speech was considered as part of the government's
campaign to bolster Trimble's position.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for Northern Ireland to have its own
government since direct rule from London was imposed in 1972 at
the height of the Protestant-Catholic "troubles".
</P>
<P>
The government of Northern Ireland will simultaneously take
necessary steps to implement the "Good Friday" agreement, signed
18 months ago.

<HEADLINE> Asian Pacific Ministers Adopts Declaration on Space Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific ministers in
charge of space application wound up their three-day conference
here Saturday after adopting a report and a declaration on space
application in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report said significant progress has achieved in the field
of space applications for sustainable development in Asia-Pacific
region since the first ministerial conference held in Beijing in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that profound advances on space technology
and its applications should be available to enhance the
sustainable development and for achieving rapid improvements in
the quality of life in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Second Ministerial Conference on Space Applications for
Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific, organized by the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP), was attended by ministers or high-ranking
officials from 27 out of 51 ESCAP members and 9 associate members.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the uneven development of space technology
applications among member states, the delegates urged that
regional cooperative mechanisms be institutionalized to facilitate
equitable sharing of the benefits of space technology development
and applications by all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference unanimously endorsed the Strategy and Action
Plan for Space Technology Applications for Sustainable Development
in Asia and the Pacific for the new millennium and the Delhi
Declaration on Space Technology Applications in Asia and the
Pacific for Improved Quality of Life in the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
The report adopted by the ministers said there were a number of
major constraints still facing Asia-Pacific countries,
particularly those with limited financial and human resources.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was preceded by a three-day senior
official meeting, was an immediate follow-up of the Third UN
Conference on Peaceful Use and Exploration of Outer Space held in
Vienna in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi Declaration said the first ministerial conference,
held in Beijing in 1994, was an important milestone in the
promotion of space science and technology development and
applications in the region.
</P>
<P>
It said the launching of the Regional Space Applications
Program for Sustainable Development in Beijing and its
implementation have had a significant impact on national
capacity-building, enhancing regional capabilities and raising the
status of the region to be one of the fast growing areas for space
technology development and applications.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the essential role of space technology and
applications to environment and natural resource management, food
security, capacity-building, human resource development and
education, poverty alleviation, weather forecasting, natural
disaster reduction, health care and hygiene and sustainable
development planning.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that is essential to use practical and
feasible means for the effective implementation of technology
research and development programs, including the mechanism for
enhancing academic exchange and human resource development.
</P>
<P>
They urged bilateral and multilateral donors and international
organizations to support the implementation of the second phase of
the Regional Space Applications Program for Sustainable
Development.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Supports Bid for 2006 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong SAR government
backed Hong Kong's bid for the right to host the 2006 Asian Games,
a government spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said after a special meeting, the chief executive in Council
had decided to support the expression of interest which the Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&AMP;OC)
intends to submit to the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) for the
hosting of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment is that Hong Kong has the capability to
organize and to host the 2006 Asian Games, " said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We believe that hosting the Asian Games will elevate
Hong Kong's status as a center in Asia for hosting international
sports events."
</P>
<P>
He said a bidding committee led by the SAR government would be
appointed soon and would formulate the formal bid next year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesmen added the Hong Kong sports venues would meet
international standards for hosting the Games.
</P>
<P>
According to Timothy Fok, president of SF&AMP;OC, Hong Kong has a
disadvantage now in lacking a large multi-functional sports
complex, which several other biding contenders boast of.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, Malaysia, Qatar, India, Uzbekistan and Syria have
already proposed their bids for the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Fok will leave for Kuwait Saturday to participate the meeting
of OCA and express Hong Kong's interest in biding for the Games.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman pointed out that the formal bid to be
submitted to OCA would be subject to the further approval of the
Executive Council. Any financial commitment would require the
approval of the Finance Committee of the legislative council.
</P>
<P>
OCA will decide the host for the Games in November 2001.

<HEADLINE> China May Start Clinical Tests of New AIDS Vaccine Next Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seth Berkley with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative
said at the workshop that China is the largest vaccine producer in
the world which has sufficient research and clinical skills to
contribute to the global effort, and it is of great importance for
China to join the global AIDS vaccine development efforts.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 400,000 cases of HIV have been reported in China.
This high figure will spur scientists to launch research on gene
variation and epidemiological studies, and on cloning of
characteristic strains for AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Johnston from the U.S. National Institute of Health
said no significant efficacy information is yet available on any
current AIDS vaccine, though over 30 candidate HIV vaccines have
been evaluated in over 60 clinical trials worldwide since 1987.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over 40 million people worldwide have
contracted AIDS, and 11 million have died from the deadly disease
since it was discovered in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Though the promotion of AIDS prevention education has proved
effective in reducing the risk of infection, the spread of AIDS
has not slowed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that currently over 16,000 people are infected
with HIV each day worldwide, doubling the figure before 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Shao Yiming, of China's leading AIDS research center,
stressed that "it is crucial to attach equal importance to
prevention and development of vaccines in tackling the deadly
disease."

<HEADLINE> China May Start Clinical Tests of New AIDS Vaccine Next Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists announced
here today they will apply next year for clinical testing rights
for two new AIDS vaccines jointly developed with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Shao Yiming of the National Center for AIDS Prevention
and Control, the country's top AIDS vaccine research body, said
today that if the applications are approved, China will be
launching its first clinical tests of AIDS vaccines.
</P>
<P>
Shao said the Chinese and German scientists have co-developed a
DNA-based AIDS vaccine and a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.
Tests on animals indicated that the vaccines can increase immunity
against HIV.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the two countries have applied gene-engineering
technology to create a virus that is HIV-like in terms of
structure but has no HIV virus nucleic acid, which Shao claimed is
safe, as the nucleic acid has been removed from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The move indicates that China, facing the challenge of an
increasing incidence of AIDS, is working together with the
international community for breakthrough discoveries in AIDS
vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative
announced at the International AIDS Vaccine Workshop which closed
in Beijing today that it will cooperate with China in developing
at least two trial AIDS vaccines for clinical evaluation, based on
strains of HIV-1 circulating in China. The phase one trials will
begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The organization also decided to build least two clinical trial
sites in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign AIDS experts participating the workshop
believed that it is quite possible to develop a safe AIDS vaccine.
They agreed that the biggest problems in the field are technical
issues such as virus variation, as well as the huge funding
requirements and necessary participation of large number of
scientists and people.
</P>
<P>
Describing the AIDS vaccine development as a program as mammoth
as a moon landing, they said the major breakthroughs in the field
are relying more and more on close cooperation between developed
and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They believed that China is one of a few developing countries
that have the capacity to launch cooperative programs in the field.

<P>
The Sector Commandant of Federal Road Safety Commission in
Kwara State, Umar Bello Aginji, attributed the accident to the
narrow nature of the road and the hazy weather condition.
</P>
<P>
Aginji reminded the drivers of broken-down vehicles to put up
visible road signs at the required distance to alert on-coming
traffic of impending danger.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Stimulate Demand Next Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
expected to take further measures to expand domestic demand next
year in a bid to maintain sustained, rapid and healthy economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Minister Zeng Peiyan in charge of State Development Planning
Commission pledged a policy package aimed at stimulating domestic
demand at a national meeting on development planning which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zeng made a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of this year'
s macro-economic policy and remaining problems, and put forth main
goals and tasks for economic and social development next year.
</P>
<P>
As investment, consumption and export have been effectively
increased as a result of the central authorities' policies,
economic growth is now estimated at seven percent or above this
year, well meeting the previous projection, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Conditions for the nation's economic and social development are
improving and more opportunities have emerged with the upturn of
the world economy and the successful conclusion of Sino-U.S.
negotiations on China's entry to WTO, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem of insufficient demand, Zeng pledged to
further gear up investment in fixed assets next year, which will
be "markedly more than this year."
</P>
<P>
The government will concentrate its investment on
infrastructure facilities, technological renovation, environmental
protection, research and development, education and construction
of medium- and low-grade housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will further make use of fiscal and monetary
levers to support economic growth and provide a better policy
environment for private investment, the minister said, adding that
more funds will be injected into projects in the under-developed
western region.

<P>
Describing consumer demand as vital to economic growth, Zeng
said that the central government has decided to readjust policies
on consumption, with previous policies hindering private
consumption in power, housing, motor vehicles and
telecommunications to be revised and improved next year.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage financial institutions to expand
consumer credit, exploit the potential in the development of the
tertiary industry and take effective measures to increase
affordability of both urban and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China will continue to work to
facilitate exports, improve the structure of foreign trade and
keep the balance of international payments and the relative
stability of the Renminbi exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
China will also allow more access to the domestic market for
foreign investors and open the door wider in the service industry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng took special notice of a co-ordinated development among
different regions, claiming that the central authorities have been
determined to "take a substantial step" in promoting development
of the western region next year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of infrastructure facilities will be accelerated
in the west, while environmental protection will be strengthened,
industrial structure be readjusted and development of science and
education be sped up, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Plan for SOE Reform Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The head of China's State
Economic and Trade Commission today urged local governments and
departments to work harder to ensure the reform of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) happens within the targeted three-year period.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the commission, said at a
working conference which began today that the country has promised
to pull most of the large and medium-sized state firms out of
financial difficulty and to establish a modern enterprise system
in most of them before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
To meet that goal, Sheng asked the local governments to further
cut surplus production capacity in the industrial sector,
especially in the fields of coal, iron and steel, and sugar
refinery. Meanwhile, manufacturing of products with good market
potential will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
To further tap the domestic market, especially in the rural
areas, will be an important task to spur the economy next year,
the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also prodded firms to take advantage of state policies to
expand exports and tap market potential.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheng, the country next year will restructure a
batch of traditional industries with advanced technology and
continue to support the technical upgrading with financial
policies such as interest discounts, which will provide more
opportunities for firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, all key state firms will establish their
own technological development centers.
</P>
<P>
China will let more firms declare bankruptcy next year, said
Sheng, adding that the debt-to-equity swaps will help save a batch
of firms formerly in the red.
</P>
<P>
To improve management of these key firms, China will strengthen
supervision of costs, spending and product quality. Top managers
of these firms will be trained in groups and their daily
operations be supervised more closely.
</P>
<P>
Sheng noted that this year's economic development, especially
the improvement of economic efficiency of the state sector, has
laid a strong foundation for the next year's reform.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first three quarters of this year,
the SOEs made 48.9 billion yuan in profits, 2.5 times the figure
of the same period last year.

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Institute of Arts

one of China's most prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
The institute is now known as the Academy of Fine Arts, Qinghua
University.
</P>

This is an important step forward on the road to build Qinghua

The Central Institute of Arts and Crafts set up in 1956 is the
country's largest art institute, known as the "cradle of the
Chinese art designers." It has a strong faculty and complete
teaching facilities.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua has been adding disciplines in the sectors of economic

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Attack on UN Personnel in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Saturday denied
any involvement in the attack on United Nations personnel and
Burundian civilians in October.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation
said in a statement that Tanzania condemned the insinuations that
the so-called attackers had come from and returned to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania denies any
role whatsoever in the killings and wounding of U.N. personnel and
citizens of Burundi," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement responded to a report sent recently by the
Burundi government to the United Nations Secretary-General,
claiming that the attackers came from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The statement restated Tanzania's position that it deplores and
deeply condemns the senseless acts of violence and the inhuman
killing and maiming of people in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Burundi cannot in any way exonerate itself
from its primary responsibility of providing security for United
Nations personnel as well as its own citizens," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming that it does not allow or support any armed group
on its soil, Tanzania urged all the parties to the conflicts in
Burundi to continue the peace talks in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, involving the Burundi government, opposition
and rebel groups, began last June in Arusha to bring an end to the
six-year-old civil war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks have been stalled since the mediator, former
 Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere died in October.
</P>
<P>
A new mediator will be probably named by the end of this month
when leaders of the Great Lakes region hold a summit in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
So far some 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since the Burundi conflict broke out in October 1993 when the
first elected ethnic Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was
assassinated by the ethnic Tutsi- dominated Army.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the progress in the peace process, the Great Lakes
region countries suspended on January 23 this year the economic
sanctions imposed on Burundi on July 31, 1996, a week after Pierre
Buyoya seized power in a bloodless military coup which toppled an
ethnic Hutu president.

<HEADLINE> Accountability Courts to Be Set Up in Pakistan Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Accountability courts will
be set up in Pakistan soon to try those involved in looting of
state wealth, corruption and misuse of power, said an top
accountability official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The process of law has been set into motion for establishment
of trial courts at district and session levels "which will start
functioning very soon", said Lt. General Syed Muhammad Amjad,
chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), while
addressing a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
According to a NAB Ordinance promulgated earlier this month,
the accountability courts will decide the cases within 30 days and
the convict will be disqualified for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
The convict will have right of two appeals at the levels of
high courts and the supreme court, said Amjad.
</P>
<P>
He said the NAB is doing well in recovering the defaulted
loans, adding that 21 persons, including politicians, bureaucrats,
former armed force men and industrialists, had been arrested for
loan default.
</P>
<P>
Amjad did not specify the numbers of accountability courts,
saying, "we will start with the number we need" and the number
will increase accordingly.
</P>
<P>
After the coup last month, the military ruler of Pakistan set
up the National Accountability Bureau to recover defaulted loans
and deal with corruption-related persons.

<HEADLINE> 300,000 Chinese Take China's First Exam for Licensed Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 Chinese are
taking a national medical examination today and tomorrow to become
China's first group of licensed doctors.
</P>
<P>
The test is divided into four categories: clinical skills,
Chinese medicine, stomatology and public health. Both medical
practitioners and assistant medical practitioners will be tested.
</P>
<P>
Before the written exam, practical skills tests including
demonstrations of surgical techniques and patient diagnosis were
held last month.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive examination is expected to lay the foundation
for a medical licensing and registration system in China.
</P>
<P>
For five decades, China has run a health care system that doesn
't issue any national unified license to medical professionals.
Medical school graduates usually are permitted to treat patients
after completion of a one-year internship and the evaluation of
their qualifications, which are conducted by local health
administrations.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said China's existing health care system, even
though it has proved successful in improving the overall health of
the Chinese, has made it easy for quack doctors to profit from
giving unauthorized medical care.
</P>
<P>
"The people's health should always be the top priority, so we
won't allow unqualified persons to infiltrate the ranks of medical
practitioners," stressed Health Minister Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 1.5 million doctors
and some 460,000 medical assistants. However, the number of new
physicians in recent years has far exceeded the number of
graduates from medical colleges, which suggests that many
unqualified people are practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
Until now, China has followed the Law on Medical Practitioners,
which stipulates that those who pass a qualification test and are
registered have the right to practice medicine.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Official Calls Unity Key to Region's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Unity among the 10 member
states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has
been the key factor in the region's recovery from the financial
crisis that hit the area in 1997 and 1998, an ASEAN official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo
Severino said the financial crunch that the region experienced
only stressed the importance of the regional grouping and its
identity.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the answer of ASEAN to the financial crisis was
not disunity but more integration of its economic goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
One example, according to Severino, is the decision of the
ASEAN to advance the target date of the implementation of the
ASEAN Free Trade Area originally scheduled for 2010 to year 2005.
</P>
<P>
As part of its commitment to liberalization, the ASEAN has also
decided to advance the implementation of the ASEAN Investment Area
to 2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under these schemes, all member countries of the group will
reduce tariff rates to 0-5 percent by 2005 and open their
manufacturing industries and provide national treatment to ASEAN
investors.
</P>
<P>
"Because ASEAN knows that we can survive only if we stay united
and not fragmented," Severino said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, founded in 1967, now groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia,
Laos and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Faces Challenge Of Unity, Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- a Commonwealth official has
said the major challenge facing the organization in the new
millennium was to unify people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and
improve the economies of member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Commonwealth has become a force for democracy and member
countries need to advocate for policies that promote humanity,"
Emeka Anyaoku, outgoing secretary-general of the Commonwealth
Chief, told reporters before leaving here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, who is to leave office in March next
year after about 10 years at the helm, said the Commonwealth had
been successful in demolishing racism and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"The Commonwealth has been extremely relevant in tackling
problems in our time, including the demolition of apartheid in
South Africa and colonization in southern Africa, including
Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Commonwealth would resolve the challenge
of economic development as many member countries were poor and
there were a number of programs aimed at meeting this need.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku was in Zimbabwe to address the two-day international
conference on Zimbabwe's proposed new constitution which ended on
Friday.
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Crack cocaine had become

Criminal syndicates initially concentrated on the Johannesburg

<HEADLINE> PLA General on Station of Troops in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) general said here today that it will be necessary to
station troops in Macao when the territory is returned to China on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu Yuejun, commander of the newly-established
PLA garrison troops for the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR), said at the military unit's first press conference that "it
is necessary to station a proper number of skilled and capable
troops in the region to enforce the Sino-Portuguese Declaration
and the Basic Law of the Macao SAR."
</P>
<P>
This move is a symbol of China's resumption of sovereignty over
Macao and a need for the Central Government to effectively manage
Macao's defense, he said, adding that it will also help maintain
the region's social stability and economic development after it
returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the troop's basic task is to take charge of the
defensive affairs of the Macao SAR. In addition, according to the
Garrison Law of the Macao SAR, ordered by the Central Military
Commission, the troops can assist the Macao government in
maintaining social security and conducting disaster relief
operations when the Macao SAR government has appealed to and won
approval from the central government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the troops stationed in Macao are mainly a
contingent of the infantry army, with a small number of naval and
air force officers.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be equipped with all necessary weapons, mainly
light weapons, to fulfill their mission, according to the general.
</P>
<P>
Major General He Xianshu, political commissar of the Macao SAR
garrison troops, these men and officers are selected based on PLA
army units which have enjoyed historical success, including the
army unit established in the early stage of the Red Army in the
late 1920s, and troops participating in the War of Resistance
against Japan between 1937-45, in the Liberation War against the
Kuomintang, and in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Assist
Korea in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Some members are from the Hong Kong SAR garrison troops, he
added, and some participated in the flood-fighting campaign of
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the officers and soldiers are selected from
active PLA military service rosters in accordance with China's
conscription regulations. They are of good professional and moral
quality, and have a passion for the motherland as well as for the
Macao SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, every officer and soldier has a sound educational
background, he said, adding that the officers are all college
graduates or above and soldiers graduates of senior middle schools
or higher.
</P>
<P>
They are also in excellent physical condition, and the
requirement for their height is over 1.7 meters for men and 1.65
meters for women.
</P>
<P>
In order to successfully execute their duties in Macao, said
the commissar, the troops are undergoing strict training and
educational courses. They are studying the Macao SAR Basic Law,
the Garrison Law, the Chinese government's policies regarding
Macao, and other laws and information concerning Macao.
</P>
<P>
On how the troops will enter Macao, Major General Liu said it
will be decided according to the actual situation. It will be
convenient for the troops to enter quickly by land in the case of
Macao, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the Macao SAR government will be
responsible for the region's social security. However, if there is
a riot that surpasses the SAR government's capability to control,
the Macao garrison troops will act strictly according to the
Garrison Law which prescribes explicitly their duties and tasks,
the general explained.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Kills 38 Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Saturday that the latest fighting between government troops
and Tamil rebels had killed 38 rebels as conflicts continued to
rage in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) said Saturday afternoon in its clandestine radio that it
captured one more town of Paappamoddai and was advancing south in
the northwestern district of Mannar.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's new claim followed its statement on Friday that it
had captured the military-held towns of Periyamadu, Pallamadu,
Palampiddi, Thatchamaruthu and Madhu -- all in the district of
Mannar located on the western flank of Wanni region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the LTTE have beaten into the army's western
flank in the northern Wanni region after gobbling up most of its
eastern flank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in November, LTTE rebels captured 10 towns when it
launched a surprise offensive code-named "Unceasing Wave 3" on the
eastern flank of the Wanni region, the main battleground during
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the LTTE rebels had recaptured all the
territory it lost to the government troops since 1995 with the
exception of Jaffna, the former stronghold of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry did not mention losing towns to Tamil
rebels but said troops Friday repulsed rebels' attack using
artillery, mortars and machine guns effectively in western sector
of Vavuniya, the main government-held frontier town some 250 km
north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said 12 LTTE rebels had been killed in the
last 12 hours due to the fighting while one soldier was killed and
19 others had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
Government troops in an ambush engaged a group of LTTE rebels
with machine guns and small arms at Ariyakandalkulam in the
northern Welioya region, killing 20 rebels, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that troops killed six more rebels in three separate
clashes in the Jaffna region, the former stronghold of the LTTE
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
attached great importance to the protection of children's rights,
according to a government press release issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
the Child in 1990 and adopted a national program of action for
children in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The Children Statute of 1996 translated the U.N. Convention
into a national legal instrument enforceable in this country," the
press release issued by the Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social
Development said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda launched its first universal primary education (UPE)
program in January of 1997 which provides free primary education
for four children in each family.
</P>
<P>
The UPE initiative has increased primary school enrolment from
2. 6 million to six million pupils in a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called for a quick peaceful solution to the
problem of insecurity in the northern and western parts of the
country and the establishment of social centers to cater for the
street children orphaned by AIDS or war.

and putting his rich repertoire of delicate net play and powerful
smashes into display.
</P>
<P>
Dong, ranked 29th in the world, did not speak to the reporters
after the win but was apparently emotional.

Chinese headcoach Li Yongbo said, "Dong Jiong regained
confidence this time." China's reigning world champion Sun Jun did
not take part in the competition after being hit by a series of

taking the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and had
failed to win a singles title in major international competitions
since then.

Fung, eighth on the world rankings, said: "I played like a
drunk man today. Dong outpaced me and I could not take initiative
to attack." The world championships runner-up admitted it was the
worst game he played this year.
</P>
<P>
The hosts almost completed a clean sweep of all golds available
here, with only the men's doubles taken by the South Koreans.

<P>
Zhou Mi, 20, beat compatriot Gong Ruina 11-6, 11-5 in the women

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Vows Not to Tolerate Rebel Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that while his administration remains
fully committed to seeking lasting peace in Mindanao, it will not
tolerate any attacks by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Estrada warned MILF rebels not to
jeopardize the ongoing peace process by threatening to launch a
holy war against the government.
</P>
<P>
"We're not out here to exchange threats. In fact, my
administration remains committed to seek peace in Mindanao, that's
why we have opened peace talks with the MILF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he remains willing to personally talk with MILF
leaders if this will help speed up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he even welcomes a plan of Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid to continue to assist in efforts by
his administration to attain peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wahid wants to help us forge an agreement with the MILF,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was instrumental in helping speed up the signing of a
1996 peace agreement between the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by Nur Misuari, who is now governor
of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the MILF has threatened to declare a holy
war on the government if President Estrada scraps the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada said it was the MILF that broke the spirit of the
peace process when it raided some areas in North Cotabato,
Mindanao, only a week after peace talks formally started between
the two sides on October 25 in Maguindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In that raid, Estrada said, four soldiers were killed and
several others were wounded while more than 30,000 civilians were
forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF has continued its fighting for an
independent Muslim state in Mindanao since the government and the
MNLF signed the peace accord in 1996.

LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Northern Ireland Ulster Unionist Party's leader David
Trimble's battle to persuade his party to accept the peace deal in
the province suffered a setback Friday night when it emerged that
one of Gerry Adam's closest allies doubts that the IRA will disarm.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a surprise move, the judge in the Microsoft monopoly
trial in the United States appointed a mediator to oversee
voluntary settlement talks between the government and the software
giant, which dramatically increases chances for an out-of-court
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The government is preparing to support a proposal to allow
the monarch to be a Roman Catholic or to marry a member of that
faith in a move that would raise far-reaching questions about the
relationship between the Church of England and the State.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, risked
his personal future, the state of his party and possibly the
entire fate of the peace process in Northern Ireland on a single
meeting of the UUP's ruling council held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Jack Straw, the home secretary, was on Friday night facing
furious opposition from lawyers and civil liberties groups to his
plans to curb defendant's right to choose trial by jury.

<HEADLINE> Russia Resumes Air Raids Over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor weather grounded all military flights over Chechnya on
Friday, including transport aircraft, the headquarters of the
federal troops in North Caucasus said.
</P>
<P>
It said rebels were trying to prevent the blockade of Grozny
from the south, and actively strengthening their positions in the
town of Urus-Martan, where air defense installations and around 3,
500 fighters armed with "Stinger" anti-aircraft missiles, large-
caliber machine guns, grenade launchers and other firearms are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack planes have flown more than 3,
500 bombing and reconnaissance missions since the beginning of the
Russian operations in the North Caucasus in August, the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, Interfax reported intensive aerial and
artillery bombardment by federal troops in Urus-Martan, quoting
Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev.
</P>
<P>
"Volley upon volley of 'Grad' missiles are being fired almost
without pause," Makhashev said.
</P>
<P>
He described the current military campaign as "a senseless war..
. that costs the lives of Russians and Chechens" and said the
Chechen leadership is "prepared for constructive talks" with the
federal center "on a wide range of issues." On Friday, Deputy
Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Manilov said he expected
federal troops to liberate Argun, a strategically important town
in Chechnya, shortly.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to clear Argun of the bandits quite soon,"
Manilov said. Argun is the third largest city in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops, after a seven-week campaign against Islamic
militants, have secured control of about 40 percent of the
republic. Gudermes, the second Chechen city, is already in federal
hands.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said that the mountain village of Bamut, another
strategic point in the current military operation, would also be
put under federal control shortly.
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in a direct clash with the militants. We'll
face them and give them the choice to either leave Bamut or be
wiped out," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, the regional capital, there are 5,000-6,000 rebels
remaining, including a large number of mercenaries, the general
said.
</P>
<P>
"The city has few civilians left" and some rebels are leaving
the city for southern Chechnya, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"They feel the end is drawing near and are trying to save
themselves in the southern mountains," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Violating Georgian Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday denied
allegations that one of its Su-25 fighter jets violated Georgian
air space on November 18, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"No violation of Georgian airspace by Russian military aircraft
occurred on November 18," Interfax quoted the Russian Air Force
Main Headquarters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after accusations Friday by Georgia that a
Russian Su-25 attack plane flew some 15 kilometers in and around
Shatili on the Chechen section along the Georgian-Russian border
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Air Force Headquarters did acknowledge that two Su-
25 attack planes were up in the area on November 18, but said one
of the planes approached no closer than 7 kilometers away from the
Georgian state border and the other kept its distance 20
kilometers away, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
This assertion can be proved by radar installations and the so-
called black boxes that record flight parameters, the headquarters
said, adding that Moscow is prepared to hand over the verifying
information to Georgia.

Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr Al-Thani, who was allowed to meet deposed
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has called for his fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Saturday that Hamad flew into Karachi
Friday and met Sharif after he appeared before the anti-terrorist
court in the plane hijacking case for the first time since October
12.
</P>
<P>
Hamad came to Islamabad and called on Chief Executive General
Pervaiz Musharraf after his meeting with Sharif, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister also had a meeting with his
Pakistani counterpart, Abdul Sattar, and Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Hamad as saying, "We had very traditional
close and friendly ties with Sharif. It is up to the court to
decide the cases against him. We respect the Pakistan judicial
system."
</P>
<P>
Hamad, however, called for a fair trial of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
This was the first contact of any official of Arab countries
with the deposed prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Islamabad-based envoys of Canada and
Malaysia had met Sharif here during his detention this month.
</P>
<P>
Hamad told the new Pakistani government that he initiated the
mission on the behest of Qatari Amir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
His mission is by no means interference into Pakistan's
internal affairs, Hamad said, adding, "We respect Pakistan's
sovereignty and integrity."

<P>
NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is one of the most
serious problems affecting the youths in Africa including Kenya,
Country Director Chrispin Wilson of the United Nations Childrens'
Fund was quoted by the East African Standard newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the young people Friday in the Kenyan capital

men and women infected with HIV, and nearly all of them live in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Baku-Ceyhan Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi has condemned the signing of
Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline agreement and termed the agreement as
"political," local daily Jomhuri Islamic (Islamic Republic)
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the economic advantage," the daily
quoted Asefi as saying, " no doubt, economy will dominate its
logic over political considerations."
</P>
<P>
The agreement to finalize the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline was signed
in Istanbul on Thursday by presidents of Turkey, Georgia and
Azerbaijan with U.S. President Bill Clinton as a witness.
</P>
<P>
The 2.4-billion-dollar pipeline is to run a distance of 1,730
kilometers from Baku in Azerbaijan Republic to Ceyhan in
Turkey. The project will be completed in the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Iran has claimed that the Baku-Ceyhan plan is not economic and
proposed to set up a pipeline through Iranian soil instead.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. showed strong opposition to the plan to
transfer the Caspian Sea energy through Iran, which was considered
by Washington as "a repressive and fundamentalist regime."

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington Narrow Difference on Missile Range Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK) and
the United States have narrowed their difference in their talks on
the expansion of the former's missile range to 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion on the ROK missile issue were productive and
concrete, bringing the U.S. and ROK positions close together,"
said a press release of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ending the talks which began Thursday here, the two sides
agreed to make a final conclusion on Seoul's demand to extend its
missile range to 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also agreed to solve the issue in a way to meet
both the Seoul's demand to secure a missile defense system and the
Washington's effort to maintain its missile nonproliferation
policy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, South Korea has challenged the 1979 memorandum of
understanding between the two countries, which restricts South
Korean missile range to 180 kilometers in return for U.S.
provision of the technology for developing missiles of 180-
kilometer range.
</P>
<P>
South Korea called for an extension to 300 kilometers as
allowed by the Missile Technology Control Regime as the missile of
180-kilometer range fails to reach Pyongyang after the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) test-fired a rocket which flew
over the Japanese territory in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, at his meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung reportedly demanded
technology for missiles covering up to 500 kilometers without
actually producing and deploying them to put up a strong deterrent
by showing that Seoul is capable of striking everywhere of the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Washington has agreed in principle on the Seoul's demand to
develop missiles with range of up to 300 kilometers, but the
latter asked for access to the former's missile development
program, which South Korea considers a grave violation of its
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to consider South Korea's desire for missile
range flexibility in a sympathetic way," visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Rober Einhorn Thursday before his three-day
talks with South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington is concerned with the possibility of the
extension of missile range would cast shadow on the improved
atmosphere created after Pyongyang agreed not to test-fire any
more long range missiles in September this year.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has cautioned students against irresponsible sexual behavior
when they spend the upcoming Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
"Such behavior could lead to being infected with the deadly
disease AIDS, " Moi said when addressing high school students at
the western Kenyan town of Eldorest.
</P>
<P>
The president advised students to choose their friends well,
saying not everybody who talked to them was a friend.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation Saturday quoted the outspoken president as
saying that adolescent sex was now risky, especially with the
spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Few political leaders in the east African country are devoted
to the AIDS awareness campaign. But some community leaders even
deem the epidemic as a taboo.
</P>
<P>
Lack of AIDS awareness in the rural areas has been identified
as the cause of soaring AIDS infection. Most residents in
countryside still held the misconception that AIDS was a result
of witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
AIDS claims about 500 lives in Kenya each day and 11 more
people are infected with the disease per minute, according to
official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Discard Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has urged Kenyans to scrap tribalism in order to tackle
challenges in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Moi was quoted by Saturday's East African Standard newspaper as
saying that the root cause of instability in many countries was
tribalism and it should be eradicated if meaningful development
was to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some political leaders Friday at a rally for
dividing Kenyans along tribal lines instead of cultivating peace,
adding that such leaders should be rejected by people.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that anyone who found inciting people into
tribal clashes would face the punishment of law.
</P>
<P>
Moi also said that Kenya is a peaceful country and will not
tolerate alien dictates that could plunge Kenya into chaos.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Rises 14.3 PC in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
continued to rise at a robust pace in October and its total value
hit 34.742 billion Singapore dollars (20.829 billion U.S. dollars,
registering a strong expansion of 14.3 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Singapore Trade Development
Board Saturday, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports increased by
10.1 percent year-on-year in October, non-oil re-exports by 5.5
percent after 13 months of consecutive declines and non-oil
imports continued to soar by 16.1 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Powered by the continued strong demand, Singapore's domestic
exports of electronics were up 4.8 percent in October with the
exports of integrated circuits (ICs) expanding by 25.2 percent and
those of telecommunication equipment by 37.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Singapore's domestic exports of disk drives continued
to be in doldrums reflecting the downward pressure on disk drives
arising from keen competition.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by domestic exports of pharmaceuticals and intermediate
compounds to the European Union (EU) and disc media products to
Japan, Singapore's domestic exports of non-electronic products
strengthened further in October 1999, expanding by 21.7 percent
over the same month of last year on the heels of a 17.3-percent
increase in the preceding month.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil registered a robust expansion of 27
percent year-on-year in Singapore in October 1999, almost twice
the growth rate seen in September 1999, and the strong growth was
fueled by the escalating oil price which recorded a hefty increase
of 58 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Growth in non-oil re-exports mainly came from re-exports of
electronic components and sustained positive growth in non-oil
re-exports to the crisis-hit economies, via Malaysia, Thailand and
South Korea while increase in non-oil imports was primarily a
result of strong rises in imports of ICs, parts of semiconductors,
capacitors, printed circuits, parts of aircraft and cellular
phones and radio phones.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports to all of its top five
markets stayed in positive territory in October this year with a
marginal increase of 0.4 percent to the United States, a
7.8-percent growth to the EU, a 11.6 percent expansion to
Malaysia, a surge of 27.4 percent to Japan and a 22.5-percent
growth to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Major Rivers Losing Navigability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's three major rivers
-- the Padma, the Meghna and the Jamuna -- have been losing
navigability because of deposit of silts on their beds, The
Independent daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six of the 74 channels along the 6,000-kilometer river
route in Bangladesh have closed and 35 others have become risky
for lack of navigation, affecting transportation of merchandise
across the country, the report quoted Water Development Board
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bahga river port in North Bengal and the river ports in the
districts of Patuakhali and Barguna in south Bangladesh have
become unfit for use by water vessels, according to the Bangladesh
Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA).
</P>
<P>
And the river ports in the southern district of Barisal are
facing threat of existence for non-navigability of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
It has become essential to keep the rivers navigable for
keeping ferry services operative to maintain road communications
between the capital city and other parts of the country, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The emergency of shoals at different points of the rivers Padma
and Jamuna has made the situation worse, leading to the necessary
of dredging. The BIWTA has been engaged in dredging in the Aricha
sector, some 60 kilometers west of Dhaka, and in the Barisal
sector to keep the rivers navigable, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government in November last year proposed to
dredge 1,150 kilometers of rivers and rivulets in the country, and
work on the project was scheduled to start in the 1998-99 fiscal
year and to be completed by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Situated along the Bay of Bengal and between India and Myanmar
in South Asia, Bangladesh has as many as 230 rivers, the majority
of which form three major river systems -- the Ganges, the
Brahmaputra and the Meghna with their tributaries crisscrossing
the country.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ready for Ozone Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Sate Council and
various government departments are getting ready for the 11th
international meeting on airborne toxins that deplete the life-
sustaining ozone layer, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
They are preparing for an annual meeting of parties to the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, a
work committee announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be in Beijing from November 29 to December 3.
An estimated 1,000 representatives from the member nations and
other air-quality organizations will attend.
</P>
<P>
To gear up for the annual meeting, senior officials from the
committee's key departments, including the State Environmental
Protection Administration, the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Security discussed ways to smooth out logistical
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenghua, minister of the State Environmental Protection
Administration and vice-chairman of the organizing committee, said
the central government hopes to arrange a meeting that will let
developing countries learn from others' experiences.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best to secure all the preparation and
organization work and make the meeting a complete success," Xie
said.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol created a framework for protecting the
ozone layer in a way that would be fair to all nations. The
framework includes a list of controlled ozone-depleting substances
and the timetable for phasing them out.
</P>
<P>
It comes with a fund to help developing countries meet their
air-cleaning obligations as specified by the Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol was adopted in 1987. And so far, there
have been 166 parties to the Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Better External Environment Pushes Up Singapore's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua)-- Singapore has enjoyed three
consecutive quarters of positive economic growth as the global
economy has registered an encouraging continued improvement.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has announced
that the growth momentum of Singapore's key economic sectors has
clearly turned stronger and the results of its surveys show that
most industrialists and commerce and services providers are
anticipating better business prospects in near term.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey released by MTI Thursday on the
country's economic performance in the third quarter of 1999,
Singapore's economy is well on the track to a sustained recovery
after having registered 0.6, 6.7 and 6.7 percent growth,
respectively, in the first three quarter of the year, which has
encouraged MTI to raise its official GDP growth forecast from four
to five percent to around five percent for 1999 and 4.5 to 6.5
percent for 2000.
</P>
<P>
This means the city-state will enjoy an expected about six
percent sustainable growth next year and has completely come out
of the shadow of the Asian financial crisis erupting in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Singapore's economy and the turnaround of
business sentiment is primarily the result of the improvement of
the global economy and the upturn in global industrial activity,
which are essential for Singapore to remove or offset what had led
to Singapore's sharp economic slowdown in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Singapore had attributed last year's sharp economic downturn to
three factors: slump in external demand as a result of deepening
recessions in most parts of Asia, erosion of cost competitiveness
as a result of the sharp depreciation in the regional currencies
and decline in the manufacturing sector triggered off by global
over-capacity in the electronic industries.
</P>
<P>
Marked Changes conducive to the overcoming of these adverse
factors have taken place and Singapore's external and domestic
demands expanded strongly by 7.9 percent and 13 percent,
respectively, in the third quarter of 1999 after a hefty pick-up
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Singapore's largest trade partner, has continued
economic expansion, which helped bilateral trade growth to stay in
positive territory and register a 3.2 percent growth in
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) to U.S. in the third
quarter of this year, a slight improvement from the 2.3 percent
growth in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The EU, Singapore's second biggest trade partner, has posted
positive development, which fueled continued strength in
Singapore's NODX exports to the EU market to achieve a 6.3 percent
hike in the third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Of the other three economies of Singapore's Five top markets,
the improvement in the Japanese economy is proving more
sustainable than previously anticipated and economies of Hong Kong
and Malaysia have turned around to register positive growth.
</P>
<P>
As Japan is Singapore's fourth largest trading partner,
absorbing 6.6 percent of Singapore's export and supplying 17
percent of the city-state's imports, a strengthening of the
Japanese yen has boosted Singapore's exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
While Singapore dollar fell by 5.1 percent against yen,
Singapore's NODX to Japan continued its hefty expansion of 27
percent in the third quarter after the 39 percent increase in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of this year, Singapore's NODX to Malaysia
grew by six percent registering a second consecutive quarter of
expansion, and its NODX to Hong Kong returned to the positive
territory after five quarters of contractions.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the economic recovery, notably in Asia, the third
quarter saw all economic sectors except construction posting
positive growth in Singapore with manufacturing sector surging up
by 17 percent and the wholesale and retail trade expanding 9.3
percent and external trade growing by 10 percent to the level last
seen in the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals in Singapore have continued to pick up this
year, totaling 1.8 million in the third quarter of this year and
representing a 13 percent rise year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The MTI said that the effect of the external upturn, which have
thus far boosted the internationally-oriented and exportable
sectors, has begun to show up more strongly in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sectors such as business services, retail trade
and hotels and restaurants are amongst the best performing
quarters in the third quarter of this year, MTI said.
</P>
<P>
The business sentiment in Asia for the period from October 1999
to March 2000 continues to strengthen generally as the recovery in
external demand filters through to the more domestically-oriented
segments of the economy, MTI added.
</P>
<P>
However, the MTI warned that the key external risks have not
dissipated despite increasingly less likely and the possibility of
a stock market hard landing in the U.S. remains the key
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
MTI also pointed out that one fresh risk since the last quarter
is the excessive strength of the yen which could derail the
incipient recovery in Japan and would be detrimental to Asia
including Singapore.

<P>
China Monday expressed strong indignation at the "wanton

</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the Ishihara's so-called "visit of

reunification cause.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 29 Parties Contest NZ Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine political
parties in New Zealand have registered for contesting the general
election, which is just a week away.
</P>
<P>
Of these, the National Party led by Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley and the Labor Party with Helen Clark as its leader remain
the major rivals in the election.
</P>
<P>
Other important political parties include New Zealand First
Party led by Winston Peters, former deputy prime minister who was
dismissed by Shipley last year; ACT New Zealand, a partner of the
National Party; and the Alliance, a potential coalition ally of
the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand adopts the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)
electoral system. It consists of individual elections in
single-member electoral districts plus an allocation of seats to
political parties based on the total votes won nationwide by each
party in a separate party vote.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, New Zealand citizens or permanent residents who
are 18 or over and have registered to vote will get two votes, one
for the electorate and another for the party they want to be for
the government.
</P>
<P>
During the past month and more, the current MPs and candidates
have been trying to convince voters they're the best people to do
the job. That's why politicians are kissing babies, campaign
billboards are cluttering roadsides telling people whom and which
party they should vote for and there are heaps of political
pamphlets in residents' mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the five major parties have held televised debates,
selling their policies to the public and releasing manifestos
detailing what his or her party intends to do if it hands the
reins of power.
</P>
<P>
Their debates have focused on domestic issues such as taxation,
tertiary education, the economy, superannuation and political
leadership, because they have little difference on external
policies.
</P>
<P>
The main dispute between the ruling party, the National Party,
and the major opposition party, the Labor Party, is their policies
on taxation. The former is determined to go ahead with its tax cut
promises. It pledges to cut the company and top personal tax rates
from 33 percent to 30 percent, if it is re-elected, to encourage
economic growth in the country. This tax policy has been welcomed
by employers, businessmen, and highly-paid people. The latter, if
it wins the forthcoming election, plans to lift the top personal
tax rate by six percentage points on a person's income over 60,000
NZ dollars (31,000 U.S. dollars) per year, in order to spend more
on social welfare projects such as education, public health and
superannuation. The policies of the Labor Party are attractive to
a large number of low-and middle-income people.
</P>
<P>
The results of the public opinion polls during the past year
and more have always given the Labor Party a lead over the
National Party, sometimes obvious, sometimes slight. But most
results of the polls have given Prime Minister Jenny Shipley a
higher support rate than the Leader of the Labor Party, Helen
Clark, in terms of personal reputation. So, It's still hard to
predict which party would win the election.
</P>
<P>
But, it can be predicted that neither the National Party nor
the Labor Party will get a majority of the 120 seats in the
Parliament to form a government by itself.
</P>
<P>
The new New Zealand Government will undoubtedly be a coalition
one. It will be formed either by the Labor Party and its allies to
pursue a center-left line or by the National Party and its
partners to adopt a center-right policy.

<HEADLINE> China's Optic Fiber Demand in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- News from a recent National
Autumn Fair on telecommunications commodities held in south China'
s Guilin City said that China needs six million km of optic fiber
next year,
</P>
<P>
China's optic fiber telecommunications market has been
expanding at an annual rate of 20 percent. This growth rate will
continue until 2002.
</P>
<P>
Optic fibers are needed in making fiber-optic cables for China'
s telecommunications industry. As China has a limited capacity in
producing optic fiber, the country has to import about 70 percent
of its total optic fiber from abroad. In 1997, for instance, China
spent over 200 million U.S. dollars in importing optic fiber from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
China has 1.5 million km optic fiber cables across the country.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adding more details Annan Hails U.S. Positive Move on Back Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday evening said he "is pleased that the United
States Congress has acted positively on the issue of U.S. arrears
to the United Nations," but he stressed all member states are
obliged to pay U.N. dues " in full, on time and without condition,
" a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by Annan's spokesman here, was a quick U.
N. response to the vote by the U.S. Senate to free money to pay U.
N. back dues, which total 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in the statement, "is grateful" to U.S. President Bill
Clinton and his foreign team as well as to members of the House
and Senate " for their determination to break this long-standing
and debilitating impasse."
</P>
<P>
However, "the Secretary-General notes that the legislation does
not provide for all payment of the arrears owed by the United
States to the United Nations, and it includes a number of other
terms and conditions that can only be solved in negotiations
between the United States and the other 187 Member States," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General looks forward to working constructively
with the United States and the entire membership in meeting the
profound challenges the world faces as we enter the 21st century,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Of the 926 million U.S. dollars in the U.S. legislation, which
has to be approved by President Clinton, some 712 million U.S.
dollars are expected to go toward the obligatory 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars Washington owes for regular dues and peacekeeping
assessment. The remainder will go to U.N. agencies the United
States supports, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 million U.S. dollars of the appropriation would be
paid without conditions and will spare the United States from
being stripped of its vote in the 188-member U.N. General Assembly
next year, although it could face the same problem in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, a Member State will "automatically lose
" its vote at the General Assembly if it falls behind in paying
its assessed contributions for regular dues and peacekeeping costs.
</P>
<P>
To pay its bill, the United Nations assesses each country a
bill determined by its wealth, based on gross domestic product (
GDP). Under this formula, the United States accounts for 27
percent of the world's wealth.
</P>
<P>
But before the bulk of the remainder is paid, U.N. members need
to agree to conditions such as lowering the U.S. dues from 25
percent to 22 percent and not raising the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lengthy refusal to pay its back dues has plunged the
world body into a serious financial crisis for decades.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Richard
Holbrooke, who has called the debt dispute "one of the most
unfortunate incidents in recent American foreign policy," has been
shuttling between New York and Washington D.C. in a bid to
persuade Congress into freeing the money to pay the U.N. dues.

<P>
Bulgaria expects to have more talks with Prodi during his visit
to the East European country, Stoyanov told reporters after a
meeting with Prodi in Istanbul on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Prodi's visit will provide a real chance to
start negotiations on its EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
At the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) which opened in Istanbul Thursday, French
President Jacques Chirac told Stoyanov that France supports
Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
All of the heads who attended the OSCE summit also voiced their
supports for Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgaria has not received such
broad and direct support for the past 10 years, the Bulgarian
president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prodi said that the European Commission decided to
float more than 6,000 million euro (about 6,600 million U.S.
dollars) to Bulgaria and Romania, which was part of the EU
enlargement strategy.
</P>
<P>
On the clearing of the Danube River, Prodi said it was an issue
of vital importance which he had discussed with Stoyanov and other
heads of some countries along the Danube River.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Offensive Defeated: Colombian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana on Friday announced that security forces have
successfully defeated offensives by the rebel force and killed
more than 100 guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country'
s largest guerrilla group, has been fighting against the
government for three decades. It launched a new round of joint
attacks in seven of the 32 departments of the country, among them
Guainia, a jungle zone bordering with Venezuela, where the rebels
suffered the biggest number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
"They are defeated. More than 100 rebels were killed,"
Pastrana said in a speech at a military academy, "Our army, marine
infantry, air force and national police demonstrated their
capability of reaction in these efficient joint operations."
</P>
<P>
On October 24, the government and the FARC met for peace talks.
Invited to declare a Christmas and New Year's truce, the
guerrillas responded with a long list of preconditions which were
refused by the government. The FARC started attacks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While vowing to defeat every rebel attack, Pastrana gave no
hint that he will give up hope in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The FARC betrayed the confidence not only of the government,
but of all Colombians who had believed in their declared desire
for peace," Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
"I have obligations to Colombia. I have commitments to the
Colombians. I am seeking peace for my country and people. I will
do it with every available resource," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll by the China
Entrepreneurs Survey System indicates that most Chinese
entrepreneurs are optimistic about the nation's economic
development, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 48.6 percent of the 3,562 respondents
who work in construction, transportation, telecommunications and
services anticipated China's economy will grow six to seven
percent this year. Thirty-one percent said that the growth will be
seven to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the respondents said the country's economic
development is adequate.
</P>
<P>
They believe the country's economic controls have worked well
and will allow the economy to keep growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact of the Asian financial crisis is
dissipating, and deflation should also level off, survey
respondents said. However, insufficient demand, irrational
economic structure and inefficient domestic companies are
restricting further development, those surveyed said.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs said that they hope the central government
continues to adopt pro-active fiscal policies, help non-
governmental investment and raise the income of urban and rural
residents.

<HEADLINE> Premier League to Rule on Sky Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Premier League of England
is to rule on whether BSkyB can keep its 11.2% share in Manchester
United.
</P>
<P>
The European champions are in breach of league rules because
the media company also owns 9.9% of shares in rivals Leeds United.
</P>
<P>
League rules state companies can only own more than 10% of one
club while also owning a stake in another with the permission of
the league's board.
</P>
<P>
The rule was brought in to ensure clubs competing in the same
competition are not given "team orders" by a joint shareholder who
may favour one side winning over the other.
</P>
<P>
At Manchester United's annual general meeting, the club's
finance director, David Gill, said he had written to the league
seeking the all-clear for BSkyB's shareholding.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We feel that Sky should maintain their holding.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that they are able to exert undue influence
on the club, but if the league say they must divest their shares,
then that is what will happen.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see a problem with their roles in other clubs."
</P>
<P>
Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards said the fact
UEFA would not bar Leeds and United appearing in the same European
competion showed there was no concern over BSkyB's influence on
the clubs.
</P>
<P>
He said: "As for this country and the FA Cup, you mustn't
forget that Tranmere and Everton have Peter Johnson as their major
shareholder and they have both been allowed to compete side by
side in the competition."
</P>
<P>
An attempt by BSkyB earlier this year to buy a controlling
interest in Manchester United was blocked by the government on
competition grounds, as it feared giving the satellite company too
much power in negotiating television rights to premiership
football.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB also recently bought a minority share in Manchester
United's local rivals Manchester City.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Calls for Shareholders' Rejection to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany's leading mobile phone
group Mannesmann AG Friday urged its shareholders to reject the
record-high revised offer of British Vodafone Airtouch which had
launched a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone Airtouch, world's No.1 in mobile business, has
announced a hostile bid for Mannesmann of 242 billion marks (128
billion U.S. dollars) after it failed in a friendly takeover
attempt earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The British firm is offering 53.7 of its own shares in open
market for each Mannesmann share in what might be the biggest
corporate buyout in history. The deal, if successful, will thwart
MCI Worldcom's record 115 billion U.S. dollars purchase last month
of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
But Mannesmann executive has not yet given up resistance,
instead it is persuading shareholders to reject the "risky" offer.
</P>
<P>
"This offer is weak and full of risk to our shareholders," said
Klaus Esser, Mannesmann chief executive, Friday at the company's
headquarters in Duesseldorff.
</P>
<P>
"A decision over a friendly or hostile takeover will at first
be based on whether it is in the interests of shareholders," Esser
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Esser's plan to defend Mannesmann was accepted by the company's
supervisory board at a special session Friday evening, after the
board received Vodafone's offer. Esser is scheduled to disclose
his strategy to Mannesmann shareholders next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Vodafone achieved its bid for Mannesmann, the British firm
would become world's largest international mobile network carrier
with over 42 million customers.
</P>
<P>
But Mannesmann's traditional units, including machinery and
automotive technology, will be sold as Vodafone has planned.
Germans are afraid thousands of jobs will be lost.

telecommunications in the central American country.
</P>
<P>
The credit will promote the expansion of the telephone service
in the rural areas and will assist in the correction of the
information error of the year 2000 in the telephone systems,
Nicaraguan authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan telecommunications system provides less than 30
lines for every 1,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (
ENITEL) will design more efficient programs with the World Bank
credit, to provide Nicaraguans with telephone service even in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank credit will be paid back in 40 years under
variable rates of interest with 10 years of grace.

<HEADLINE> NZ Welcomes WTO Decision on US Lamb Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Saturday
welcomed the World Trade Organization's (WTO) decision to
establish a disputes settlement panel to consider its case against
the United States lamb safeguard action which restricts imports of
New Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement on Saturday, Minister for International
Trade Lockwood Smith said the establishment of a panel is "welcome
news" and means that a final ruling on this case will be made by
the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed a tariff on imports of lamb from New
Zealand and Australia. The New Zealand Government believes the
tariff is contrary to the rules of the WTO. It initially sought
formal consultations with the U.S., but the consultations, which
were held in late August this year, failed to resolve the issue.
Since then New Zealand has actively sought a WTO disputes
settlement panel to rule on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Government's decision to introduce trade restrictions
on lamb imports must be challenged," Smith said, adding that
acceptance of the U.S. interpretation of the safeguard action
would set an "unfortunate precedent" and could lead to
"restricting fair trade in goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The WTO disputes settlement body has also approved a request
for a panel from Australia on the U.S. lamb import restrictions,
and one panel will be established to hear both cases, according to
the New Zealand Minister.

MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine economy grew at a slower pace in the third
quarter than in the second, but the expansion was more broad-based
and not as reliant on the farm sector, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Today:
</P>
<P>
-- For lack of funds, the offer of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan for a Filipino to head the U.N. peacekeeping force in East
Timor may have to be refused, a senior Philippine official said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Bank of the Philippines kept the key overnight
rates unchanged Friday to ward-off ill impact of the latest hike
in the U.S. rates, as well as the deterioration in the budget
position of the government, on the peso.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Closes With Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket
closed Friday at 23.28 U.S. dollars per barrel after a firm
increase of 1.28 dollars over last week, said the Mining and
Energy Ministry (MEM).
</P>
<P>
The average price of the Venezuelan crude in the first 18 days
of November is 21.87 dollars per barrel, said the MEM, attributing
the price surge to an increasing use of the fuel as winter arrives
in the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Crude exports of Venezuela represent 80 percent of its total
foreign trade volume and 58 percent of tax revenues.

to the United Nations," but he stressed all member states are
obliged to pay U.N. dues "in full, on time and without condition,"
a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by Annan's spokesman here, was a quick U.
N. response to the move by the U.S. Congress to free money to pay
U.N. back dues, which total 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"He (the Secretary-General) believes this vote marks a turning
point in the efforts to restore the United States to its natural
leadership position at the United Nations," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in the statement, "is grateful" to U.S. President Bill
Clinton and his foreign team as well as to members of the House
and Senate "for their determination to break this long-standing
and debilitating impasse."
</P>
<P>
However, "the Secretary-General notes that the legislation does
not provide for all payment of the arrears owed by the United
States to the United Nations, and it includes a number of other
terms and conditions that can only be solved in negotiations
between the United States and the other 187 Member States," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General looks forward to working constructively
with the United States and the entire membership in meeting the
profound challenges the world faces as we enter the 21st century,"
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Railway Station To Be Rebuilt After Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's railway authorities
will rebuild the Nanjing Railway Station severely damaged in a
fire on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Two new waiting halls, each with an area of 1,000 sq m, will be
built on the eastern and western sides of the station square next
month. A garden will be constructed on the site of the original
waiting room destroyed by the fire.
</P>
<P>
An overall facelift of the station will start next year.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at about 1:00 a.m. on November 12 in
a video entertainment room on the second floor of the station,
completely destroyed the 2,200-sq-m passenger waiting room, cut
electricity, and killed a businessman. Baggage offices were
vacated to make way for temporary waiting rooms and a new 1,500-sq-
m temporary waiting room was built on the station square soon
after the fire.
</P>
<P>
Normal passenger and cargo transport operations have not been
affected by the incident. Nanjing Railway Station, a major stop on
the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, was built in 1968.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region has
successfully grown artificially-bred saffron, a medicinal herb
known as "the King of Plants" and sold in shops and markets in
Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
According to a local spokesman, the medicinal herb was first
developed by researchers at Sichuan University and then by the Bio-
Science Development Company Ltd. in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Saffron can invigorate blood circulation, cause a swelling to
go down and prevent fatigue and aging. It is also effective in
treating brain diseases, tumors and viruses.
</P>
<P>
Although saffron was first used on a trial basis in the
treatment of ailments and diseases in Tibet, it has to be imported
from abroad because neither wild nor artificial saffron is found
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Saffron is grown on 3,650 square meters in the Lhasa River
valley on a trial basis. Four kg of dried saffron and six tons of
seeds are expected to be produced in the initial stages of
experiments.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says against Isolationism, Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential front-runner, outlined his foreign
policy views on Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library, saying he was against isolationism and protectionism
because it was a "shortcut to disaster."
</P>
<P>
He criticized members of both Republican and Democratic
politicians who expressed their support for isolationism and
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"This is the shortcut to chaos, an approach that abandons our
allies and our ideals," the Texas governor said. "The vacuum
left by America's retreat would invite challenges to our power."
</P>
<P>
Bush also warned against drifting from crisis to crisis,
saying that "America must be involved in the world, but that
does not mean our military is the answer to every difficult
foreign policy situation -- a substitute for strategy."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the United States should "develop and deploy"
missile defense systems, both theater and national, which are
opposed by almost all the world, including U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
He also called for shifting the country's relationship with
Russia and China from one of "strategic partners" to that of
competitors engaged "without ill-will -- but without illusions."
</P>
<P>
And he proposed to strengthen alliances with South Korea,
Japan, the Philippines, Australia and Thailand, which he said
would serve as a counterbalance to China.
</P>
<P>
"If I am president, China will find itself respected as a
great power, but in a region of strong democratic alliances. It
will be unthreatened, but not unchecked," he said.
</P>
<P>
He would challenge the determination of China for the
unification, saying he would "help Taiwan defend itself."
</P>
<P>
But he supported China's admission into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Russia, Bush said there was a "real
possibility" that the United States and Russia could team up on
a system that would protect both nations, so long as Russia
"breaks its habit of proliferation."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that both the United States and Russia "confront
the legacy of a dead ideological rivalry -- thousands of nuclear
weapons," and called for an inventory of all nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
Bush already has made some major addresses on civic
responsibility, defense and education. This time was his own view
on foreign policy. Next month he will speak on economic policy.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Friday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling on a
profit warning from the world largest heavy machinery maker
Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the trading, the Dow index fell 31.81 at
11,003.89. The blue chip index rose 152.61 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 2.94 at 1,422.00 but the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 22.14 at 3,369.25, surpassing the
record closing high of 3,347.11 points set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as Caterpillar warned that its fourth
quarter profits will be slightly higher than 61 cents a share
earned in the previous quarter but lower than 97 cents expected
by analysts.
</P>
<P>
But the index trimmed its losses because of IBM's report on
good performance. Shares of IBM, the Dow's component, rose
higher.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index was pushed higher as China.com, a Hong
Kong-based Internet company, declared a 2-to-1 stock split. The
company benefited from the Sino-U.S. trade deal on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization this week and its share jumped
nearly 22 percent after the stock split.
</P>
<P>
Among other Internet companies which closed higher were JDS
Uniphase Corp., a fiber-optic equipment maker. The company rose
more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.78 at 646.12 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 0.76 at 461.28. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 3.38 at 826.12.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on

<HEADLINE> Collins Retires from International Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Scotland football team mainstay
John Collins shocked his country Saturday by announcing his
retirement from international football.
</P>
<P>
The Everton midfielder, one of Craig Brown's heroes in Scotland
's 1-0 Euro 2000 play-off second-leg win over lacklustre England
at Wembley this week, has told the national coach that his 58th
cap will be his last.
</P>
<P>
Collins, 31, gave no specific indication of the reason for his
unexpected decision, saying simply: "I just want to announce my
retirement from the Scotland team and leave it at that."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I am proud to have played so often for Scotland but
I hope people respect my decision."
</P>
<P>
Collins, finishing his international career on a high, admitted
to being upset by the reaction to the 2-0 first-leg defeat by
England at Hampden Park last weekend which ultimately resulted in
Scotland's elimination from the European Championship finals next
summer.
</P>
<P>
"We've been hurt by criticism that we felt was over the top
after the first match at Hampden," he told The Scottish Sun.
</P>
<P>
"You can look at the games against England in two ways. On one
hand we are out but we took a lot of satisfaction and pride from
our win.
</P>
<P>
"The only difference between the two matches was that England
took their chances," he said.

<HEADLINE> Christie Vows His Innocence Despite Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- World sprint legend Linford
Christie of Britain attempted to draw a line under the drugs row
that has embroiled him, despite a setback in his fight to clear
his name.
</P>
<P>
Christie, Britain's greatest sprinter, will have an agonising
wait before learning his final fate after testing positive for the
steroid nandrolone in February.
</P>
<P>
An International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) council
meeting Friday referred the case of the 1992 Olympic Games 100m
gold medallist Christie and 400m hurdler Gary Cadogan to an
arbitration panel after deciding they were unhappy with the
decision to clear them made by UK Athletics in September.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration panel will meet early next year and if they
find Christie guilty he will be banned for two years.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement to PA Sport, Christie renewed his claims of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
He said: "As far as I am concerned the matter has already been
dealt with long ago by the UK Athletics disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
"I am innocent and have been comprehensively cleared. In any
case I am retired as an athlete and look forward to furthering my
career in coaching and broadcasting."
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics' disciplinary committee cleared Christie after he
had tested positive for nandrolone at an indoor meeting in
Dortmund and forwarded their findings to the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
After considering Christie's case last weekend the world body's
anti-doping commission refused to accept UK Athletics' findings.
</P>
<P>
Reigning European 200m champion Doug Walker is already awaiting
his arbitration hearing after the IAAF said they believe there is
a case for him to answer after metabolites of nandrolone were
found in his sample last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cautions against Speculation in EgyptAir Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The head of a main U.S.
agency probing into the EgyptAir crash Friday expressed his deep
regret over media speculation on the cause of the accident which
killed all 217 aboard a New York-Cairo Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) Jim Hall told reporters in Washington that some
"unidentified sources" have led media to speculate on
"undocumented information" from the jet's cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
"This has caused pain for the (victims') families, has not
promoted the interests of aviation safety and has placed
misinformation in the public realm," Hall said.
</P>
<P>
He joined State Department spokesman James Rubin in trying to
make the investigation more smoothly for the interests of victims'
families and the relationship between the U.S. and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"We are troubled by the tremendous amount of inaccuracy, wild
speculation and outlandish conspiracy theories coming through in a
variety of media," Rubin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has pointed to the crew member Gamil al-Batouti,
whose religious phrase uttered moments before the crash was
deduced to a "suicide attempt" leading to the doomed plunge of the
flight 990 jet into the Atlantic some 60 miles off U.S. southeast
coast October 31.
</P>
<P>
Muslims in the Arab world feel irritated by the "suicide"
theory.
</P>
<P>
Hall said 3 additional Egyptian representatives joined the
Egyptian delegation headed by General Abdel-Fatteh Kato and U.S.
and Egyptian personnel are reviewing the investigation process.
</P>
<P>
A literal Arabic transcript of the entire cockpit voice
recording is being prepared and when it is completed, an English
translation will be done, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recovery operations for victims' remains and
aircraft wreckage are expected to begin shortly after a
multipurpose offshore installation vessel arrives from Lisbon
around December 1, Hall added.

<HEADLINE> Keane to Resume Talk with Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- England premier league football
club Manchester United are to make a last attempt to persuade Roy
Keane to sign a new contract before the New Year.
</P>
<P>
United chief executive Martin Edwards told the club's annual
general meeting today that the future of the club's captain was a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
Keane is out of contract in the summer and could then leave on
a free transfer.
</P>
<P>
After 1 January, the Republic of Ireland international will be
free to talk to other clubs.
</P>
<P>
Edwards confirmed that manager Sir Alex Ferguson will have new
talks with Keane in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Sir Alex is going to have another chat with Roy. We would
obviously like to put it to bed, but Roy has said that he doesn't
want to do it until the end of the season," said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
"We would need some feedback from him on that. But if there is
any possibility of doing something before the January 1 deadline
then obviously we would be delighted to so.
</P>
<P>
"Those talks with Roy will be held before Christmas."
</P>
<P>
Keane is reputed to want around 40,000-a-week to sign a new
contract, and shareholders expressed concern at the possibility
that the club could lose its driving inspiration.
</P>
<P>
But PLC chairman Sir Roland Smith made it clear that Keane's
future was uppermost in the board's mind.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do whatever needs to be done to keep him," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But until he has made up his mind about what he wants, we can'
t do anything."
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Keane question, a number of other frequently-
discussed issues surrounding United were aired at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Edwards denied suggestions of a rift between him and Ferguson,
while the club's FA Cup withdrawal and the unsuccessful BSkyB
takeover bid were also discussed.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Backed Over Hampden Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- England football team manager
Kevin Keegan has received widespread support over his decision to
stay up until dawn with a handful of England players to watch
Lennox Lewis' world heavyweight title fight after his team's 2-0
victory at Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Paul Ince revealed after the 1-0 defeat against the
Scots at Wembley almost four days later that he was among the
group of players who watched the boxing on television in the team
hotel with Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Ince said: "Five of us stayed up to six o'clock in the morning,
having a few beers, playing cards and watching the Lennox Lewis
fight - and Kevin was one of them."
</P>
<P>
Ince's comments were intended to show how well Keegan was
bonding with his team as the midfielder added: "We are together.
He gets the squad going, and the players love him."
</P>
<P>
But, while some newspapers had a wry dig at Keegan's team then
performing like a 'pub side' at Wembley, one report quoted sports
scientists questioning whether players would have recovered
properly for training sessions and even called for Keegan to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Football Association chiefs, who were well aware of what had
taken place, dismissed suggestions that Keegan had placed the team
's preparation for the Wembley game at risk and initially chose to
release a short statement backing the coach to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
They believed that with almost four days until the return
fixture and with two doctors in the camp Keegan had not done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double later added: "Kevin Keegan talked
quite openly last Monday about the arrangements he had made with
his players last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"He was then praised for treating his players like adults. In
our view, there isn't an issue to discuss."
</P>
<P>
Those arrangements were that the players could take the Sunday
off, with the only stipulation being that they did not go to a
nightclub - and while some chose to watch the fight with Keegan
before then sleeping in, others went home or played golf.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls on Sierra Leonean Parties to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday called upon warring Sierra Leonean parties to honor
the July peace accord at once in a bid to promote the peace
process in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement to the press here by
the president of the 15-nation Security Council, Danilo Turk of
Slovenia at the end of the closed-door session on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Council members called on all parties to the Lome Peace
Agreement to immediately implement all its provisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council expressed continued concern
about the volatile security situation, and violations of the Lome
Peace Agreement and the consequent humanitarian suffering of the
people of Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the efforts by the Government of
Sierra Leone, the U.N. special representative, Francis Okelo, and
the 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
to support the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Council members also "urged excombatants, especially those
belonging to the RUF (rebel Revolutionary United Front), to lay
down their arms, enter the camps, and help start to rebuild a
peaceful and stable Sierra Leone for the benefit of all its
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members stressed that it is unacceptable that rebels
should continue to harass and intimidate humanitarian personnel,"
he said. "They underlined that international community can only
assist Sierra Leone where conditions permit and reminded rebel
leaders of commitments on humanitarian access which they made on
signing the Lome Peace Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members welcomed the immediate deployment of robust
peacekeeping force, for which first troops will arrive later this
month," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, preparations are now well under way for the
deployment of the 6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force, an earlier
U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah singed the peace accord
on July 7 in Lome, capital of Togo to end the civil war, which
broke out in 1991. An earlier accord signed in November 1996
collapsed within days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force, which include a substantial number
of the Nigerian soldiers, will deploy across Sierra Leone as
former rebel fighters surrendered their weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton pledged late Friday that he would do his best to help
resolve the differences between Greece and Turkey as well as the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner given in his honor at the presidential
building here, Clinton, who arrived here Friday evening for a
24-hour official visit, said that he had urged Turkish leaders to
resolve its differences with Greece and he himself would do
everything possible to help settle the issues and to promote
friendship and reconciliation between Greece and Turkey, whose
relations have been strained for decades over their disputes in
the territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of
the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit comes during a thaw in relations between the
two long-time rival neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Ankara, Clinton pressed Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to make a
"positive gesture" towards Greece.
</P>
<P>
This is Clinton's first-ever visit to Greece, and thousands of
Greeks demonstrated in downtown Athens to protest against his
visit and Washington's policy toward the Balkan region. In the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki as well as in some 30 other
Greek cities, Greeks held similar acts.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 EU Cases Found to Be Fraud in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Friday that over 1,000 cases of suspicion of irregularities and
fraud in 1998 proved to be fraud with losses of over one billion
U.S. dollars in EU and its member states.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1998 annual report on fight against fraud, EU
commissioner responsible for budget and fraud prevention Michaele
Schreyer said 120 officials of the EU anti-fraud office investigation
5,318 fraud-related cases last year, of which about 20 percent
proved to be fraud.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that cigarette smuggling alone had deprived
the 15 EU member states of hundreds of millions of dollars in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
And one criminal syndicate diverted on-and-a-half million
liters of alcohol from the EU to Eastern Europe, falsely
declaring it to be tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
The report also said over five thousand suspected fraud cases
had been investigated but only one EU executive's official had
been sacked, who received payments in exchange for contracts.
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, vice president of the European Commission, the
EU's executive arm, has published what he calls a whistleblower's
charter, setting guidelines to EU staff who want to report
suspicions of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"I have long held the view that conscientious and responsible
whistleblowing in public and private sector organizations is
necessary and justified," Kinnock said today during a meeting in
The Hague, Netherlands.

UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Coordinator for Afghanistan on Friday deplored the bombing of
displaced persons in Panjshir Valley of Afghanistan.

No staff of the U.N. office or international agency in Bazarak

The U.N. set up an office in the area in September to respond

LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) - European markets gave a cold
response to the world's largest takeover attempt Friday, with
London stocks closing well in the red and others failing to do
much better.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone AirTouch, the world's biggest mobile phone company,
sought Friday to land a knock-out blow on Mannesmann with a 127.7
billion US dollars hostile offer direct to the shareholders of the
German telecom company.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 suffered its biggest loss in four week on the
session as renewed fears of further UK rate rises rattled banks
and Vodafone Airtouch unnerved investors with its hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed at 6,482.3 points, down 68.5 or 1.05
percent. This was down 29.3 points from a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Banks wiped 17 points off the FTSE amid revived worries of a
possible rise in rates that would hit demand for loans. Lloyds TSB
and Barclays both lost more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil giants BP Amoco and Shell also fell sharply, carving 19
points from the FTSE 100 as a dip in crude prices sparked a bout
of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed just 5.92 points higher at
5,955.97. At one stage the index hit a new peak for the year of
6,032.67, but the slide in Mannesmann stock left the index
clinging barely to positive territory.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares ended with a new record as the CAC-40's
heavyweight France Telecom surged 6.0 percent late in the day,
helping the index erase earlier losses.
</P>

The CAC-40 index closed at 5,263.23 points, up 16.9 or 0.32

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate adopted a
compromise intelligence budget legislation Friday, authorizing an
increase in spending for intelligence activities.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which includes a provision strengthening sanctions
against drug traffickers and their associates, covers the Central
Intelligence Agency and 10 other intelligence agencies and
programs.
</P>
<P>
With Friday's adoption, the bill is going to President Clinton
for signature. Sponsors said President Clinton was expected to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers familiar with the legislation disclosed that the
budget totaled about 29.5 billion dollars, up considerably from
the 26.7 billion dollars level of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Senator Bob Kerrey, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said the intelligence community needs more money
because its resources are stretched thin, partly due to the need
to keep pace with technological advances.
</P>
<P>
The legislation allows imposition of economic and financial
sanctions on leading international narcotics traffickers and
confiscation of assets of the traffickers' business partners by
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
It also requires the president to present a "most wanted" list
once a year to identify leading international narcotics dealers.
</P>
<P>
Those on the list would be subject to having their U.S.-based
assets frozen. The traffickers, their families and their
associates would also be denied visas to enter the U.S..

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Russia, Western Powers Clash over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The two-day summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) ended
here Friday, but the wrangling between Russia and western powers
over the Chechnya issue is likely to persist.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held immediately after the conclusion of
the summit, OSCE Chairman-in-Office Knut Vollebaek announced
Russia has agreed that a political solution to the issue is
essential.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia welcomes a visit to the area by the chief of the
OSCE, the pan-European security body. Moscow also welcomes the
OSCE to assist in the renewal of a political dialog with the
leadership of the rebel republic, he added.
</P>
<P>
While Vollebaek's announcement seems to indicate a turn of
Russian stand, however, the angry exchanges Thursday between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on one side, and western leaders
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, on the other, do not fall
into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to emphasize here that lasting peace in the
Chechnya and so-called 'peace negotiations' with bandits are not
one and the same thing," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
No one should be under any illusion on that score and there
will be no negotiations with bandits and murderers, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Clinton countered him by calling for a political dialog not
with terrorists but with those who are willing to seek a peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
But they certainly differ on who the terrorists are and who
those willing to seek a peaceful resolution should be in Chechnya,
as the Russian government deems all the rebels and their leaders
in Chechnya terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Russia regards the Chechnya issue an internal
affair, whereas the western powers reject the notion.
</P>
<P>
"You have no right to criticize Russia over Chechnya," Yeltsin
lectured.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept the prescriptions of the so-called
'objective' critics of Russia," he asserted, adding "we know very
well from and through which countries the terrorists are receiving
support."
