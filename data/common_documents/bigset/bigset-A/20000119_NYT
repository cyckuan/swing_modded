JONES SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's well-coached edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones is a very smart man, and we know that because he
hasn't hired himself to coach the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Running America's Team has moved alongside demolition expert and
nuclear waste management as one of the tougher jobs. All those
years watching Clippers games with Al Davis obviously made Jones a
football expert, and he's exerting his influence with all of Davis'
subtly.
</P>
<P>
   Firing Chan Gailey wasn't Jones' mistake. Hiring him was. But
Jones got exactly what he wanted, a malleable coach who would
neither stand up to the owner nor get in the way, work for the
lowest salary among head coaches in the NFL, and not take his guns
on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes he's the fellow who turned the Colts around, not
Jimmy Johnson, Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman or the trade of Herschel
Walker. Jones suffers from a strange affliction that strikes many
powerful, monied men: Having succeeded in one area of business,
they believe they are capable of running any other business despite
any real insight.
</P>
<P>
   Jones obviously was a good oil tycoon. But just as Clippers
Donald Sterling made his money through real estate, a lot of it is
just good fortune and good timing. Jones bought a team in the dumps
that had only one way to go and gave Johnson the wherewithal to
build it the way he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   And that's important. Gailey inherited an aging team with
personnel and salary cap problems, and he failed. And likewise,
Johnson inherited a team in Miami with its own problem dynamic, and
he too failed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson should have known better. His effort to retrofit the
Dolphins was destined to fail, because Dan Marino is a three-step
quarterback and a team is limited in what it can do running the
ball if defenses don't have to worry about play action. Plus,
Johnson never had a speed back capable of turning a corner, because
his preference are between the tackle warriors like Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic it is that the best man to coach Jones' Cowboys is
probably Johnson, who happens to be retired. . . .
</P>
<P>
   No league copies itself more than the NFL, so expect a lot of
coordinators to fill the vacancies around the league. A lot of
ex-coordinators had good success this past season as head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Brian Billick, Kansas City's Gunther Cunningham,
Chicago's Dick Jauron, Philadelphia's Andy Reid and the Raiders'
Jon Gruden all have received complimentary word of mouth after
first or second seasons of work this season. Gruden, Jauron and
Reid all fell off the Mike Holmgren family tree, which may explain
why the Packers hired another Holmgren protege, Mike Sherman, as
its head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin and Cleveland's Chris Palmer are
extensions of the Bill Parcells family. The Jets new owner will
make one final run at getting Parcells back on the sidelines one
more year, but he'll hire Jets aide Al Groh if he can't. Parcells,
who always chafed with general managers, wants his shot at making
all of the decisions, without having to be on the field and running
every practice.
</P>
<P>
   Other gossip: Dallas may promote defensive coordinator Dave
Campo, although Jones may make a run at Broncos aide Gary Kubiak.
New England is waiting for the Bill Belichick mess to be decided,
with ex-Raiders Art Shell and Willie Shaw and ex-Carolina coach Dom
Capers as possible alternates. New Orleans needs to hire a G.M.
before a coach, and just-fired Steelers G.M. Tom Donohoe is a
candidate. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If I'm a Miami Dolphins fan, I'm worried about what Wayne
Huizenga might do with the fish now that Johnson has retired. The
same man who blew the Marlins up after winning a World Series could
urge Dan Marino to retire, keep the team under the salary for a
year or two, and count his profit.
</P>
<P>
   As badly as the Dolphins and Johnson said they wanted to win
this year, Miami played about $6 million under the league salary
cap. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Looking for insight into this weekend's NFL playoff games? How
'90s of you. Here's a very early forecast on the NFL '00 season:
</P>
<P>
   NFC East: As long as Danny Snyder doesn't break Norv Turner's
toys, the Redskins should be able to stay atop the division. They
have three first-round picks in the 2000 draft, the second, 12th
and one more between No. 24 and 27. The Cowboys are another year
older, and everyone else has holes. Team to watch: The Eagles, who
were pretty competitive late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central: Tampa has two first round picks and seemingly has a
quarterback they can build around. The Bears should be better in
their second year in a west coast offense. The Packers (new coach),
Vikings (old coach) and Lions (Barry Sanders) have baggage to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   NFC West: Rams rule, unless you subscribe to the theory that the
'99 Rams are the '98 Falcons with a better end zone dance. The
49ers still have cap problems and a fuzzy-headed quarterback, the
Saints are beyond help, and '98 was a fluke for the Falcons. Team
to watch: Carolina in George Seifert's second season.
</P>
<P>
   AFC East: Fox Sports analyst Cris Collinsworth believes the Jets
could win the Super Bowl if Parcells comes back, and Indianapolis
will be strong again if the defense gets a personnel upgrade.
Everyone else in the division is in flux Miami and New England with
new coaches, and Buffalo with a quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central: Jacksonville and Tennessee are both young by NFL
standards, and they don't appear to be in jeopardy of losing many
key players to free agency. It helps having Cleveland and
Cincinnati in the same division. Team to watch: Baltimore, a team
that got better as the season progressed, and has two first round
picks (5 and 14).
</P>
<P>
   AFC West: The division from hell. Denver won't go 6-10 again,
the Chiefs and Raiders are tough, and Seattle will improve as long
as Mike Holmgren the G.M. fills holes at wideout and linebacker for
Holmgren the coach. The rest of the division wishes Ryan Leaf a
speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State is 10-3, but it still isn't getting much
support in any of the computer rankings. The combination of some
easy nonconference wins and the Big West's puny reputation is too
much for the 49ers to gain much respect.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is closing in on hallowed ground with eight
straight wins. A win against New Mexico State Thursday would match
the nine-game winning streak put together by Joe Harrington's
1989-90 team.
</P>
<P>
   Between the 1968-69 and 1973-74 seasons, the 49ers posted eight
winning streaks of 10 games or more, six by Jerry Tarkanian and two
by Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Lute's 1973-74 team had 12- and 11-game winning streaks. The
all-time school record is 19 wins by Tarkanian's 1969-70 squad, and
Tark also had a 16-game streak in 1970-71. . . .
</P>
<P>
   There's no truth to reports that John Rocker's e-mail address is
kkk.rocker.jrk.

DO GOOD VIBES EQUAL WINS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the subject of chemistry, Davey Johnson and Kevin Malone go
together like oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   I would have said bleach and ammonia, a notoriously noxious
combination, but I'm not sure if it's dangerous that the Dodgers'
manager and general manager clash on a basic tenet of
team-building.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their apparent disagreement points to a problem that some
Dodgers-watchers have suspected for a while, that Johnson and
Malone aren't reading from the same page of the Baseball
Encyclopedia. Or maybe it's no problem at all. We'll find out
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day is 10 weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Johnson and Malone were at USC's Dedeaux Field for
the first of the Dodgers' informal pre-spring-training workouts.
Malone spoke at length about how encouraged by new Dodgers chairman
Robert Daly he made a winter priority of improving the clubhouse
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up in scouting, and one reason I had some success was
because I focused on the (players') attitude,'' Malone said. ``The
key for me was what we call makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, since the Dodgers' second consecutive third-place
finish, he sent notable malcontent Raul Mondesi to Toronto and
acquired players like community-minded right fielder Shawn Green,
wise old pitcher Orel Hershiser and scrappy utility man F.P.
Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the guys who are !ital!baseball players,''
Malone said, meaning guys who play the game the right way, whose
approach might rub off on teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you bring in guys with makeup and hope it comes
together,'' Malone said. ``I think we tried to do that last year
with (catcher Todd) Hundley, (center fielder Devon) White and
(pitcher Kevin) Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley played hurt in 1999 and it's hard to lead from the
Mendoza Line. Brown won 18 games but lacks the personality to teach
his young staffmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have multiple guys with that attitude, so it rubs
off on everybody,'' Malone said. ``When you're struggling, when
you're going through adversity, it's the glue that keeps everybody
together.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounded good to me, so a few minutes later on that
morning at USC, I asked Johnson about the importance of chemistry.
He reacted as if I'd proposed a clubhouse gift exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' the manager said, ``chemistry to me is if you've
got the best offensive club in the league, the best pitching staff
in the league and the best defense in the league, and guys saying,
`We're pretty good,' '' Johnson said. ``!ital!That is good
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry on this club,'' Johnson went on, ``was pretty
good last year, but the offense ranked eighth in the league, the
pitching staff ranked eighth and the defense ranked eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Dodgers were 11th in runs scored, seventh in ERA
and 13th in fielding percentage, but Johnson was making a point,
something like the curmudgeonly adage that leadership is a
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't very balanced and we were easy to defend,'' he
said, referring to the shortage of left-handed power, a problem
that Green's 42-home-run bat might solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry. I hear that all the time,'' he said, almost
mockingly. ``I had guys who hated each other, but they drove in
runs. Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez didn't go out together, but
they could play like heck.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was referring to the New York Mets team he managed to
the 1986 World Series championship. The only chemistry those Mets
knew was practiced by their bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bring in the best guys in the world, but if they can't
play, it doesn't help. You always win because of execution,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly thinks he knows what Johnson meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Davey about that, and what he's saying is,
`Winning is important, because when you win, people tend to rally
together,' '' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, chemistry is a product of winning, rather than the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Daly can't help thinking back to 1988, when he was
merely a well-connected fan cheering Tom Lasorda's overachieving
Dodgers of Mickey Hatcher and the Stunt Men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what chemistry is about for me,'' said Daly,
who takes the unusual step of interviewing potential acquisitions,
to make sure money isn't the only reason they want to be Dodgers.
``It's about people who can stay together when they're not doing
well. The real issue is that people don't start blaming each other
when things don't go well. I'm talking about the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy realizes he gets slaps on the back just for moving a
runner over, and not just for hitting a home run, he'll feel good
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's possible to create a feel-good clubhouse a surely
as a hit summer movie, whether you can orchestrate chemistry or
must hope it just HAPPENS, Daly will see. So will Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson? Just give him the hottest hitters and the hardest
throwers and he'll take his chances.

TEST OF PENTAGON'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: The following added story is now the lead story on The New
York Times front page.)  
(rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a serious setback to plans for creating a
missile defense system to protect the United States, a missile
fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific failed to hit a mock
warhead fired earlier thousands of miles away from a California air
base, the Pentagon announced Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was considered a critical test, since President Clinton is
scheduled to decide this summer whether to proceed with full
deployment of a multibillion-dollar system to shield the United
States from limited missile attacks from North Korea and other
potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Pentagon had tested a fully integrated
system of radars and sensors intended to guide the missile as it
sped into space in search of the target.
</P>
<P>
   If the test had succeeded, the Pentagon would have met its own
minimum standard for advising the president that the technology was
feasible for deploying the system in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the military will have one more chance in late April or
early May to test the system and prove that it works. The
administration has imposed a June deadline for the Pentagon to open
its review of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Pentagon was at a loss to explain what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably won't have any information telling us why we
failed for at least 48 hours,'' said Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the
Air Force, the spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization. ``There are a lot of people involved _ we
don't even know how far off we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor, or kill vehicle, was tried out in a test last
October. The interceptor was pre-programmed to find its target and
did hit the mock warhead. The value of the accomplishment was later
questioned, however, when Pentagon officials acknowledged last week
that the interceptor had succeeded only after a series of mistakes
caused it to drift off course; the kill vehicle initially homed in
on the balloon decoy, not the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the latest test will fuel the already deep divide
between politicians and anti-nuclear activists over the prospect of
building this $12.5 billion shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another indication that the president would be
ill-advised to pursue deployment of this system this summer,'' said
Tom Z. Collina, director of the arms control and international
security program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group
opposed to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised the test failed,'' Collina said. ``There were so
many backup systems. The test was so controlled that it is
surprising that under those conditions they still failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's launching, other critical elements of a
defense shield were tested, including space-based sensors,
ground-based radar and the system's command centers.
</P>
<P>
   The test began with the launching of a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California at 9:19 Tuesday night, Eastern time. The missile
carried a mock warhead and a balloon decoy.
</P>
<P>
   About twenty minutes later a prototype intercepter was launched
from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, some 4,300 miles
west of the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The kill vehicle hurtled towards the missile but failed to hit
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner said it would be weeks before the officials would
understand the reasons for the failure.
</P>
<P>
   A product of research begun under President Ronald Reagan's
unfulfilled Star Wars concept, this far more modest defense shield
is meant to protect all 50 states from a limited strike by an
unpredictable enemy, like North Korea. It could not stem a
full-scale attack from a nation like China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If built, it would be the most complicated weapon system ever
designed.
</P>
<P>
   It would also break the rules set out in the 1972 Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty signed by Moscow and Washington, which forbid either
nation from establishing a missile defense system to protect the
entire land mass of their countries from attack.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican presidential contenders, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have said they would
be willing to build the defense shield even if Russia continued to
refuse to alter the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty was meant to offset building defensive weapons
because the other side would feel compelled to build an offensive
system that would overwhelm it,'' said Richard Perle, an adviser to
Governor Bush who worked on missile defense for President Reagan.
``That whole view disappeared with the Soviet Union. If you really
believe the Cold War is over then the treaty is no longer
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that deploying this system would undermine not
just the anti-ballistic missile treaty but the entire system of
arms reduction and nonproliferation treaties that have limited the
spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   With growing concerns about the proliferation of missile
technology, Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense
Act of 1999, which requires the deployment of a system when it is
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to make a decision this summer whether to
go ahead with the deployment, about the same time the two political
parties will be holding their conventions, adding to concerns that
politics rather than policy will drive the decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By then the Pentagon will have held another test in April or May
and made its recommendation to the president based on the
completion of five of 21 scheduled tests. Kenneth Bacon, the
Pentagon spokesman, admitted that this was ``an extremely demanding
program on a rigorous schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And only time will tell whether we're able to surmount the
technological challenges fast enough to meet the schedule that's
been laid out,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, the president also will take into
account the threat from from countries like North Korea, the effect
the system will have on arms control, and the cost of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Pentagon officials said they were worried that
too much money would be poured into missile defense, to the
detriment of more traditional programs, undermining the ability of
the armed forces to fight in more traditional actions like the one
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost will just grow,'' said of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four decades the Pentagon has spent nearly $100
billion on missile defense systems with very few successes.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate threat of a missile attack from North Korea or
eventually from Iran or Iraq is cited as the main reason the
Clinton administration has given itself such a demanding deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the system's first group of 100 interceptors will
probably be deployed in Alaska, where it is far easier to protect
against missiles from northern Asia or the Middle East. The whole
system would include radar in Alaska, Massachusetts, California,
Greenland and Britain for tracking missiles, as well as a command
center in Colorado Springs.

U.S. INDICTS ALGERIAN HELD BY CANADA IN BOMB PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wash.)   (Eds.: Story grows with new details throughout , and removes
earlier references to GIA group; story is also now on Page 1 of New
York Times)  
 (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Algerian man arrested in Canada last week was a
central figure in a group of Algerian terrorists suspected of
planning a bomb attack in the United States, federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed Tuesday night in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan linked the suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, to another Algerian
accused of smuggling bomb parts into the United States near Seattle
and to a Brooklyn man identified as an accomplice of the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment traces the plot back to 1997, almost two
years earlier than the authorities had said up to this point.
Haouari was also charged with providing false identification
documents to members of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explicit link to others already charged in the plot,
prosecutors said Haouari ordered the Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to travel to Seattle in December to meet Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot, the authorities have said, was interrupted by
Ressam's arrest as he crossed the Canadian border near Seattle,
trying to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is suspected of belonging to a gangster-terrorist
group with a base in Montreal, anti-terrorism investigators have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested in Montreal on Jan. 10 by Canadian
authorities, a law enforcement official said Tuesday night, but the
arrest was not publicly announced. He was held in Montreal under a
warrant seeking his extradition to the United States, where he will
face charges in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Haouari is one of a handful of people they are
most interested in as they try to untangle a plot whose tentacles
have reached from Canada into New York, Boston, Vermont and
Seattle. Despite the latest indictments, however, the outlines of
the alleged plot remain sketchy, and the authorities have not
identified a specific bombing target of the plotters.
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear Tuesday night whether more arrests were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major questions for investigators has been who
ordered the plot, which the authorities believe was being carried
out by Algerian Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment does not say whether Haouari was a member of
any militant Islamic group in Algeria or elsewhere, other than to
describe him as being associated with ``members and associates of a
terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does place him at the center of activities on two coasts,
which now appear even more coordinated, in what the authorities
believe was an effort to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United
States, perhaps in connection with millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini was also charged in last night's indictment. His arrest
as an accomplice of Ressam's was first announced in New York in
late December. At the time, the authorities said Meskini, 31, had
traveled to Seattle in mid-December to meet Ressam as he crossed
into the United States with his bomb-making materials. The
government had also accused Meskini of having knowledge of ``a
terrorist network of Algerian nationals,'' which included Ressam,
and that the two had planned to go to Chicago to raise money for
the group. Until Tuesday night, Meskini had been known as Abdel
Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new details in Tuesday night's indictment were charges
that Haouari had directed Meskini's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment said that last November, Meskini made phone
calls from New York to Haouari's business and cellular phones in
Montreal. In December, it said, Haouari requested that Meskini make
his trip to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, Haouari advised Meskini to discard his
pager and to change his telephone numbers in the wake of Ressam's
arrest, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian immigration documents, Haouari arrived in
Canada in August 1993 and sought refugee status, claiming that his
life was in danger from Islamic militants as well as Algeria's
military government.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian authorities turned down his request for political
asylum a year later, saying his account of his background and
persecution was not plausible.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Algerian man arrested in Canada last week was a
central figure in a group of Algerian terrorists suspected of
planning a bomb attack in the United States, federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed Tuesday night in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan linked the suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, to another Algerian
accused of smuggling bomb parts into the United States near Seattle
and to a Brooklyn man identified as an accomplice of the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment traces the plot back to 1997, almost two
years earlier than the authorities had said up to this point.
Haouari was also charged with providing false identification
documents to members of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explicit link to others already charged in the plot,
prosecutors said Haouari ordered the Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to travel to Seattle in December to meet Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot, the authorities have said, was interrupted by
Ressam's arrest as he crossed the Canadian border near Seattle,
trying to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is suspected of belonging to a gangster-terrorist
group with a base in Montreal, anti-terrorism investigators have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested in Montreal on Jan. 10 by Canadian
authorities, a law enforcement official said Tuesday night, but the
arrest was not publicly announced. He was held in Montreal under a
warrant seeking his extradition to the United States, where he will
face charges in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Haouari is one of a handful of people they are
most interested in as they try to untangle a plot whose tentacles
have reached from Canada into New York, Boston, Vermont and
Seattle. Despite the latest indictments, however, the outlines of
the alleged plot remain sketchy, and the authorities have not
identified a specific bombing target of the plotters.
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear Tuesday night whether more arrests were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major questions for investigators has been who
ordered the plot, which the authorities believe was being carried
out by Algerian Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment does not say whether Haouari was a member of
any militant Islamic group in Algeria or elsewhere, other than to
describe him as being associated with ``members and associates of a
terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does place him at the center of activities on two coasts,
which now appear even more coordinated, in what the authorities
believe was an effort to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United
States, perhaps in connection with millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini was also charged in last night's indictment. His arrest
as an accomplice of Ressam's was first announced in New York in
late December. At the time, the authorities said Meskini, 31, had
traveled to Seattle in mid-December to meet Ressam as he crossed
into the United States with his bomb-making materials. The
government had also accused Meskini of having knowledge of ``a
terrorist network of Algerian nationals,'' which included Ressam,
and that the two had planned to go to Chicago to raise money for
the group. Until Tuesday night, Meskini had been known as Abdel
Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new details in Tuesday night's indictment were charges
that Haouari had directed Meskini's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment said that last November, Meskini made phone
calls from New York to Haouari's business and cellular phones in
Montreal. In December, it said, Haouari requested that Meskini make
his trip to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, Haouari advised Meskini to discard his
pager and to change his telephone numbers in the wake of Ressam's
arrest, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian immigration documents, Haouari arrived in
Canada in August 1993 and sought refugee status, claiming that his
life was in danger from Islamic militants as well as Algeria's
military government.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian authorities turned down his request for political
asylum a year later, saying his account of his background and
persecution was not plausible.

SHERMAN DEAL SIGN OF STRANGE TIMES IN NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ St. Louis and Tampa Bay. Tennessee and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   What is this? ``Hee Haw'' in helmets?
</P>
<P>
   Never has the NFL offered up a more improbable final four. The
pedigree of these teams can be traced all the way back to an August
flea market at the drive-in theater.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, new teams and faces are always good in a country where
the average attention span is tidier than Mayor Paul Schell's
college linebacking career.
</P>
<P>
   And compared to what's going on among NFL coaches, the season on
the field has been stately and traditional.
</P>
<P>
   The latest improbability is the appointment of Mike Sherman, I
believe it was, to coach the Green Bay Packers, the NFL's most
history-rich franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The startling part was that this Sherman fellow (no relation,
apparently, to Mr. Peabody) was actually a coach with the Seattle
Seahawks, although the final test results are not back from the FBI
lab.
</P>
<P>
   According to a handful of reliable witnesses, local newspapers'
Seahawks beat writers, Sherman allegedly coordinated the Seahawks'
offense last season. They may be the only non-football personnel to
have had contact with the departed.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with identification stems from the fact that head
coach Mike Holmgren calls the plays and assumes most of the duties
of offensive coordinator, much as he assumes the responsibilities
of most everyone at the Seahawks headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The job under Holmgren is tantamount to being a beret on Dolly
Parton. Who would notice?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Ron Wolf did. The Packers' general manager could not
have stunned the NFL more with this move had he anointed Regis
Philbin. Apparently Wolf was swayed by the fact that the offense he
was purportedly in charge of scored one touchdown in its final 10
quarters of play.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction was easy to understand. Anyone watching the
Seahawks the last half of the season had to say, ``Man, who's in
charge of THAT?!''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's possible that someone of Sherman's stumpy
resume _ the man's been in the NFL three years, and hasn't been a
head coach beyond high school _ is the beginning of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Who would want to be a head coach in the NFL
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously not Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Two of the game's
most esteemed coaching figures gave up the sidelines because they'd
had a bellyful. It's not a coincidence that both eagerly sought and
were granted the dual roles of coach/GM.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same gig given Holmgren, who last week at his wrap-up
media briefing sounded as if he were re-thinking how may trailers
he wanted to tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do I want to get into the personnel side of it,
perhaps? The business side?'' he said. ``Those are things I'm going
to have to think about and decide on.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty isn't specific to the overly ambitious. Fired
this year were single-job employees Mike Ditka, Ray Rhodes, Chan
Gailey and Pete Carroll, a year after an infamous Black Monday
purge in the NFL that claimed five coaches in one day, including
the Seahawks' Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers fired Rhodes after a single season, finishing with
the dreaded double snowman (8-8), the same record as Erickson.
Gailey did Rhodes one better, finishing 9-7 and making the playoffs
with the Cowboys. But hey, he had two years at the helm. What more
does he want?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the bizarre story in New York, where Parcells
publicly handed off his Jets job to an assistant, Bill Belichick,
only to be given a handwritten note from Belichick that said, ``No
thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently detecting a leper colony instead of a football team,
Belichick bolted so fast they still haven't scrubbed off the skid
marks from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to coach the New England Patriots, but that was
yesterday. Today Belichick may want to sell elephants door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to win quickly in the NFL was always severe. But
the annual weirdness seems to have kicked into warp drive.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say if there's anything more than coincidence at work
here. But if something has changed, the first place to look would
be franchise sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets recently were sold for $625 million, not long after the
Redskins were purchased for $800 million, including stadium.
Remember the good old days, when Paul Allen could buy a team for
$200 million, back when $200 million meant something?
</P>
<P>
   While most of the coaching tumult wasn't directly connected to
franchise sales, the fact that the Rams and Indianapolis Colts were
one-season resurrections, following the example of the Atlanta
Falcons a year ago, suggests to every owner that quick fixes are
not only possible, they are downright trendy.
</P>
<P>
   After the modern new owner has laid down a half a bill for a
sports franchise, he is not prone to listening to three- and
five-year plans.
</P>
<P>
   When a 20-second wait for an Internet hookup is now deemed an
eternity, imagine the dismay when it is learned sports-team
gratification might be a whole (begin italic) year (end italic)
away.
</P>
<P>
   Today's NFL coaches would be wise to consider the dangers in a
1-3 exhibition-season record.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ON a bright, beautiful day in downtown Houston, several of this
city's movers and shakers gathered together to stand around and
watch the grass grow.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they didn't even get that far. They gathered together
to watch where the grass eventually will grow.
</P>
<P>
   They gazed lovingly at a clump of dirt. They watched in awe as
the roof came open at Enron Field and sunshine flooded in. And
frankly, my dear, it was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   What the day's proceedings lacked in made-for-television action,
they more than made up for in significance. You could see the
future from here.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make you want to reach down, scoop up a handful
of the compost-like soil covering the floor of Enron Field and
shout to the heavens like Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind:
``As God is my witness, I shall never watch indoor baseball
again!''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, you'll never go hungry at the ballpark again,
either _ not with Ruggles sitting out there behind the left-center
wall and so many other restaurants and upscale concession stands
circling the field. Talk about lending a double meaning to ``The
Gashouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to what Tuesday was all about: imaginations
wandering.
</P>
<P>
   As Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and the leading architects,
engineers and construction executives for Enron Field played host
to this unveiling of sorts, right on cue the Gashouse roof opened
wide and said, ``Ahh.'' Not to mention, ``Oooh.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest test of the retractable roof was staged for the
media, and it not only went off without a hitch but teased the
cameras into images of what the 2000 Astros season could be.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you might think about the team and the direction
in which it is headed after recent roster moves, it's going to be a
gas watching baseball in this place. If you miss the Astrodome now,
you won't for long.
</P>
<P>
   All but roughly 20 percent of the chairback seats already are in
place at Enron, and everyone at Tuesday's ceremony boasted of how
the stadium will be completed in time for the March 30 exhibition
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium also will come in about $2 million under its $250
million budget, which might cause the cynic in all of us to wonder
why that money couldn't have been set aside for Mike Hampton or
Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. Seating at the stadium will be quaint and close.
Sightlines figure to be as good as or better than anywhere else in
baseball. The clubhouses are large and luxurious, and the
atmosphere likely will be the best of any stadium in the state.
</P>
<P>
   McLane has for months talked proudly of the feel Enron Field
will give local sports fans. Finally on Tuesday, you could reach
out and touch exactly what it was he has been talking about. Soil.
Sun. Coziness.
</P>
<P>
   You could imagine seeing McLane's field of dreams carpeted with
real grass, trimmed to perfection and glistening in the glow of
nearby skyscrapers. You could imagine sitting under the sunlight or
the stars as Jeff Bagwell or Craig Biggio steps up to the plate
with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we can lament the clear drop-off there will be in the
Astros product, and it stands to reason that by August we'll be
doing just that. This will not be as good a team as in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   And to see the short 315-foot porch in left field is to wonder
about some horrific possibilities for a weaker Astros pitching
staff, especially when Jose Lima takes the mound challenging
hitters and declaring, ``I don't mind giving up home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gashouse he just might. The ball will fly out of the
place. Oh, how the Astros will miss Hampton, a ground-ball pitcher
who could have thrived on a grass field such as this one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, left field appears to be Bagwell-friendly, to
the tune of what could be about 50 homers, some of them most
certainly plopping onto Crawford Avenue whenever the roof is open.
Bagwell also was at the Gashouse on Tuesday, offering tips
regarding the hitting background and batters' sightlines and giving
his stamp of approval for the hitting-friendly yard.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the Astros do not figure to be nearly as good a
pitching team as they were a year ago, such righthanded power as
Bagwell's, Biggio's, Ken Caminiti's, Moises Alou's and Richard
Hidalgo's might have the scoreboard spinning at a dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the roof is open and it's warm, you would think the ball
will carry better,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
``But until we get in here and start playing, we're just going to
have to wait and see how it plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it won't be the best Astros team we've ever seen, it'll
be a gas.

OWNER JONES DUMPED FIRING IN AIKMAN'S LAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While he babbled and blathered, trying to explain why an 8-9
coach had to be fired, owner Jerry Jones didn't do his quarterback
any favors last week.
</P>
<P>
   No. As the Chan Gailey Offensive Extravaganza pulled out of
Valley Ranch for the final time, Owner Jones stepped right up and
tossed Troy Aikman under the symbolic departing bus.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the owner had solicited a season review from Aikman and
asked him where the struggling offense stood. And, yes, as Aikman
acknowledged Tuesday, he responded to the questions that Jones had
asked him.
</P>
<P>
   But let's spike this rumor now, before it sprouts yet another
pair of legs. Jones never asked Aikman whether Gailey should be
fired, nor did Aikman offer any such suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman didn't fire Chan Gailey. Gailey's miserable 18-16
record over two seasons did.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the demanding public, that record was damning
enough. From the defeat at New Orleans on Christmas Eve until his
exit last week, Gailey's support among the populace had dwindled to
vapors. No one seemed to want him back. No one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with his rambling soliloquy at the news conference, Owner
Jones accomplished the seemingly impossible: He made an instant
national martyr out of Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN funny men-anchors snickered. Oh, that Jerry. Two
playoff seasons, and Chan is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers remarked how classy it was for Gailey to meet the
press for 30 minutes and answer questions in the wake of his
firing. It was, but it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Never to be confused with a Jay Leno, Gailey's terse answers
were devoid of (A) acknowledging blame for the team's two-year
performance, and (B) admitting that he probably could have saved
his job had he been willing to change.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' Christmas Eve notion, you may recall, was that the
solution might come in ``not changing the coach, but changing the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man wouldn't change. Gailey's smug answer on firing day
was that there was no reason to change his offensive system because
it was the same one that had ``been to four Super Bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? With the Denver Broncos, Gailey's first two Super Bowl
trips came as the special-teams and tight-ends coach. He took over
the quarterbacks in 1988 and was elevated to offensive coordinator
for the next two seasons. The tenure did include another trip to
Super Bowl XXIV, but Denver's record over those three years is
worth noting _ 24-24.
</P>
<P>
   Look familiar?
</P>
<P>
   On the Pittsburgh team that faced the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX,
by the way, Gailey was not the coordinator. He coached the pass
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, as well as Emmitt Smith and other veterans, have taken
heat for not embracing the Gailey offensive system. They have been
chided for wanting an offense like the good old days _ 1992, 1993
and 1995, to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Can you blame them? If anyone should have adapted, it was
Gailey, not his so-called ``disloyal'' veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Aikman will tell you that he is not a complicated
man. There are no angry agendas swirling beneath that stony
surface. He only wants to win. Aikman probably hears that Cowboys'
``window of opportunity'' slamming ever shut better than anybody.
</P>
<P>
   He is now four years older than he was the last time that this
franchise reached an NFC Championship Game. So are Smith, Michael
Irvin, Darren Woodson and Leon Lett. Four years can be a lifetime
for many NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is no coach killer. If he was, he would have gleefully
signed the departure papers of Barry Switzer, a mistake of a coach
that cost Aikman, Emmitt, et al, an additional four years.
</P>
<P>
   But check the newsprint. You won't find any old clippings of
Aikman slamming Switzer. He didn't have to. Switzer saw his own way
to the door.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Aikman as the team loner, arrogant and
back-stabbing, is a myth propagated by team troublemakers. The
Cowboys don't need them, as Owner Jones may well realize once he
picks his new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, Aikman even presented himself in court
during the high-profile trial of his teammate _ and good friend _
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman says it's ``unsettling'' to hear that some people think
he's at the root of the Cowboys' coaching turmoil. But let me
suggest that that perception has been fueled by an owner who should
have just kept his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   All Owner Jones had to say was, ``Chan was 8-9, and I've spent
too much money to accept that,'' and Cowboys fans across the planet
would have nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he babbled and dropped Gailey's firing into the lap of
his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But let's spike that rumor. Aikman didn't say anything about
firing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to. nn

   BEYOND-N.H. (Seattle) _ On a drizzly night late this week, more
than a dozen volunteers for Al Gore gathered at their headquarters
at the Seattle Labor Temple for a routine they have followed for
weeks: telephoning faithful Democrats to encourage them to vote for
the vice president in the Washington state caucus on March 7. By
contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted only a week to
making telephone calls to identify its supporters. His fledgling
operation does not even have an office. The differences in the Gore
and Bradley operations here underscore the degree to which the
candidates are prepared to march to the nomination should they
triumph in the first showdowns in Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New
Hampshire a week later. By Richard L. Berke.

DODGERS SIGN GRUDZIELANEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So confident are the Los Angeles Dodgers that Mark
Grudzielanek won't have trouble making the switch from shortstop to
second base, the sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a
four-year, $18 million deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also doled out $6.8 million in one-year contracts to
sign a quintet of players, including right-hander Chan Ho Park, and
the spending might not be finished.
</P>
<P>
   The club recently began talks with Eric Karros on a long-term
deal that could allow the first baseman to finish his career with
the Dodgers, team and industry sources said. Those sources said
signing Karros to a multiyear deal is the next priority.
</P>
<P>
   He's slated to make $5.5 million in 2000, the final year of his
contract. Karros is believed to be seeking five years, including a
no-trade through the 2001 season. After that, Karros would have
veto power of any trade. It's believed the contract could be worth
$35 to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Karros is coming off his best statistical season. He established
career highs in average (.304), doubles (40) and RBI (112) and tied
a career best with 34 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek set a Dodgers record for shortstops by hitting .326
in 1999. It was the highest average for a National League shortstop
in 63 years. The contract should also ease Grudzielanek's mind in
making the position switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to all our scouts and (manager) Davey (Johnson)
believes in it,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We
met with him and made sure he wanted to with a Dodger, and he did.
He wanted to be here. He's got passion, he's got fire. He's a
competitor. He's a team player and wants to win. That's his goal.
He wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who made $1.9 million last season, will be paid $3
million this season, $4 million in 2001, $5 million in 2002 and
$5.5 in 2003. The Dodgers hold a $6 million option for the 2004
season with a $500,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   But before the sides agreed to the deal, Grudzielanek, 29, met
with Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first four years (in the major leagues), it wasn't a good
relationship with ownership and the front office,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``I met Mr. Daly and I know how thorough he is and he's done
his homework on learning what type of person I am. I can't tell you
enough how happy I am to be a part of this. It think this is really
heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The plethora of contracts means the Dodgers' payroll for their
projected 25-man opening day roster is $85.4 million. As has been
the case for the Dodgers, avoiding salary arbitration is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   They did so by signing Park to a $3.85 million deal. Park could
earn another $400,000 from incentives for starts and innings
pitched. Park, who made $2.3 million last season, went 13-11 with a
5.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever Terry Adams averted the process by signing
a one-year deal worth $1.4 million. Adams made $736,000 while going
6-3 with a 4.02 ERA and 13 saves with the Chicago Cubs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Kevin Orie escaped arbitration by inking a
one-year, $600,000 contract with another $175,000 in incentives
possible. Pitcher Dan Naulty signed a one-year deal worth $475,000
and the club will sign catcher Chad Kreuter today to a minor-league
deal for $450,000 with another $250,000 possible in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter, 35, hit .225 for Kansas City last season. He will
battle with Paul LoDuca and Angel Pena to back up Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Also, right fielder Trenidad Hubbard cleared waivers and was
granted free agency. Hubbard hit .314 in 82 games for the Dodgers
last season.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Steve Francis hoofed his way to midcourt with steps that will
probably have Cuttino Mobley taunting him for weeks. But as he
swayed to his own beat, a spectacular driving shot over Portland's
Rasheed Wallace having just fallen, he could have danced all night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis later laughed at his only awkward moment Tuesday. But he
also seemed to know he and the Rockets had reached another level
that once seemed out of their reach in this most trying of seasons.
And with that climb, there was reason to believe there will be more
chances to work on his dance steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets ran their winning streak to four by defeating the
Portland Trail Blazers 90-89 at Compaq Center. It was by far their
best win of the season and just their third against a team with a
winning record.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who had been off since a loss Saturday, came in
with the league's second-best record and wins in eight of their
previous nine games. The Rockets were playing their third game in
four nights in three cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our most important win of the year,'' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We had beat the Lakers, and we had most of
our guys and they didn't have Shaq (O'Neal or Kobe Bryant). This
(Portland) team is definitely a contender. We're on a back-to-back.
The guys responded really well. And our rookies were phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond phenomenal, Francis and Kenny Thomas seemed to
inspire their teammates with more than production.
</P>
<P>
   And continuing to work his way back, Hakeem Olajuwon dusted off
the old stop, fake and spin move that became the signature of his
1995 playoff demolition of the Spurs' David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a flashback,'' Olajuwon said. ``Brian Grant told me,
`I thought you retired that move.'''
</P>
<P>
   And with that reminder of how a superstar's finest moments can
lift a team, Francis seemed to have the packed house ready to rumba
with him and similarly elevated his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things, they're worth more than two points for the
emotional level they give you,'' Tomjanovich said of the move that
made Francis feel like dancing. ``Then the buzz in the crowd gives
you more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   A night after Francis and Thomas both had the most prolific
scoring games of their rookie season, they in many respects
surpassed themselves. Thomas had 22 points and 14 rebounds, both
personal bests. Francis had 26 points and matched his early-career
best with 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Rockets rookies scored 32 of the team's 47
second-half points and 13 of 17 in the fourth quarter when Francis
went against Trail Blazers defensive ace Greg Anthony and Thomas
took on Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good confidence-booster,'' Francis said. ``With the
way we've been struggling, with all the injuries, for us to come
out and be able to execute down the stretch was great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Francis seemed to sense what could happen long before the
Rockets took the win. When he completed his drive on Wallace, the
16,285 in Compaq Center seemed as sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rasheed and I were talking all game,'' Francis said. ``I was
glad I got the `and one' on him. That wasn't a dance. That was kind
of a locomotive or something to get warmed up. I'm not a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did get warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   With the Trail Blazers leading by four and the Rockets having
committed three consecutive turnovers, Francis passed to Thomas,
who completed a nifty drive with his left hand. Francis then scored
the game's next six points, putting the Rockets ahead 88-84 with a
stunning drive into a reverse that he followed with a step-back
17-footer.
</P>
<P>
   When Portland guard Steve Smith missed a jumper, the Blazers'
10th consecutive miss, Anthony Miller grabbed the rebound, was
fouled and made two free throws for a six-point lead with 1:23
left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets could not quite slam the door, or even get off
another good shot.
</P>
<P>
   With 10.8 seconds left and the Rockets clinging to a one-point
lead, the Blazers went for the win. Scottie Pippen took off for the
basket. With Thomas challenging him at the rim, Pippen missed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, in his second game back in Houston since leaving the
Rockets, had 12 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. But he
made just five of 15 shots and had six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a rookie and everything, I thought Pippen was going to
get that call,'' Thomas said. ``I just got my hands up and tried to
move out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had one last chance to pull out the win, inbounding
under the Rockets' basket with 5.7 seconds left. But the Rockets
cut off Smith and the pass planned for Wallace. Anthony's forced
jumper rattled around and out, setting off a Rockets celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty helter-skelter,'' Anthony said. ``The play was
supposed to go into Steve Smith, and he would get it to Rasheed. I
was the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar endings, of course, had happened many times to the
Rockets. Having finally strutted on the other side, plans were made
to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Francis said. ``It's my first time in the NBA
winning four games in a row. It builds a lot of confidence. And the
younger guys know even though we were losing early, even though we
had a lot of injuries, we could still come back and beat good
teams.''

U.S. INDICTS ALGERIAN HELD BY CANADA IN BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs byline; subs for rewriting, new material throughout)  (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER with CRAIG PYES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Algerian man arrested in Canada last week was a
central figure in a group of Algerian terrorists suspected of
planning a bomb attack in the United States, federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan
linked the suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, to another Algerian accused of
smuggling bomb parts into the United States near Seattle and to a
Brooklyn man identified as an accomplice of the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment traces the conspirators' acts back to 1997,
almost two years earlier than the authorities had said up to this
point. Haouari was also charged with providing false identification
documents to members of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explicit link to others already charged in the plot,
prosecutors said Haouari ordered the Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to travel to Seattle last month to meet Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot, the authorities have said, was interrupted by
Ressam's arrest as he crossed the Canadian border near Seattle,
trying to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is suspected of belonging to a gangster-terrorist
group that lived for a time in Montreal, antiterrorism
investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested in Montreal on Jan. 10 by Canadian
authorities, a law enforcement official said on Tuesday night, but
the arrest was not publicly announced. The charges were kept under
seal, and federal officials in New York and Washington refused
earlier in the day to respond to any questions about whether
Haouari had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari was held in Montreal under a warrant seeking his
extradition to the United States, where he will face charges in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Haouari is one of a handful of people they are
most interested in as they try to untangle a plot whose tentacles
have reached from Canada into New York, Boston, Vermont and
Seattle. Despite the latest indictments, however, the outlines of
the alleged plot remain sketchy, and the authorities have not
identified a specific bombing target. It was also not clear on
Tuesday night whether more arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major questions for investigators has been who
ordered the plot, which the authorities believe was being carried
out by Algerian Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment does not say whether Haouari was a member of
any militant Islamic group in Algeria or elsewhere, other than to
describe him as being associated with ``members and associates of a
terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does place him at the center of activities on two coasts,
which now appear even more coordinated, in what the authorities
theorize was an effort to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United
States, perhaps in connection with millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, was also charged in
Tuesday night's indictment. The arrest of Meskini _ who was earlier
identified by the authorities in court papers as Abdel Ghani _ was
first announced in New York late last month. At the time, the
authorities said Meskini, 31, had traveled to Seattle in
mid-December to meet Ressam as he crossed into the United States
with his bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   The government had also accused Meskini of having knowledge of
``a terrorist network of Algerian nationals,'' which included
Ressam, and said that the two had planned to go to Chicago to raise
money for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new details in Tuesday night's indictment were charges
Haouari had directed Meskini's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment said that last November, Meskini made phone
calls from New York to Haouari's business and cellular phones in
Montreal. In December, it said, Haouari requested that Meskini make
his trip to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, Haouari advised Meskini to discard his
pager and to change his telephone numbers in the wake of Ressam's
arrest, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari and Meskini were each charged with providing ``material
support and resources'' to terrorists, and concealing those
efforts, and conspiracy and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was released after the close of the business
Tuesday without any explanation or further comment by government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While little is known about Haouari, his immigration files in
Canada reflect a determined campaign by him to win refugee status
in Canada. According to those documents, Haouari arrived in Canada
from Algeria in August 1993 and sought refugee status, claiming
that his life was in danger from Islamic militants as well as
Algeria's military government.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian authorities turned down his request for political
asylum a year later, saying his account of his background and
persecution was not plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The petition for refugee status rested on a single incident,
which had occurred in 1992. Haouari, who described himself as a
seaman from Arzew, a small port in the western part of Algeria,
said he was approached by friends who were active in the Islamic
Salvation Front, known as the FIS, the secular government's major
opponent, who asked him to help smuggle arms into the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the immigration papers, Haouari described himself as a former
member of the FIS and acknowledged that he had organized meetings
in various mosques, distributed political literature and helped to
prepare for the first round of legislative elections in December
1991, which the FIS won. A coup d'etat by the army in January 1992,
however, denied the FIS an almost certain victory in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari said he quit the party the following April, claiming the
FIS had used violence to achieve its ends, which he said was
against ``my principles and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the immigration documents, Haouari said that in May
1993, he was asked by a FIS leader to unload weapons from a ship on
which he worked.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari told Canadian authorities in the asylum petition that he
feared reprisals from the FIS if he refused. In June 1993, he
sailed to Marseilles, France on a friend's boat, where he spent two
months illegally. Then he claims to have obtained a false French
passport in the name of Abderahaman Boumazrek.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari says he then drove to Switzerland, and eventually flew
to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After his asylum claim was rejected, Haouari filed a series of
appeals, whose disposition could not be determined on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Haouari bring to at least seven the number
of people arrested in the investigation into the bombing plot.
Besides Haouari, Meskini and Ressam, the authorities have charged a
Canadian woman and an Algerian man who were arrested last month
trying to cross the border from Canada into Vermont, as well as
another man in Seattle and a Brooklyn man who is being held as a
material witness.

planning a bomb attack in the United States, federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan
linked the suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, to another Algerian accused of
smuggling bomb parts into the United States near Seattle and to a
Brooklyn man identified as an accomplice of the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment traces the conspirators' acts back to 1997,
almost two years earlier than the authorities had said up to this
point. Haouari was also charged with providing false identification
documents to members of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explicit link to others already charged in the plot,
prosecutors said Haouari ordered the Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to travel to Seattle last month to meet Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot, the authorities have said, was interrupted by
Ressam's arrest as he crossed the Canadian border near Seattle,
trying to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is suspected of belonging to a gangster-terrorist
group that lived for a time in Montreal, antiterrorism
investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested in Montreal on Jan. 10 by Canadian
authorities, a law enforcement official said on Tuesday night, but
the arrest was not publicly announced. The charges were kept under
seal, and federal officials in New York and Washington refused
earlier in the day to respond to any questions about whether
Haouari had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari was held in Montreal under a warrant seeking his
extradition to the United States, where he will face charges in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Haouari is one of a handful of people they are
most interested in as they try to untangle a plot whose tentacles
have reached from Canada into New York, Boston, Vermont and
Seattle. Despite the latest indictments, however, the outlines of
the alleged plot remain sketchy, and the authorities have not
identified a specific bombing target. It was also not clear on
Tuesday night whether more arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major questions for investigators has been who
ordered the plot, which the authorities believe was being carried
out by Algerian Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment does not say whether Haouari was a member of
any militant Islamic group in Algeria or elsewhere, other than to
describe him as being associated with ``members and associates of a
terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does place him at the center of activities on two coasts,
which now appear even more coordinated, in what the authorities
theorize was an effort to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United
States, perhaps in connection with millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, was also charged in
Tuesday night's indictment. The arrest of Meskini _ who was earlier
identified by the authorities in court papers as Abdel Ghani _ was
first announced in New York late last month. At the time, the
authorities said Meskini, 31, had traveled to Seattle in
mid-December to meet Ressam as he crossed into the United States
with his bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   The government had also accused Meskini of having knowledge of
``a terrorist network of Algerian nationals,'' which included
Ressam, and said that the two had planned to go to Chicago to raise
money for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new details in Tuesday night's indictment were charges
Haouari had directed Meskini's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment said that last November, Meskini made phone
calls from New York to Haouari's business and cellular phones in
Montreal. In December, it said, Haouari requested that Meskini make
his trip to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, Haouari advised Meskini to discard his
pager and to change his telephone numbers in the wake of Ressam's
arrest, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari and Meskini were each charged with providing ``material
support and resources'' to terrorists, and concealing those
efforts, and conspiracy and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was released after the close of the business
Tuesday without any explanation or further comment by government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While little is known about Haouari, his immigration files in
Canada reflect a determined campaign by him to win refugee status
in Canada. According to those documents, Haouari arrived in Canada
from Algeria in August 1993 and sought refugee status, claiming
that his life was in danger from Islamic militants as well as
Algeria's military government.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian authorities turned down his request for political
asylum a year later, saying his account of his background and
persecution was not plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The petition for refugee status rested on a single incident,
which had occurred in 1992. Haouari, who described himself as a
seaman from Arzew, a small port in the western part of Algeria,
said he was approached by friends who were active in the Islamic
Salvation Front, known as the FIS, the secular government's major
opponent, who asked him to help smuggle arms into the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the immigration papers, Haouari described himself as a former
member of the FIS and acknowledged that he had organized meetings
in various mosques, distributed political literature and helped to
prepare for the first round of legislative elections in December
1991, which the FIS won. A coup d'etat by the army in January 1992,
however, denied the FIS an almost certain victory in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari said he quit the party the following April, claiming the
FIS had used violence to achieve its ends, which he said was
against ``my principles and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the immigration documents, Haouari said that in May
1993, he was asked by a FIS leader to unload weapons from a ship on
which he worked.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari told Canadian authorities in the asylum petition that he
feared reprisals from the FIS if he refused. In June 1993, he
sailed to Marseilles, France on a friend's boat, where he spent two
months illegally. Then he claims to have obtained a false French
passport in the name of Abderahaman Boumazrek.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari says he then drove to Switzerland, and eventually flew
to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After his asylum claim was rejected, Haouari filed a series of
appeals, whose disposition could not be determined on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Haouari bring to at least seven the number
of people arrested in the investigation into the bombing plot.
Besides Haouari, Meskini and Ressam, the authorities have charged a
Canadian woman and an Algerian man who were arrested last month
trying to cross the border from Canada into Vermont, as well as
another man in Seattle and a Brooklyn man who is being held as a
material witness.

ZIGGY IS A STAR AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a night he was Ziggy Stardust again, dazzling
the crowd, his teammates and especially the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six weeks since Ziggy Palffy last played that way,
scoring two goals and flooding the ice with spectacular passes
Tuesday night in the Los Angeles Kings' 5-3 victory in front of
14,458 at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be premature to declare Palffy healed from the sore
lower back that often has made playing unbearable, just it might be
too soon to say the Kings troubles are over.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy led the Kings to an impressive victory over a Stanley Cup
finalist after the team went 2-10-1 in the previous 13 games. But
he also was clutching his back and slow getting to his feet after
getting flattened late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem significant at the time. Not after Palffy opened
the scoring with a breakaway goal in the first five minutes of the
game and added a second goal off a 360-spin move that was a
chiropractor's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy also assisted on the second of two goals by Luc
Robitaille. For Robitaille, it marked the 12th time in his 13
seasons that he has reached 20 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also got a goal from Brad Chartrand on a reconfigured
third line that made three goals against a team that shutout the
Mighty Ducks 5-0 on Monday night. The goal also chased Sabres
goaltender Martin Biron in favor of Dwayne Roloson. Biron barely
broke a sweat against the Ducks, but the second night was
different.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does when visiting teams play the night before in
Anaheim, Kings coach Andy Murray attended the game and came away
impressed. Buffalo has stumbled after reaching the Stanley Cup
finals last June, but Murray said stopping the Sabres' team speed
would be critical to a victory. So he matched Craig Johnson, the
Kings' fastest skater, on a line with Palffy and Bryan Smolinski,
the team's leading scorer who assisted on the first two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy has confounded the Kings coaching staff because his
condition has not improved since he woke up Dec. 4 with back
spasms. Trainer Pete Demers said Monday that strengthening the body
parts around Palffy's back was critical but that it could be
difficult to make him 100 percent during the season.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six weeks, he has had one goal and one
empty-netter. He has missed four games, one more than he did in his
first four seasons with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The flair that helped Palffy score 40 goals three times and led
to last summer's trade has been missing. Less than five minutes
into Tuesday's game it was back.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a pass from Smolinski around center ice, Palffy
broke in on Biron, who faced only 17 shots while shutting out the
Ducks. Often the back has not allowed Palffy to convert such plays,
but he made this one look easy, firing the puck over Biron's right
pad for his first goal since Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille was next, scoring in classic fashion by batting a
Smolinski shot out of the air and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led 3-1 when Robitaille got his second, on the power
play. This time he got the puck from Palffy in front and scored his
20th.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven seconds later, Robitaille gave the Kings a
three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the 1997-98 season, when he had just 16 goals,
Robitaille has reached 20 every season. It's not like the old days
when he had eight consecutive years over 40, including 63 in
1992-93.

NO REASON TO PANIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time this season, the Los Angeles
Lakers actually have a discernable losing trend, if not a losing
streak. But coach Phil Jackson was relaxed, loose and in a humorous
mood T ``I don't think the sky is falling yet,'' he said with a
smile, following a three-hour practice at Southwest College.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's loss to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Lakers have
lost two of their last three games a first this season. Jackson had
been waiting for his team to face some kind of adversity, and this
is about as much as they've endured so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said. ``I don't know how they felt about the
game. I mean, I still can't get a read on this team at times, how
they really feel about whether they're disappointed about losing a
game like that, whether there's a sense of we let something happen
to us that we shouldn't let happen to us, embarrassment at not
helping each other out in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team still has to show me some character in that regard,
that we'll see in how they come back and play against Cleveland
(tonight). That's the only indication, is what happens when you
meet the opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Memo to the NBA: It's rare for a coach to chalk up a loss to
fatigue or an adverse schedule, but Jackson is writing off Monday's
loss for exactly those reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 12:30 p.m. start required the Lakers to report to Staples
Center by 11 a.m. about 33 hours after they landed at LAX early
Sunday morning. They had just returned from a road trip that had
them play three games in four days, in two different time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we gave good effort . . . it'd be fun to run
out the hounds and scream about the effort, but these guys played
how many games, 10 games out of 14 days?
</P>
<P>
   ``They end up with a trip to the East Coast and come back and
play a noon game in a time zone that's like 9 o'clock in the
morning for them? Let's be realistic about what's going on,''
Jackson said. ``Give us the evening game that the Clippers had,
(instead of) a noon game here. It doesn't make much sense. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Being realistic and believing in the biorhythms of the body,
knowing how I felt (Monday) morning, I had some sympathy for these
guys, trying to go out there.''

AIKMAN SAYS HE DIDN'T INSTIGATE GAILEY'S FIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman cleared the air and
categorically denied Tuesday that he intentionally or knowingly was
instrumental in Chan Gailey's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the farthest thing from the truth,'' Aikman said,
adding that reports to the contrary have been ``unsettling'' for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Chan,'' Aikman said. ``I never tried to get him fired.
He's a good football coach, and I understand his desire to win. We
had a very good relationship. I don't think any less of him now
just because it didn't work here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aikman said he understands public sentiment that traces
him to the smoking gun, he said he doesn't feel a need to defend
himself, but more a need to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a false perception about my impact on this
team,'' said Aikman, referring to his input into owner Jerry Jones'
decision-making process. ``If people want to think I played a major
part in what just happened here ... well, I understand, it goes
with the territory. I don't like it, but I'm going to shoulder
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Aikman's involvement stemmed from something
Jones said during his Jan. 11 news conference when Gailey's
dismissal was announced, two days after Minnesota eliminated the
Cowboys from the playoffs. Jones said he met privately with a
number of key people in the organization before deciding to fire
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Aikman both debunk any notion that the question of
whether ``Gailey goes'' or ``Gailey stays'' was put to Aikman
before Gailey was fired 23 months into a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coaching change was not discussed,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones normally doesn't look for anyone to make a business
decision for him, and Aikman's track record is one of restraint
under far worse conditions than an underachieving offense. Aikman
rode four years of a well-documented personality clash with Barry
Switzer, without going to Jones after that first year and demanding
that Switzer be removed.
</P>
<P>
   After the 27-10 playoff loss to the Vikings, Jones apparently
asked Aikman and others to give him opinions on such matters as
what to improve and how to improve it, possibly including
suggestions on game-day preparation, strategy, play calling and
offensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm asked my opinion about something, I'll give my
opinion,'' Aikman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he had similar conversations with Gailey on numerous
occasions in the past two years. Their last conversation was Jan.
12, one day after Gailey was fired. Aikman called him to express
his concern, appreciation and well-wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman wouldn't go into detail about any differences he had with
Gailey, but insiders had speculated for months that it had more to
do with play calling than with the system, and nothing to do with
Gailey as a person or even a football man.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has been an avid supporter of the Norv Turner and Ernie
Zampese offenses that the Cowboys used while winning Super Bowls in
the 1992, '93 and '95 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I don't look at that offense as the only answer,'' Aikman
said. ``If we decide to go with that again ... great. But I'm not
set on just that.''
</P>
<P>
   To Aikman, it's time to look around the NFL and ``plagiarize''
from the most successful teams in moving the football and scoring
points. At the top of the list are the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good teams ``attack'' defenses,'' said Aikman, who watched
with interest Sunday as Kurt Warner threw five touchdown passes in
the Rams' 49-37 victory against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful teams are using multiple personnel groups,
multiple formations. ... They're being aggressive,'' Aikman said.
``I think to be effective today, you have to throw the football. If
you don't, you struggle to score. In today's game, you really need
the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman stopped short of putting the blame of falling from eighth
to 16th in total offense in the NFL entirely on a failure of
Gailey's system to fit the Cowboys' personnel. Instead, Aikman said
he feels ``a responsibility,'' as should his teammates, for the
failures that led to Gailey's firing. nn

BAKER-LED SONICS WIN SIXTH STRAIGHT, WHIPPING KEMP, CAVS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Coming off an emotional road victory over the Los
Angeles Lakers on Monday, the Sonics could have let up a bit
Tuesday night against the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   But with forward Vin Baker leading a torrid first-quarter
attack, and guards Gary Payton and Brent Barry picking up the
outside scoring in the fourth quarter, the Sonics proved they could
keep a winning streak intact largely on patient perseverance and
two solid periods to open and close the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was easily enough to preserve Seattle's sixth consecutive
victory, 99-80, with a workman-like effort before 13,326 in
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``After beating the Lakers down there, we didn't want to respond
adversely to good fortune, which we have done sometimes this year''
Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We came out great, let them back
in the game and had a wakeup call at halftime. But we responded
real well.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling offensively against the Lakers with a
season-low three points Monday, Baker popped in 14 of his game-high
28 in the first period and recorded two of his four blocked shots,
one against former Sonic Shawn Kemp, as Seattle established a 29-14
lead at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing, I feel, the best basketball in the league right
now,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Baker's early heroics, the Cavs hung around most of the
second quarter as Westphal went to his bench, giving plenty of
playing time to Rashard Lewis, subbing for Payton, and Jelani McCoy
spelling Horace Grant.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland backup guard Andre Miller driving the lane for
nine points in the quarter and forward Lamond Murray picking up 10
points down low, the Cavs began to capitalize on the Sonics' sudden
penchant for turning the ball over and lapsing on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Payton and Baker returned, the Sonics had trouble
getting back into their early rhythm, as the Seattle duo both were
forced into turnovers late in the second period. Cleveland closed
to within six, 46-40, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs even took the lead 52-51 for a few seconds in the third
quarter, but Barry swished a 3-pointer and the Sonics hit five
consecutive free throws to regain their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A key play in the quarter followed a technical foul on
Cleveland's Brevin Knight. Knight complained when Kemp was called
for his fourth foul underneath the basket on Baker, and Payton hit
the penalty free throw while Baker made both of his. On the next
series, Knight tried to take Payton to the hole but was off the
mark, and Payton took the ball back down the court and juked past
Knight for an easy layin.
</P>
<P>
   Payton then ended the quarter by putting back his own layin
attempt to give the Sonics a 72-67 lead going into the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't focused a little bit in that third quarter,
which we do kind of often,'' Payton said. ``But then we came back
with the starters and we blew them away. It was just one of those
lapses, but this team is getting better and better, and we need to
understand that we can't have lapses.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth quarter, the lapses were gone, thanks in large
part to Barry, Payton and Baker,
</P>
<P>
   Barry played a key role to open the period, hitting a jumper and
feeding Lewis with a nifty bounce pass down the lane for a dunk
that put the Sonics up by seven. After the Cavs were forced into a
24-second violation, Barry tapped in an errant Grant jumper to put
the Sonics up 80-71 with just over seven minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case people haven't noticed, that guy has been playing
fantastic basketball at both ends of the floor,'' Westphal said of
Barry, who finished with 21 points and hit three of six 3-pointers.
``All that stuff about him not being able to play defense or him
not doing this or that, you know he's proving some people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   During that crucial fourth-quarter stretch, the Sonics scored 14
unanswered points, and the Cavs went over five minutes without
scoring before Kemp finally hit a jumper with five minutes to play.
By then, Payton and Baker were back in sync, and the Sonics pushed
their advantage to 20 points to ease away with the win as the bench
took over for the final 2:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped turning the ball over and stopped giving up as many
second shots, and I thought we got us a nice win,'' Westphal said.
``I thought we really needed this win, going out on a four-game
road trip. We didn't want to leave on a downer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cleveland, Kemp was held to 13 points and hit only four of
13 field goal attempts. Murray led Cleveland with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically had a chance to stay in this ballgame until the
end, and we just gave up and lost our confidence,'' Kemp said. ``We
just basically stopped playing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the matchup between Baker and Kemp drew plenty of pregame
attention, Baker downplayed any lingering emotions from the
September 1997 trade that brought Baker from Milwaukee and sent
Kemp to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be part of a personal thing,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's focus now, he said, is on the four-game road trip,
which starts Thursday against former Sonics coach George Karl's
Bucks in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been playing well on the road, so we're not worried
about it,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   For Payton, who had 25 points and eight assists, the win Tuesday
showed the Sonics have put all the pieces together in the new year.
Since, Jan. 1, the team's lone loss has been to the Lakers in
Seattle on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think everybody is on a roll,'' Payton said. ``
... When we were winning earlier, we got real happy and people
started relaxing. Now we can't relax.''

 &HT;    Bare-alls betray all reality
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Try to picture Katharine Hepburn doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Or Audrey, speaking of magnificent Hepburns. Or Grace Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   There is Cameron Diaz on the January cover of Vanity Fair, her
derriere hanging out like the Norge repairman. In a candid, unposed
moment on the inside pages, Diaz fondles her exposed breast while
she ponders, ``I don't care if anybody sees my movies. In fact, I
prefer if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Tyra Banks on the January cover of GQ, her flowing
tresses barely covering her bare breasts. The headline taunts,
``Tyra, Please Pull Your Hair Back!'' Even more offensive is the
inside photo spread titled ``What a Gorgeous Lei'' _ Tyra in
Hawaiian garb, natch.
</P>
<P>
   To the GQ question, ``If you had to have one cosmetic surgery,
what would it be?'' Banks takes time out from the eight-page photo
spread starring her bosoms to reply: ``Breast reduction. Make
people stop talking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not porn actresses or soft-porn actresses. Diaz is
Hollywood's starlet of the moment, box office gold. Banks is a
supermodel and aspiring actress who ``bows down'' to Julia Roberts
as to a latter-day Sarah Bernhardt.
</P>
<P>
   These are not porn magazines or soft-porn magazines. Vanity
Fair, for one, has intellectual pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, I pick up the ``serious'' magazines that come
into my home _ chock full of good reading, like Esquire and Vanity
Fair _ and suspect that I have accidentally subscribed to Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   There are mainstream magazines you don't dare leave out for the
children to find. There are mainstream radio stations you can't
turn on without overhearing jokes whose punch line is bawdy.
``two-bit 'ho.''
</P>
<P>
   As women's roles in the real world have expanded, gained more
significance, our roles in movies and the media have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe me? Name the modern-day actresses with a fraction
of Katharine Hepburn's fire, or Grace Kelly's dignity. Name the top
actresses who wouldn't stoop to these soft-porn magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short list beginning with Meryl Streep, who is considered
lucky, these days, to land roles as somebody's maiden aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Colbert was once the feminine ideal; now the Perfect
Woman is Tyra Banks. No, I stand corrected: As Inside Edition
recently informed its viewers, Catherine Zeta-Jones is the Perfect
Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Inside Edition announcer gushed over the upcoming nuptials
of Michael Douglas and the Welsh actress, pooh-poohing Douglas'
reputation as a philanderer. That won't happen, the announcer
asserted, because Zeta-Jones is the ``perfect woman.'' Well, of
course, it's all clear now: Douglas' rumored infidelities were due
to the imperfections of his partners.
</P>
<P>
   The program went on to an even more insulting segment about
Linda Tripp's face lift. Tripp doesn't blame people one bit for not
having liked her in the past, she looked so ``haggish.'' She wants
you to know she is truly, truly sorry. . . . for having been deemed
unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Monica Lewinsky is contrite, very contrite, for
having been . . . overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you didn't expect either of these women to look inward ,
did you? Not when all of society conspires to make women believe
that all our imperfections _ like our best virtues _ are purely
external.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones is the Perfect Woman, after all, and all
the rest of us should just hang it up.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be fine by me, if we didn't have to behold them, in
all their naked perfection, on the cover of every magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to a newstand near you: The New Yorker's Swimsuit
Edition.

<P>
   Rather puzzling: Is it real or is it CBS?
</P>
<P>
   Networks virtually pull wool over our eyes
</P>
<P>
   real life for saturday, jan. 15
</P>
<P>
   greer read
</P>
<P>
   Once again, my emotions are all out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   I'm laughing when I really should be crying.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sitting here this morning obsessed with one thing.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think about going to the county fair or doing yardwork
or what to make for snacks during the Dolphins game.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, that last part is a lie. I can always think
about snacks. I'm thinking salsa, cheese dip and those good chips
with a ``hint of lime'' since the game's on early.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my other obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The bird.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know if the bird that spread its magnificent wings and
swept across my television screen during Friday morning's WPTV
weather report was real.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it computer wizardry?
</P>
<P>
   So I called up WPTV-Channel 5 meteorologist Dean Tendrich and
left him a rambling message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck are you talking about?'' said Tendrich, when
he called me back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was real,'' he told me. ``It's no monkey
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a live shot of the West Palm Beach skyline I was
looking at. And a live bird flying across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more than I can say for the CBS Evening News.
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard? They've been using computer imagery to spice up
some of their evening news broadcasts. The technique's not new.
Indeed, ABC radio and television reporter Cokie Roberts used it a
while back.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, she got in trouble for it. Here's what
happened:
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jennings broke away to the Capitol building. And there
stood Cokie.
</P>
<P>
   Except _ oops _ she wasn't really standing in front of the
Capitol at all.
</P>
<P>
   She was standing inside the ABC newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a coat.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capitol superimposed behind her.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is the same computer wizardry they use to mark the
first-down with that fake line during televised football games.
Florida's Sunshine Network used it to plop fake ads on baseball
fields around the country last year. The Early Show , that new show
with Bryant Gumbel, has been using it to put their ads on
horse-drawn carriages and buildings and buses behind their set in
New York City. And on New Year's Eve, Dan Rather's folks used it to
obliterate the big NBC television screen on Times Square, replacing
it with something that looked very much like a CBS billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Except it wasn't. It was a computer ad, and CBS is getting flak
for using it during a live news broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to do things without ruining the
neighborhood,'' said CBS executive Steve Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Friedman doesn't give a hoot about deceiving viewers.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose we should get used to this business of deciphering
what is real and what is virtual. We've got virtual murder defenses
and virtual friendships and an e-mail company just bought half the
damn world.
</P>
<P>
   See, isn't this all just hilarious?
</P>
<P>
   Put down the paper and laugh along with me. First the men.
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
</P>
<P>
   Now the women. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
</P>
<P>
   A little more enthusiasm, please. Because, I'm thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this amazing progress, virtual menopause has to be
just around the bend. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Good grief.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm crying.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The ignorance of incompetents is bad news for
politics
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Gov. Bush, since you have only limited foreign
policy experience as governor of Texas, and since you have already
flunked a pop quiz on foreign affairs, do you feel confident that
you can handle the foreign policy duties required of the president
of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, let me remind you that Texas is larger than any
European country. I don't see you asking any European leaders if
they think they are competent enough to handle foreign affairs.
Right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, sir. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me finish. Of course, I feel confident that I can handle
the foreign policy duties of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only foreign policy experience the current occupant of the
White House had before he became governor of Arkansas was leading
anti-war demonstrations in Europe. I defended Texas in the National
Guard. I am supremely confident in my abilities to handle foreign
policy duties as president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore, you have worked more closely with the
president than any other vice president in history. But due to the
scandals that have plagued this president, the country now is
looking for moral leadership in the White House. Do you feel
confident that you can provide moral leadership even though you
have been so closely associated with President Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me remind you that I not only invented the Internet,
global warming and rap music, I also invented moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in a penthouse in Washington, D.C., I
helped harvest tobacco. Later, I accepted money from tobacco
lobbyists. Now I want to sue the pants off tobacco companies and
regulate all tobacco. That's moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told that the money I got from those Buddhist nuns
was for campaign financing, I gave it back. That's moral
leadership. I am confident beyond words that I can be the greatest
moral leader the White House has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   According to a study reported in last month's Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, incompetent people tend to be
extremely self-assured. Competent people, however, tend to have
doubts about their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Incompetent people, according to the study by Cornell professor
of psychology Dr. David A. Dunning, are doubly impaired.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, they are incompetent. To make matters worse, they
not only don't know that they are incompetent, they actually are
supremely confident in their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dunning and his research partner _ Dr. Justin Kruger, now at
the University of Illinois _ believe that the skills needed to
achieve competence are the same skills needed to recognize
competence.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about clueless. People who can't tell jokes believe they
are really funny. People who can tell jokes don't think they are
very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Besides testing humor with a panel of professional comedians as
judges, the study also tested logic and grammar skills.
</P>
<P>
   People who tested lowest in logic skills ranked their logic
skills higher than people who tested highest in logic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Incompetent test-takers had an over-inflated opinion of their
abilities, and competent subjects underestimated their powers.
</P>
<P>
   The professors expressed self-doubt about their study, which
means they are competent and their study is valid.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, who are singularly self-assured, weren't tested.
</P>
<P>
   They overflow with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   This must mean that politicians are incompetent and don't know
it.
</P>
<P>
   I give politicians more credit. I think they know that they
don't know but think the voters will not support someone who admits
it. They are right. Isn't that funny?

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take 1 of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article last year reported that DNA testing would be done
in the Jeffrey MacDonald case, the one that ``Fatal Vision'' was
based on. Did anything ever come of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The process is still in the examination stages. Lucia
Bartoli, a member of the MacDonald defense team in Boston, told Q&AMP;A
last week that the defense was hoping for the DNA to be done soon.
But she added that it's not possible to provide a specific time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Both prosecution and defense ``must be satisfied as to the
exhibits themselves, and then determine if any specific specimen
should be sacrificed for the DNA,'' Bertoli said. ``The process is
longer than the actual testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacDonald defense wasn't allowed to test all hairs, blood,
and other material in the evidence collection, Bartoli said. ``We
are allowed to test only those items mentioned in Philip Cormier's
affidavit.'' Cormier is one of the pro-bono attorneys on the case.
Several of the items mentioned are gone, Bartoli said, ``but for
now, the defense will do the best possible with the items we are
being allowed to test.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald was found guilty in 1979 in the deaths in 1970 of his
wife and two daughters at Fort Bragg, N.C. At the time, MacDonald
was an Army captain. He is serving three life terms in a federal
prison in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Charles Schulz drew his last cartoon on Jan. 3, the
``Peanuts'' strip still appears every day in the newspaper with
that day's date on it. Is he still drawing, or are these recycled
cartoons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Schulz's last new daily strip, a letter to readers announcing
his retirement, was printed on Jan. 3. Since then, his syndicate,
United Media, has been offering reprint strips from the early
1970s, redating them so they will run in the proper order. The
``Peanuts'' strips on Sundays are still new ones. Schulz's last new
Sunday strip will run on Feb. 13. After that, strips on Sundays
will go to reprints, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution, by the way, is planning special
coverage on Feb. 13 devoted to ``Peanuts'' and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The TV program ``Biography'' recently featured actor and
comedian Dick Van Dyke. Several years ago, I read that a daughter
of his had committed suicide. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kelly Jean Van Dyke-Nance, whose body was found in November
1991 in her North Hollywood apartment, was Dick Van Dyke's niece.
She was the daughter of actor Jerry Van Dyke, his brother. The Los
Angeles coroner's office listed the death as a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on morale in the military. In light
of that, can you tell us the salary range the Army pays its
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pay table is complex, with the range obviously depending
on rank or grade and years of service. Effective Jan. 1, monthly
pay for enlisted members with the rank of E-1 (recruit) and less
than two years' service is $930.30; for officers at the grade of
O-10 (general), $8,214.90. Other examples: E-9 (sergeant major)
with 20 years, $3,361.50; W-4 (chief warrant officer) with 10
years, $3,235.50; O-6 (colonel) with 16 years, $5,693.10. Online,
you can view the current pay table, which became effective Jan. 1,
at this site: http://pay2000.dtic.mil/jan2000pt.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I enjoyed watching the videotape of the movie
``Rudy,'' about the life of Rudy Ruettiger of Notre Dame fame. Did
he ever graduate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Daniel ``Rudy'' Ruettiger, portrayed by Sean Astin in
the 1993 film, graduated in the spring of 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettiger's story was the classic one of a little guy with big
dreams, a walk-on football player who made the most of his one and
only play at Notre Dame. Before the final game of the 1975 season,
his senior year, four other seniors on the team asked then-head
coach Dan Devine to let the 5-foot-7, 165-pound Ruettiger suit up.
After he got in on the final play, sacking the opposition
quarterback to seal the victory for Notre Dame, his teammates
carried him off the field on their shoulders to the cheers of fans.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie came out, making him a hero to many _ he was
invited to dinner at the White House by President Clinton _
Ruettiger wrote three books and hit the public-speaking circuit,
giving motivational talks. But in 1994 he decided to slow down to
devote more time to his wife and daughter. The family moved from
Chicago to Henderson, Nev., and at last report Ruettiger was
speaking only on rare occasions, such as to church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw several brief mentions about a millennium time capsule
to be placed in Washington on New Year's Eve. I never saw or heard
what went into it. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was unveiled Dec. 31 at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History in Washington was a prototype
of the National Millennium Time Capsule. Carved out of wood in an
American flag motif, it stands 4 feet high, 6 feet long and 2 feet
deep.
</P>
<P>
   The actual capsule, to be made of copper, steel and titanium,
isn't expected to be finished until early summer, and even then it
will go on display in the rotunda at the National Archives in
Washington until the end of the year. At that time it will be
relocated to a secure, climate-controlled area, to be opened in
2100.
</P>
<P>
   The items that will be sealed in the real capsule are many and
varied. Among them: a piece of the Berlin Wall; an essay about
freedom written by elementary school students in the Northern
Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the western Pacific; a
Twinkie; a cell phone; photos of Earth from space; a World War II
helmet; a pair of sunglasses worn by Ray Charles; a copy of the
14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection under the law; a
Boston Public Library card; military dog tags; and a sealed
container of the vaccines that so greatly extended life in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Millennium Council will continue to accept
invited submissions until the official capsule is completed. Until
then, the prototype will remain on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that there's a Web site that provides a view of
objects on Earth, even a person's house. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to a site _
http://terraserver.microsoft.com _ containing aerial photos from
the U.S. Geological Survey and satellite surveillance images 2-4
years old. But not everything in the United States is covered by
the database. Only about 30 percent of the country is included.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The late actor John Wayne seemed like an icon of patriotism.
Did he ever serve in the military?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Wayne (birth name: Marion Michael Morrison) wanted to
become a naval officer, according to Current Biography Yearbook,
but the best he could obtain was an alternate appointment to
Annapolis. That didn't work out, so he went to the University of
Southern California from 1925 to 1927 on a football scholarship. He
took a summer job as fourth assistant property man on a John Ford
film, ``Mother Machree,'' at the studios of Fox Film Corp., which
led to acting assignments and eventual stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our solar system is part of the Milky Way galaxy. About how
many solar systems are in the Milky Way? And does the solar system
where Earth is situated have a name?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Planetary system'' is a better description than ``solar
system.'' J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy in the University
of Georgia's department of physics and astronomy, said the common
parlance for our planetary system is ``solar system,'' after Sol,
our sun.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, Shaw said,
and not all of them have planetary systems. In fact, recent
discoveries of planets orbiting nearby stars indicate that only
10-20 percent may have planetary companions. ``However, we are
beginning to think that in the 20 billion or so planetary systems
in the Milky Way, ours is not the usual arrangement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Astroare just beginning to discover the wide variety of
planetary systems and have yet to figure out just where ours fits
in the pattern, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The zebra has physical characteristics like a pony and orse.
Is there some quirk preventing it from being trainable for domestic
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Richard Sartor, assistant curator of large mammals at Zoo
Atlanta, said he knows of no biological reason why zebras have not
been domesticated. However, he says he has heard anecdotes about
people who have successfully trained a hand-raised or tame zebra.
</P>
<P>
   Taming involves one individual animal, while domestication is
working with and altering a population's genetic makeup over time.
``Throughout history, as with wild cats and wild dogs, different
cultures have chosen and successfully domesticated and/or trained
certain animals as opposed to others,'' Sartor said. ``Some animals
thrive more readily than others in human-controlled environments,
and some species have domesticated more easily than others have.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any background information about Rosa Rodriguez,
the Miami judge involved in the custody case of Elian Gonzalez?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rodriguez, 39, was born in Washington, D.C., of Puerto Rican
heritage. She attended high school and college in Tampa, earning a
bachelor's degree at the University of South Florida in 1982. She
graduated from Yale Law School in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation, Rodriguez spent four years doing criminal
defense work in the office of the Miami-Dade public defender. In
1995, she did a brief stint in private practice, working as a
commercial litigator for the Miami law firm Zarco and Pardo.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Hartford (Conn.) Courant, Rodriguez wound up
with the politically explosive Gonzalez case almost by accident.
She was elected 16 months ago as a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge
after a hard-fought campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She was transferred to the family court last fall when her rival
for the judgeship accused her of campaign finance violations. The
transfer is temporary and intended to keep Rodriguez from cases
where prosecutors have a stake while the Miami-Dade state's
attorney's office investigates. Rodriguez says no laws were
violated, and she isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has happened to the Enola Gay, the World War II bomber
that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima? Was it scrapped after
the war, or is it on display somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Enola Gay is ``between engagements'' and isn't on public
view. Parts of the B-29 went on display in 1995 at the National Air
and Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. At
the time, visitors could see a 50-foot section of its fuselage,
from the cockpit to the bomb bay. But that exhibit has ended, and
renovations are under way at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft will go back on view in 2003 when the Dulles Center
opens on a 176-acre site at Washington Dulles International Airport
in northern Virginia, said museum spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas. The
center's museum will be home to hundreds of airplanes and
spacecraft _ Enola Gay, among them _ that couldn't be displayed in
the National Mall museum because of space limitations.

 &HT;    NUTS AND BOLTS: January a good time for tool organization
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   January is traditionally a time when people vow to
get-things-organized-and-this-time-I-really-mean-it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a do-it-yourselfer, a good way to start the year is to
clean, reorganize and update your tool boxes, tool racks and other
places you keep tools and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Start by pulling everything from your tool box and setting the
tools out in orderly fashion where you can see them. Separate any
nails, screws, washers, rivets and similar small parts you've
tossed into the box and put them into marked or see-through
containers. Old baby food jars and the plastic containers film
comes in are useful here.
</P>
<P>
   Dump any debris left in the box into a trash container and
inspect the box for wear and tear. If they box is metal, you may
need to sand and repaint it inside and out to correct rusting.
Lubricate hinges as needed and make sure all clasps work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat the process with any cabinets, drawers and racks that
hold tools _ pull out and separate the tools and materials, clean
the containers and fix minor problems such as crooked hinges.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory and inspect your tools. If you're used to working
around the house, you know which tools you typically use all the
time. Make sure all those basic tools are in working order.
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to being a do-it-yourselfer, your initial tool
collection should include a 16-ounce (medium-sized) claw hammer, a
set of screwdrivers or a screwdriver with interchangeable bits, a
pair of adjustable pliers, a pair of long-nosed pliers, a
retractable metal tape measure, a small level, a utility knife and
a hacksaw. A general-purpose wood saw, staple gun, wood chisels,
hex wrenches, putty knife and wire-cutting pliers often come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   You need some wrenches, too. Most books suggest you start with a
set of open end wrenches and a couple adjustable wrenches.
Personally, I think a good socket wrench set is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   And your first major purchase should be a variable speed
drill-driver of good quality. A drill-driver drills holes and
drives and removes screws.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a rechargeable drill in the $80 to $150 range that
should do most of the light work around the house. Make sure your
drill comes with an extra battery and a recharger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to run out and buy a complete set of tools all
at once. But keep in mind what you need in your basic kit and buy
good quality tools as the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   If you need an expensive tool for a project and you don't think
you'll use the tool much in the future, consider renting instead of
buying.
</P>
<P>
   But a circular saw and bench grinder are good investments if
you're serious about becoming a handyperson.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tool maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   After a while your tools lose their newness and their efficiency
starts to drop. That's when you start buying tools to maintain your
other tools.
</P>
<P>
   The bench grinder mentioned earlier is such a tool. It's an
electrical device with spinning abrasive wheels used to sharpen and
shape metal. A bench grinder comes in handy for sharpening chisels
and similar tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The most important sharpening tool you should keep on hand is a
whetstone or similar flat abrasive stone. You can find abrasive
stones at hardware and home improvement stores for about $5 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   To use an abrasive stone, clamp it flat on a surface and
lubricate it with oil or water depending on the instructions that
come with the stone.
</P>
<P>
   Push the knife, scissor or snip blade you're sharpening along
the stone with light, even pressure for several strokes. Turn the
blade over and sharpen the other side the same number of strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Most abrasive stones come with a fine side and a medium side.
The fine side is what you'll use for most household sharpening.
</P>
<P>
   Hand saws are sharpened with small, triangular files.
</P>
<P>
   Clamp the blade of the saw between strips of wood with the teeth
of the blade starting about an eighth of an inch above the wood.
Starting with the first tooth leaning toward you, make two or three
passes with the triangular file. Repeat the process on the other
teeth leaning toward you.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse the saw in the clamp and sharpen the teeth that are now
leaning toward you. With a crosscut saw, you'll be filing at a
45-degree angle. With a ripsaw, you'll file at a 90-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   If you use your drill often, another useful tool maintenance
item is a drill bit sharpener. If you don't go through a lot of
bits in a year, it may be cheaper to replace individual bits as
they wear out.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've lubricated, sharpened and cleaned all the tools,
start putting them away again. But don't pile everything you own
into the tool box you carry around with you.
</P>
<P>
   Why lug the tool you only use once a year? Put that one in a
cabinet or a drawer until you need it. Another great way to store
tools is to affix a pegboard to the wall behind your favorite work
area.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to use a separate case for your drill-driver
rather than trying to cram it into the case with your other tools.
Your drill-driver case should have enough room for all the bits you
usually use plus your favorite accessories such as polishing pads
or sanding disks.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of two.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I frequently see references to the Jewish organization B'nai
B'rith. What does the name mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hebrew words translate as ``children (or sons) of the
covenant.'' The international service organization, organized in
1843, devotes itself to philanthropic and community activities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Washington recently
and pulled the window shade down because I was being blinded by the
sun. Before takeoff, a flight attendant told me to raise it, saying
it was required by federal law. In all my years of flying, I've
never heard of such a thing. What do you say?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no federal regulation requiring shades to be raised
during takoff or landing, said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration's Southern region. There may be a
company policy, she added, depending on the airline. Delta
spokesman John Kennedy, speculating that this may have been a case
of miscommunication, said Delta has no such regulation, either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the new gold dollar coins?
Where can they be obtained?
</P>
<P>
   A: Authorized by the U.S. $1 Coin Act of 1997, the new golden
dollar coin replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin, which was
introduced in 1979. According to the U.S. Mint, the replacement
``meets an increasing demand for a dollar coin in commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with public acceptance of the Anthony coin
was that it was easily confused with a quarter. The new golden coin
will be obviously distinguishable. While it's the same diameter as
the Anthony coin, the new coin will be gold in color, have a smooth
edge (in contrast to the reeded edge of the Anthony coin), and have
a wider border than existing U.S. circulating coinage.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin will go into general circulation in March. It will
be available through banks, stores, vending machines, the Mint's
Web site _ www.usmint.gov _ and the usual outlets where money
changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   Between January and March, the golden dollar will be available
only through limited distribution. During this time, the Mint is
partnering with several companies that will distribute the coin.
One partner, General Mills, will include a new golden dollar coin
in every 2,000th box of Cheerios cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in going to Cuba on vacation. Has the State
Department relaxed restrictions on U.S. citizens going there?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The State Department Web site dealing with this subject _
www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/travel.html _ states
emphatically: ``Tourist travel is not possible under U.S. law.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens must be licensed by the Treasury Department in
order to go there legally. General licenses are authorized for,
among others, U.S. and foreign government officials traveling on
official business; journalists employed by a news reporting
organization; professional research; and people making a
once-a-year-visit to close family relatives in circumstances of
humanitarian need.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. laws restrict financial transactions with Cuba. The Trading
With the Enemy Act forbids Americans from spending money in a
country with which the United States has no formal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are ways to get to Cuba without an official
license if someone wants to skirt the State Department's
regulations. Flying to Cuba via another country, such as Mexico,
Canada or the Bahamas, is possible. Some travel agents may be able
to provide information, and at least one Web site _
www.cuba-travel.com _ also has information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the controversy surrounding Elian Gonzalez, we're
curious: What has happened to the other people who survived the
sinking of the boat coming from Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   A: In addition to the boy, two adults survived. Both have been
released into the custody of family members pending hearings before
the immigration court, said Russ Bergeron, spokesman in Washington
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Elian, his mother
and stepfather, and 10 others were aboard the 17-foot-boat when it
left Gardenas, on Cuba's north coast, on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Roy Kramer, commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, has
come out in favor of a ban on the summer recruiting of high school
basketball players. I want to commend him for his stand. What is
his e-mail or regular mail address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact him by e-mail at rkramer(at)sec.org or by regular
mail at this address: Southeastern Conference, 2201 Richard
Arrington Blvd., Birmingham, AL 35203.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What specifically did Gen. Colin Powell do militarily to gain
recognition as an American hero, as he was called by Vice President
Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A: Powell, who was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the
Army after graduating from City College of New York, was assigned
in 1962-63 to a South Vietnamese infantry battalion patrolling the
border with Laos. While marching through a rice paddy one day in
1963, Powell stepped into a Punji-stick trap, impaling his foot on
one of the sharpened stakes concealed just below the water's
surface. After that wound he was awarded the Purple Heart, and in
that same year he was given a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968-69, Powell returned for a second Vietnam tour of duty
with the Army infantry as a battalion executive officer and
division operations officer. He was injured in a helicopter crash
landing, during which his rescuing of troops from the burning
copter earned him a Soldiers Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, he won 11 medals, including the Legion of Merit in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Among other positions during his long and distinguished military
career, Powell also commanded forces in South Korea, West Germany
and the United States, and in 1986 he became commanding general of
the Fifth Corps in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1987, President Reagan
named him assistant to the president for national security affairs.
You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on a lawsuit in New York that may
bring financial compensation to inmates involved in the 1971 Attica
prison riots, or to their survivors. Can survivors still join that
class-action suit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But a claim form must be filed by the inmate involved,
or a survivor legally appointed to handle the inmate's estate. To
obtain a form, write: U.S. District Court, Attention: Attica Case,
100 State St., Rochester, NY 14614. Information also is available
from the principal lawyer for the plantiffs' class: Elizabeth Fink,
294 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11201 (877-480-5050).
</P>
<P>
   A person involved in the Attica uprising and siege Sept. 9,
1971, already would be a member of the class involved in the
lawsuit, a spokeswoman for U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca in
Rochester, N.Y., told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in 1974 on behalf of 1,281 inmates, sought $2.8
billion. On Jan. 4, Telesca announced that inmates beaten and
tortured would share in a settlement of $8 million from New York
state. The court has imposed a deadline of mid-February for
plantiffs to weigh in on whether they think the proposed settlement
is adequate compensation. The episode left 43 people dead and more
than 80 injured.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 inmates are expected to provide their opinions on the
proposed settlement, said Joe Heath, one of the inmates' lawyers.
Another 400 may be dead, he added, while the remainder may be
uninterested or can't be located. If the inmates reach a consensus
to accept the settlement, Telesca will hold hearings to divide the
money. If they don't accept, the litigation will continue, Fink
said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the yea all 50 state quarters will be
issued, in order, so we can keep track of the ones we've gotten and
the ones we need to get?
</P>
<P>
   A: The state quarters are being issued in the sequence that the
states joined the union. In 1999, these were produced: Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. This year's
schedule: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   These will follow: 2001, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Kentucky; 2002, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana and
Mississippi; 2003, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri and Arkansas;
2004, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa and Wisconsin; 2005,
California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas and West Virgina; 2006,
Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota and South Dakota; 2007,
Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah; 2008, Oklahoma, New
Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The old movie ``White Christmas'' was shown once again during
the holidays. One of the stars was Vera-Ellen, the talented dancer.
Whatever became of her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The actress-dancer, who was born in 1926, died of cancer in
1981. While she was best remembered for her role in the 1954
``White Christmas,'' which also starred Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and
Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen appeared in numerous other films,
paired at times with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article last year reported that DNA testing would be done
in the Jeffrey MacDonald case, the one that ``Fatal Vision'' was
based on. Did anything ever come of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The process is still in the examination stages. Lucia
Bartoli, a member of the MacDonald defense team in Boston, told Q&AMP;A
last week that the defense was hoping for the DNA to be done soon.
But she added that it's not possible to provide a specific time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Both prosecution and defense ``must be satisfied as to the
exhibits themselves, and then determine if any specific specimen
should be sacrificed for the DNA,'' Bertoli said. ``The process is
longer than the actual testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacDonald defense wasn't allowed to test all hairs, blood,
and other material in the evidence collection, Bartoli said. ``We
are allowed to test only those items mentioned in Philip Cormier's
affidavit.'' Cormier is one of the pro-bono attorneys on the case.
Several of the items mentioned are gone, Bartoli said, ``but for
now, the defense will do the best possible with the items we are
being allowed to test.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald was found guilty in 1979 in the deaths in 1970 of his
wife and two daughters at Fort Bragg, N.C. At the time, MacDonald
was an Army captain. He is serving three life terms in a federal
prison in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Charles Schulz drew his last cartoon on Jan. 3, the
``Peanuts'' strip still appears every day in the newspaper with
that day's date on it. Is he still drawing, or are these recycled
cartoons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Schulz's last new daily strip, a letter to readers announcing
his retirement, was printed on Jan. 3. Since then, his syndicate,
United Media, has been offering reprint strips from the early
1970s, redating them so they will run in the proper order. The
``Peanuts'' strips on Sundays are still new ones. Schulz's last new
Sunday strip will run on Feb. 13. After that, strips on Sundays
will go to reprints, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution, by the way, is planning special
coverage on Feb. 13 devoted to ``Peanuts'' and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The TV program ``Biography'' recently featured actor and
comedian Dick Van Dyke. Several years ago, I read that a daughter
of his had committed suicide. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kelly Jean Van Dyke-Nance, whose body was found in November
1991 in her North Hollywood apartment, was Dick Van Dyke's niece.
She was the daughter of actor Jerry Van Dyke, his brother. The Los
Angeles coroner's office listed the death as a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on morale in the military. In light
of that, can you tell us the salary range the Army pays its
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pay table is complex, with the range obviously depending
on rank or grade and years of service. Effective Jan. 1, monthly
pay for enlisted members with the rank of E-1 (recruit) and less
than two years' service is $930.30; for officers at the grade of
O-10 (general), $8,214.90. Other examples: E-9 (sergeant major)
with 20 years, $3,361.50; W-4 (chief warrant officer) with 10
years, $3,235.50; O-6 (colonel) with 16 years, $5,693.10. Online,
you can view the current pay table, which became effective Jan. 1,
at this site: http://pay2000.dtic.mil/jan2000pt.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I enjoyed watching the videotape of the movie
``Rudy,'' about the life of Rudy Ruettiger of Notre Dame fame. Did
he ever graduate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Daniel ``Rudy'' Ruettiger, portrayed by Sean Astin in
the 1993 film, graduated in the spring of 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettiger's story was the classic one of a little guy with big
dreams, a walk-on football player who made the most of his one and
only play at Notre Dame. Before the final game of the 1975 season,
his senior year, four other seniors on the team asked then-head
coach Dan Devine to let the 5-foot-7, 165-pound Ruettiger suit up.
After he got in on the final play, sacking the opposition
quarterback to seal the victory for Notre Dame, his teammates
carried him off the field on their shoulders to the cheers of fans.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie came out, making him a hero to many _ he was
invited to dinner at the White House by President Clinton _
Ruettiger wrote three books and hit the public-speaking circuit,
giving motivational talks. But in 1994 he decided to slow down to
devote more time to his wife and daughter. The family moved from
Chicago to Henderson, Nev., and at last report Ruettiger was
speaking only on rare occasions, such as to church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw several brief mentions about a millennium time capsule
to be placed in Washington on New Year's Eve. I never saw or heard
what went into it. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was unveiled Dec. 31 at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History in Washington was a prototype
of the National Millennium Time Capsule. Carved out of wood in an
American flag motif, it stands 4 feet high, 6 feet long and 2 feet
deep.
</P>
<P>
   The actual capsule, to be made of copper, steel and titanium,
isn't expected to be finished until early summer, and even then it
will go on display in the rotunda at the National Archives in
Washington until the end of the year. At that time it will be
relocated to a secure, climate-controlled area, to be opened in
2100.
</P>
<P>
   The items that will be sealed in the real capsule are many and
varied. Among them: a piece of the Berlin Wall; an essay about
freedom written by elementary school students in the Northern
Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the western Pacific; a
Twinkie; a cell phone; photos of Earth from space; a World War II
helmet; a pair of sunglasses worn by Ray Charles; a copy of the
14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection under the law; a
Boston Public Library card; military dog tags; and a sealed
container of the vaccines that so greatly extended life in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Millennium Council will continue to accept
invited submissions until the official capsule is completed. Until
then, the prototype will remain on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that there's a Web site that provides a view of
objects on Earth, even a person's house. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to a site _
http://terraserver.microsoft.com _ containing aerial photos from
the U.S. Geological Survey and satellite surveillance images 2-4
years old. But not everything in the United States is covered by
the database. Only about 30 percent of the country is included.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The late actor John Wayne seemed like an icon of patriotism.
Did he ever serve in the military?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Wayne (birth name: Marion Michael Morrison) wanted to
become a naval officer, according to Current Biography Yearbook,
but the best he could obtain was an alternate appointment to
Annapolis. That didn't work out, so he went to the University of
Southern California from 1925 to 1927 on a football scholarship. He
took a summer job as fourth assistant property man on a John Ford
film, ``Mother Machree,'' at the studios of Fox Film Corp., which
led to acting assignments and eventual stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our solar system is part of the Milky Way galaxy. About how
many solar systems are in the Milky Way? And does the solar system
where Earth is situated have a name?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Planetary system'' is a better description than ``solar
system.'' J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy in the University
of Georgia's department of physics and astronomy, said the common
parlance for our planetary system is ``solar system,'' after Sol,
our sun.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, Shaw said,
and not all of them have planetary systems. In fact, recent
discoveries of planets orbiting nearby stars indicate that only
10-20 percent may have planetary companions. ``However, we are
beginning to think that in the 20 billion or so planetary systems
in the Milky Way, ours is not the usual arrangement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers are just beginning to discover the wide variety of
planetary systems and have yet to figure out just where ours fits
in the pattern, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The zebra has physical characteristics like a pony and orse.
Is there some quirk preventing it from being trainable for domestic
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Richard Sartor, assistant curator of large mammals at Zoo
Atlanta, said he knows of no biological reason why zebras have not
been domesticated. However, he says he has heard anecdotes about
people who have successfully trained a hand-raised or tame zebra.
</P>
<P>
   Taming involves one individual animal, while domestication is
working with and altering a population's genetic makeup over time.
``Throughout history, as with wild cats and wild dogs, different
cultures have chosen and successfully domesticated and/or trained
certain animals as opposed to others,'' Sartor said. ``Some animals
thrive more readily than others in human-controlled environments,
and some species have domesticated more easily than others have.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any background information about Rosa Rodriguez,
the Miami judge involved in the custody case of Elian Gonzalez?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rodriguez, 39, was born in Washington, D.C., of Puerto Rican
heritage. She attended high school and college in Tampa, earning a
bachelor's degree at the University of South Florida in 1982. She
graduated from Yale Law School in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation, Rodriguez spent four years doing criminal
defense work in the office of the Miami-Dade public defender. In
1995, she did a brief stint in private practice, working as a
commercial litigator for the Miami law firm Zarco and Pardo.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Hartford (Conn.) Courant, Rodriguez wound up
with the politically explosive Gonzalez case almost by accident.
She was elected 16 months ago as a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge
after a hard-fought campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She was transferred to the family court last fall when her rival
for the judgeship accused her of campaign finance violations. The
transfer is temporary and intended to keep Rodriguez from cases
where prosecutors have a stake while the Miami-Dade state's
attorney's office investigates. Rodriguez says no laws were
violated, and she isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has happened to the Enola Gay, the World War II bomber
that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima? Was it scrapped after
the war, or is it on display somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Enola Gay is ``between engagements'' and isn't on public
view. Parts of the B-29 went on display in 1995 at the National Air
and Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. At
the time, visitors could see a 50-foot section of its fuselage,
from the cockpit to the bomb bay. But that exhibit has ended, and
renovations are under way at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft will go back on view in 2003 when the Dulles Center
opens on a 176-acre site at Washington Dulles International Airport
in northern Virginia, said museum spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas. The
center's museum will be home to hundreds of airplanes and
spacecraft _ Enola Gay, among them _ that couldn't be displayed in
the National Mall museum because of space limitations.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of two.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I frequently see references to the Jewish organization B'nai
B'rith. What does the name mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hebrew words translate as ``children (or sons) of the
covenant.'' The international service organization, organized in
1843, devotes itself to philanthropic and community activities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Washington recently
and pulled the window shade down because I was being blinded by the
sun. Before takeoff, a flight attendant told me to raise it, saying
it was required by federal law. In all my years of flying, I've
never heard of such a thing. What do you say?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no federal regulation requiring shades to be raised
during takoff or landing, said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration's Southern region. There may be a
company policy, she added, depending on the airline. Delta
spokesman John Kennedy, speculating that this may have been a case
of miscommunication, said Delta has no such regulation, either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the new gold dollar coins?
Where can they be obtained?
</P>
<P>
   A: Authorized by the U.S. $1 Coin Act of 1997, the new golden
dollar coin replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin, which was
introduced in 1979. According to the U.S. Mint, the replacement
``meets an increasing demand for a dollar coin in commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with public acceptance of the Anthony coin
was that it was easily confused with a quarter. The new golden coin
will be obviously distinguishable. While it's the same diameter asthony coin, the new coin will be gold in color, have a smooth
edge (in contrast to the reeded edge of the Anthony coin), and have
a wider border than existing U.S. circulating coinage.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin will go into general circulation in March. It will
be available through banks, stores, vending machines, the Mint's
Web site _ www.usmint.gov _ and the usual outlets where money
changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   Between January and March, the golden dollar will be available
only through limited distribution. During this time, the Mint is
partnering with several companies that will distribute the coin.
One partner, General Mills, will include a new golden dollar coin
in every 2,000th box of Cheerios cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in going to Cuba on vacation. Has the State
Department relaxed restrictions on U.S. citizens going there?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The State Department Web site dealing with this subject _
www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/travel.html _ states
emphatically: ``Tourist travel is not possible under U.S. law.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens must be licensed by the Treasury Department in
order to go there legally. General licenses are authorized for,
among others, U.S. and foreign government officials traveling on
official business; journalists employed by a news reporting
organization; professional research; and people making a
once-a-year-visit to close family relatives in circumstances of
humanitarian need.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. laws restrict financial transactions with Cuba. The Trading
With the Enemy Act forbids Americans from spending money in a
country with which the United States has no formal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are ways to get to Cuba without an official
license if someone wants to skirt the State Department's
regulations. Flying to Cuba via another country, such as Mexico,
Canada or the Bahamas, is possible. Some travel agents may be able
to provide information, and at least one Web site _
www.cuba-travel.com _ also has information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the controversy surrounding Elian Gonzalez, we're
curious: What has happened to the other people who survived the
sinking of the boat coming from Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   A: In addition to the boy, two adults survived. Both have been
released into the custody of family members pending hearings before
the immigration court, said Russ Bergeron, spokesman in Washington
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Elian, his mother
and stepfather, and 10 others were aboard the 17-foot-boat when it
left Gardenas, on Cuba's north coast, on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Roy Kramer, commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, has
come out in favor of a ban on the summer recruiting of high school
basketball players. I want to commend him for his stand. What is
his e-mail or regular mail address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact him by e-mail at rkramer(at)sec.org or by regular
mail at this address: Southeastern Conference, 2201 Richard
Arrington Blvd., Birmingham, AL 35203.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What specifically did Gen. Colin Powell do militarily to gain
recognition as an American hero, as he was called by Vice President
Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A: Powell, who was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the
Army after graduating from City College of New York, was assigned
in 1962-63 to a South Vietnamese infantry battalion patrolling the
border with Laos. While marching through a rice paddy one day in
1963, Powell stepped into a Punji-stick trap, impaling his foot on
one of the sharpened stakes concealed just below the water's
surface. After that wound he was awarded the Purple Heart, and in
that same year he was given a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968-69, Powell returned for a second Vietnam tour of duty
with the Army infantry as a battalion executive officer and
division operations officer. He was injured in a helicopter crash
landing, during which his rescuing of troops from the burning
copter earned him a Soldiers Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, he won 11 medals, including the Legion of Merit in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Among other positions during his long and distinguished military
career, Powell also commanded forces in South Korea, West Germany
and the United States, and in 1986 he became commanding general of
the Fifth Corps in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1987, President Reagan
named him assistant to the president for national security affairs.
You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on a lawsuit in New York that may
bring financial compensation to inmates involved in the 1971 Attica
prison riots, or to their survivors. Can survivors still join that
class-action suit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But a claim form must be filed by the inmate involved,
or a survivor legally appointed to handle the inmate's estate. To
obtain a form, write: U.S. District Court, Attention: Attica Case,
100 State St., Rochester, NY 14614. Information also is available
from the principal lawyer for the plantiffs' class: Elizabeth Fink,
294 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11201 (877-480-5050).
</P>
<P>
   A person involved in the Attica uprising and siege Sept. 9,
1971, already would be a member of the class involved in the
lawsuit, a spokeswoman for U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca in
Rochester, N.Y., told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in 1974 on behalf of 1,281 inmates, sought $2.8
billion. On Jan. 4, Telesca announced that inmates beaten and
tortured would share in a settlement of $8 million from New York
state. The court has imposed a deadline of mid-February for
plantiffs to weigh in on whether they think the proposed settlement
is adequate compensation. The episode left 43 people dead and more
than 80 injured.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 inmates are expected to provide their opinions on the
proposed settlement, said Joe Heath, one of the inmates' lawyers.
Another 400 may be dead, he added, while the remainder may be
uninterested or can't be located. If the inmates reach a consensus
to accept the settlement, Telesca will hold hearings to divide the
money. If they don't accept, the litigation will continue, Fink
said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the years when all 50 state quarters will be
issued, in order, so we can keep track of the ones we've gotten and
the ones we need to get?
</P>
<P>
   A: The state quarters are being issued in the sequence that the
states joined the union. In 1999, these were produced: Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. This year's
schedule: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   These will follow: 2001, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Kentucky; 2002, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana and
Mississippi; 2003, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri and Arkansas;
2004, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa and Wisconsin; 2005,
California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas and West Virgina; 2006,
Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota and South Dakota; 2007,
Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah; 2008, Oklahoma, New
Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The old movie ``White Christmas'' was shown once again during
the holidays. One of the stars was Vera-Ellen, the talented dancer.
Whatever became of her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The actress-dancer, who was born in 1926, died of cancer in
1981. While she was best remembered for her role in the 1954
``White Christmas,'' which also starred Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and
Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen appeared in numerous other films,
paired at times with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

 &HT;    Calories can add up fast with a big morning bagel
 &HT;    BY Karen Collins, M.S., R.D.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is a bagel the equivalent or two servings of grain in
the Food Guide Pyramid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The USDA's Food Guide Pyramid counts a bagel as two serving
from the grain group. But this is based on a 3-inch plain bagel,
not the hefty 4 1/2-inch deli-style version. Those super-size
bagels are equivalent to four servings or more.
</P>
<P>
   To estimate of the number of servings provided by a bagel or
other product, check the Nutrition Facts panel. One serving of most
bread products is roughly 1 ounce (28 grams) and provides about 70
calories and 15 grams of carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger bagels also hold more high-calorie spreads and toppings.
Those loaded with nuts, dried fruit, seeds, chocolate or topped
with a thick slathering of cream cheese can easily tip the scales
at 450 to 600 calories, which is about one-third of an inactive
woman's daily caloric requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is cracked wheat bread the same thing as whole wheat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cracked wheat is simply whole-wheat berries broken into
smaller pieces. This may give products a lighter taste or texture
than does regular whole wheat. Some ``cracked wheat bread''
contains only a small amount of cracked wheat and is mainly made of
refined flour. Check the ingredient label to make sure that cracked
wheat or whole-wheat flour is listed first as the primary
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Whole-grain and minimally refined grains are preferred over more
refined products. Whole grains are higher in dietary fiber, several
vitamins and minerals, and a variety of natural health-promoting
phytochemicals. A recent research conference on phytochemicals
noted that whole grains provide a variety of antioxidants, which
seem to be of help in preventing both heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If dried beans are so healthy, are some more nutritious than
others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Legumes, or dried beans, provide protein and the minerals
iron, zinc and magnesium, but without the saturated fat found in
meat. Legumes are also an excellent source of fiber. They are quite
different nutritionally from green beans, but among the dried beans
nutrient content is basically similar.
</P>
<P>
   Navy beans and soybeans are somewhat higher in magnesium than
the rest, while lentils are somewhat higher in iron and fiber. In
countries where cancer and heart disease are not the problems they
are here, people eat a mostly plant-based diet that emphasizes
vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Dried beans are a much-loved
part of the cuisine in all these places, served in soups, stews,
salads and appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research, and Becky
Gorham, a registered dietitian with the USDA/ARS Children's
Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

 &HT;    Quiet winter weekend ideal for reacquainting with old friend
roast
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A winter weekend at home is a time to cherish.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The golfers and gardeners and grill cooks can take a rest from
their obsessions. Shoppers can put away their credit cards. They
can all spend the afternoon curled up in front of the fire _ or at
least nested in a big chair _ and read a book, garden catalog or
chatter on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   And they can do what no one seems to have time to do anymore _
cook an old-fashioned roast.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday roast is traditional to its very bone. But
contemporary homemakers have virtually abandoned these big cuts in
favor of quicker-cooking pieces, from chicken breasts to pork
tenderloin. Those may be fine for weekdays, but they don't whet the
appetite with wonderful aromas that fill the house.
</P>
<P>
   For that you need meat and vegetables that roast for an hour or
more. Turn a page and lift your head; your nose will tell you
what's going on in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're not talking party roasts such as prime rib or leg of
lamb. We're talking family-friendly cuts. Pork loin, or even better
yet, a pork shoulder roast, an economical but flavorful cut that
tastes the way pork used to before producers bred it to be so lean.
Then there are lamb shanks or a lamb shoulder roast, or maybe a
beef rump roast that cooks until that cut dissolves to tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the roasts went into the oven just before the
family went to church. The midday dinner was ready when everyone
got home. Today, a lot of church-goers head out for a Sunday
brunch.
</P>
<P>
   But the lazy afternoon looms ahead. Dinner can be oh-so-easy
with a roast. As the saying goes, just pop it in the oven. Cooks
may have to rouse themselves once to add vegetables to the pan. But
after that you don't even have to look up from the book until it's
done.
</P>
<P>
   So turn on the music and cozy up. Cherish a day in which the
demands can be few.
</P>

A WINE CELLAR ON A BEER BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color graphic of a man and his wine bottles) 
 By JENN SHREVE 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all began with a single sip of a 1993 Andrew Will Cellars
merlot, but there was no turning back for Mike Flaherty. A
42-year-old strategist for Boeing in Seattle, Flaherty amassed a
300-bottle wine collection, with plenty of zinfandels, cabs and
ports. But one thing was missing: a cellar to put it in.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a poor, 'trailer trash' citizen like myself, I spend an
inordinate amount of my income on wine,'' Flaherty explains. ''I
just don't have enough money lying around to buy a fancy oak
refrigerator for my wines, as much as I'd like to.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Wine Market Council's recent $1.3 million ad
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   ''Wine: What are you saving it for?'' It's a question that those
who've savored a perfectly aged vintage are quick to respond to:
When it comes to wine, even a year or two of proper storage can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Wine consumption, of course, is up and sales are booming _
thanks to a flush economy and a stream of reports on the health
benefits of wine _ so there are plenty of newly minted wine
fanatics in search of a reliable cellar.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that a spacious, stand-alone wine room runs
about $2,500 and a wine refrigerator with a 300-bottle capacity or
a WhisperKool system, which you install in a closet, are about
$1,000 each _ prices high enough to make even hardened wine
enthusiasts think twice.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many budding collectors with bottles stashed under
the bed or in a closet, less than perfect cellar conditions. That
doesn't mean you can't get creative like Flaherty and other
fledgling collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty found his solution on the Internet, where wine
consumers increasingly gather in chat rooms to exchange tasting
notes and dole out advice. He discovered that many household
refrigerator thermostats have a ''range adjustment'' screw on them
that allow you to change the cooling range.
</P>
<P>
   So the 1-to-9 dial can be lowered or increased to suit a wine
bottle's particular needs
</P>
<P>
   One of Flaherty's friends donated an old fridge. He located the
screw behind the temperature gauge, bought a cheap thermometer to
read the temperatures as he adjusted the screw. Once he reached a
steady 55 degrees Fahrenheit, the ideal temperature for long-term
wine storage, Flaherty located some wooden bottle racks at a
clearance sale for $24.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Flaherty spent less than $50 on his 78-bottle ''wine
cellar,'' allowing him to invest the savings in more wine.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Flaherty, are using the converted fridge to solve
their wine-storage problem.
</P>
<P>
   For about $400, Keith Kwasne of San Jose, Calif., converted a
commercial beverage refrigerator into a wine cellar for his
300-plus bottles. ($200 for the refrigerator, $50 for a new
thermostat and $150 for the racks).
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look pretty, but it sits in my garage anyway,''
Kwasne says.
</P>
<P>
   These makeshift fridge cellars won't soothe every storage issue.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerators tend to vibrate and wine doesn't like to rock 'n
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerators also don't control humidity, important in keeping
corks moist and securely sealed.
</P>
<P>
   But those are long-term concerns, for collectors storing wine 10
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Advises Robin Garr, host of The Wine Lovers' Page on the Web,
''Bear in mind that 99 percent of the wine made in the world is not
intended for aging but is to be drunk up as soon as possible _
certainly within a year _ while it is still young and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr lists Bordeaux, Burgundy, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir
among those that benefit from long-term aging in an expensive wine
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who don't have the money for a fancy solution like that
don't have to despair. It's probably not practical to keep wine for
decades without a cellar, but for a year or two or even as long as
five years, you can do very well with a wine rack that holds your
wine bottles on their sides (so the cork stays wet), kept in a
relatively cool and quiet part of your house,'' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   Places to avoid? The kitchen, direct sunlight, and any part of
the house that receives a lot of foot traffic or vibrations from
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, a computer programmer in Columbia, Md., finds his
basement works well for storage.
</P>
<P>
   ''My basement rarely, even in Maryland summers, gets over 65
degrees with a low of 55 in winter. It's probably not good for
long-term storage but will probably work for me, as I only have
maybe two bottles I intend to let live beyond another five years,''
Davis says of his 270-bottle collection.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, if you can't afford to buy a bells-and-whistles
cellar, you probably can't afford the kind of wines you'd want to
keep for 10 or more years either.
</P>
<P>
   When Jonathan Gorman, a finance manager in Chicago, started
collecting wine nine years ago, basement storage was adequate.
Since then, his collection has grown in breadth and scale.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he stashes 30 to 40 bottles in a wine refrigerator at
home, and keeps the remaining 400-600 bottles at a personal storage
facility.

   The cost is $1 per bottle per year, and they accept deliveries
from wineries. ''While it's like sending your children to boarding
school, at least you know they are being well taken care of,''
Gorman says, displaying a level of devotion that is common among
seasoned wine devotees.
</P>
<P>
   There are hidden benefits to storing wine offsite, Gorman says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some wine-locker facilities act as wine clubs, hosting parties
where fellow aficionados can gather to trade and taste. I always
enjoy meeting the other people who are storing wine at my facility.
We obviously have at least one thing in common. Plus, it's kind of
cool to walk around the facility checking other people's
collections out. Some people you envy and some you pity. One locker
is full of Beringer white zinfandel!''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they prefer white zinfandels or aged pinot noirs, and
regardless of where their collections are stored _ be it a
renovated fridge or mahogany, 3,000 bottle storage room _ wine
collectors great and small will tell you they're constantly
thirsting for more.
</P>
<P>
   As Flaherty puts it, ''My retirement plan? Work forever, but
plan carefully to die with no unopened bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   With proper storage and the right amount of planning, that
shouldn't be a problem.

DOGS PULLING SKIERS: IT'S SKIJORING
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of people and dogs skijoring)

<P>
   There is an edge to the air, a swell of nervous energy, the sort
that speeds the heart. And if you can't feel that, there's the
raucous din of dogs near mad. Pinched cries, barks, yelps,
beseeching whines, run-on yaps, an anxiety-soaked yowling unmuted
by the snow laying thick across Fairbanks under the wide, blue
Alaska sky. Haunches twitch. Steaming noses jerk about, picking at
the sting of cold air.
</P>
<P>
   George Salmon nods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dogs know exactly what's going on,'' he says. ''They're
ready to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon plunges his head into the camper shell of his red Toyota
pickup and rummages around, while, Benny and Jets, 60-plus pounds
of Alaskan husky each, jerk at their chains, working to remove the
truck's bumper.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the truck Salmon pulls out skis and a long
strand of bungie cord.
</P>
<P>
   ''Skijoring is a trip,'' Salmon says with a wide grin.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring is a Norwegian word. It means ''ski driving,'' though
driving implies control that's not always present.
</P>
<P>
   Done correctly, skijoring works like so: dog (usually one or
two; more than that and there's even less control) and trailing
skier are connected by 7 to 12 feet of bungie cord running from the
dog's harness to a hook on the skier's belt. Skier gives the
command to go. Dog lunges forward, bungie jerks taut. If the
skijorer remains upright, off they go, dogs eagerly bunching and
unbunching in fluid surges of power, skier skiing behind.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a brake or any kind of steering device, skijorers rely
on verbal commands, but dogs can be selective listeners. So when
skijorers compare their sport to water-skiing, it's a reasonable
analogy, except that boats don't leap into embankments to roll in
the snow or stop abruptly to pee.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring's roots are traced to Scandinavia where Nordic-style
mushing _ teams of one to four dogs pulling a small sled called a
pulk, with the skier trailing behind _ has long been immensely
popular. But the pulk can be heavy and difficult to maneuver, so in
skijoring one simply gets rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian immigrants actually introduced skijoring to this
country more than a hundred years ago, hardy souls donning skis,
then schussing along behind a galloping horse. One can only imagine
the long winters that lead to such recreation, and the excitement
that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon can do better than imagine. A boisterous fellow with an
exemplary handlebar mustache, a few years back Salmon gained local
notoriety by briefly skijoring behind eight dogs, which in Lower 48
terms is akin to strapping booster rockets to your back and
pointing them all in different directions. The attempt ended in a
giant tangle. On another occasion, skijoring with four dogs and a
pulk down a steep, narrow trail, he was yanked off his feet.
Spinning along behind, Salmon managed to align himself so that none
of his limbs whacked against the trees and rocks edging the trail.
But the sleeves of his jacket were rolled up, exposing his
forearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got dragged maybe a hundred yards,'' he says. ''It was
almost a third degree burn. Nearly got to the fascia. There was
blood all over the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon laughs as his dogs might bark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haw! We were really blitzing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon may be alone in his enthusiasm, but he isn't alone in his
pursuit. North America's first skijoring club (the Alaska Skijoring
and Pulk Association) was founded in Fairbanks in 1987, and since
then the sport has spread elsewhere: to New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin _ where apparently their
ancestors' experiences with horses didn't dissuade them.
</P>
<P>
   If skijoring has an epicenter its the Salcha, Alaska, home of
Mary Hoe-Raitto. Hoe-Raitto has probably done more for skijoring in
this country than anybody. Soft-spoken and direct, she possesses
the quiet competence necessary to run her own sled dog kennel and
the firmness of character required to run off an angry moose that
has dashed into the midst of a mushing team.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the tiny town of Fagernes, Norway, Hoe-Raitto
stewed in the Nordic passions of dogs and skiing. Arriving in
Fairbanks in 1983, she first popularized skijoring by inadvertently
introducing it to her Salcha neighbors. An expert cross-country
skier, on one occasion skijoring with two dogs, she tailed a
surprised musher, and his 20-dog team, for five miles (''He kept
looking back, expecting me to be gone.'') Another time she fell and
careened through the neighborhood for a half-mile on her belly
(''That gets people's attention.'')
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has organized skijor exhibitions, conducted
clinics, and, along with friend and fellow skijorer Carol Kaynor,
written ''Skijor With Your Dog,'' a thorough book filled with sound
advice (Take the line off your belt and hold it in your hands when
going down steep hills.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Hoe-Raitto and Kaynor, skijoring is growing by
leaps and bounds for simple reasons. It's fun, fairly safe (''Only
slightly more dangerous than cross-country skiing,'' says Kaynor),
cheap (a skijoring belt, line and dog harness cost less than $70)
and easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a skijor dog isn't hard either. Hoe-Raitto and Kaynor
tick off the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Golden retrievers. Border collies. There's lots of Australian
shepards. Labs, Chesapeake Bay retrievers, Great Danes, beagles,''
says Hoe-Raitto.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schnausers!'' says Kaynor. ''We've had a couple of giant
schnausers! Poodles too. They can pull really well.''
</P>
<P>
   By dint of temperment and genetics certain breeds _ German
short-haired and wire-haired pointers, German shepards, Irish
setters, Siberian huskies _ make good race dogs. Bassets do not.
</P>
<P>
   ''They like to stop and shake,'' says Kaynor.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring isn't limited to dogs either. People have used
reindeer. Hoe-Raitto has seen pictures of her father and
grandfather hooking up a Norwegian elkhound and a goat.
</P>
<P>
   A skijor team on the fly can reach 22 miles an hour, which gives
the skijorer little time to account for canine idiosyncrasy. That
is why, before races, Salmon heads off what potential problems he
can. It might look like he's trotting Benny and Jets through their
warmup paces before the race begins, but it's mostly an attempt to
have them do what dogs do. Benny and Jets can perform on the fly,
but Salmon would prefer they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not something you want,'' he says. ''Plus they slow
down and that can really bring your time down.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, for one, sees a bright future for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''People love skiing, they love the outdoors, they love dogs,''
he says. ''You're going to be seeing more and more of skijoring.
And once you see it, winter will never be the same!''

FBI AGENT ACCUSED OF LYING IN BULGER CASE MAY LOSE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI AND SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An FBI agent accused of lying to investigators in the
ongoing probe of corruption in the bureau's relationships with
reputed mobsters James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi has been notified that the bureau wants him
fired, sources close to the probe said.
</P>
<P>
   If the FBI succeeds in dismissing Special Agent John Newton _
who has demanded a hearing at FBI headquarters in Washington on the
matter _ he would become the first agent fired in connection with
the misconduct probe.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, a 51-year-old former Green Beret, is a close friend of
former agent John Connolly, who was Bulger's and Flemmi's longtime
handler. At Connolly's urging, Newton joined the three men for
several secret meetings during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly was indicted last month for allegedly tipping off
Bulger and Flemmi, as well as reputed New England Mafia boss
Francis P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, to an impending racketeering
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Newton declined to comment Tuesday. A Boston FBI spokesman, Jay
Grant, said only that Newton was ``still an agent of the FBI,'' but
that he could not discuss any further disciplinary matters.
</P>
<P>
   During lengthy court hearings in 1998 in a separate federal
racketeering case against Flemmi, Bulger, Salemme, and others, an
assistant US attorney accused Newton of lying under oath to protect
Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly reportedly has been placed on leave by Boston Edison,
where he has worked as an executive since leaving the FBI in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Newton testified in 1998 that Connolly told him in late January
of 1995 that Bulger and Flemmi had been given permission to commit
any crime short of murder by former FBI Organized Crime Squad
supervisor John Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Connolly) said it (the rackteering case) was going to be a
mess,'' Newton testified. ``He said John Morris at the get-go gave
these guys the okay to do everything short of murder, or clipping
someone, whatever the terminology was. He said our office was
familiar with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney Fred Wyshak, however, accused Newton of
changing his testimony. Wyshak said Newton told investigators from
the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility that the
conversation with Connolly took place in 1997 _ after Flemmi had
admitted that he was an informant and began contending that the FBI
had given him immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak accused Newton of protecting Connolly, who was trying to
build a ``cooperative defense'' with Flemmi, his longtime source.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought that John Connolly did a good job when he was an
agent, didn't you?'' Wyshak asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, I did,'' Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't you think that now all his good work is being
tarnished?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And isn't that why you're in here trying to protect him?''
Wyshak asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is not,'' Newton replied.
</P>
<P>
   Newton also drew the ire of prosecutors and the federal judge
presiding over the case, Mark L. Wolf, for not telling agents about
the alleged extortion of South Boston real estate agent Raymond
Slinger by Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Newton was also questioned by investigators about accusations
made against him in 1989 by convicted marijuana smuggler Joseph
Murray. Murray, who volunteered to cooperate against Bulger and
Flemmi, told FBI agents that Connolly and Newton ``were selling
information regarding wiretaps to Whitey Bulger and Stevie
Flemmi.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents who interviewed Murray dismissed the allegations as
``rumor and conjecture on the part of Murray and others.'' Newton
reportedly also denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Newton's colleagues are said to be unhappy with the
bureau's move to oust him. ``They think he is being hung out to dry
because of the furor over Bulger and Flemmi,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, a 20-year bureau veteran, was reportedly on thin ice at
the FBI since being caught taking a rack of deer antlers from
convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski's Montana cabin as a
souvenir.

TOP AIDE ALLEGEDLY MET WITH FUGITIVE MOBSTER 
</HEADLINE>

 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fugitive South Boston crime boss James ``Whitey''
Bulger and his trusted associate Kevin Weeks have secretly met
since Bulger went on the lam and were even together when Bulger
made a threatening call to an FBI agent, according to sources
familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With Weeks now cooperating against Bulger, investigators are
hopeful that he may help nab the gangster who has eluded them for
five years despite a $250,000 reward for his capture and his
elevation to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Bulger first fled the area, he occasionally stayed
at the Long Island home of Weeks's relatives in Selden, N.Y., and
had mail sent to him there. Bulger also listed that address on a
New York driver's license that bore Bulger's photograph under an
alias, Thomas Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows where Bulger is,'' said a source familiar with
the investigation. ``He can reach out to anybody he wants and tell
them to do what he wants to get done, but they can't reach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities say they believe that Weeks may know more
than anybody about how Bulger is surviving, where he has been, and
perhaps where the constant flow of cash he carries is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he could help,'' said another source, noting that Weeks
is believed to have remained in contact with Bulger over the past
five years while running the Bulger organization in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks, 43, of Quincy, offered to strike a deal with prosecutors
after his indictment last November on federal racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks says he was with Bulger on Oct. 13, 1995, when Bulger made
a threatening call to FBI supervisor John Morris at the FBI Academy
in Quantico, Va. Morris, who testified last year in federal court
with a grant of immunity, admitted to pocketing $7,000 in bribes
from Bulger, a longtime FBI informant, during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Morris recounted how Bulger called him nine months after he had
fled the Boston area to evade a January 1995 federal racketeering
indictment and warned, ``You took money from me and if I go to
jail, you're going to go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the FBI believed the call had been made from the Conley
freight terminal in South Boston, but Weeks asserts that the call
was placed from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit filed in Weeks's case alleges there is other
evidence showing that Weeks and Bulger have probably been in
contact while Bulger has been a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   During 1996, Bulger used prepaid calling cards to make calls to
physical therapy businesses in Boston, allegedly to contact Weeks,
according to the Massachusetts State Police affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Weeks led investigators to a gully alongside the
Southeast Expressway in the city's Dorchester section, where they
unearthed the remains of two men and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks identified the dead, who he said were killed by Bulger and
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, as IRA sympathizer John McIntyre,
accused bank robber Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett, and Deborah Hussey,
the daughter of Flemmi's longtime girlfriend. Barrett disappeared
in 1983; McIntyre and Hussey disappeared the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Now attorney Dennis J. Kelly, who represents Weeks, and
prosecutors assigned to the office of US Attorney Donald K. Stern
and Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin are negotiating a
possible deal with Weeks, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal with Weeks could lead to new charges against Bulger and
Flemmi, who already face separate federal racketeering indictments,
one returned in 1995 and the other last December. Also named in the
recent indictment is retired FBI Agent John J. Connolly Jr., the
longtime handler of Bulger and Flemmi, who is accused of protecting
them from prosecutions by tipping them to crimes and warning them
to flee on the eve of the 1995 indictment.

   WASHINGTON _ The stock market may be racing along on ``Internet
time,'' but many members of Congress still seem to set their pace
by an old-fashioned pocket watch attached to a long chain of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While new technologies are transforming the U.S. economy, many
lawmakers continue to focus on decades-old issues such as
protecting agricultural subsidies, imposing steel quotas and
preserving banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 535 members of Congress, only a few dozen have carved out
a reputation for understanding legislation important to
technology-driven companies. And those few who have become
technology-savvy are not widely dispersed geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers recognized by industry as tech leaders come from
just two states: California, home of Silicon Valley, and Virginia,
birthplace of America Online and many other Internet-driven
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But tech leadership may begin growing as Congress reconvenes
this year. Now courted by hordes of high-paid tech lobbyists and
eager to win the support of entrepreneurs making money and creating
jobs, more members of Congress are educating themselves on
tech-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Congress, regardless of party, are starting to
recognize how important technology is to the country,'' said Marc
Brailov, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
trade group. ``They know it has been driving the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more legislators will be paying attention once the
results of the 2000 census are revealed, predicted Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., who has witnessed the phenomenal growth in tech jobs
in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians ``are going to see that not a lot of people are
doing manual labor any more,'' Moran said. ``The census will help
us identify the sources of employment, and people (in Congress) are
going to realize they have more tech workers than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, technology-driven changes in the economy
have not been widely recognized by lawmakers, who often appear more
comfortable with 20th-century industries _ or even 19th-century
ones _ than with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 104 members of Congress continue to keep
alive the Steel Caucus, which tries to block foreign competition.
That's nearly as big as the informal Congressional Internet Caucus,
which tries to help legislators learn more about the online world.
</P>
<P>
   But the steel industry has nearly evaporated from the U.S.
economy. The combined market value of the nation's major steel
companies _ USX Steel Group Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and LTV
Corp. _ amounts to about $4 billion, while Yahoo!, just one
Internet-focused company, has a market value exceeding $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for devotion to venerable causes such as steel or
peanut subsidies is that lawmakers ``still envision their districts
as industrial or agricultural centers,'' Moran said. Even states
that have gained the most from the technology boom, such as
Massachusetts and Washington, do not have congressional delegations
that are recognized as tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, two lawmakers have become recognized as tech-friendly.
Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican, has pushed hard to raise the number
of special visas granted annually to foreign computer programmers,
engineers and other high-skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, has built
a tech reputation by creating a GOP ``e-contract'' with America. He
generally opposes government regulation of the Internet, as well as
taxes on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas delegation as a whole has not developed the depth
of knowledge on tech issues that the Virginians have. Rep. Bob
Goodlatte, R-Va., widely recognized as one of the most active
lawmakers on technology issues, said job growth is the reason that
he and other Virginia legislators have gotten so involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia is the new hot spot for technology,'' he said. By
showing entrepreneurs that his state has a tech-savvy set of
lawmakers, Goodlatte said he hopes to attract even more new
companies and wealth. ``I certainly think that the people whose
jobs are dependent on tech companies are glad to see we're working
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't other states getting as excited about New Economy
issues? The most frequently cited reasons for the lack of
enthusiasm among lawmakers for tech issues are age and professional
background. Legislators tend to be older and have educations in
law, not engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the Internet Caucus about four years ago,
(lawmakers) didn't have e-mail addresses or Web sites,'' Goodlatte
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is now moving beyond the basics of sending e-mail
and getting down to the difficult work of shaping laws for the new
economy, he added. He predicted that Congress will do so not by
creating any new structures, such as a Senate Technology Committee
on a par with the Senate Banking Committee, because the influence
of new technologies is too diffuse and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every committee is going to have to deal with these issues''
of how powerful technologies are transforming commerce, medicine,
communications and more, Goodlatte said. ``I don't think you could
devise a single committee that could handle all of it.''

   WASHINGTON _ The stock market may be racing along on ``Internet
time,'' but many members of Congress still seem to set their pace
by an old-fashioned pocket watch attached to a long chain of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While new technologies are transforming the U.S. economy, many
lawmakers continue to focus on decades-old issues such as
protecting agricultural subsidies, imposing steel quotas and
preserving banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 535 members of Congress, only a few dozen have carved out
a reputation for understanding legislation important to
technology-driven companies. And those few who have become
technology-savvy are not widely dispersed geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers recognized by industry as tech leaders come from
just two states: California, home of Silicon Valley, and Virginia,
birthplace of America Online and many other Internet-driven

UNDATED: critical data.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These theories are intuitively attractive, and they fit many
of the experiences we have,'' she said. ``But it is when something
is intuitive that you need to be most careful to have adequate
scientific controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Koss pointed out that although it is true that most rape
victims are young women, most rapists are 18 to 25, and it is more
than likely that they will find victims in their own age group. She
and other experts noted that a surprisingly large number of rape
victims are young children.
</P>
<P>
   She said that other work by evolutionary scientists supported
the notion that male violence toward women may have evolved partly
as a strategy for controlling access to reproductive partners, an
interpretation consistent with Ms. Brownmiller's observations.
``But there are also roles for many other influences at the
societal level, the institutional level, the family level, the peer
level and within the two individual people,'' Dr. Koss said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics objected to the authors' use of nonhuman examples
to buttress their case. ``We can't ask a female fish whether she
appears to resist bshe doesn't want to copulate or because
she is testing males for their fitness,'' Coyne said. ``But we can
ask a human female who has been raped if she participated
willingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally contentious are the authors' ideas about how women react
to rape. On the basis of a study in the 1970s by Thornhill and his
wife, Dr. Nancy W. Thornhill, they contend that young women suffer
more distress after being raped than do children or older women
past their reproductive years. This ``makes evolutionary sense,''
they say, because it is young women who risk being impregnated by
an undesirable mate.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Koss said that other studies indicated that the impact
of rape was far worse for elderly women than for younger women.
``They develop a much more pervasive fear of going out of their
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists applaud the efforts of Thornhill and
Palmer to refocus attention on rape as a sexual crime and to link
it to other evolutionary work on male and female sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Understood within the context of evolutionary theory, said Dr.
Neil Malamuth, professor of psychology at the University of
California at Los Angeles, the scientists' thesis ``is not as
preposterous as it might seem.'' While feminists like Ms.
Brownmiller perform an important service by focusing on the
violence and power components of rape, he said, ``there are aspects
of rape that really do have to do with sex.''

&HT;     ANOTHER CASE OF LOST FAITH IN THE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Write one column on the chaotic breakup of
somebody's marriage, and you'll have a hundred people calling the
next day, saying, ``You think that's scary? What'll you hear what
I'm going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, frankly, is why I won't write about the subject. One
reason I've been married 30 years to the same woman _ not the
biggest reason, by the way _ is that I know what heartbreaking
horror shows divorces can be. Also, while I'm sympathetic, was
anybody holding a Glock-9 to your head when you married this person
in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   This case, however, makes a specific point, and at a time when
it's particularly worth making. The woman is pretty, polished and
from a successful suburban Albany family. The husband is smooth,
sharp and pulls in a big bucks in business. The problem, according
to both the woman and a law enforcement figure I know who is
familiar with this case, is that the husband drinks too much and
suffers from a ferocious cocaine problem.
</P>
<P>
   After the woman took the kids and split, moving back in with her
parents, things got grim. The husband began calling Child
Protective Services, alleging abuse of the kids. Child Protective
Services takes no chances on this stuff. Twice they investigated,
determining each time that the charges were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the husband began calling the cops.
Repeatedly, he told them that his wife was phoning him, threatening
his life. She denied it, but the cops don't fool around with
complaints like this anymore. Cops in Connecticut once ignored such
accusations. They ended up with both a corpse and a huge lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   With no evidence other than the husband's statement, the cops
busted this woman anyway. The case was adjourned, and orders of
protection were issued all around.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept making complaints that she was threatening him, and
the cops busted her again. This time, they dragged her out of her
parents' house in handcuffs at 2 a.m. and before a boneheaded town
justice, who rather casually tossed her in jail until she coughed
up a hefty bail. Luckily, her family had a few grand around the
house and managed to spring her before daylight.
</P>
<P>
   This bust was on a felony charge _ on criminal contempt of court
for supposedly violating the protection order. Now, not only are
divorce lawyers involved, criminal lawyers are in the picture, too.
Also, the husband kept complaining to the cops, so now the woman
has been charged with a second felony, even though the only
evidence the cops had, again, was the husband's word.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that this woman is pushing 40 and has
never before had any contact with the criminal justice system. She
comes from comfortable circumstances and has always looked upon the
cops and courts as protectors, not persecutors. In this, she was
like about half of white Americans, who tell the Gallup
Organization that they give cops and courts high marks for
integrity and ethical standards. Only one-third of black Americans
feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this could happen to somebody like you,'' I asked her the
other day, ``what do you think it might be like for some unmarried
minority woman on welfare with a couple of out-of-wedlock kids?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shudder to think,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, a controversial trial starts in Albany. Four New
York City cops are charged in the shooting death of a West African
immigrant named Amadou Diallo. On a dark night in the Bronx not
quite a year ago, the cops were hunting a rapist. They approached
Diallo for questioning and apparently decided that he was reaching
for a gun. Diallo, a totally innocent man, turned out to have only
a wallet in his hand. The cops realized that only after they had
pumped 19 bullets into him.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, hundreds of demonstrators, overwhelmingly minority folks,
will be stomping around outside the Albany County Courthouse. Most
white people won't understand why.
</P>
<P>
   This woman will.

 MORE Y2K BUGS SURFACE; HOSPITALS, OFFICES AFFECTED 
C.2000 Asahi News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Y2K glitches caused computers at some government
offices, hospitals and even bicycle parking lots to spew out false
information at the beginning of the new year, according to recent
reports.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 cases in which computers recognized this year as 1900
were reported, including many glitches found in weather observation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The dates ``Heisei 88'' and ``Meiji 33'' appeared on official
government papers issued this year. Some hospital computers
miscalculated patients' ages, putting elderly patients in their
younger years. And data was lost at various facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The glitches, however, did not pose a threat to public security,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were able to correct most of the problems by hand. But
one case in the fire and emergency headquarters in Mikuni, Fukui
Prefecture, was so serious that technicians needed to change the
integrated circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of the cases was when older computers and
software designed to identify the year by the last two digits
interpreted 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   This triggered errors in logic as the date in these systems
suddenly flew back a century.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers went back to the Meiji Era (1868-1912), and
displayed this year as Meiji 33-the year in the Japanese calendar
100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other computers identified 2000 as ``Heisei 88.'' The Heisei Era
started in 1989 and the computers worked until 1999. But the
systems broke down when they interpreted the new year as the
``minus 88th year of the Heisei Era.''
</P>
<P>
   A travel center of Shikoku Railway Co. (JR Shikoku) sold seven
books of coupon tickets without noticing that its computer printed
the expiration date as ``January 88.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kamakura, the issue date of ``Heisei 88'' was printed on
residency certificates for non-Japanese. Some certificates had to
be rewritten by hand.
</P>
<P>
   And specialists were at a loss as to why some of the
malfunctions occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heisei 87, 98th month, 97th day'' was the issued date printed
on vehicle tax certificates in Ena, Gifu Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   In Hashimoto, Wakayama Prefecture, a sewage works device showed
the date ``90th month, 00th day of year 1899.''
</P>
<P>
   For some elderly people, the bug was a source of amusement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 75-year-old patient at Sapporo Medical College
Hospital was recognized as 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A device to measure bone density at a hospital in Tokushima
University's medical faculty subtracted 20 years from the patients'
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Other system breakdowns led to data loss.
</P>
<P>
   A noise-monitoring system around New Tokyo International Airport
at Narita lost all the data taken on Jan. 1 at eight monitoring
posts.
</P>
<P>
   A computer system at JR Sakaide Station in Kagawa Prefecture
malfunctioned, providing a New Year's bonus for bicycle users.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance gate did not work when users inserted their passes,
so parking was free until Jan. 3.

&HT;     LOW-FRILLS AIRLINE SEES COMPETITION IN THE AIR, ON THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Southwest Airlines is the kind of company that
makes for management lore: a savvy competitive strategy; tight cost
controls; and yet, a colorful workplace and legendary chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   It is the way the company has stayed in business while offering
lower fares than other airlines. Not that chief executive Herb
Kelleher considers other airlines the only transportation companies
to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand,'' he once told a shareholder, according
to a 1998 article in the trade journal Direct Marketing. ``We're
competing with ground transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Southwest has to be cheap _ and fast. It wants the
customers the other planes, trains and automobiles will leave
behind. And Southwest knows where to look for them and where not
to, according to spokeswoman Whitney Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest announced recently that it would add Albany as one of
its newest destination cities in the Northeast, beginning service
in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Albany International Airport and local officials, who earlier
this month toured the still-unopened $6.2 million terminal
expansion into which Southwest will move this spring, expect that
the airline's arrival will mean lower fares, more jobs and new
businesses for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest skips hub-controlled airports, where a dominant
airline sets the traffic patterns others must adhere to, Brewer
said. Hubs would decrease the flexibility in the flight
destinations Southwest could offer, and it would cause delays in
handling the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest wants to turn its planes around within 20 minutes for
maximum efficiency, Brewer said. ``We want to get our customers in
and out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It also holds down operating costs if arriving planes can be
unloaded, cleaned, refueled and prepared for takeoff in that time
frame, she said. ``We call it attacking the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the Dallas-based airline have created a culture
that doesn't try to hide the company's frugal ways. Employees are
encouraged to have fun, Brewer said, and so will often crack jokes
or sing during flights.
</P>
<P>
   And the company claims it works extra hard to keep customers
happy, even if they are paying low fares. For instance, an airline
executive told a trade publication about the time a Southwest
representative let a passenger, a diabetic, 87-year-old woman, stay
with her overnight after the passenger missed a connection, and the
times pilots help unload bags to keep the airline on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The company enjoys a good rapport with employees, who own 13
percent of the stock. While 85 percent of the work force is
unionized, there has never been a strike against Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is closely linked to its chief executive, who is
responsible for crafting a company culture that has kept the
airline successful. But that has raised questions about who would
follow the 67-year-old Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became even more pressing when Kelleher completed
treatment for prostate cancer late last year. But the company has
given no indications of its leadership plans.

MUSIC INDUSTRY EXPECTS MERGER TO ACCELERATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the music industry, the merger of America
Online and Time Warner has struck a chord. It promises to hasten
the coming of the day when music is distributed digitally through
the Internet rather than through record stores.
</P>
<P>
   But that chord doesn't sound the death knell of record stores
just yet. Many obstacles must be overcome before consumers
routinely download music instead of buying compact discs. And there
is a limit to how much one company _ even one as potentially
powerful as AOL Time Warner _ can influence the evolution of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The promise, of course, comes from the combination of AOL, the
world's largest Internet service provider, with Time Warner's
record company, one of the five giants that dominate the music
business. The merged company is expected to push music online more
aggressively than record companies alone have been doing. And AOL's
expertise in making the Internet easy to use could help make
Internet music downloading less daunting for novices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In combination we think we can help to set the agenda for the
industry,'' said Ted Leonsis, president of the AOL Interactive
Properties Group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, owning both content and distribution does not necessarily
give a company the ability to set an industry agenda. Sony bought a
movie studio after the defeat it suffered in the market with its
Betamax videocassette recorder. Yet Sony still lost a battle to set
standards for the DVD, the digital videodisc.
</P>
<P>
   Even how AOL and Warner Music Group will work together is not
clear. The simple model _ that AOL will become the big Internet
distribution and promotional arm of Warner Music _ has its
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis said that AOL will have to work with all record
companies, not just Warner, because consumers would be reluctant to
visit any site that offered only one brand. Besides, fans of a
particular singer or group ``typically don't know what label
they're on,'' said Andrea Fleming, vice president of corporate
marketing for Liquid Audio, an online music company.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music Group wants to deal with several online retailers,
said Paul Vidich, executive vice president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warner might benefit from special promotions on AOL or
from AOL's expertise in developing Internet services. Leonsis said,
for instance, that in the 1980s Warner Music took advantage of
music videos earlier than other record companies because its parent
company owned MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Vidich said Warner Music was already benefiting from a
cutting-edge image from its pending association with AOL. ``In the
last week at least two companies have come to us with ideas and
said Warner is now the perfect partner for them,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music, whose labels include Reprise, Elektra and
Atlantic, is perceived in the industry as having been less
aggressive than many of its peers in moving online.
</P>
<P>
   Vidich disputes that notion, saying the company has been
developing a comprehensive system for promoting and selling music
on the Web, including digital downloads, that it will introduce in
the middle of this year. Time Warner has stakes in three start-up
companies distributing music or music videos digitally and is also
becoming a part owner of CDNow, which sells compact discs from its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, moving onto the Internet is not Warner Music's biggest
challenge. The company has slipped from No. 1 to No. 4 in market
share over the last few years because it failed to develop many new
acts. It also lost or got rid of many experienced executives.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is already involved in Internet music through ownership of
Winamp, a program for downloading music, and Spinner, a Web radio
service. But it has not been perceived as a friend of the record
industry, because it has not been avid in fighting Internet piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been drawing people to their site using content
essentially as a loss leader,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association of America, which represents record
companies.
</P>
<P>
   She said Spinner had not yet started paying for the music it
transmits and that AOL initially opposed an Internet copyright
protection bill until a compromise was reached. Leonsis of AOL said
the company had always said that it would ``do the right thing'' on
copyrights but that the online world might be different from other
spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Now that AOL is becoming a big music owner, its attitude could
change. ``Now AOL has a multibillion-dollar stake in making sure
that intellectual property is respected on the Internet,'' said Ron
Stone, president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, a Los Angeles
company that manages such acts as Bonnie Raitt and Los Lobos.
``That's the best news out of this merger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, big music companies have moved only gingerly onto the
Internet. Forrester Research, a market research firm based in
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that sales of music through the
Internet this year will reach $1.3 billion, about 10 percent of
total domestic music sales. But virtually all of those online sales
will be of compact discs through electronic commerce sites like
Amazon.com. Only 4 percent of the $1.3 billion, or far less than 1
percent of overall music sales, will be distributed digitally
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of piracy is just one obstacle. Long transmission times
make it unwieldy to download an entire album using a standard
modem. And music companies have not figured out how to make the
business profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Geiger, chairman and chief executive of Artistdirect, an
online music company, said that the prices some companies are
charging to download a song, $1 to $2 or more, will probably prove
too high for consumers used to getting things free on the Internet.
He said music might best be offered as a subscription service, in
which consumers pay a monthly fee to have access to music on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that music is going to evolve into somewhat of a
service,'' said Geiger, whose company is partly owned by Warner and
other big record companies. ``Right now it's product only, except
for radio.''
</P>
<P>
   By going online too aggressively, the music industry could anger
its existing retailers and make its investment in compact-disc
plants obsolete. But executives say that as when CDs replaced vinyl
records, new formats generally increase the size of the overall
market and allow the industry to resell the same songs to existing
customers in the new format.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say electronic distribution is inevitable. AOL Time
Warner might lead the boats, but all will be swept up in the
current.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without the deal,'' said Danny Goldberg, president of
Artemis Records in New York, ``technology is going to change the
way music is delivered, just as it has in the past.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY HAS A LONG WISH LIST FOR CONGRESS THIS YEAR
 &HT;    With TECH-CONGRESS. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last year, Congress got beyond its partisan rancor
long enough to pass a number of laws sought by the nation's booming
high-tech companies. This year, the tech titans expect even more
out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On trade, taxes, visas, digital signatures and many other
issues, the owners of technology-driven companies will be pushing
for far-reaching bills when the 106th Congress reconvenes Monday.
With lawmakers planning to recess in late July to attend political
party conventions and launch re-election campaigns, the pressure to
get bills passed early in the year will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say, 'OK, this is a short year, so let's just
put these bills in a drawer,' `` said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.,
co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus. Rather than dismiss
2000 as a do-nothing election year, tech supporters will ``be
pushing every step of the way,'' he said. ``You have to build
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, technology-related issues were not particularly hot
topics in Washington, both because most lawmakers were unfamiliar
with the Internet and because many tech entrepreneurs were too busy
making money to care about politics.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web has woven itself into the workplaces and homes of
tens of millions of Americans, tech legislative issues have shot to
the top of the agenda on the Hill. And in places like Austin, Palo
Alto, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta and Northern Virginia, entrepreneurs
now realize their fortunes may be determined in large part by
Congress's action or lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   With tech companies hiring lobbyists at a frantic pace and
lawmakers eagerly listening to them, bills have been moving along
in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion. In less than two years, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to
impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic commerce,
increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled immigrants,
limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related software
flaws, and extend copyright protections to material published on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the tech agenda is even more aggressive. Of course,
electronic-commerce companies, chip makers and other sectors of the
diverse high-tech business community have different priorities, but
companies propelled by new technologies generally want lawmakers to
help them by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, high-tech products have been the leading U.S.
exports. To increase growth, computer makers, chip manufacturers,
software developers and others want greater access to foreign
markets, especially China.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies want Congress to grant permanent normal trade
relations status to China. That's not a simple matter in an
election year because labor unions, a core Democrat constituency,
oppose expanded trade. So do some conservatives who believe China
never lives up to its agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also are demanding that government further loosen
controls on the export of high-performance computers. Again, this
is a touchy issue because many legislators fear that equipment
vital to our national security will end up illegally in the hands
of Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the pool of highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are desperate for more engineers and programmers. They
want Congress to increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas
used by companies and universities to hire foreign workers with
specialized skills. Industry was successful in boosting the visa
level two years ago, but opposition from labor unions will be stiff
in this election year. Anti-immigration Republicans may oppose the
visa increase as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tech employers also want the government to bolster U.S. schools
by providing development grants for teachers who want more computer
training and scholarships for students pursuing technology-related
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spurring research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Tech-driven entrepreneurs want a permanent extension of the
research and development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging the growth of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue is whether to allow state and local
governments to collect sales taxes from online purchases.
Currently, most shoppers pay no sales taxes on Internet purchases
because of a temporary tax moratorium imposed by Congress. But as
e-commerce grows, more mayors and governors are clamoring for the
right to collect sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This may be too hot of a potato for Congress to hold in an
election year, so the moratorium may be extended to bump the issue
into 2001. But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal opponent of
Internet taxes, could push for a permanent ban to attract attention
to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also want Congress to move on a number of other
issues, such as approving the use of electronic signatures to allow
more business dealings over the Internet, and settling a number of
thorny privacy issues involving transfers of financial data and
medical records.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    HIGH-TECH ECONOMY BENEATH THE NOTICE OF MANY IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    With TECH-AGENDA and TECH-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market may be racing along on ``Internet
time,'' but many members of Congress still seem to set their pace
by an old-fashioned pocket watch attached to a long chain of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While new technologies are transforming the U.S. economy, many
lawmakers continue to focus on decades-old issues such as
protecting agricultural subsidies, imposing steel quotas and
preserving banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 535 members of Congress, only a few dozen have carved out
a reputation for understanding legislation important to
technology-driven companies. And those few who have become
technology-savvy are not widely dispersed geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers recognized by industry as tech leaders come from
just two states: California, home of Silicon Valley, and Virginia,
birthplace of America Online and many other Internet-driven
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But tech leadership may begin growing as Congress reconvenes
this year. Now courted by hordes of high-paid tech lobbyists and
eager to win the support of entrepreneurs making money and creating
jobs, more members of Congress are educating themselves on
tech-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Congress, regardless of party, are starting to
recognize how important technology is to the country,'' said Marc
Brailov, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
trade group. ``They know it has been driving the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more legislators will be paying attention once the
results of the 2000 census are revealed, predicted Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., who has witnessed the phenomenal growth in tech jobs
in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians ``are going to see that not a lot of people are
doing manual labor any more,'' Moran said. ``The census will help
us identify the sources of employment, and people (in Congress) are
going to realize they have more tech workers than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, technology-driven changes in the economy
have not been widely recognized by lawmakers, who often appear more
comfortable with 20th-century industries _ or even 19th-century
ones _ than with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 104 members of Congress continue to keep
alive the Steel Caucus, which tries to block foreign competition.
That's about the size of the informal Congressional Internet
Caucus, which tries to help legislators learn more about the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the steel industry has nearly evaporated from the U.S.
economy. The combined market value of the nation's top steel
companies _ USX Steel Group Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and LTV
Corp. _ amounts to about $4 billion, while Yahoo!, just one
Internet-focused company, has a market value exceeding $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for devotion to venerable causes such as steel or
peanut subsidies is that lawmakers ``still envision their districts
as industrial or agricultural centers,'' Moran said. Even states
that have gained the most from the technology boom, such as Texas,
Massachusetts and Washington, do not have congressional delegations
that are recognized as tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently cited reasons for the lack of enthusiasm
among lawmakers for tech issues are age and professional
background. Legislators tend to be older and have educations in
law, not engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the Internet Caucus about four years ago,
(lawmakers) didn't have e-mail addresses or Web sites,'' said Rep.
Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. That has changed, with virtually all
legislators having some online presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable
lawmakers on technology issues, said Congress is now moving beyond
the basics of sending e-mail and getting down to the difficult work
of shaping laws for the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Congress will do so not by creating any new
structures, such as a Senate Technology Committee on a par with the
Senate Banking Committee, because the influence of new technologies
is too diffuse and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every committee is going to have to deal with these issues''
of how powerful technologies are transforming commerce, medicine,
cations and more, Goodlatte said. ``I don't think you could
devise a single committee that could handle all of it.''

A DIM VIEW OF THE ECLIPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently, the 1999 racing season ended June 5. That was the
day Charismatic broke down in the Belmont Stakes while attempting
to win the Triple Crown. The final six months of the season must
have been run just for fun, because Monday night Charismatic was
named Horse of the Year, an award he earned while in the recovery
shed.
</P>
<P>
   Eclipse Award voting is done by three blocs: the Daily Racing
Form, the National Turf Writers Association, and the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association, which represents the tracks.
Charismatic was the choice over Daylami, an international grass
star and the true Horse of the Year, on two of those three ballots.
Charismatic won the Racing Form vote, 13-10, and the writers' vote,
37.5-19.5. Daylami won the NTRA vote, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those who voted for Charismatic didn't fully comprehend
that he lost, not won, the Triple Crown in the Belmont, as did Real
Quiet and Silver Charm in the two years before him. Were Real Quiet
and Silver Charm voted Horse of the Year? Why, no, and they were
both easily better than Charismatic. A former $62,500 claimer,
Charismatic won 4 of 10 starts last year. A batting average of .400
is great for Ted Williams, but not for a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Daylami ran only once in the United States, winning the
Breeders' Cup Turf with ease, which made ``The Horse of the World''
eligible. If he was eligible, he should have won. Charismatic
doesn't even breathe the same air as Daylami. If you were a
breeder, whom would you rather own? Charismatic's victory was
parochialism at its worst. America, good; Europe, bad. Dirt, good;
turf, bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to change the Eclipse voting and give the fans a say.
The pros have gotten it wrong two of the last three years, with
fraudulent 2-year-old Favorite Trick winning over Skip Away in 1997
even a bigger joke than this. And to think the elites in the NTWA
don't want to give the bettors a ballot. How could it get any
worse?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at how the voting went in the other categories:
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Colt: Anees won all three blocs. Anees was so
impressive in coming from behind to win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
that he deserved the award. This voter considered Greenwood Lake,
winner of the Champagne and Remsen, long and hard. That Greenwood
Lake ran so poorly (sixth) in his 3-year-old debut at Gulfsteam
Satruday makes a vote for Anees look even better.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old filly: Chilukki was another unanimous and deserving
winner. Her record of 7-6-1-0, with the loss in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile Fillies, speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old colt: Charismatic was unanimous, as well he
should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old filly: Silverbulletday. With a record of
11-8-1-0, she received all but one split vote in the overall
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Handicap horse: Victory Gallop, by 25-24 from the Racing Form
and 18-8 from the NTRA, beat Behrens, 2-1. The writers went for
Behrens, 64-56. The vote here went to Behrens, but Victory Gallop
was given serious consideration. Behrens went 9-4-4-0 but hurt
himself badly with a sorry performance (seventh) in the Breeders'
Cup Classic. Victory Gallop was 3 for 3 in this country (losing
only in Dubai), and beat Behrens by a nose in their only meeting,
but Victory Gallop was done Aug. 1. There are no complaints here
with a vote for Victory Gallop, who, overall, was a better horse.
</P>
<P>
   Handicap Filly or Mare: Beautiful Pleasure. She was sensational
winning her final three starts, including the Breeders' Cup
Distaff, and the vote was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinter: Artax. He was terrific on his best days, and was
another unanimous selection.
</P>
<P>
   Male Turf: Daylami. Unanimous. A no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Female Turf: Soaring Softly. With a mark of 8-7-0-0, including a
triumph in the inaugural Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf, she
earned a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   Steeplechase: Lonesome Glory. A steeplechase legend, but he ran
only twice last year before breaking down in April. He was a
unanimous winner by blocs, but the vote here went to Ninepins, who
took the Breeders' Cup Grand National and Colonial Cup. The
Lonesome Glory backers must have voted from memory in what was
another head-scratcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the human categories, Frank Stronach was top owner; Bob
Baffert best trainer; Jorge Chavez outstanding rider, and Ariel
Smith top apprentice rider. The votes here went to all four
winners. Stronach, whose horses earned more than $6 million, and
Smith, who was a standout in New York, were unanimous choices.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert beat D. Wayne Lukas, 2-1, winning 30.5-17.5 from the
Racing Form and 14-8 from the NTRA. Lukas took the NTWA vote,
62.5-59.5. Baffert was embarrassed at the Breeders' Cup, going 0
for 8, but had a great season, with his charges earning $16
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who moved into the highest echelon, beat Jerry Bailey,
who had won the two previous years, 2-1. Chavez won the NTWA vote,
50-42, and the NTRA vote, 11-9. Bailey took the DRF ballot, 22-20.
The outcome provides some well-earned recognition for Chavez, who,
until now, had been underappreciated.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Late to the game, Apple adds series of Net-based services
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple announced a dizzying number of new initiatives
at the recent MacWorld Expo in San Francisco. It's no wonder some
got lost in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at one in particular that, although it received
little attention, is very important to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative is called iTools, and it's an effort to raise
Apple's profile and usefulness on the Internet. In essence, iTools
is a collection of six free Internet-based consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   The services include electronic mail, a database of ``kid-safe''
Web sites, file storage, and space to build and maintain a Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   None of these services is unique. If anything, Apple is late to
the game in offering them. Many other sites, including Microsoft's,
are offering all or more of these services.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, though, Apple can distinguish itself by how well it
executes Internet-based services. At first glance they certainly
look classy.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat when it comes to using them right away. A
user must have Apple's latest operating system, OS 9. Other
operating systems won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find iTools as a tab on Apple's redesigned Web page. The
new design features a platinum look similar to that of the
company's operating system. Along the top of the page is a series
of tabs. Click on the one named iTools, and you'll go to a page
that briefly describes each of the four services and asks you to
register in order to use any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in brief, is a description of each of the new services:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mac.com: You can now send and receive e-mail through Apple's
Web site. It works pretty much like the other such services on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ KidSafe: Apple has built a database of 55,000 sites it has
tested for appropriateness for kids. Signing onto KidSafe blocks
you from going to any other sites. It works in the reverse manner
of a filter. Instead of filtering out sites, it simply offers safe
ones. The site does filter incoming e-mail, chat room
correspondence and online games for inappropriate language and
images.
</P>
<P>
   _ IDisk: This service provides 20 megabytes to users. That is
not a lot, but it is free. It's also accessible from wherever you
access the Internet. IDisk also lets you share and export files and
images with others. You could, for example, store a picture of your
family and then copy it into an electronic card to send to friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home page: With this service you can build and maintain a
personal Web page.
</P>
<P>
   _ ICards: This where you can import photos from iDisk and create
electronic cards to send through the Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ IReview: This is a separate page where members of iTools can
post and read reviews of various products, Web pages and services.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Counties go dot-com
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two things bug Bryan Mundy: paper and lines.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as CheckFree are using the Internet to make the
bill-paying process check-free. Online banking software firms like
S1 want to thin the Friday afternoon line at the bank. Both
companies are trying to convince others to think of the Internet as
the main medium for doing business.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has done the same for government in any substantial
way. Mundy's company, Ezgov.com, which was started in May, hopes to
make a business out of cutting red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is catching on. In the next few weeks, the 8-month-old
firm plans to close on a second round of venture capital funding,
between $25 million and $30 million. Ezgov.com would not say who
the investors will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I see mail or paper or people standing in line, it
makes my skin crawl because there's no reason for it,'' said Mundy,
Ezgov.com's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government on the Internet is so wide-open. People are buying
books and airline tickets online. But no one is offering government
services,'' he said. ``Twenty years from now, all these things will
be done over the Internet. Someone's going to take us from now to
there, and we think we can be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based firm has signed deals with local governments,
including DeKalb County and Clarke County/Athens, as well as with
Riverside County, Calif., and Brazoria County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, DeKalb residents have been able to pay property
taxes and research deeds through EzGov.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Ezgov.com is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   IBM helped Arizona's Department of Motor Vehicles. A few
paper-based records management companies _ SDR Technologies and
National Information Consortium _ have shifted their business
models to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A few start-ups also have attracted venture capital recently.
</P>
<P>
   Link2gov.com, a Florida company backed in part by Atlanta-based
iXL Enterprises, received $7.5 million last spring, including money
from GE Capital Partners and Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Link2Gov.com, formerly Transsport.com, is automating some of
Washington, D.C.'s transactions, including vehicle registration
and, soon, parking ticket payments. The firm already offers the
ability to register for Georgia hunting and fishing licenses
online. The company expects to announce the ability to pay Mobile,
Ala., parking tickets online soon, said Joe Jones, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Govworks.com, a New York-based firm, said it received a $19
million second round of venture capital in November. The firm
offers the chance to pay parking tickets and other local government
bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com was started in May by Mundy, 35, and Ed Trimble, a
31-year-old formerly with Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 60 people working out of the same building
that, after renovation, will be the home of the new EarthLink
(following its merger with MindSpring).
</P>
<P>
   At Andersen, Trimble worked with clients such as Delta Air Lines
and MCI. In 1996, Trimble left to start InterArch Technologies,
which developed electronic-commerce applications. Mundy worked for
TicketMaster/CitySearch before joining Trimble at InterArch.
</P>
<P>
   Before investing more than $80,000 of their own money to get
Ezgov.com started, Trimble and Mundy researched the issue. They
said they asked people standing in line waiting to get their
vehicle tags renewed if they would rather be doing it from their
den.
</P>
<P>
   Then they talked to the people who run government agencies.
DeKalb County was the first to go online last fall.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb saw the service as a way to become more efficient and cut
car pollution by reducing the number of people driving to a county
office to research property records or pay taxes, said Liane
Levetan, DeKalb chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Levetan said the county is considering offering the ability to
renew vehicle tags and pay water and sanitation bills and parking
tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely elated,'' Levetan said. ``The possibilities are
unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com also has attracted some big names. The board of
directors includes former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, former
Congressman Jack Kemp and Zell Miller, former governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 67, has taken several board seats since retiring as
governor in 1999, including Georgia Power and Post Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com is his first high-technology start-up. Miller said he
was offered the chance to be on the board of two high-technology
start-ups when he first left office. He passed on them and later
regretted it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very high-tech person. I still have a hard time
sending e-mail,'' Miller said. ``But this one seemed to be the
perfect fit of where some of my knowledge and experience was.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller met with Trimble and Mundy at the Willard Hotel in
Washington last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were really on to something,'' he said. ``I
never met a county official who didn't want to do something to make
it easier for his constituents. And I never met a constituent that
didn't want something made easier. I think it would be appealing
for everyone.''

A MIXING BOWL OF JOB SEEKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Sport's biggest job mart is in full swing here on
the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the Senior Bowl is a game in which the best college
seniors gather to showcase their talents for an armada of more than
600 NFL scouts, personnel directors, and coaches, but the real
reason everyone is here is for jobs. To fill them or to find them.
</P>
<P>
   The players are here to convince at least one NFL team to give
them an opportunity and, perhaps, a million or two dollars. The
scouts, coaches, and personnel directors are here to watch the
players practice, weigh them, measure them, evaluate them, and, in
some cases, make decisions about whether to hire them in April when
the draft is held.
</P>
<P>
   But there is at least as much job seeking on the sidelines as on
the field, because it is there that new coaches seek new assistants
and unemployed coaches seek out the new coaches to become their
assistants, while barely-employed coaches, such as the bulk of the
Patriots' staff, seek to avoid becoming utterly-unemployed coaches
by becoming newly-employed coaches somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   If this is confusing to you, you should try being one of those
poor guys.
</P>
<P>
   Circling all of these people like sharks are men in tasseled
loafers or $100 sneakers, Armani suits or sweatsuits. All come
attached to cell phones. They are the agents for many of these men
or are trying to become the agents for many of these men. They are
here to sell themselves or their clients or both.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's not the most comfortable scene for a lot of the
people involved, and hence it is a churning well of rumors. The
hottest Tuesday was that ex-Patriots coach Pete Carroll will be
named the Green Bay Packers' defensive coordinator. The source of
this was a reliable former associate of Carroll's, although he
prefaced his pronouncement by saying, ``Check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Packers boss Ron Wolf been in Mobile, that wouldn't have
been difficult, but he was in Green Bay telling a writer,
``Absolutely not,'' when asked if he would consider hiring Carroll
or Willie Shaw, the ex-Raider defensive coordinator. This did not
convince the writer that Wolf had not already hired Carroll,
however, because splitting a hair is one thing the best NFL
executives master early in their careers. Wolf could later argue
that he didn't have to consider it if he'd already done it.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the rumor that he would be the Packers' defensive
coordinator and Marty Mornhinweg would be offensive coordinator was
sweeping through Mobile and around the NFL despite Wolf's denial.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Patriots owner Bob Kraft would like it to be true,
since that would take him off the hook for at least a portion of
what he owes Carroll for the next two years, but it will be at
least another day before it is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Patriot assistant Al Groh appeared to be
functioning as the Jets' head coach in Mobile even though they have
yet to name one.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue would
announce a ruling Wednesday to let Bill Belichick's contract stand
and then reluctantly try to broker a deal that will allow Belichick
to come to New England.
</P>
<P>
   If he comes _ and that is what the Patriots want, because they
have no real Plan B _ Belichick will very likely bring Charlie Weis
with him as offensive coordinator. Weis stunned the Jets when he
testified in support of Belichick's argument that his contract was
no longer valid. He was not a hostile witness, as some have
reported, but in fact aided Belichick's escape effort and now is
praying that Belichick will return the favor if he ends up running
the Patriots for around $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Senior Bowl, much of the Patriot staff is trying to
do its job but finds itself more fixated on looking for work. Thus
far, only defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell has landed a job,
with the Seahawks. Initially, the Patriots refused to grant Seattle
permission to talk with Sidwell but reconsidered when it was
pointed out that Belichick might come in and fire everyone, so it
would be unfair to block him from going to another team with no
assurance that he would have a job in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the coaches are waiting to see who is hired in
New Orleans and Dallas and Miami as well as in New England and New
York and whether those hirings will produce opportunities. Of
course, men on those other staffs are also here angling for work,
as were more than a few deposed front office executives, so this
was a Quik Copy bonanza day grinding out resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on this side of it before,'' said Bill
Kuharich, who was fired two weeks ago in New Orleans as club
president and general manager eight months after his contract had
been extended two years. ``I've been in New Orleans for 14 years so
I've never experienced this side of it but I've always had nothing
but sympathy and respect for the guys who would come here looking
for a new job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's one of them and he is rumored to be a candidate in
Pittsburgh to replace deposed Tom Donohue, who auditioned for the
Saints' job Tuesday in New York, was rumored to be headed to New
England this week and then will Miami Thursday, where many feel he
will ultimately go to join with old friend Dave Wannstadt and run
his personnel operation. If so, Saints' scout Tom Marino also could
be in the running in Pittsburgh, which has reportedly received
permission from the Saints to talk with him, although Marino has
been contacted by no one in Mobile or on his mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, word is long-time Cowboy assistants Dave Campo or Joe
Avezzano will end up as the new head coach in Dallas with an Ernie
Zampese clone coming in to coordinate the offense. So why not the
real Ernie instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't think that will happen,'' Zampese said. ``I don't
konw if I want to go through this again. I might just want to be a
consultant for a year and then maybe just a position coach. You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed you don't. At least not in Mobile on a Tuesday night when
the entire Saints' staff is looking for work after having been let
go while those in New England, Dallas, Miami, Green Bay and the
Jets don't know what to do because they haven't been fired yet but
haven't been hired yet either because a new man could sweep them
all out today, tomorrow or whenever.
</P>
<P>
   That's why everyone here is looking. Looking at future players
and for future jobs...not necessarily in that order.
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Merger fallout uncertain
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past week, all the pundits and analysts have
been busy trying to figure out how the AOL-Time Warner merger will
change our lives, raise our cable rates, increase the hole in the
ozone or help the Cubs win the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to talk about the potential of this new
enterprise and the role TV/Internet guru Bob Pittman, AOL's
president, could have on the digital music revolution as well as
broadband content development, but the results of the deal remain
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, I'd like to ``take a moment'' as they say on ``Ally
McBeal'' and remember that AOL and Time Warner have been
insinuating themselves into our lives long before Steve Case, Ted
Turner and Gerald Levin were all smiling and clapping in front of
the scariest pile of media logos ever collected in one place.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished college, I went to work for Little, Brown &AMP;
Co.'s college textbook division. It was fun for a while, but I soon
discovered all the disparaging things GenX author Jay McInerney
said about low-level publishing jobs were true, and I decided to
move on. I resigned on Monday, and on Wednesday employees were told
that the company would merge with motion picture giant Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction at the staid Boston publishing house was one of
sheer horror. Editors were stuffing their resumes into fax machines
faster than you could say ``Bugs Bunny.'' The very idea that the
company founded by Henry Luce, which published such venerable
magazines as Time and Life and had such noted talents as Norman
Mailer, Ellen Gilchrist and Ansel Adams, was going to join up with
a movie studio was just appalling.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, a wonderful editor named Alex, just shook his head and
murmured, ``The writing was right there on the wall, and I wasn't
wearing my glasses.'' The new Time Warner divested its textbook
division and a few other moldy properties and continued its march
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to New York City about the time America Online was
gaining mainstream popularity. It was also the subject of much
ridicule for its ``carpet bombing'' marketing technique for
packaging AOL diskettes in everything except cans of Campbell's
soup.
</P>
<P>
   My boss had a box of AOL diskettes under his desk, which he
collected from all over the place. It was a great curiosity, and
people loved to look at all the versions and types and colors of
AOL disks that were actually in circulation. Marc was devastated
when the janitorial staff mistook his collection for trash. I
suspect ``Antiques Road Show'' would probably be interested in that
box now.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, people liked AOL, even the Web geeks who usually
had another Internet provider to get them out to the Web. (AOL
hadn't done any of its famous deals with Netscape or Microsoft
yet.) Every month founder Steve Case would write a letter to
members that would be featured prominently on the AOL welcome
screen, and people read them.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about ``Steve'' like they knew him. The service had
only 4 million or 5 million members then. People were known to have
actual conversations online without being accosted by potential
child molesters, credit card thieves or rowdy teens with stupid
screen names.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, AOL went to a flat-rate pricing plan that was
novel in the industry. The crush of subscribers who logged on for
hours on end just because they could nearly brought the system to
its knees. People were livid. They were doing everything from
circulating online petitions to e-mailing Steve Case personally to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   You see, back in 1997, millions of people thought they could
just drop a note to Steve, and that he might read it and actually
do something. Usually what you got back was a form letter, but
still it was something.
</P>
<P>
   AOL had the knack of making millions of people all feel like
part of one big happy but slightly dysfunctional family. I actually
know several couples who met on AOL and not in a romance chat room,
either. A group of people used to meet every Sunday night to talk
about alternative rock music, and I never missed a week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also sponsored a moderated book chat that was
one of the best book groups I've ever dropped in on. AOL connected
people, almost in the same way the pictures from the old Life
magazine used to, which is one reason all the pundits say this
merger makes so much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually AOL's troubles led Case to television to convince
users that the dial-up debacle would never happen ever, ever again.
Nevertheless, he threw the door wide open for upstarts like
MindSpring, EarthLink, AT&AMP;T's WorldNet and a host of other Internet
service providers to offer Net access without endless busy signals
and mail server crashes and with customer service people who might
actually help you.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, people stayed loyal to AOL. The service continued
to grow and develop into something that not just first-time Net
users but seasoned and cynical veterans might like, with
innovations in Web access, electronic commerce and instant
messaging across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the start of the 21st century, AOL, the online service
I've been using since I got my first PC, is merging with Time
Warner, the company I was working for when I got my first PC. AOL
Time Warner has grown from being a print publisher to a movie,
cable, news, sports, music and now Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too big? Who knows? Probably, but I still remember when
people thought that Time magazine and Warner music and CNN all
being owned by the same company was unthinkable. I wonder how much
they'll want for a piece of Microsoft?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Search engines: Underpowered, oil-leaking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We wanted to come up with lots of reasons why
the creation of the Internet search engine has made our lives
simpler, more efficient and easier to pursue as we look for help
navigating the Web. But after looking for evidence on the Net and
getting back search results like ``Hot Blondes want to talk to YOU
_ XXX!'' and links to personal home pages for engineers in
Istanbul, we reversed our position.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the NEC Research Institute in
Princeton, N.J., found even the largest search engines only cover
about one-sixth of what's on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And we would argue that it's not even the correct one-sixth.
</P>
<P>
   What caused such a mess? Much like the Titanic, it was the
result of hubris: While a few search engines, such as Yahoo!, use
humans to catalog Web sites into the correct categories and
indexes, most sites tried to do the same by creating ``smart''
software that did it automatically. The result? Thousands of
irrelevant results on the simplest of requests.
</P>
<P>
   So, all you incompetent, frustrating search engines out there _
we have one last search request for you: ``Get bent.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Take care of calls with CyberGenie
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One of the things that separates big companies
from little companies is that big companies often have assistants
to answer calls and forward messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cygnion Corp. has introduced a device that turns the small
business owner's personal computer into a personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberGenie PC Cordless Phone System directs incoming calls
to as many as 20 different users, forwards calls to outside phones
and notifies users when e-mails and faxes have arrived. And instead
of forcing callers to push buttons, the CyberGenie recognizes
spoken commands.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie won an Innovation Award as one of the best new
devices exhibited at the International Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas earlier this month. It is scheduled to start arriving in
CompUSA, Office Depot and other stores by February.
</P>
<P>
   The basic CyberGenie system will sell for $499 and comes with a
2.4GHz digital spread spectrum base station, one cordless handset
and a software disk. It connects to a personal computer through a
USB port and connects to the phone system through standard phone
jacks.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie is designed to work in homes and small businesses
with two incoming phone lines. Users can buy up to nine extra
cordless handset and charger units for $129 each.
</P>
<P>
   The system can set up 20 voice mail boxes, and callers reach
their parties simply by speaking their names or dialing their
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie gives its users remote access to e-mail messages and
faxes. The users call into the system, and CyberGenie uses voice
simulation software to read e-mail and faxes over the phone. The
system also offers other phone system features such as conference
calls and calls between handsets within the office.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on CyberGenie you can visit
www.cygnion.com online or call (877) 438-4364 (GET-GENIE).

NEW ENGLAND FIRMS BUILDING A BETTER NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's no secret the explosive growth of the Internet has
helped create an information highway that carries ever-increasing
amounts of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the cloverleafs, ramps, and automated toll booths that
link and modernize the system.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of technology, based on fiber-optic
communications, is being developed to speed and increase the flow
of traffic on the Net and to soup up services to users of the
information highway.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``optical networking,'' the hardware and software are
being developed by dozens of upstart telecommunications companies.
Many of them are in Massachusetts, which has become the epicenter
for optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young companies are saying, `How do we not stall the
growth of the Internet?' So they are on the bleeding edge of the
technology, thinking several years ahead to get a leg up over
competitors,'' said Andrew Cray, senior analyst at Aberdeen Group
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optic technology isn't entirely new: cables containing
hair-thin glass strands that use pulses of light, instead of
electrical pulses, have increasingly replaced copper wires to form
the backbone of the nation's communications network.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new wave of fiber-optic equipment that transmits
huge amounts of data at phenomenal speeds _ comparable to
sophisticated toll booths and on-off ramps _ along with new
software services. This new infrastructure promises to make
Internet communications faster, cheaper, and better.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, optical networking has taken on a buzz. Take the example
of Sycamore Networks Inc. of Chelmsford, best known for its
dizzying stock market valuation _ $20.5 billion as of Tuesday.
Sycamore developed a powerful optical switch that allows phone
carriers to offer the latest fiber-optic technology to corporate
customers quickly and less expensively. The company went public in
October at $38 a share and saw its stock surge to 328 in late
December. It closed Tuesday at 259 15/16, down 8 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   With Sycamore serving as a model, a bevy of other start-ups has
sprung up locally. Unlike Silicon Valley, home to some of the major
telecommunications giants, Greater Boston and parts of southern New
Hampshire are considered the leading centers for optical
networking, followed by Northern California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled along Interstate 495 are nearly a dozen optical
networking start-ups backed by venture capital, mostly formed in
the last 22 months. Many of the leaders of these companies and
their employees have come from Bell Laboratories, Lincoln
Laboratories, and Cascade Communications Inc. of Westford, the
high-speed switching company that enjoyed a meteoric rise in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the optical start-ups, who have yet to sell products and
services commercially, are targeting phone carriers and service
providers, who in turn sell to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the management and talent running these
optical start-ups in Massachusetts, you see their infrastructure
expertise in building systems and reliable networks for telephone
carriers,'' said David E. Schantz, general partner at Matrix
Partners, a local venture firm that has funded several optical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have this level of experience in Silicon Valley,
which is why the pendulum in the next generation of optical
networking has swung eastward to New England.''
</P>
<P>
   The new companies are developing products and services that
complement Sycamore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's infrastructure is built on voice telephone calls, and
while it has changed to handle data, optical networking is starting
differently _ with no choke points. You can have a mind-boggling
10,000 lanes with automated tolls,'' said Desh Deshpande, Sycamore
chairman and founder.
</P>
<P>
   To speed adoption of the new technology, Sycamore announced last
week that 50 optical networking equipment makers and long-distance
carriers will promote universal technical standards, creating a
sort of ``optical dial tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Plugging into Sycamore switches are a host of complementary
companies with names like Coriolis Networks, Appian Communications,
and Quantum Bridge Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little bit of the land-rush scramble going on,
where entrepreneurs see opportunities (in selling to) long-distance
carriers who want to offer corporate customers more capacity for
their Internet traffic and new telephone services _ all at a lower
cost,'' said Robert Castle, founder and president of Coriolis, a
35-person Boxborough company developing optical access equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The thirst for more Net capacity, or ``bandwidth,'' is expected
to fuel sales of optical networking equipment and services, from
$8.9 billion last year to more than $41 billion by 2003, according
to RHK, a market research firm in San Francisco. At the same time,
phone carriers that buy the optical equipment and install it in
corporations will also provide related services _ such as Web
hosting, desktop videoconferencing, customized private networks,
and a panoply of e-mail possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to develop the services side that the
carriers will depend on for their future, while also keeping up
with the speed requirements that optical networking requires,''
said David Tolwinski, president of Tenor Networks Inc. of Acton.
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Networks was formed to provide hardware and customized
services. Robert P. Ryan, now vice president of research and
development, and Leon K. Woo, the company's chief technology
officer, formed the company in October 1998. Tolwinski joined them
in January 1999. All three worked at 3Com Corp.'s switching
division in Boxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the kids went to school, Leon and I put our ideas
together on the dining room table of my home,'' recalled Ryan. ``We
are technologists and saw a fundamental change in the way networks
will be built in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just technology that gave rise to optical networking.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which effectively ended the
Baby Bells' phone monopolies, sparked a flurry of
telecommunications start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be in business today were it not for the Telecom
Act,'' said Mick Scully, founder and president of Appian
Communications of Boxborough, which has quickly grown to 43
employees since March.
</P>
<P>
   As with anything that involves Internet communications, the
optical networking upstarts say that speed is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to run like hell, set expectations, meet them, and
know that you really have less than a year's lead time over your
rivals,'' said Anthony Zona, president and chief executive of
Quantum Bridge of North Andover.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Cutting edge gadgets for 2000
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceThe first Consumer Electronics Show of
<TEXT>
the third millennium was held last week in Las Vegas. The
conference shows off the cool gadgets and gizmos you'll be seeing
this year and beyond. Gadgetry is in hyperdrive, with some 7,000
new products on the way. Here are the best of the best, the cutting
edge of the cutting edge due out this year. A cautionary note: The
products' release dates and prices are tentative and, at the time
of electronics show, could not be confirmed. That means not
everything is guaranteed to hit store shelves. Some gadgets may be
destined to only exist on the shelves of their creators:
<P>
   GENIUS CALLING
</P>
<P>
   Who: Ericsson, www.ericsson.com
</P>
<P>
   What: R380 Smart Phone. The Smart Phone is the size of an
average mobile phone but has a flip keypad which transforms the
communication device into a palm-sized computer. The phone is
totally jammed with features including Internet capability and PDA.
The R380 will feature a calendar, address software, WAP browser
(which enables you to see Web pages without the graphics) and
handwriting recognition software. The phone is also voice-activated
for the hands-free executive in you. Oh, and if that's not enough,
the R380 can also be an MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   When: Tentatively June/July (in limited areas)
</P>
<P>
   How much: to be announced
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   What: GR-DVL9800. This is the top-of-the-line JVC digital video
camera to be released this year. The camera has been reduced in
size and now is about the size of your hand. The optics have been
totally overhauled and the camera lightened. It will double as a
true digital camera. While other digital video cameras capture
images off the tape, the JVC captures high resolution XGA digital
stills on a separate, removable MultimediaCard. This will let the
user film and photograph simultaneously. The camera comes with an
automatic pop-up flash.
</P>
<P>

   What: Soundspot SA-2. This 4.5-inch speaker won a CES
``Innovations'' award for its design and superior sound. The tiny
orb speaker was developed to be integrated into home theaters.
While its physical profile is almost nonexistent, the sound is
fantastic. This is due to Morel's own, super-secret audio
technology, cryptically called EVC (external voice coil). The
result: speakers that would make any audiophile rapturous.
</P>
<P>
   When: March
</P>
<P>
   How much: $530 a pair
</P>
<P>
   LI'L BUDDY

customized call answering, up to 20 individualized voice mail
boxes, memo recording and conference calls. But that's just the
beginning. Cybergenie can also access your E-mail and faxes and
read them to you over the phone. As a bonus, the Cybergenie can
call you whenever a voice mail, E-mail or fax comes in and read it
to you. The system is especially designed with the small office and
the home office users in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When: End of this month
</P>
<P>
   How much: $500 (one cordless handset is included), $130 each for

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Digital age mega-mergers create settlers, not pioneers
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a little shop in Gwinnett County that sells
ice cream that is truly homemade. Unlike the big-name chain ice
cream shops, it doesn't have 84 flavors, it's not fancy and the
prices are relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   But there is always a big line to buy the ice cream. That line
is filled with people who don't mind driving a little farther and
paying a little more for a small selection of really exceptional
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the announcement that AOL and Time Warner will
merge _ creating a chain store of media unlike any that exists now
_ the experts are predicting with the solemn voice of prophets that
this is the dawn of a new digital age with new rules. You are being
told that the giant new company is the pioneer of the new digital
age.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I think they need to calm down and buy a bowl of homemade peach
ice cream at that down-home little stand.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to learn from ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you my own peach-flavored prediction of the future.
Keep in mind that it comes from a fellow who is only expert at ice
cream and typing.
</P>
<P>
   I think the combination is just one more enormous merger. That,
rather than breaking the mold, it is merely a part of a pattern
that should look familiar to you by now.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the merger means to you as a customer: You'll be
able to decide if you want to patronize a new chain of stores. This
chain will sell information. It'll do it efficiently, and there
will be a sameness and a consistency that will appeal to a lot of
people. Like any chain operation, the prices will be good, the
selection of information will be large, and _ as Holiday Inn once
promised in its ads _ you'll find very few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the world wrong with finding that
attractive. A lot of people will. That's the whole notion of the
deal _ big numbers of customers that will turn into big advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have great power because it is big. So it
will be able to make good deals when it buys and sells. It'll hire
smart and safe people to run the operation. They'll be the managers
of the chain of media stores and will make sure that the stock in
trade _ price, consistency and efficiency _ is maintained.
</P>
<P>
   There will be disadvantages, too. The company will be so big
that it'll react slower than the small companies. That's an
important disadvantage since the rules of the Internet change so
fast. By the time a giant company stops to hold board meetings and
hire marketing consultants to figure out how to cash in on these
changes, it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being the pioneer, the giant will follow paths blazed
by the explorers of the media world. That isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that the AOL and Time Warner merger won't create an
innovator in the new digital age. Instead, the new company is more
like the settlers who followed the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers _ most of them really _ will prefer that. Other
customers, a smaller group, will want things the big company can't
offer, so they'll search out the small media stands that aren't
part of a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very attributes of size, consistency and safety inherent
in the big company will open new niches for smart small companies
that are able to move faster and take more chances. The best of
these small companies will realize that they won't be able to
compete with chain store rules. So they will ignore the rules.
They'll concentrate on making the best bowl of homemade peach ice
cream possible, and they'll charge enough for it to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be advantages for the big companies. And _
thank God a mercy _ there will always be a market for really good
homemade peach ice cream.

WOMAN OF THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Will Elizabeth Dole or Dianne Feinstein move
into the vice presidential mansion in Washington, D.C.? Because
presidential nominees will be chosen early, speculation will focus
on the gender of possible running mates. But another contest, more
grounded in probability, could elect the first female member of
Congress to a leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Nancy Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco
since 1987, is running for House majority whip and expects to win.
This race is speculative, too. The job won't exist unless Democrats
recapture the speaker's gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to win five more seats, and Pelosi hopes to
deliver four from her own state with four fund-raisers before
California's primary March 7. Raising dough is part of the
leadership DNA, at least since Tip O'Neill parlayed savvy, charm,
and a Midas touch into the whip's job in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   This race centers less on ideology than on personality and
regional strength. Pelosi's opponents, Steny Hoyer of Maryland and
John Lewis of Georgia, are well-respected Democrats from below the
Mason-Dixon line. Both share Pelosi's liberal voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi thinks she has a chance to be the first female House
speaker in history because of geography as much as gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out here, I am constantly energized by prospects for
the future. `Let's do it' is in the air, it's in the water,'' she
says. But back in D.C., ``we debate old ideas on stale
assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians deal with transportation, urban issues,
agriculture, trade, all the big issues,'' she adds. ``California
has to be represented in the leadership.'' When the late Phillip
Burton of San Francisco lost the House majority leadership by one
vote in 1976, California had 43 House members. Today, it has 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a traditional, regular Democrat, a liberal Democrat,''
Pelosi says. She was born that way in Baltimore in 1940 when her
father, Thomas D'Alesandro, was serving the first of five terms in
the House before becoming mayor of Baltimore. Her brother, Thomas
D'Alesandro Jr., was also mayor of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi knew she was making progress when some colleagues asked
``What's the hurry?'' when she first unveiled her ambitions in
1998. A former state chairwoman, she has lost only one election,
when she ran for chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in
1985: ``That race was instructive for me. Paul Kirk, a good man,
got in early. He won. I learned a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pelosi wins, tokenism or symbolism will count less than her
unglamorous work in House committees. Some of her assignments, on
ethics, for instance, are thankless tasks. As the senior Democrat
on the foreign operations subcommittee, she works on foreign debt
relief, an issue with few headlines or political payoffs. Last
year, during a holiday recess, her work on the House Intelligence
Committee meant a tour of North Korea. Second prize, two weeks in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters include Joe Moakley of Massachusetts and Jack
Murtha of Pensylvania, both shrewd vote-counters. But the work of a
whip is, as its name suggests, confrontational. In 1985, some
Democrats opposed making the job elective. ``My view then and now
is that it shouldn't be a popularity contest,'' former
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois says. ``But Nancy
Pelosi is very unusual. She has a lot of political moxie. She's a
tremendously hard worker. I wouldn't sell Nancy short.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother of five and grandmother of four, Pelosi counts
ethnicity as an asset: ``It's important for the Democratic party to
state that Italian-Americans need apply. It's a banner I carry very
proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for gender, ``I'm not running as a woman, but we should
understand who elects Democrats. I have the credentials. Being a
woman is sort of a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Can she handle the job? ``I prefer the word `strong' to `tough.'
I'm a pretty strong person. I think my colleagues know that.''
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Looking for a loan? Shop online and save
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They don't have to give you credit, but there are
plenty of people out there in cyberspace who would be delighted to
do just that. Whether you're looking for a house loan or a car
loan, there are online lenders in just that business.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other sites and services online that specialize in
helping you decide whether you can qualify for a loan and, if you
can, that will help you calculate just how much you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a common scenario: You own a home, have a
mortgage but wonder if you're getting a good deal. Is now a good
time to refinance? Yahoo _ which has several impressive loan
services _ has just the tool you need at loan.yahoo.com/m/mm.html.
When you go to that page, you'll fill out a fairly lengthy form
answering questions including what interest you're paying, where
you live, the value of the property, the type of property
(single-family home, condo, etc.) and the remaining balance on your
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just push the button. You'll be told if the program can
find other deals that beat the one you have now.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave the Yahoo loan center, let's take a look at one
more service at www.giggocar.com/yahoo/affordability.asp. It does
the calculations that will help you decide just how much you can
afford to pay for a car. While you may not like the answers, it's a
good starting point for making a buying decision.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll look at some auto loan sites _ places online that will
lend you money to buy a car. Before we do, remember that this is
not an endorsement of the sites or an assurance you will get a good
deal. Just as you would before obtaining any loan, you need to
compare rates and also assure yourself that the company is a good
one to do business with.
</P>
<P>
   The first site at www.world-funding
</P>
<P>
   -group.com/ tries to give that assurance with a big sticker from
the Better Business Bureau. There's also a toll-free number to
call. The site has loan calculators that will give you a good idea
what sort of payments you would make before applying.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of these sites offer the same services, let's just
list one other auto loan page. You'll find PeopleFirstFinance at
www.peoplefirst.com/pff/sitewhoweare
</P>
<P>
   .cfm. It's been in business since 1997, which _ in the online
world _ is a long stand.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Loan Locator.Com. The premise here is
that you select the type of loan you're interested in (auto, home,
etc.) and then fill out a form. Once that is complete, you're told
that you'll receive at least four e-mails offering you a loan.
Again, let the buyer beware. The site is located at
popwords.com/locator/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /Arkansas.mortgage.lead
</P>
<P>
   /bad-credit-mortgage.asp.
</P>
<P>
   A similar site _ which specializes in mortgages _ is called
GetSmart.Com and is located at www.getsmart.com/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /HomeBanner?BANNERNAME &QC; 0.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta-based Real Estate.Com, the notion of shopping a loan
is taken to a new level. Simply go to www.realestate.com
</P>
<P>
   /mortgageauction/home.asp and fill out the form. Your mortgage
application is submitted automatically to more than 250 potential
lenders. You're promised that you'll start getting bids competing
for your business in 24 hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lending Tree, an online outfit that advertises
you'll ``apply in minutes _ know within hours.'' It's located at
homepages.go.com/homepages/v/i/e
</P>
<P>
   /viewcosmic/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, by the way, that more conventional lenders also
have Web sites. So, while searching for an online loan, check out
the Web site maintained by your bank or mortgage lenders in your
area.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    America, frame-by-frame
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is one of the rites of passage in American life,
the desire to drive across the country. But who is lucky enough to
have the time and freedom to do it? Now, thanks to the World Wide
Web, you can at least see what it looks like _ every last mile.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Frondorf, a San Antonio-based engineer, wanted to cross our
nation's midsection for years. With some help from Kodak, he did.
Starting in New York, Frondorf took a picture every mile, all 3,304
of them, until he reached San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The results can be viewed on the Web, at www.kodak.com
</P>
<P>
   /US/en/corp/features
</P>
<P>
   /onTheRoad. Looking at the pictures requires a Flash multimedia
plug-in, which can be downloaded from the site for free.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf actually made the trip twice. He had to bring a tripod
and clamps that mounted the 35 mm camera to his passenger side
window. On the first pass, he brought a Porsche but not a
wide-angle lens. As a result, the Rocky Mountain stretch of
Interstate 70 included a lot of close-ups of rock walls. The
low-riding Porsche also created quite a few guardrail shots.
</P>
<P>
   The next trip was in June in a high-riding Ford Explorer.
Frondorf traveled mostly on older highways, including U.S. 30, U.S.
40 and U.S. 50. The trip took six days.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf would stop when the natural light started to fade. He'd
mark his spot and look for a motel. He used a Canon T-90 with a
wide-angle lens and a motor drive. Shooting through the window
meant he did not run the air conditioning, so he kept the film in a
cooler. The shutter was triggered by a device hooked to the
odometer. Every time a mile passed, the shutter released.
</P>
<P>
   SITE COVERS CEREAL WITH SOME SOGGY PROSE
</P>
<P>
   If you love cereal _ and we're not talking old-fashioned Cream
of Wheat, we're talking dessert cereal _ consider www
</P>
<P>
   .emptybowl.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site is an invaluable resource to lovers of Cap'n Crunch,
Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula _ name brands that are to breakfast
what the chalupa and the Big Mac are to lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The site features reviews. December's top 10 list is from Mike
D.
</P>
<P>
   Health Choice Mueslix was rated 10th for its ``good texture and
interesting extras like the proper use of dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon Life was next, praised for its subtle sweetness but
marked down for getting soggy to soon. ``Still, the taste is
sassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Grahams came in seventh, cited as ``tasty vittles that
work best with milk products.'' The review comes with this
advisory: ``Do NOT use Cherry Coke with syrup. Way too sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa Puffs were next. They're considered a reliable replacement
to Count Chocula and come with a nice bonus: ``When the Count is
out of town and I need a different texture, Cocoa Puffs do the job.
They can also make some chocolate milk for you if you're out of
syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranking cereal is a blast from the past: Kaboom. ``Some
people cry over old lovers. I cry over Kaboom! It was the
onomotopoeia of cereals. The milk would turn into some crazy color,
and the cereal was multicolored and marshmallow-filled. Plus, it
made its own gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a feature called ``Point Counterpoint.''
In the December offering, two staffers debate the virtues of skim
milk vs. 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: Skim milk is not overpowering. It has the flavor of
milk but does not weigh down your meal. You can drink your cereal's
leftovers without the feeling of guilt. It gives you calcium while
not feeling like it's moving down your throat like some leftover
ooze from ``The Blob'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   A counterpoint: Skim milk? If you're going to use skim milk, why
not just use water? You get the same flavor. Once, during the week
when Will's sister was a vegetarian, she insisted on only drinking
skim milk. Once, when there wasn't any in the house and she was
yelling and complaining, Will took half a glass of whole milk and
filled the rest up with tap water. She drank it and said it tasted
great! Is that what you want on your cereal?

GLANVILLE SAYS NOTHING, LOUDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's just take a little look at our old friend Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has had one of its most interesting seasons in recent
memory, with some Jekyll-and-Hyde teams (Patriots, Raiders), some
percolating dynasties (Indianapolis, Tennessee, Washington), some
fallen teams (Denver, San Francisco), and some should-be-retiring
giants (Jerry Rice, Dan Marino).
</P>
<P>
   And what did our intrepid CBS analyst have to say throughout the
year?
</P>
<P>
   Not much. Not much at all.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville has the rare ability to drain all energy from a
television studio, leaving colleagues with little air to breathe.
On last week's pregame show, for instance, Glanville grabbed his
chair and joked that Jimmy Johnson wouldn't take his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Earth to Glanville. If CBS Sports president Sean McManus asks
you to take a quick ride to his favorite cannoli store, don't go.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is that Glanville made the growing chemistry among
host Jim Nantz, Randy Cross, and Craig James appear to be forced.
The CBS crew couldn't outfox the real Fox team of James Brown,
Howie Long, Cris Collinsworth, and Terry Bradshaw (who, by the way,
owns the good 'ol boy character). Glanville was like . . . well,
put it this way: The best thing he said all year was that the
Cleveland Browns were horrible.
</P>
<P>
   His attempts at humor made laugh tracks weep. Remember his
attempt to make fun of Drew Bledsoe's slump by calling him
``Blue-zo''?
</P>
<P>
   Get it? Blue? Zo?
</P>
<P>
   Glanville had a million of them.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville joked about the size of Minnesota Vikings tackle Korey
Stringer. The only problem is that Springer actually lost weight
this season, to a slim 340 from last year's 390.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville's claim to fame was predicting that Browns quarterback
Tim Couch would be hurt. Anybody who watched the team could have
told you that. Couch's offensive line gave up 60 sacks this season.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem, Glanville said, the Browns should run more
and block better. It's that kind of thinking that made Glanville a
63-73 coach, infamous for getting rid of Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville made viewers long for the days when George Seifert
occupied the coach's seat on CBS's ``NFL Today.'' At least Seifert
knew when to shut up. Glanville's mouth has always attracted
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyche hated him. In 1989, as coach of the Cincinnati
Bengals, Wyche ran up the score on Glanville's Houston Oilers,
61-7. When he was up by 51, Wyche ordered an onside kick, two
fourth-down runs, and a field goal with 22 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche, still irked after the game, called Glanville a liar and
said, ``He's probably the biggest phony in football. He's got the
best talent in the AFC, possibly in the league, but he brings them
down. They play stupid football. They have no discipline. At the
league meetings, no one hangs out with him. Drop me a note if you
ever find anybody who thinks the world of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in October, Washington Post sports media critic Len Shapiro
watched a pregame show and was horrified at Glanville the studio
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glanville tries too much to be a rebel without much of a
cause,'' wrote Shapiro, ``and thank goodness they won't allow him
to wear his trademark motorcycle jacket on air.'' Shapiro added,
``While Randy Cross and Craig James were offering strong, sound
opinions, Glanville had little to add except the occasional cheap
shot at a colleague, and virtually no cogent analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Fox didn't fight very hard when Glanville bolted for
CBS. He was Fox's secret weapon, a modern day Trojan horse. And the
scoreboard says: Fox's pregame show earned a 3.9 rating, while CBS
lagged behind at 2.8.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laughing it off
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Enberg signs a new deal with CBS, and that means the
venerable Verne Lundquist might have to take a back seat. Lundquist
is taking the hit with humor. During Saturday's Jacksonville
blowout of Miami, Lundquist said, ``I don't know whether to say,
`Whoa, Nellie,' or `Oh my!' '' Lundquist's partner, Dan Dierdorf,
stopped him before the joke went too far. Dierdorf pointed his
finger at Lundquist, and chided him, ``Bad boy, Verne.'' Dierdorf
also got off a good line about the blowout: ``If this were a high
school basketball game, the referees would turn on the running
clock.'' . . . Boston's all-sports radio station gets a dart for
switching from Saturday's Redskins-Buccaneers game with four
minutes remaining and the game on the line to pick up Celtics-Nets.
WEEI said it had to switch because of contractual obligations, but
no one would have missed the first quarter of the Celtics,
especially given the drama of the Redskins losing on a muffed snap
as they attempted a last-minute field goal . . . Randy Moss is all
of that, but spraying water on the back of an official is the
height of childishness. Fox caught the fourth-quarter temper
tantrum after Moss unsuccessfully complained about perceived pass
interference. Moss's fit was outdone only by Toronto Raptors
forward Charles Oakley pulling a major nutty in Saturday's game
against the Milwaukee Bucks. Oakley got into a screaming match with
referee Leroy Richardson and shoved his own coach, Butch Carter,
and teammate Kevin Willis, both of whom were trying to prevent
Oakley from getting near Richardson.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Compton's strong on basics, but hits a few wrong notes
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Compton's Encyclopedia 2000 is a handsome production,
easily navigated and full of information. Not all of it is good
information, but that is true of most encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   Every electronic encyclopedia I've examined, and that includes
virtually all of them, has its weak points and strong points. Like
most of them, Compton's is aimed at the elementary and secondary
school student.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is paid to things these students are apt to need
than to more arcane matters. I usually check on the treatment of a
lot of arcane stuff, and I'm usually disappointed. That situation
continues with Compton's.
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco receives its usual treatment _ that which you might
expect from a modern dance scholar who has barely heard of the
stuff. There is, however, a few seconds of flamenco guitar audio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the articles are unsigned, and thus there is no one to
blame for this sentence in the article on shooting: ``The early
marksmen on the frontier, however, competed only with rifles
because they believed that accurate shooting with pistols and
revolvers required little or no skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the clueless would believe such a thing, and frontier
marksmen may have been unwashed, unkempt and even unlettered, but
as a class they were scarcely clueless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, absent this blunder, the section on
marksmanship is surprisingly long, detailed, interesting and
lacking in political innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Every encyclopedia has a time line, but I particularly enjoyed
Compton's. It is easy to browse, can be set up in different blocks
_ years, centuries and so forth _ and is quite detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The audio portions of the encyclopedia are the most amazingly
mixed bag I've encountered yet. On the good side, there's a lot of
it. Some of it is authentic. For instance, the little portion of
Dvorak's symphony ``From the New World'' is played by an orchestra
and not a synthesizer or MIDI instrument. The caption announced
that ``you can hear the music of the black American slaves on this
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, you can't. This is the opening of the
symphony, not the ``Going Home'' portion that some argue was
inspired by spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' gets orchestral treatment,
but I can't figure out what's happening in the opening theme of the
``Jupiter'' symphony; it sounds dimly like an orchestra, but
there's a piano in it. The famous ``Queen of the Night'' aria from
``Magic Flute,'' we are told, has ``some of the highest notes ever
written for soprano.'' It's a good thing for the kids that this is
pointed out, since there's no soprano to be heard. In fact, the
human voice is notably missing from all the music.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was reasonably familiar with the work of Beethoven,
but here we are presented with something called ``Nature,'' without
opus number, played by a piano and what might be a hurdy-gurdy or
an abused cat. It is a marchlike affair, and if Beethoven wrote it
I doubt he would thank Compton's for resurrecting it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity that music is treated by most of the encyclopedias
in such a cavalier way, as it is one of the most important
advantages the electronic versions have over print.
</P>
<P>
   However, all this carping seems excessive when, according to the
publisher's Web site at www.shopmattel
</P>
<P>
   .com/, this two-disc encyclopedia can be ordered for $15.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of hundred movies and animations, including
some of those dandy 360-degree rotating scenes. One of them,
startlingly, is of the High Museum in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the intended audience of schoolchildren intent on subjects
like geography, science, social studies, history and the like,
there is more than enough here to see them through. Compton's seems
particularly strong on modern history, and there are several
thousand links to further information on the Web.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Dell's direct line to the futureBy Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Dell Computer Corp.'s rise during
the 1990s is sprinkled liberally with superlatives like ``first,''
``most'' and ``youngest.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was the first big company to sell computers via the
Internet and the most profitable personal computer maker in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dell can add the title of best-performing stock on the
Nasdaq exchange in the 1990s. Shares of the Round Rock, Texas,
company appreciated 88,000 percent in the past decade. One hundred
dollars invested in Dell stock 10 years ago and held through all
seven splits would have grown to $88,000 today. During the 1990s,
which the personal computing industry might remember as the Decade
of Dell, the company evolved from upstart PC maker to No. 1 in the
United States and forced bigger rivals to copy parts of its direct
sales approach.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, 34, the company's founder, chairman and CEO was
once an introverted entrepreneur who seemed uncomfortable in front
of an audience. Now he is regarded as a witty guru of e-commerce.
Even giants of the Industrial Age, such as Ford Motor Co., are
seeking his guidance on doing business over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of exuberant expectations, the question inevitably
comes up: What can Dell do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell _ intense, driven and curious himself about what
his company can achieve _ has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Dell can ship four times as many computers in 2004
as it did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to increase our market share from only 9 percent
last year to only 20 percent, which is probably a goal that's too
low, that would be 47 million units for Dell in 2004,'' Dell said
in an interview recently.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, modest or not, is based on his expectation that
worldwide personal computer sales will soar 69 percent by 2004 and
that Dell will account for more than half of that growth.
</P>
<P>
   But then Dell may be the most bullish executive in the personal
computer industry. He derides talk of the ``post-PC era'' as
``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether a company can grow and expand,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE OF A CURIOSITY
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell didn't have the Internet to inspire him for the
first 11 years of Dell Computer's existence. Instead, he invented a
radical new way of doing business that conveniently realizes its
full potential on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the opportunity early and seized it. But it was
serendipity, too, a necessary ingredient in every story of
phenomenal success. It didn't hurt that the establishment in the
personal computer industry viewed Dell as more a curiosity than a
threat in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists believed that the then-Austin company's new idea
to sell computers directly to customers would fail in key segments
of the market, such as corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The nerdy college dropout, however, thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically had the foresight to break the rules of
traditional business, and we came up with a new set of rules that
were very effective for us,'' Dell said recently. ``And we stuck by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time bigger competitors understood the threat, sometime
in the middle of the decade, the Texas upstart was too big _ and
had too much momentum _ to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1999, Dell achieved his goal and overtook
archrival Compaq Computer Corp. as the top seller of personal
computers in the United States, the world's biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   The research and consulting firm, International Data Corp., said
in a report on the third quarter of 1999 that Dell is closing in on
No. 1 worldwide.
</P>

Texas.

DANGEROUS FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fractured skull. Broken kneecap. Back injury, requiring surgery.
Stress fractures of the ankle and tibia. It's not the weekly
casualty report from the smashmouth NFL. It's merely this season's
injury list in figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   The sport of grace and artistry, of rhinestones and sequins, of
kissing and crying, is becoming an orthopedist's nightmare of
broken bones and torn muscles at the elite level, with several top
stars already down for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Binnebose, a strong contender to make the US Olympic team
in 2002, nearly died last autumn when his back buckled during a
star lift in practice and pairs partner Laura Handy fell on top of
him as his head whacked the ice. Binnebose was put into a
drug-induced coma for 11 days after brain surgery, spent two months
in the hospital, and still has facial paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Hartsell, US pairs champion with her brother Steve,
fell out of a practice lift a week before Christmas and fractured
her patella. Russia's Anjelika Krylova, the two-time world ice
dancing champion with Oleg Ovsyannikov, is slated to go under the
knife now that her old back ailment has flared up. US men's
champion Michael Weiss was nagged by a stress fracture in his ankle
and didn't qualify for last weekend's Grand Prix final. And Erin
Pearl from Scarborough, Maine, missed the Grand Prix season with a
stress fracture in her leg and needed a medical waiver to get into
next month's US championships in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   As the sport demands more and more daring and difficult jumps,
throws, and lifts, plus a year-round commitment to train and
compete, skaters are turning up with the same kind of injuries seen
in a pro football trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk value is great,'' says Christy Krall, senior director
of athlete programs for the US Figure Skating Association. ``We
should call it extreme skating.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the injuries come from falling, or being dropped or
thrown several feet onto a rock-hard surface. Some occur in warmup
collisions between close-quarters couples. But many are cropping up
because skaters are training too hard and competing too often with
little rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the multisport athlete anymore,'' says Dr.
Mahlon Bradley, an orthopedic surgeon and former skater. ``We have
the unisport athlete who goes four seasons without a break. There's
no down time.''
</P>
<P>
   The elite skating season now runs from October to April,
followed by the Champions on Ice exhibition tour, followed by
working on new programs for the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, skaters would take two or three months off after
the season and go back to school,'' says pairs coach Ron Ludington.
``Now, these kids go 12 months a year.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Dick Buttons and Tenley Albrights of decades
past, they're not tracing school figures. They're constantly
airborne, working on quadruple jumps and triple-triple
combinations, landing hundreds of times on a narrow blade,
punishing bone, muscle, and tendon.
</P>
<P>
   The endless (and tedious) art-or-sport debate about figure
skating is settled quickly by scientific reality. Skaters in the
middle of a program have the same heart rate as half-milers (200
beats a minute) and produce as much lactic acid as marathoners.
They need up to 300 pounds of centrifugal force to hold in their
arms and legs when they jump. And when they come down, the force on
the landing leg is up to 14 times their body weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three practice sessions a day, five days a week, maybe 500
jumps,'' says Krall. ``You can do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries are predictable and inevitable: stress fractures of
the tibia, ankle, and foot, compressed and sprained ankles, damaged
knee tendons and ligaments, lower back strains and the kind of
jumping-related groin injuries that have plagued Alexei Urmanov and
Elvis Stojko.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, tore a groin muscle at the
1997 world championships and ended up missing the 1998 Games.
Stojko, odds-on favorite to win there, tore the same muscle
practicing his skywalking programs, then ripped an abdominal muscle
while favoring the groin as he limped to a painful silver.
</P>
<P>
   The quad _ four revolutions _ seemed like a moon landing when
Kurt Browning did the first one in 1988. Now, it's mandatory for
any world contender. Tim Goebel, the 19-year-old who could lift
Weiss's title next month, did three quads at Skate America last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a quad now to be competitive,'' says Dr.
Roger Kruse, who was the US skating team physician at the 1998
Olympics. ``So everyone's going to be doing them, no matter what we
say.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peggy Fleming won the 1968 Olympics, she did nothing
tougher than a double axel, which most juniors now do in their
sleep. Dorothy Hamill won the 1976 gold medal without trying a
triple jump, and Linda Fratianne landed only two when she won the
1979 world title.
</P>
<P>
   Seven triples, including triple-triple combinations, are now
standard stuff in a women's world-level long program. The pairs,
once a stylish side-by-side display, have evolved into an aerial
circus of one-handed lifts and triple-throw jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be competitive today, not even in the same
league,'' says Ludington, who won four US pairs titles and a 1960
Olympic medal with wife Nancy. ``The material they're doing is more
dangerous and demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ice dancing, which skeptics insist is more samba than
sport, has seen increasing amounts of collisions and spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, you're basically skating in high
heels,'' says Amy Webster, a two-time US medalist (with Ron
Kravette) who retired after having surgery on her shoulders and
more than a dozen dislocations. ``When you have to be attached as
dancers do, the chances are great for tripping and falling.''
</P>
<P>
   When blades leave the ice, lacerations can follow. Rachel Mayer
and Peter Breen, the 1992 Olympians from Massachusetts, missed out
on a return trip when Mayer's blade ripped apart one of Breen's
finger tendons and sidelined them for weeks before the 1994 trials.
Debbie Koegel nearly had her biceps severed by a Swiss skater's
high kick.
</P>
<P>
   Even warmups can be perilous. Renee Roca broke her wrist (and
still skated with cast and painkillers) in a collision at the 1994
US championships.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents are inevitable when steel and speed intersect on a
slippery surface. More worrisome is the crippling toll that the
constant leaping and landing is taking on the top skaters.
</P>
<P>
   The USFSA has been prodding them to do more off-ice work, more
strength training and conditioning, more flexibility exercises,
more stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also been talking about `periodization' in training _ a
rest period, a maintenance period and a buildup period,'' says
Bradley, who has worked with the USFSA's sports medicine committee
for nearly three decades. ``But it's difficult to get skaters to
take time off the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   When Button and Albright competed in the '50s, the season was
little more than the national and world championships. Now that
skating has become by far the most popular Olympic winter sport,
the schedule is chock-a-block with continental championships,
mandatory Grand Prix events, pro-ams, and made-for-TV
``challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   There's simply no time to take time these days, not without
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past if someone had a stress fracture, you got him off
the ice to rest,'' says Kruse. ``Now, they go off to do shows and
exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's a full-time freshman at UCLA, Michelle Kwan
still skated in the Grand Prix this season. If she hadn't, she
would have been banned from lucrative open events like the one in
Tokyo, where she picked up a quick $40,000 before heading to the
Grand Prix final in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Michelle doesn't do the Grand Prix events, she can't do the
pro-ams,'' says coach Frank Carroll. ``She'd have no ability to
make any money. She'd be out. Would we be doing all these things
this year if we didn't have to? No, we wouldn't. Michelle has to
skate and skate and skate and skate. They've made it so they're
just working her body to the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan already spent three weeks in a cast with a stress-fractured
toe before the last Olympics. Tara Lipinski pulled gluteal and hip
muscles from overworking after she won at Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the Olympic motto (``Faster, Higher,
Stronger'') meets skating's new mantra (``More, More, More'')? You
get an injured list that resembles the Washington Redskins'. All
that's missing are the shoulder pads and face masks.
</P>
<P>
   Binnebose is down for the year, but his coach figures he can at
least take a few turns on the ice a couple of weekends from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's going to wear a helmet,'' says Ludington. ``You can
bet on that.''

<P>
   Helen of Troy is said to have launched a thousand ships. William
Shatner of ``Star Trek'' fame may have done something nearly as
impressive. As a pitchman, he has almost single-handedly launched
an e-commerce company and created an Internet brand.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of radio ads over the last 18 months, the hammy
thespian has enabled Priceline.com to stand out from a throng of
Internet start-ups, all clamoring for the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Shamelessly flirting with self-parody, Shatner now stars in
Priceline.com's first television ads, which go beyond earlier
assurances that this dot-com will be ``big _ really big.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were created by the New York office of Boston ad agency
Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, and they have Shatner singing the
glories of an Internet service that claims to give consumers the
freedom and power to name their own price on air fares, hotel
rooms, cars, and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for an ad campaign called ``Troubadour'' is a music
club. Cast as the club's star act, Shatner wears jeans, a leather
jacket, and a wig hat. The ads have Shatner putting new words to
such 1960s and '70s pop songs as ``Age of Aquarius'' and ``I Want
You to Want Me.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of 10 TV ads, Shatner sings, ``If saving money is wrong,
I don't want to be right.'' In another, he smashes a guitar _ in a
bit of unscripted spontaneity, according to Chuck Kushell,
president of Hill Holliday's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever may be said of their artistic merit, the ads have
elicited instant response. Earlier this week, Priceline.com said
the ads helped it to hit a one-day sales record of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the top of my head, I can't think of another'' celebrity
pitchman who's had this kind of impact, Kushell said. ``In every
(newspaper) story about Priceline.com, Shatner is always mentioned
somewhere in the first three paragraphs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such is Shatner's cult status that the biggest challenge
for Hill Holliday was to develop a campaign whose pitch wasn't
eclipsed by the pitchman, Kushell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of had to retrofit the brand around him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, Priceline.com is about pioneering an unusual
idea that matches consumers and sellers through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline.com is about buyer-driven commerce; it's not an
auction,'' Kushell said. ``You don't compete against anyone. You
don't bid. You name your own price. Priceline.com allows you to get
stuff you might not otherwise be able to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   If low prices are the draw for consumers, Priceline.com gives
airlines and hotels a chance to sell excess inventory such as an
empty plane seat that might otherwise be a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution: If Priceline can meet their price,
consumers are obligated to buy that plane ticket or hotel room.
There's no backing out at the last minute. Sales are instantly and
automatically billed to a consumer's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet phenomena go, Priceline.com's credentials are all in
order. For its latest quarter, it lost $102.2 million on revenue of
$152.2 million, though much of the loss came from a one-time
charge. Its stock has been on a wild ride, up 5 1/4 Friday to close
at 56 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Shatner as pitchman came about almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said, ` `Star Trek,' high tech, Priceline _ oooh!' ''
Kushell said.
</P>
<P>
   When Priceline.com broke its first ads in the spring of 1998,
its ad agency was Heater of Boston. Several themes for an ad
campaign were bandied about, but there was no consensus on a
strategy that would ``get cheap awareness for a new and complex
service,'' said agency principal Bill Heater. Almost by default,
the compromise decision was to go with a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Comic Bill Cosby was considered, but Shatner was always the
first choice, said Priceline.com spokesman Brian Ek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone whose voice was instantly recognizable
because we were mostly doing radio ads at the time,'' Ek said.
``And we wanted someone with cross-generational appeal who was
somehow associated with the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Early ads suggested that celebrity and perfect pitch had met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the line about how Priceline was going to be `big _
really big,' and Shatner put his own spin on it,'' Heater recalled.
``It sounded so good it became the tagline.''
</P>
<P>
   In need of a larger agency, Priceline.com picked Hill Holliday
as its new ad agency last summer. Priceline.com's ad budget has
been estimated at about $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In doing research for the TV ads, Hill Holliday learned that
Shatner is an inveterate crooner who sometimes recorded albums of
pop songs. His version of ``Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'' is
widely esteemed by Trekkies, and his recordings are a staple of The
Annoying Music Show, which is broadcast on more than 100 National
Public Radio stations across the country. Looking to be tongue in
cheek, Hill Holliday decided Shatner's singing would be perfect for
a new campaign of TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Of Shatner's musical style, Kushell said: ``It's like Jack Benny
and his violin. Everybody but Jack knows that Jack can't play. It's
the same with Bill and his singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Shatner might willingly participate in his own
lampooning, Ek noted that Shatner asked to be compensated in stock
options, something that had never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   Heater reckons Shatner has made $7 million to $8 million from
Priceline.com. Chump change by Jim Carrey's standards, but still
enough to prompt other celebrities to follow Shatner's lead.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, Whoopi Goldberg was paid stock
options to plump flooz.com, an on-line gift currency; ditto for
drag queen Ru Paul, who shills a meeting service called WebEx.com.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Alanis Morissette may have the best deal of all. She and
her management company reportedly got stock options worth about $30
million from MP3.com, a music site.
</P>
<P>
   The money is good and the demands none too strenuous. It took
only two days to shoot the 10 Priceline.com ads.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Shatner doesn't mind playing scripts that cast
him as a lamely aging hepcat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd do just about anything you wanted,'' Heater said. ``He
did a video for the Priceline Christmas party last year. He'd even
leave birthday greetings on your voice mail.''

DELTA UNDER NEW CHIEF NOT QUITE CLOUD 9 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was flattered by the call to see if he would be
interested in becoming chief executive of Delta Air Lines. But Leo
Mullin had a master's degree in applied mathematics and an MBA from
Harvard. He knew the odds; he figured he didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent 31 years as a self-described ``road warrior''
flying around the country _ first as a consultant, then a railroad
executive, then a banker, and finally a utility executive _ Mullin
knew a lot about Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The airline that grew out of a crop-dusting operation in the
Louisiana delta to become the nation's third-largest carrier,
measured by the industry standard of passenger revenue. In terms of
passengers flown and aircraft departures, Delta was the largest.
But Delta was also without a CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The board had fired Ron Allen, a Delta veteran who oversaw the
controversial $1.3 billion purchase of many of bankrupt Pan
American World Airways's assets. Allen was also the architect of
Leadership 7.5, a program to cut operating costs by $2 billion; it
had the unintended effect of destroying a half-century of
harmonious labor relations in what had come to be known as the
``Delta Family.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unprecedented for Delta to hire anyone to run the company
who had not risen through the ranks of the Atlanta-based airline.
Delta's executives hailed from Georgia Tech, not Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was extremely unlikely that I would be offered the
job,'' Mullin said during a rare interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   But two months later, on Aug. 11, 1997, Gerald Grinstein, the
nonexecutive chairman of Delta's board, called Mullin, a native of
Maynard, and offered him the job. Three days later, Mullin was
flying on a private jet to Atlanta, after finishing a short work
week as vice chairman of Unicom Corp., the holding company for
Commonwealth Edison Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I might be called upon to say something when I met
the management team the next morning,'' Mullin said. ``I remembered
that (General Electric Co. CEO) Jack Welch said the three most
important things in measuring a business are customer satisfaction,
employee satisfaction, and cash flow. I built a little talk around
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Delta's cash flow was rebounding after four years
of losses totaling $2 billion. But customer service and employee
morale were at nadirs.
</P>
<P>
   Plane interiors, from first class to the back of coach, were
frayed. And a 1996 employee survey had ranked the morale of Delta's
then 62,000 employees in the lowest quartile of US corporations _
shocking for a company that 13 years earlier had seen an
employee-generated program of voluntary paycheck deductions result
in employees buying the airline one of its first Boeing 767s.
</P>
<P>
   Those times, however, were a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was blood on the walls from all the cuts,'' said one
pilot. About 15,000 employees had been let go. Even Mullin said
that the company ``had lost its sense of soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees are still raw from the experiences of the last
decade, and separate unionization efforts are underway for flight
attendants, mechanics, and ramp workers. Mullin has made it a
priority to defeat those efforts and last week gave 3 percent
raises to domestic nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   His first task, however, was to improve service.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the new managment team made a commitment to replace the
interior of every one of Delta's 558 airplanes within 16 months.
``It cost about $125 million,'' Mullin said. ``There was no
budgeting exercise first. We just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mullin didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   From his years of traveling, he knew on-time performance was
critical. ``It is king,'' he said. ``If your on-time performance is
lousy, then everything is lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mullin arrived, Delta was 10th out of 10 among the major
airlines in on-time performance and languishing near the bottom in
two other measures: lost bags and customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of everything in the 1999 annual report the thing that meant
the most to me is we were the only major airline in the top three''
in each of the US Department of Transportation's airline rankings:
for best on-time performance, fewest mishandled bags, and fewest
customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report also includes a record $1.1 billion profit on
revenue of $14.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mullin, the company has spent billions to improve Delta's
technology, which he said had been ``abysmal.'' That investment is
paying returns with quicker boarding and better baggage-handling at
its busy Atlanta hub, where the airline operates 650 flights a day
in a complex operation where one delay can start a domino effect.
Soon, each baggage tug will have computers mounted on board,
alerting ramp workers to last-minute gate changes which could delay
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Most uncharacteristically, the company bet heavily on
Priceline.com, the discount Internet ticket-seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline needed a major airline to jumpstart their operation,
and they talked to everybody, including us,'' Mullin said. There
was some concern that if Delta signed up, it would be competing
against itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge was determining: Is this inevitable, is the
Internet the future, and are we followers?'' Mullin recalled. ``Our
management team decided the Internet would be a powerful thing in
this game. They also recognized how important we would be to
Priceline.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of getting just a share of ticket sales, Delta asked
for equity and picked up warrants for more than 11 million
Priceline shares at 93 cents each. Delta was the first airline to
do it, and the first airline to be able to cash out. The windfall
has resulted in more than $700 million in cash. Indeed, the sale of
Priceline stock made possible Delta's recent announcement that it
will buy back $500 million worth of Delta stock.
</P>
<P>
   Delta remains a stakeholder in Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, focusing on customer service is not without risk.
Many see brand loyalty in the airline industry as ephemeral, with
price and schedule being the most important criteria.
</P>
<P>
   But Mullin said his philosphy, which he learned at McKinsey &AMP;
Co. after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1967, is that
``profit is a byproduct of a good product. If you render a superior
product, it will render a superior return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of industry, but if you can get an
extra 5 or 10 percent of passengers, particularly the business
traveler, that is the difference between victory and defeat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, improved service seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's load factor _ a measurement of revenue passengers on
board _ is a lofty 72.6 percent, up from 67.8 percent in 1996. The
airline has had more than $2 billion in profits in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Mullin was hired, said former board chairman Gerald
Grinstein, was that he was an outsider, with a background in
developing corporate strategies.
</P>
<P>
   He can also ``think outside the box,'' said Don Perkins, retired
chairman of Jewel Cos. He met Mullin in Chicago, where Mullin was
deeply involved in civic activities, such as being chairman of the
board of the Field Museum of Natural History. When a new president
was needed, instead of hiring someone from another museum, Mullin
tapped a Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton executive. The choice was excellent,
Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   In the airline industry, schedule and price differences are
becoming more transparent, Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Price is less of a variable as more business is done on the
Internet and fare changes by one carrier are quickly matched by
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have analysts watching route segments every day, and if
Continental changes its fares on a route, I guarantee Delta will
make a change within five hours,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts have been noticed. Delta was named Airline of the
Year in 1988 by Air Transport World and best-managed airline of
1999 by Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology. And Wall Street analysts
like his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.'s Glenn D. Engel, pick Delta as
the best of the big airlines.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Hmmm. Not sure those government anti-drug
messages are getting through. Two network presidents referred to
game shows as ``crack'' and ``heroin.'' Time for an ``after-school
special'' in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   We take back anything negative we ever said about Regis Philbin.
He's a nice man who is doing his schtick without offense. We're
even going to overlook the fact that when he spoke to television
critics here, he once referred to himself in the third person. And
we're going to forgive him for almost killing David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CNN's ``Crossfire'' recently debated First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's appearance on Letterman's show. Apparently real news took
the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tyler Moore was here promoting her movie, ``Mary and
Rhoda,'' which has been mocked brutally by most critics, but the
bigger issue is this: Uh, Mary's had some work done. She looks like
she's 17.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if her movie gets turned into a series (not likely), ABC
will pass and it will end up on The WB where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central announced Tuesday that former presidential
hopeful and current TV pitchman Bob Dole will be a part of that
network's often hilarious election-year coverage, ``Indecision
2000.'' Dole always has been funny and he ought to have a lot of
chances for one-liners (unless his wife gets the vice presidential
slot on the Republican ticket).
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The Boss: ``Malcolm in the Middle'' is the first bona fide
midseason hit, getting more than 23 million viewers for its second
episode, an unheard of increase of more than 1 million over its
eye-popping debut. We love this show like you can't imagine, but
the catchy theme song called ``You're Not the Boss of Me Now'' by
They Might Be Giants is stuck in our head.
</P>
<P>
   Variety is proclaiming that ``Malcolm'' is the savior of the
sitcom, a genre commonly referred to as dead. To which we say: Wait
until you see some of the dogs that are coming your way. No need to
chill the Champagne, sitcoms are still mostly lousy.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Why we love UPN, examples 121 and 122: The network is planning
on developing two shows called ``Hip Hop Bounty Hunters'' (pretty
self-explanatory) and ``I Spike,'' which is about undercover female
agents who pose as professional volleyball players. Oh, come on!
You know that's brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood insider tips, example 46: They are no longer called
``extras.'' They are called ``atmosphere.'' Signs at some studios
proclaim, ``No atmosphere beyond this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That answers a lot of our nagging questions about quality.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The WB pretty much came out and said that ratings took a hit
when ``Felicity'' star Keri Russell cut her curly, signature locks.
We knew fans were fickle, but when you start dealing with teen
viewers it gets pretty cutthroat. God forbid Dawson get a pimple or
his ``Dawson's Creek'' pals may drown him.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The last, most definitive and true words we should ever utter
about the alleged scandal of the government paying for anti-drug
messages in prime-time shows, from government-hater and
major-league TV producer Dick Wolf: ``It must have been the slowest
news day of the last two years. I mean, this is not a story, folks.
Apparently there has been an obsession in this room. This is like
examining navel lint. ... The scripts are going in (to the network)
at the last possible minute because everybody is obsessively
rewriting them. The idea that somebody in the White House would be
reading my scripts to give me advice _ it would be laughable. I've
never seen something with so little consequence get so much
input.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 ATLANTA: ... big airlines.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Delta is in a better competitive position today than it was at
the beginning of the decade,'' he said, noting that its
acquisitions of two regional carriers, Comair for $1.9 billion and
Atlantic Southeast Airlines for $700 million, represent good value.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the labor front, they have a bit more of a challenge,''
Engel said. ``His particular problem is the pilots signed a
concessionary agreement (in 1996), and they seem to want revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The first contract negotiations with 9,000 pilots dealt with
setting wage rates for operating new equipment: the Boeing 737-800,
the 777, and the 767-400. Much of the company's efforts to remain a
top-tier carrier were tied to acquiring the 777 and the 767-400 for
use on busy domestic routes. The 737-800 will be used on the
lucrative Shuttle, in response to US Airways's using new planes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta suggested an hourly rate for the 777 of $239, but the
pilots wanted more than $300. In a bold move, Mullin deferred
delivery on nine of the eleven 777s the airline had ordered, saying
in the annual report that ``since we were unable to reach an
agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, that aircraft is no
longer part of Delta's current fleet plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a contract was reached on the new aircraft, and wages
for those who pilot 777s start at $250 but will increase at rates
to be determined in future negotiations. That initial agreement was
seen by both management and rank and file as removing a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Without good morale, customer service will suffer, and Mullin
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   He is frequently seen on the company's campus near Hartsfield
International Airport in Atlanta, chatting up employees _ not
surprising for one of seven sons who grew up being active in his
father's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual, for example, for Mullin to stop by the
operations control center _ the nerve center of any airline _ to
talk with employees early on a Saturday morning or to meet small
groups of pilots as they formally make the transition from first
officer to captain.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin's intellect is astonishing, friends say, but he is far
from aloof. They say he is an engaging person, but fearless and
tenacious. (He once entered a fencing competition and won. He met
his wife, Leah _ she is a board member of the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation and active in promoting medical research _ by writing to
her about the Peace Corps when she was a volunteer in Peru.)
</P>
<P>
   The only time he bristled during a two-hour interview was at the
mention of a concern some pilots have: that he is a money man who
does not care what type of company he runs, as long as he has
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no evidence of that at any point in my
career,'' Mullin said. ``I am a steward of this company. I
inherited a great company, and my goal is to leave it substantially
better off. I want to make Delta the greatest airline in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said that Delta's pilots will be the best paid in the
industry, but the negotiations will be pivotal to the long-term
success of the airline and of Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Nichols, a Delta pilot and union spokesman, said the rank
and file ``have high expectations for this contract.'' While it is
clear that Mullin is trying to improve morale and reverse the
legacy of Ron Allen, ``he's got a ways to go'' in order to win
employees back, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran pilot who has spent nearly 30 years with Delta
said Mullin's big challenge is to motivate younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a world of talent there, and if he can tap into it,
then Katie bar the door, this will be someplace special. And that's
why I am excited about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the comment, a gleam appeared in Mullin's eye.
Almost 57, he has eight more years to accomplish his lofty goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicit in that statement is there is a real belief in the
company,'' Mullin said. ``There is an enormous opportunity in front
of us, and I wouldn't want to be anyplace else. This company is the
best platform in America to achieve greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether Mullin's strategic thinking, political
skills, and mathematical background can make a Massachusetts-born
banker whose first job was bagging groceries at the A&AMP;P king of the
airline industry.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The plan sounded incredibly simple when Kathy
Delaney-Smith explained it. She took her Harvard women's basketball
calendar down from the wall, flipped through the pages and counted
the seven weeks remaining in the regular-season. Daily practices,
weightlifting twice a week, and games against Ivy League opponents
on weekends. Chemotherapy at Dana Farber on Tuesdays. In less than
a week, Delaney-Smith begins the first of four treatments for Stage
2 breast cancer. Almost two months of radiation will follow the
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her office at the Lavietes Pavillion, the 50-year-old
did not hesitate to discuss her new routine. Since the discovery of
a lump in her right breast, core biopsy, diagnosis and surgery all
took place in less than two weeks, the busy coach quickly dismissed
her initial fear. The thought of potent chemicals being pumped into
her body does not make Delaney-Smith pause. She jokes about losing
her shoulder-length, sandy blonde hair, flipping it back in a mock
show of vanity. And although she might miss a few practices, her
doctors said that coaching the 12 remaining Crimson contests was a
``completely reasonable expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   After Delaney-Smith went public with news of her breast cancer
early this month, she was inundated with flowers, cards, e-mails,
and phone calls from former players and friends made during 30
years of coaching. The response has overwhelmed Delaney-Smith. But
the women who played under her at Westwood High School and Harvard
are not surprised by the outpouring of support. Scattered
throughout the country as they attend top law and business schools,
direct board meetings, perform orthopedic surgery and raise
families, former players have not forgotten the lessons taught by
Delaney-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The coach views basketball as an opportunity to educate young
women about life and the skills needed to take on challenges. She
cares not only about the player, but also the person, encouraging
confidence, building close relationships with every squad and
leading some former players to call her ``a second mom.'' At a
recent surprise 50th birthday party, 20 players who graduated from
Westwood showed up, impressive considering it has been almost two
decades since she coached high school girls.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney-Smith emphasizes the importance of mental preparation,
believing strongly in the power of positive thinking. She fights
for what she believes in, whether it is better uniforms, night
games, or equality. She never takes herself or her sport too
seriously, advising Crimson players to tell jokes during wind
sprints at the end of practice. She hates to lose, but doesn't
dwell on losses.
</P>
<P>
   Although upset by the news that Delaney-Smith has breast cancer,
former players have taken comfort in all they learned from their
coach. If Delaney-Smith approaches her fight against cancer the way
she taught players to handle obstacles, they have every confidence
she will beat the disease. From all indications, Delaney-Smith
seems to be putting her own advice to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one who spends a lot of time worrying about things,''
said Delaney-Smith. ``Nothing in life has ever caused me to do
that. I'm very in the moment. Other than the shock of finding out I
had cancer, fear didn't stay with me very long. Maybe it will catch
up with me, but I don't think so. I feel whatever has been dealt
me, I'll get through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would change my life a little bit because I had to
have more medical appointments and I had to slow down a little bit,
but I didn't want it to totally disrupt my professional life or my
family life. And I didn't want people to feel sorry for me. I've
talked with a lot of people who have gone through this and
everything is highly individual. I have a lot of confidence in my
strength to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It takes a strong woman to lead a high school team into a locker
room filled with boys in various states of undress. But back in the
1970s at Westwood high, Delaney-Smith wanted to make an important
point and saw no other way to do it. She would not tolerate the
girls' basketball being treated as second-class citizens; visiting
boys teams should not be entitled to use the girls' team's locker
room when other facilities were available, and the girls and their
coach would no longer wait an hour while the boys changed.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning from an afternoon away game, Delaney-Smith led
her players into their locker room to collect their belongings.
Notified earlier in the day of the young coach's plan, school
authorities warned that severe repercussions might follow such an
action. But Delaney-Smith did not change her mind. She walked into
her office inside the locker room, pulled the shades down and
completed her post-game paperwork. Her players got what they needed
out of their lockers and left for home. Never again has a visiting
boys team ever used the girls' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unacceptable that we should wait and not be able to get
into our own locker room,'' said Erin DiVinchenzo, who graduated
from Westwood in 1983 and followed Delaney-Smith to Harvard. ``She
made us march in there when the boys' team was in there. You're a
15-year-old girl and you're hysterical. You can't believe it. She
said, `We're going to go in there, get our stuff, and do what we
have to do.' She made her point. As a young girl growing up, you
realized there was no reason to accept second best.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Madeline McCoy, who graduated from Westwood in 1978 and
saw four of seven sisters play for Delaney-Smith: ``She gave me
that love of the game where you wanted to work so hard for her. She
was so for women in sports. When we started playing, (the idea of)
women in sports was just really getting going. No one really gave
us the time of day, and she fought for everything. She was so big
on having you act like ladies, but play like guys on the court. She
was someone who expected a lot out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaney-Smith also expected a lot from Westwood administrators.
</P>
<P>
   During 11 years as a high school coach, she filed countless
grievances, asking for everything from equal practice time to equal
pay. She did not take no for an answer. She did not stop until her
program ranked among the best in the state in terms of the support
it received from school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney-Smith got state-of-the-art uniforms with players' names
on the back to replace plaid, wool skirts, turtle necks, and
pinafores. The team practiced a choreographed pre-game warmup that
made players feel like professionals. Young girls all over Westwood
aspired to play basketball at the high school. She sought out
college opportunities for her players. She fought to play night
games and her teams drew sellout crowds. And Delaney-Smith won.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney-Smith's career record at Westwood was 204-31, including
an unequaled six undefeated regular seasons, one Massachusetts
state title and a 96-game, regular-season winning streak. Her
legendary accomplishments led to National High School Coach of the
Year honors in 1981. Not bad for a woman who applied to coach
swimming at Westwood and took the basketball job only after some
prodding from the superintendent. Not bad for a coach who spent
many of her early practices scouring basketball reference books for
drills and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the first person I can remember other than my parents
who said to me, `You can do anything you want. You can be anything
you want,' in a way that you really believed it,'' said Jackie
MacMullan, who graduated from Westwood in 1978. ``That's a pretty
neat message to give a kid. She helped me a tremendous amount.
Anyone can teach you a layup. It had nothing to do with that. It
had to do with self-esteem, believing in yourself. She's the best
coach I've ever had, bar none.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired to coach Harvard in 1982, Delaney-Smith has made history
at the Ivy League institution. Under her guidance, the Division 1
women's program has won six Ivy titles, including the first in
school history in 1985-86. The Crimson have made three appearances
in the NCAA tournament, shocking the country with their first-round
victory over Stanford in 1998. The 71-67 triumph marked the first
time in tournament history that a 16th-seeded team had beaten a No.
1-seed. It also marked a high-point in Delaney-Smith's Harvard
tenure.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... the Family.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first wave of the Dawn Powell appreciation began with
Wilson's 1962 essay _ ``a little time bomb ticking away for 30
years,'' according to the critic Terry Teachout, who refers to her
books as ``dry martinis.'' Wilson began the piece with the
question, ``Why is it that the novels of Miss Dawn Powell are so
much less well known than they deserve to be?'' and concluded that
her books were ``quite on a level with those of Anthony Powell,
Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark.'' Big stuff from a big name.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell remained locked in obscurity. In 1972, Matthew
Josephson wrote a long, laudatory appraisal for The Southern
Review. It hardly created a stir. Fade to black again until 1981,
when a graduate student at the University of Minnesota named Judith
Faye Pett completed a dissertation on Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, Vidal was asked in The Antioch Review who the
most underrated American author was. He named Powell, calling her
``a comic writer as good as Evelyn Waugh and better than Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   More blank space. Powell remained a cult figure, a secret
handshake among a chosen few.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1987 Vidal's seminal piece appeared in The New York
Review of Books, triggering the second wave of the Powell revival.
``Not that many people read it but it reaches the right people,''
Tim Page said of the publication. ``Her comeback wouldn't have
happened without his piece. He is a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of Powell's was in print at that time. Two years later,
the Quality Paperback Book Club reissued three of her novels. In
1990, Vintage Books did the same, followed by the Yarrow Press, a
feisty little New York outfit, now defunct, that printed two of her
books in paper. All were out of print in 1993. The Dawn Powell
revival had stalled yet again. Gore Vidal notwithstanding, the
woman was a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of writing always has a difficult time,'' said
Francine Prose, a writer and critic familiar with Powell's work.
``It is not affirmative in the obvious ways. Oprah is not going to
pick a Dawn Powell book for her book club.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Page, who had stumbled on Wilson's 1962 essay in 1990 and
had scoured secondhand bookstores across the country for her work
while traveling as the music critic for Newsday. He fell in love
with her writing and brought the idea of reissuing her books to his
literary agent, Melanie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Michael Moore, one of four partners who
founded Steerforth Press in 1993, talked to Jackson while in New
York looking for material. ``I'd never heard of Dawn Powell until I
saw the Vidal piece,'' Moore said. ``Melanie Jackson told me that
one of her writers had the crazy idea of putting out Dawn Powell
again. She said: `I can't sell it to anyone. It has been tried and
it didn't work.' '' Moore bit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The result in 1994 was ``Dawn Powell At Her Best,'' a hardbound
collection published by Steerforth of two novels and nine short
stories. Margo Jefferson gave it a lavish review in the daily New
York Times, opening daylight for the first time to an audience
beyond the literary set.
</P>
<P>
   Page had borrowed money to buy many of Powell's papers from
Jacqueline Rice, a friend of Powell's who was executor of her
estate until 1993. At that time, Page and a lawyer he retained
persuaded her to step down. According to Page and Peter Skolnik,
now the Powell estate attorney, Rice essentially did nothing after
Powell's death to promote the work and allowed a number of titles
to fall into the public domain by failing to renew the copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   In the trove were Powell's diaries, considered by some critics
to be finer than her novels. Page edited them and Steerforth
published the finished product in hardcover in 1995. No one had
known they existed until Page found them. In a cover piece in The
New York Times Book Review, Teachout called the diaries ``one of
the outstanding literary finds of the last quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachout had called Charles McGrath, editor of the Times review,
to plead for a Sunday review. McGrath, it turned out, was a big
Powell fan dating from his days as a fiction editor at The New
Yorker, where he had learned of her from the magazine's longtime
chief fiction editor, Roger Angell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a no-brainer,'' said McGrath, who not only commissioned
a review but put it on the cover of the section. McGrath scotched
incessant comparisons of Powell to Dorothy Parker. ``She's a much
better writer than Parker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Page, now the artistic advisor to the St. Louis Symphony, had
been convinced that earlier efforts had failed because Powell's
books were reissued in paperback, and the Times doesn't review
paperbacks in depth. Also, big reviews need new fodder. The
diaries, issued in cloth, fit the bill on both counts. His strategy
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, Updike weighed in with his warm essay on Powell
in The New Yorker after Steerforth editors had sent a letter to his
home requesting a review. Chip Fleischer, another Steerforth
cofounder, called the bold strategy ``a once-in-a-decade thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steerforth had been gradually reissuing Powell's
novels in handsome paperback since 1994. In 1998, it published a
biography of Powell that Page had written. Last year, Henry Holt
and Company published a collection of her letters, edited by Page,
and a set of her plays. Hilarious and tragic, the letters make rare
reading. ``If you just had the letters, you'd have a lot,'' says
McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   The Dawn Powell revival is secure. Almost everything is in print
that should be. Her books sell modestly but steadily _ none has
sold more than 15,000 yet _ but they appear to be picking up steam.
And safe in the Library of America, she will never again disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And a good thing too. Powell's life of 86-proof pain did not rob
her of the droll voice that elevated her writing until her death.
``This is going to be a sorrowful letter,'' she wrote to a friend
in 1951, ``so we must be very brave and not rustle our Kleenexes.''

<P>
   A soaring stock market fueled an unprecedented increase in
wealth for Americans between 1995 and 1998 as the number of
families owning stock rose to record levels, according to a Federal
Reserve Board survey charting changes over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation is enjoying a golden era of economic prosperity
and low unemployment, the Fed's 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances
also found evidence the boom has been stingy in distributing the
wealth to low-income wage earners, who fell behind because they
lacked the wherewithal to invest in stocks. In a troubling trend,
Americans across the income spectrum are more deeply in debt than
they were in the early part of the decade, though debt burdens are
heaviest for low-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich are getting richer, and they are getting richer
faster than the poor,'' David Wyss, economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, an economic consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., concluded
from the report.
</P>
<P>
   While middle-class and wealthy Americans' prosperity rose in
concert with the great bull market of the 1990s, what distinguished
the Fed's 1998 survey was the enormity of gains compared with past
surveys. In 1998, Americans' wealth far surpassed levels reached in
the late 1980s, when the stock market also was rising rapidly. The
Fed has conducted the survey every three years since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``While income continued a moderate upward trend'' in recent
years, ``net worth grew strongly, and the increase in net worth was
broadly shared by different demographic groups,'' the Fed report
said. Financial gains were especially large among middle-aged and
retired Americans in their peak saving and investing years.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, experts said, points to the growing dependence of
Americans on the stock market for their financial well-being. The
market has achieved a new record every year since 1995, producing
profits that could evaporate rapidly if there were a correction.
</P>
<P>
   Stock profits through 1998 were enormous. The value of stock
mutual funds and individual shares held by top-earning Americans
surged, at the median, to $150,000 in 1998 _ up 75 percent over the
past three years and triple levels a decade ago. Middle-class
Americans saw their stock portfolios grow 35 percent over the past
three years, to $11,500, while low-income earners posted small
gains in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, median family wealth _ the net worth for a family
that fell smack in the middle of all Americans _ rose 17.6 percent
from 1995 through 1998, a period in which the Dow Jones industrial
average surged from 3700 to more than 9200. That was more than
twice the growth rate of median family wealth for the prior three
years, 1992 to 1995. (The survey uses net worth to measure wealth.
Net worth subtracts a family's liabilities, such as a mortgage,
from its assets, such as real estate, stocks, and other
investments.)
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, wealth shot up even more. Average net
worth _ which gives more weight to the portfolios of the wealthy,
such as Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates or Internet executives
_ than do median figures, rose nearly 26 percent and reflected the
ballooning portfolios of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's survey was based on detailed interviews with 4,300
families. Although officials did not disclose individuals included
in the survey, the study was supplemented with tax records to
provide better information on the difficult-to-decipher holdings of
the richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Driving big increases for some was a record number of US
families _ nearly half _ who owned stock, either directly by
purchasing individual shares themselves, or through mutual funds
and retirement accounts. A decade ago, less than a third of
American families held stock. (Stock options, which are difficult
to value, were not included in wealth totals.)
</P>
<P>
   Investing in individual stocks, which lost favor when Americans
began pouring money into mutual funds in the early 1980s, made a
comeback, which experts said may be due to the growing popularity
of on-line brokerage accounts, day trading, and Internet stocks.
Direct investments in shares accounted for nearly 23 percent of all
financial assets in 1998, a 7 percentage-point jump in three years.
Mutual funds, which also included huge stock portfolios, were
little changed at 12.5 percent of all financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying for decades that it would be a good
thing when workers . . . were stock owners,'' said John Weicher, a
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. That trend toward more stock
ownership ``is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Going against the broad trend of Americans getting ahead were
the figures for those who earn $25,000 or less. Even though some
had stock profits, the median net worth of low-income Americans
declined by 20 to 25 percent from 1995 to 1998. The median net
worth also dipped for minorities, in contrast to big gains among
those with higher incomes and among white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But even for those whose portolios are flush, longer-term trends
are less spectacular, said Edward Wolff, a leading expert on wealth
data. The Gulf War recession and a sagging stock market in the wake
of the 1987 correction took away much of the gains earned in the
stock market runup of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the gains are) just catch-up to where it should've
been,'' said Wolff, an economics professor at New York University.
Looking at gains over the past decade are ``not as spectacular as
looking to '95 to '98.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, debt levels are up sharply. Nearly 13 percent
of Americans spend more than 40 percent of their income on debt,
including mortgages on homes. That is up from a 11 percent or less
in all prior year's surveys. ``People are mortgaging themselves to
death so that they can buy a slightly bigger car,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite wider ownership of stocks, Weicher of the Hudson
Institute estimated that a quarter of Americans' wealth still rests
in their homes, with only about 9 percent in stocks. A record
two-thirds of all families own their primary residence, the Fed
survey said. More are also entering the financial mainstream: 90
percent of families now have a checking account.

TJX'S BIGGEST BARGAIN MAY BE STOCK PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TJX, the owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, is famous
for selling brand-name clothes at a discount. Is the Framingham
company's stock also a bargain at current prices?
</P>
<P>
   A number of money managers and analysts think so, especially
afer watching the stock drop from 34 to 19 since July, a 44 percent
markdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is cheap; we like it a lot,'' said James Carroll, a
value manager with Loomis Sayles. Lee Backus, an analyst with
Buckingham Research Group, is just as bullish. ``This is a heck of
a buying opportunity,'' said Buckingham, who thinks the stock could
climb 50 percent over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   So how did TJX find itself so battered down?
</P>
<P>
   A little background is in order here. Following a 1995
acquisition of Marshalls, TJX went on a winning streak that lasted
four years. The company established itself as a leader in a
category called off-price retailing, a specialty that appealed to
shoppers who wanted quality merchandise but also wanted to save a
buck.
</P>
<P>
   As Globe columnist Joan Vennochi put it a few years ago, ``The
best part of shopping at Marshalls is that you can buy a lot and
not feel guilty. You don't have to sneak the shopping bag into the
house when everyone else, especially your spouse, is sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1999, sales at TJX grew steadily, both from new
stores and old ones; earnings increased dramatically, and the stock
went from 3 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last summer, TJX swooned, along with retail stocks in
general. Rising interest rates led Wall Street to conclude that
consumer spending would get pinched. That hasn't happened yet, but
it still could if the Federal Reserve hikes rates a few times this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A second fear was competition from e-commerce. As Wall Street
watched all those dot-com retail commercials on television,
analysts worried that the new challengers would take a big bite out
of holiday sales at traditional retailers like TJX. It didn't
happen. It turned out there was plenty of business to go around.
But the worries were there.
</P>
<P>
   And then TJX gave investors a reason to worry even more. In
early December, the company said its same-store sales had declined
1 percent in the month of November. TJX blamed the subpar results
on very warm weather. A plausible explanation, but Wall Street
wasn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that takes no prisoners,'' said Carroll, of
Loomis Sayles. ``It marches you out and shoots you.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing led some to wonder if more than warm weather
was plaguing TJX. Did the company have the wrong mix of
merchandise? Would it have to cut prices and margins to move
holiday goods?
</P>
<P>
   TJX dispelled some of the immediate fears when it announced a
respectable 4 percent gain in same-store sales for December.
Apparel sold well, and so did other merchandise. The stock got no
lift from the news. ``We seem to be stuck in a trading range,''
complained one TJX shareholder, who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The company itself is not interested in discussing the vagaries
of the stock market. But in a telephone interview, its vice
president of investor relations, Sherry Lang, painted a rosy
picture of TJX's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen any fundamental change in consumer
behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is comfortable with current analyst estimates of
1999 earnings of $1.65 per share, Lang said. Over the next few
years, TJX expects to grow earnings 15 to 20 percent annually. It
also expects to keep expanding both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls at a
healthy clip for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, there is some concern that the two chains will hit
the saturation point. After that, TJX will have to rely more
heavily on some of its newer concepts: a chain that sells home
goods, another that specializes in selling to lower-income

   Money managers who like the stock complain that Wall Street has
badly overreacted to a modest amount of bad news. ``This just shows
you how shortsighted the street can be,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others point out that at today's depressed level, TJX
sells for just 11 times earnings, compared to a multiple of almost
30 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. The potential for further
deterioration is small, say analysts, while the potential upside is
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great company with a terrific franchise,'' said
Backus. ``It will recover.''
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to start the recovery? A few more months of
solid sales would help. So would a signal that the Federal Reserve
is done raising interest rates. Or perhaps investors will have to
wait for the day when the high-flying technology sector comes back
down to earth and the world once again gets interested in searching
the racks for the kind of old-fashioned value that TJX represents.

<P>
   When Rhonda Giambro's grandmother handed down her beloved mink
coat to her 10 years ago, she was touched. That 1960s fashion
statment had accompanied Giambro to the Enchanted Village when she
was 8, to a Boston Common playground, and to lunch upstairs in
Filene's back when it had a restaurant. ``That coat is special,''
she says. ``It was given in love.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mink is also downright ugly, says the 42-year-old
Bostonian. ``The sleeves stop at the elbow so my arms stick out.
It's really full and round. It kind of makes me look like a crazy
person when I wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambro is one of many baby boomers who've inherited _ with
mixed feelings _ fur coats from their families in recent years.
They won't chuck the coats _ for memories' sake _ but they won't
wear them, either, because the styles are often outdated and some
women believe that fur coats are ostentatious and cruel to animals.
Says Giambro: ``I wouldn't go out and buy a fur today. It's
unethical.'' So, what to do with this heirloom?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Mother's Old Mink Rescue Company. The Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. design house specializes in using material from
old-fashioned mink coats to make more modern and wearable velvet or
wool jackets with mink collars and cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, headed by designer Lorraine Parish, is aiming to
capitalize on the sentimental value of a mother's or grandmother's
fur coat. ``People say, `Oh! I've got my mother's old mink!',''
says Parish. ``They'll tell me all about how she used to wear it
and then they'll say it's just sitting in their closet. . . . When
I tell them I can cut out their mother's monogram (as well as mink
for the collar and cuffs) and put it in a new coat, they're
thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Old Mink skirts around the anti-fur sentiment by
proclaiming that 30-year-old furs are recycled and therefore
harmless. ``Buying a new coat perpetuates the industry,'' Parish
says. ``But recycled fur is beautiful. It's out there and . . .
it's a waste not to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Giambro, who recently ordered a fur-trimmed black velvet
fitted jacket and matching dress from Parish, ``I volunteer for the
Alliance for Animals. They're really anti-fur activists (but) I
don't feel a conflict because (my fur) is recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother's coat was bought when people weren't aware of
the abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish is one of many fashion types to use nostalgia in
marketing in recent years. Consider Calvin Klein's 1998 rerelease
of the jeans made famous by Brooke Shields in 1980. And Steve
Madden's success with the platform shoe. Parish's niche may have
particular impact since fur was once such a ubiquitous fashion
accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing is a powerful symbol, says Ilene Beckerman, author of
``Love, Loss and What I Wore,'' a memoir of her life told through
the clothes she wore. ``People hold on to their wedding dress after
they no longer have a husband and the sweater from their old
cheerleading squad. If they don't have it, it's still in their
mind. . . . Clothing is a way we express ourselves. We're all
peacocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeri Dantzig, 45, certainly remembers walking around New York
City in the 1960s and '70s as her mother, Marilyn Dantzig, sported
a black mink with rhinestone buttons and a mandarin collar. ``My
mom was an educator so it was important for her to take us out. As
kids, we would go to the ballet, the theater, and French
restaurants. When we went, we dressed,'' recalls the Vineyard Haven
resident.
</P>
<P>
   When her mom moved to Florida 15 years ago, she passed the coat
on to Jeri, who never wore it much. ``It never felt right. When I
was going to a formal function . . . I'd scoot myself to the
coatroom really quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Parish, Dantzig will soon be wearing a crimson
velvet cropped jacket with mink collar and cuffs and her mother's
original monogram. ``This is really custom. It's Lorraine's and my
mom's.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are getting older so it's nice when you get their
special things. . . . I have a pin that I'm going to wear on it
that was my grandmother's. This (ensemble) will make me feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish, 48, grew up in Huntsville, Ala., where her father owned
an auto parts store and her mother kept the books. She doesn't
recall her late mother wearing a fur, although her mother's sister
insists that she did. Parish, whose customers now include Debra
Winger and Carly Simon, learned to sew in her home economics class.
``I have really long arms and legs. My bell bottons were always too
short,'' says the 5-foot-8-inch designer.
</P>
<P>
   Her first love was ballet and jazz dancing. But after studying
in New York and Los Angeles for five years, she gave it up, got
married, and moved to Baltimore, where she opened an antique
clothing store in 1974. In 1976, Parish began designing dresses,
pants, and other casual womenswear out of a loft in New York City.
Her lines, which featured antique fabrics, were a hit, and she sold
to such stores as Henri Bendel, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Neiman
Marcus. ``I had a nice life in New York,'' says Parish. ``My
business, my beautiful loft, and my marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parish hated the dirt, noise, and expense of New York. When
her marriage failed in 1979, she sold her loft, relocated to the
Vineyard and opened her first retail store in Chilmark. ``I always
believed I'd be a big fish in a little pond. (Huge success) would
never have happened for me in New York. There's too much
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish's gamble paid off. Wealthy vacationers embraced her
whimsical free-flowing linen dresses and silk gauze skirts and
jumpsuits (some had air-brushed designs) and by 1987, her annual
sales peaked at $1 million. With loans easy to obtain in the 1980s,
says Parish, she boldly opened additional stores in Aspen, Colo.,
and on Newbury Street in Boston. ``I was only in my 30s. I didn't
know what I was doing,'' she says. In 1989, she paid the price _
she was forced to declare bankruptcy and close two stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now Parish operates under a less-is-more philosophy. She has
just one store in Vineyard Haven, which is technically her home.
She employs two seamstresses and pays a factory in Connecticut to
manufacture her designs.
</P>
<P>
   Parish also does trunk shows throughout the year in various
Northeastern cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. She
rents hotel suites and sets up racks of up to $100,000 worth of
clothing. Customers invited by postcard buy off the rack.
</P>
<P>
   Known for her womenswear made of natural fabrics in simple,
classic silhouettes, Parish started Mother's Old Mink Rescue
Company as a separate business this fall. Seeing an old picture of
Grace Kelly in a crimson dress with mink cuffs ``reminded me of my
crimson velvet; I was inspired,'' she says. ``I came to Boston to
look for fake fur,'' but the selections turned her off.
Improvising, she went to a thrift store, bought an old mink coat,
and made a jacket sample. At her next trunk show, her customers,
excited by the sample, began talking about their mothers' old minks
_ and a company name was born.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Parish's customers call her to order a brochure
highlighting the styles she can create (swing, riding, and fitted
cropped jackets). Matching skirts and pants are available. She
mails out swatches of velvets or wools, and customers mail her
their furs or bring them to her trunk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Charging $250 to $275 to create the jackets, Parish can also
provide mink or other fur for about $50 more for customers who
don't have their mother's coats. ``I have friends around the
country scouting thrift shops,'' she says. ``There are tons of furs
out there from the '60s _ hideous stoles . . .,
three-quarter-length sleeves, coats with narrow shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish completes most of her orders within three weeks. The
Connecticut factory makes the jacket bodies and ships them to the
Vineyard, where Parish will stitch on, by hand, the fur collar and
cuffs.

MEDIA FLU COVERAGE IS A PLAGUE OF PROPAGANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuning into NBC's ``Today'' show last week, I was relieved to
hear from several health-care experts that the current flu epidemic
is not as grave as media hysterics have made it sound.
</P>
<P>
   While the outbreak is heavy in parts of the country and the
virus's symptoms ``uncomfortable,'' these experts told Matt Lauer,
we are not technically in the middle of a flu pandemic. Media
coverage is being driven instead by two factors, they suggested: a
slow news month and a flurry of ads touting new prescription flu
remedies like Relenza.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that we were not as bad off as we'd imagined was
headline news in my household, which under the influence of
propagandists like Tom Brokaw had spent the past two weeks
reenacting death-bed scenes from ``The Andromeda Strain'' while
feeling like, well, victims of a bona-fide flu epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Our 3-year-old was over her pneumonia (I'm forwarding her charts
to Al Roker for peer review), though not two nagging ear
infections. After five days of high fever, I'd finally tamed the
bronchitis that had left me wheezing like a pawnshop accordion.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who also suffers from asthma, had only been to the
emergency room once. She and I did spend New Year's Eve in bed,
nursing a combined body temperature of 204.5 degrees and wondering
if we could reach Dr. Jack Kevorkian by speed dial, but that may
have just been a bout of pre-millennial ague.
</P>
<P>
   My 79-year-old aunt, a Christmas houseguest of ours, spent two
nights, but only two, in Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, taken there
by ambulance after collapsing in the street. Her pneumonia is
possibly psychosomatic, however _ the X-rays aren't all that clear.
Meanwhile, she's under doctor's orders to stay inside her apartment
until April, or whenever Dan Rather says it's safe to come out.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is improving back home in New Hampshire, where it's
only a matter of days before Bill Bradley drops by to photo-op his
new Medicare proposal. My son is back at work, fully recovered and
ready to believe any lie Ted Koppel tells him. The cats and
tropical fish all seem to be alive, though nobody remembers feeding
them between Boxing Day and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we were under the sway of New York Times reporters
who've seen too many science fiction movies,'' I told family
members last week. I specifically mentioned Gina Kolata, the Times
medical writer who has written a new book about the 1918 flu
epidemic that killed 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kolata probably convinced her editors that a couple of scary
page-one flu stories would be good for hardcover sales,'' I said.
``No wonder we panicked. Who knew all we needed was chicken soup,
ginger ale, and Steve Brill?''
</P>
<P>
   The more I thought about it, the more this media-driven,
viral-overreaction angle explained a lot of weird stuff that has
been happening lately.
</P>
<P>
   Take the New England Patriots' swoon. Star wide receiver Terry
Glenn caught what was said to be the flu (probably a mild head
cold) and missed the Pats' final two games. Glenn was suspended for
avoiding the team doctor and missing a couple of pre-game meetings.
Teammates questioned his gutsiness, but my guess is that Glenn was
fooled by Cassandras like ABC's Dr. Timothy Johnson into believing
that simply getting out of bed was a physical impossibility, never
mind taking a few whacks from 230-pound cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Swift strikes me as another potential victim of flu-scare
fever. Dropping the old ``my daughter had pneumonia'' dodge (like I
ordered mine a state chopper, Jane!), the lieutenant governor
finally came to her senses and took full responsibility for her
abuses of high office. It's like I told my own boss last week.
Given the choice of keeping my job or staying home listening to
talk radio, I can work through a few sniffles. OK, and I promise
not to expense the temp nanny or the Thera-Flu.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, my HMO, declared bankruptcy the same day I
renewed my erythromycin prescription. Coincidence? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Like Swift and the Harvard Pilgrim auditors, I'm no longer in
denial about what's really going on with this, uh, public health
``crisis.'' I am, however, concerned about the media and its
continuing effect on my family's health. Particularly worrisome is
the prospect of another slow news month coupled with the February
ratings ``sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   Under competitive pressure, Bryant Gumbel could really start
messing with our immune systems. There could be a Kolata-scripted
miniseries that sends everyone back to the ER.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Time Warner could absorb Harvard Pilgrim and put Katie
Couric in charge of the vaccine program. Massive reinfection by
CNN, bolstered by the campaign to grab market share for Relenza,
could pose as big a threat to my loved ones as the A-Sydney virus.
Maybe bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, I'm recommending they all drink plenty of
fluids, have regular Drudge Report checkups, and wash their hands
thoroughly after reading the Times. The rest of you are on your
own.

THE LITERARY RESURRECTION OF DAWN POWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dawn Powell wrote sentences like ``Never give a guest Dexedrine
after dark.''
</P>
<P>
   She called Jean-Paul Sartre ``the Hopalong Cassidy of France,''
and wrote of Mary McCarthy's novels, ``These last two starts are
invigorating _ like a brisk whiff of the stable on a clear winter
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell wrote like a dream. She died like a pauper. For almost
half a century in New York City, she limned the place with a
glittering, mordant eye. Diana Trilling called her ``our best
answer to the familiar question, `Who really says the funny things
for which Dorothy Parker gets credit?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Literary lions like John Dos Passos and Edmund Wilson adored
her. Ernest Hemingway called her his favorite living writer. The
editor Maxwell Perkins personally handled three of her novels for
Scribner's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Powell died at 68 in 1965, she was buried in an
unmarked grave in New York's City Cemetery on Hart Island, off the
Bronx _ an elixir for a cultivated New York crowd and a stranger to
the rest of the world. Few of her books were in print at the time.
By 1970, all had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The long winter of Dawn Powell had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted until 1987, when Gore Vidal wrote in The New York
Review of Books that she ``should have been as widely read as, say,
Hemingway or the early Fitzgerald.'' This grounded an astonishing
literary resurrection that, 35 years after her death, is now
complete. Dawn Powell has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 11 of her 15 novels are in print, as are collections of
her plays, short stories, diaries, and letters. The Library of
America, the nonprofit publisher of the core canon of American
literature, has decided to reissue eight of her novels in a
two-volume set. Powell will join the likes of Melville, Faulkner,
and Hemingway; once in the Library of America editions, she will
never be out of print again.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is even on the Internet; she has surfaced on salon.com,
where Vidal last year named ``The Golden Spur'' one of his five
favorite postwar novels. And two weeks ago, David Mamet optioned
two of her books for movies. ``She's happening,'' said Gerald
Howard, editorial director of the New York-based Broadway Books.
Howard has organized a Dawn Powell evening at a New York bookstore
for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like so many New Yorkers, Powell was an emigre from the Midwest
_ Mount Gilead, Ohio, in her case. Six of her novels, including her
most commercially successful effort, ``My Home Is Far Away,'' are
set in Ohio. A brief stint on a farm drove her to New York in 1918
and prompted the observation: ``There's something about farm life
that gives you the strength to run anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell ran to New York and never left. It was there that she
wrote nine of her signature novels about the city and there that
she married Joseph Gousha in 1920. The union was a tumultuous,
unhappy affair marred by alcohol, abusive behavior, and depressive
fugues. Her son, Joseph Jr. (Jojo), was born autistic in 1921, and
he required lifelong, expensive treatment that left her chronically
on the brink of financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   While she could uncork lines like, ``There is so great a premium
on dullness that it seems stupid to pass it up,'' Powell took her
satire seriously. ``Wit is the cry of pain, the true word that
pierces the heart,'' she wrote in her diary. ``If it does not
pierce, then it is not true wit. True wit should break a good man's
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She tempered a withering eye with a refreshing absence of
judgment. Her stories of Gotham decadence are not morality tales.
To her everlasting credit, Dawn Powell was no crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``True gaiety is based on a foundation of realism,'' she wrote.
``All, right, we know we're dying, we know we're poor, that is off
our minds _ we eat, sleep, make merry but we are not kidding
ourselves that we are rich and beautiful or that Santa Claus and
two blondes will soon come down the chimney. There is only sorrow
in people making believe _ sorrow and sordidness in stories of
invincible Peter Pan fairy-godmother worlds. Gaiety should be
brave, it should have stout legs of truth, not a gelatine base of
drams and wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her field of fire was downtown Manhattan in general, Greenwich
Village in particular. Her characters were louche, boozy writers,
editors, and artists of forgettable talent who on their best days
might be called amoral. They divided their time among cafes,
residential hotels, and cramped apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1954 novel, ``The Wicked Pavilion,'' Powell captured
their anomie through a now extinct American institution, the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people, and Dalzell was one of them, who were born
cafe people, claustrophobes unable to endure a definite place or
plan,'' she wrote. ``The cafe was a sort of union station where
they might loiter, missing trains and boats as they liked,
postponing the final decision to go anyplace or do anything until
there was no longer need for decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich Village was also her own matrix. She lived there for
four decades and was bereft when she moved a few blocks north in
1958. ``I have moved to a suburb,'' she wrote. ``Here at 26th and
Madison, no drugstores, newsstands, taxis stir from Friday till
Monday. I understand Fifth Avenue is a block away but which way?''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was an equal opportunity impaler. In the summer of 1942,
she stayed at Gurney's Inn, a tony spot at the tip of Long Island
that, she wrote, did not accept Jews as guests. This diktat
prompted a classic Powell romp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to meet Gentiles, who are really no
different from anybody else when you get to know them,'' she wrote
to a friend. ``It is filled with Schrafft hostesses _ genteel,
middle-aged widows who keep a Christian Science smile fastened on
their mugs until you take a poke at them. It was very pleasant
although I like a more restricted type of place _ one with no rooms
for Christians, either, just members of the Friends of Bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be a precedent for the elevation of a dead American
writer who was obscure at his or her death, but no one can name
one. Other native authors in eclipse at their deaths _ F. Scott
Fitzgerald and Nathaniel West to name two _ were brought back to
prominence posthumously. But both were successful, one wildly so,
at the heights of their careers. Powell's sales, in contrast,
rarely cracked 10,000 _ most far less.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a dead writer is particularly hard to market because,
crudely put, he or she cannot make the rounds of talk shows or sit
for the interviews necessary to sell books in the age of Oprah. So
the writer needs champions of stature and indefatigability, who in
turn need a long-term campaign strategy, a sense of timing, and
great luck. This confluence informs the Dawn Powell saga.
</P>
<P>
   There are two key figures: Gore Vidal and Tim Page, the former
Pulizer Prize-winning music critic for the Washington Post who was
the engine behind her revival. Without Vidal's literary heft and
Page's dogged attention, Powell would still be Upper West Side
cocktail party fodder. Finally, there is a tiny publishing outfit
in South Royalton, Vt., called the Steerforth Press that had the
lunatic idea seven years ago to reissue Powell's books.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in her resurrection was always an act of faith. Five
years ago, John Updike wrote in The New Yorker, ``The reputation of
Dawn Powell may be doomed to a perpetual state of revival. She is
too good a fiction writer _ too deft, funny, knowing,
compassionate, and poetic _ to be altogether forgotten yet not, in
a sense, emblematic enough to be one of the permanent exhibits in
the zoo of academically imposed American novelists.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminists, for example, have been uncomfortable with her because
she never addressed women's issues. Such truck never entered her
mind. ``The woman reader can find no comfort in identifying herself
with Miss Powell's heroines,'' Edmund Wilson said in a famous essay
about her in The New Yorker in 1962. ``The women who appear in her
stories are likely to be as sordid and absurd as the men.'' Added
Vidal in 1996, ``Powell was that unthinkable monster, a witty woman
who felt no obligation to make a single, much less a final, down
payment on Love and the Family.''

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... Harvard tenure.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The home court and level of competition may have changed, but
her winning ways and coaching philosophy remained the same. This
season, Harvard is 9-5 and stands atop the Ivy League without a
conference loss. When talking about the impact Delaney-Smith has
had on their lives, current and former Crimson players echo the
comments of Westwood alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Harvard lacking a lot of confidence as a basketball
player,'' said Trisha Brown, who graduated in 1987, was captain of
the Crimson's first Ivy championship team and has served as
assistant coach for eight years at her alma mater. ``From where I
started my freshman year to my senior year, it was an incredible
difference confidence-wise. I attribute that totally to Kathy. She
taught you so much, all the life lessons you should learn in four
years. I saw it with my teammates, too. Kids who struggled and
didn't believe in themselves left here such different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaney-Smith mentors Harvard students with her unique
combination of intense passion and unpredicatable humor. She works
tirelessly to disipline the mind as well as the body, believing
that a positive attitude produces positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of injuries when I was playing and everytime
something would happen, Kathy would always say, `I know you're in
pain, I know you're not happy that you can't play; but you can't
show that,' said Kelly Black, who graduated from Harvard in 1997.
``You have to convince yourself that whatever you are dealt is OK.
You have to act as if it's just the best thing that has happened to
you because the experience is teaching you things about life and
also making you a stronger person.''

   Delaney-Smith learned the most about life from her mother Peg
Delaney. Playing for her mother at Sacred Heart of Newton, she
became the first Massachusetts high school girl to score 1,000
points. But, as one might guess, her mother's most important
lessons came off the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard coach credits her mother with making her an
optimist. As she faces treatment for breast cancer, Delaney-Smith
carries the memory of her mother's positive attitude with her. She
also carries with her the memory of her mother's death from bone
marrow cancer nearly three years ago. And the memory of her
father's death from lung cancer nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of cancer in my family, but I think there's a
lot of cancer out there,'' said Delaney-Smith. ``It's like, `OK,
I'm just bringing another cancer to the family.' My mother dealt
well with her cancer. She lived a wonderful life while she was in
remission and she lived a wonderful life while she was on chemo.
That's probably why I don't have a fear of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when diagnosed in mid-December, Delaney-Smith had difficulty
telling her husband Francis Smith and son Jared Delaney-Smith. She
was uncertain about going public with her breast cancer, even
though a lumpectomy and node disection three days before Christmas
revealed no lymph node involvement and the prognosis for
Delaney-Smith is positive.
</P>
<P>
   But the more she thought about her situation, the more she saw
an opportunity to spread awareness, to remind women about
scheduling regular mammograms, to educate. Former players and
friends who sent along their best wishes helped the coach realize
the lessons that could be learned from sharing her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having cancer,'' said Delaney-Smith, ``is a reminder about
what's really important in life and the impact you can have on
people.''

MASSACHUSETTS BISHOP HEADED TO D.C. TO INTERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Right Reverend M. Thomas Shaw, who as bishop of
Massachusetts heads the nation's largest Episcopal diocese, next
month will settle in behind a distressed wooden desk in a cramped
US House of Representatives office and affix to his monastic robe
the orange badge of a congressional intern.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 54, is taking a one-month leave from his diocesan duties
in an effort, he said, to learn more about the inner workings of
Washington as he struggles to find a clearer voice in public policy
for his church. He will conduct his exploration as an intern for
Representative Amo Houghton, a New York Republican, who is an
active Episcopalian with strong ties to Massachusetts and a long
friendship with Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's move appears to be unprecedented. Congressional
internships and fellowships, although dominated by students, have
drawn all manner of Americans, from future billionaire Bill Gates,
who was a page in 1972, to Carolina Panthers kicker John Kasay, who
was an intern last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But never a sitting bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of scientists, psychologists, statisticians, and
lawyers doing internships, but I've never heard of a
clergyperson,'' said Rick Shapiro, executive director of the
Congressional Management Foundation and an expert on congressional
offices. ``It would be great if every church leader could have a
similar experience, because they're dealing with the moral plane of
what is right and wrong, and that is the plane that public policy
has to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he began thinking about going to Washington more than
a year ago, as his parishioners debated how the church should react
to the House impeachment of President Clinton and the intensified
bombing campaign against Iraq. His own public policy interests
include issues affecting children, capital punishment, and debt
relief for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to discover something of what the role of the
church should be in public life,'' said Shaw, who has presided over
the diocese that covers the eastern third of Massachusetts since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best ways that I learn is through experiencing
something, and I thought that the best way for me to try and
understand this is to be with the people who govern our country on
a day-to-day basis for a while, and to see the kinds of pressures
that they're under and the sort of decisions that they have to
make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow interns will mostly be 18- to 21-year-old college
students with a passion for politics and, in many cases, a
hankering for the Capitol Hill happy hours that are a mainstay of
the intern social scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw will not be a typical intern, starting with his
clothing. He says that some days he will wear the long robe and
cross that are his monastic habit; other days he'll wear his purple
shirt and clerical collar; and some days he'll wear a suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most interns, Shaw will get a desk with a window,
unrestricted access to a congressman, and invitations to a variety
of meetings with top officials designed to introduce him to the
ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said he will attempt to get Shaw opportunities to spend
time with White House officials and Cabinet members, as well as
Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and noted civil
rights advocate, and Representative Tom Lantos, a California
Democrat and Holocaust survivor. Houghton also said he would bring
Shaw to New York to see how constituents interact with a member of
Congress, and he will bring him to a Renaissance Weekend gathering
of opinionmakers in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw chose Houghton's office because the two have been friends
for about 15 years, since Houghton showed up for a retreat at the
Cambridge monastery where Shaw lives. Shaw performed the wedding
ceremony for Houghton and his wife, Cohasset writer Priscilla Dewey
Houghton.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton, 73, is the former chairman of his family company,
Corning Glass Works, and has represented the southwesternmost
corner of upstate New York since 1987. As a young man he considered
entering the ministry (a step taken by his brother, a priest in
South Carolina), and later he debated becoming a missionary.
Instead he is an active layman who often goes on retreats to
monasteries and who heads a congressional institute on faith and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said he welcomes the opportunity to provide an
insider's look at the Capitol to his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unusual, but he's an extraordinary guy,'' Houghton
said. ``How many people take a month out when you are the head of
the largest diocese? How many people want to go into the political
arena, because it's fraught with danger? Also, why would you want
to associate with a Republican, because most of the members of the
ministry are Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   ``But here's a guy who's searching, and I think the thing that
he's trying to do is to find out where the church goes and what it
should represent in today's life,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is not naive about politics _ as a young man he volunteered
for presidential campaigns and as a bishop he has spent some time
in Washington. But he says he doesn't worry about being turned off
by what he sees in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in the gift of hope that's given to us as
Christians, and I believe that whatever I observe, I'll always be
able to see some hope in the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he sees his trip as part of his ``journey into the
heart of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our public life is very much a part of our journey,'' he said.
``One of the mistakes that we make often as people of faith is
trying to separate out our life of faith with the public life we
live or the communal life we live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church of the United States already maintains five
lobbyists in Washington who, guided by the church leadership, track
issues including immigration, civil rights, hunger, and welfarepolicy. This year the church's top legislative goals are to win
greater US funding for debt relief for poor countries and to
restore some food stamp benefits for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The church's top lobbyist said he would be ``thrilled'' to have
the bishop in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishop, like a young person coming to Washington, hopes by
being in the middle of it to learn about the process,'' said Thomas
Hart, director of government relations for the Episcopal Church.
``But his presence here will also offer a tremendous amount of
visibility and weight and experience to our work.''
</P>
<P>
   During Shaw's absence, the diocese will be administered by the
Right Reverend Barbara Harris, the suffragan, or assistant, bishop.
Upon his return, Shaw said he hopes to help the church and its
parishioners think through its role in public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very much in the power of prayer, but I think prayer
has to be informed. And so what I hope is that I'm going to learn
something about life in Washington to inform my prayer and to
inform the prayer of the people that I'm called to serve here in
Massachusetts,'' he said.

REINVENTING HEALTH INSURANCE IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is always a gap between politics and government. And that
gap is inevitably as wide and deep, or as narrow and shallow, as
the gap between promise and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates invariably reach for the levers that move people, the
emotional flashpoints that trigger the vote in the booth. So we're
subjected to last-minute barrages from would-be presidents: Who
resurrected Willie Horton? Should a little Cuban kid be denied his
freshly widowed father?
</P>
<P>
   Of vastly more import to the voters of Massachusetts (and Rhode
Island) is the collapse of Harvard Pilgrim, the bankrupt medical
insurance colossus, in whose jumble of mismanaged computer files
lie the numbers and ailments of a million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, or, more properly, the fear of the loss of adequate
health insurance, is the second-most-important issue in New
Hampshire, according to one candidate's polling, only tw points
behind education. No other issues _ not taxes, not crime, not
environment _ are even close. But health insurance _ who gets and
doesn't get it and who pays for them that ain't insured _ is a
third-rail issue in American politics: Touch it the wrong way and
your candidacy is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are having a big mud-pie fight over whose health
care scheme is better. Bill Bradley is Mr. Big Idea and Al Gore is
Mr. Once-burned-twice-shy. Dollar Bill bet his bankroll on making
health care his breakthrough issue. Gore, having seen how Mr. and
Mrs. Clinton were savaged in the administration's ill-fated
first-term national health insurance initiative, opts for
incremental steps and keeps pointing to the protective endorsement
of his buddy, Senator Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are gulping for air on this one; their party
doesn't like big government or entitlement programs, and Republican
voters tend to have their health insurance already, thank you, and
don't particularly care to pay more for someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the election-year blather does anything for the 1
million Massachusetts citizens whose coverage is in jeopardy
because of the way Harvard Pilgrim managed itself into receivership
on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time wunderkind of the Weld administration, Charlie
Baker, parachuted into the driver's seat at Harvard Pilgrim several
months ago. Good Old Charlie will fix it came the assurances from
those supposedly in the know. Well, Good Old Charlie didn't have a
clue, apparently, about how bad things actually were.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever was doing the due diligence was out to lunch. The
accountants were AWOL, or else taking their money under false
pretenses. The situation was far worse than advertised, we're now
told. No one knew how much money had been lost where. And Good Old
Charlie Baker, who made the fiscal trains run on time for
Weld-Cellucci, arrived on the scene like a firefighter entering a
burning building. He promptly fell through the floor into the
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the health care community has changed
permanently. There's too much at stake now, too much money owed,
too many careers on the line. No more business as usual. Whatever
numbers Baker comes up with now will be looked at with jaundiced
eyes. The system has careened out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Into the breach has stepped Attorney General Tom Reilly, whose
expertise is prosecuting criminals, not sorting out bankruptcies.
His first order of business is to stabilize the situation and
figure out who gets first crack at reorganizing the medical care
delivery system in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He designated some investment bankers to sort through the
options. As with any kind of train wreck, the first helpers on the
scene set up a triage station, sorting out the badly hurt from the
cases who can wait and making the hard decisions about not wasting
valuable time and manpower on cases that are too far gone. Clearly,
there will have to be the inevitable blue ribbon commission to sort
out this mess.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Cellucci administration's current lineup inspires
the sort of confidence that is essential at this stage: not the
governor, who was away in Florida vacationing while the Harvard
Pilgrim meltdown took place; not his lieutenant governor, who has
difficulty sorting out her babysitting arrangements; and not his
insurance commissioner, on whose watch the train wreck occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Once Reilly's no-nonsense initial sort-through takes place, the
Legislature will have to be involved. Do we let Harvard Pilgrim
fold? Does the state jump in with a big bailout? Do we sell off the
wreckage to a white knight, a for-profit private insurer that may
turn out to be a black knight? Do we set up a new kind of
not-for-profit entity?
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Tom Finneran's credentials as a rugged fiscal
conservative who will not be bullied into a panic solution are well
established. We'll need Finneran's crusty resolve on this one.
Senate President Birmingham's gubernatorial ambitions, plus his
ties to organized labor, should prove useful in selling what
eventually must be sold to the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the inevitable commission will have to include
providers (hospitals and doctors), employers (who pay the premiums
now), state regulators, and the HMOs. Just as clearly, there is not
enough money in the system as it exists. We will have to pay more.
We have to invent a new system on the fly.

`SOPRANOS' PALES NEXT TO REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget ``The Sopranos.'' Boston has its own Irish tenor, and we
get to watch him sing for free.
</P>
<P>
   The scriptwriters of the soap opera/cult phenomenon on Home Box
Office picked the wrong week to have their lead character dismiss
Boston as ``Scranton, with clams.'' Nothing that has happened yet
on HBO's hot series about the New York-New Jersey Mafia can compete
with recent developments in our own fair Mob backwater.
</P>
<P>
   Where else but in Boston could the discovery of a Mob burial
ground only steps from a favorite police watering hole feature a
collection of colorful characters with ties to the FBI, the
president of the state university system, and the Irish Republican
Army?
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts of cops unearthing the skeletons of what are
thought to be three victims of the Winter Hill Gang across from
Florian Hall read less like news reports than a Hollywood movie
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: a yellow striped party tent erected above a
wind-swept Dorchester burial site; an excavation hampered by
weather that went from springlike to frostbite almost overnight,
making the frozen ground far less willing to yield the Mob's
secrets than Kevin Weeks, the Winter Hill lieutenant who reportedly
has taken up singing in his federal cell to save his own neck.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected victims: one of the architects of a 20-year-old
$1.5 million bank heist in Medford, one of the crew of a North
Shore fishing boat that once crossed the Atlantic Ocean on an
ill-fated mission to deliver guns to the IRA and a beautiful, young
blond whose stepfather (and reputed lover), Stephen ``the
Rifleman'' Flemmi, ran the Winter Hill Gang with James ``Whitey''
Bulger. Bulger, of course, is the South Boston crime boss who has
spent the last five years on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List while
his brother William graduated from president of the Massachusetts
Senate to president of the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a uniquely Boston story, all right.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a new century and a new millennium. But how new is
the ``new'' Boston? We can redevelop the South Boston waterfront.
We can price the locals out of City Point. But Boston, it seems, is
forever in the grip of skeletons from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Who more than John Connolly, the retired, recently indicted FBI
man, personifies the way in which the past steals the future in
Boston?
</P>
<P>
   How often has Connolly recounted the story of Whitey Bulger
buying him an ice cream cone when he was an impressionable young
boy in South Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Connolly did not choose Whitey's path. Instead, he chose one of
two professions most revered by his Irish clan. He didn't become a
priest; he did the next best thing. He became a cop. How could he
have known in those heady days at Boston College that the future
would take him back to Whitey?
</P>
<P>
   He stands indicted now with Whitey and Flemmi on racketeering
charges, accused of helping the two mobsters, both of them his FBI
informants, continue their illegal activities under his protection.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether that alleged protection extended to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Will Weeks implicate Connolly in the violence represented by the
bones in that frozen Dorchester grave? Will Connolly sing, too? If
he does, who could he implicate? The Mob bosses or his own at the
FBI?
</P>
<P>
   Television critics contend that the appeal of ``The Sopranos''
is less the writers' depiction of the Mafia than their ability to
capture the ordinary venality of the human beings at the center of
a mythic criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The bones pulled from that weed-choked lot along the Southeast
Expressway are no fiction. John McIntyre, Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett
and Deborah Hussey _ however ordinary, however venal _ were once
made of flesh and blood. They left behind real people who mourn
them still.
</P>
<P>
   The unearthing of their skeletons should put an end to the
Bulger legend, the myth that Whitey was no more than a Boston Irish
rogue.
</P>
<P>
   There is no romance in murder, no heroics in flight from the
law, no honor in betrayal, even among thieves. On television, a
good scriptwriter can make the members of a Mafia family seem like
a modern-day Partridge Family.
</P>
<P>
   What we have seen on the nightly news in the last few days are
the literal skeletons of a city's past. There is nothing
entertaining about it.

BUSH, AIMING TO BURY MCCAIN, MAKES CERTAIN TO PRAISE HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ Governor George W. Bush, trapped in a tight
race before the first presidential primary, did Tuesday what any
politician might do: He directly attacked his top opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush suddenly stopped himself. Even as he disparaged
Senator John McCain for sounding ``amazingly similar'' to the two
Democratic candidates and produced an ad that specifically assailed
McCain's tax plan, Bush bent over backward to compliment the
Arizona senator. He insisted _ four times _ that he respects
McCain. He reminded a crowd of supporters that McCain is a
``worthwhile opponent.'' And in doing so, Bush highlighted the
unusual challenge he faces in the last 1 1/2 weeks of the New
Hampshire race: how to undercut McCain, a national war hero and
celebrity, without sounding petty or unnecessarily cruel.
</P>
<P>
   The two contenders have already taken a no-negative-ads pledge,
and they have thrown few serious barbs during the last six GOP
debates. But with McCain continuing to pose a serious threat in the
New Hampshire polls, Bush is grasping for ways to dismiss his
opponent, while at the same time respecting the high regard in
which McCain is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sensitive. I think it's good he is going out of his way
to say he respects John McCain, he considers him a friend,'' said
US Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was
campaigning Tuesday with Bush. ``I heard him say he's a good man
three or four times today. . . . There's a little risk in taking on
a guy who's viewed as a war hero. On the other hand, the stakes are
pretty high here. This stuff could actually become law, depending
on who becomes president.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest source of friction between Bush and McCain in
recent days has been tax cuts, an issue each began focusing on
weeks ago to appeal to the Republican Party's most conservative
wing. Bush is proposing a $483 billion tax cut over five years that
would affect earners in all tax brackets. McCain is offering a tax
cut half that size _ $237 billion over five years _ geared more
toward low- and middle-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has seized the smaller size of McCain's tax cut proposal as
an opportunity to differentiate their campaigns, using it as a
battering ram against the conservative record McCain built in the
US Senate. But it is also clear that, tactically, Bush and his
aides view taxes as a relatively safe battleground, one where they
can dismiss McCain's ideas without insulting the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush released the first television ad specifically
aimed at McCain. Filmed during a campaign stop in Pittsfield, the
ad spoke about McCain's philosophy of government, though it stopped
short of mentioning his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent trusts the people of Washington to spend money. I
trust the people of New Hampshire to make the right decisions for
their families,'' Bush said in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush defended his criticism of McCain, sounding almost
apologetic as he continued: ``If he says something I don't agree
with, I am going to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I darn sure don't agree with saying you're going to take $40
billion of employer-related benefits and have people pay taxes on
them. I think that is a mistake,'' Bush said. ``If you abolish
employer-related benefits to pay for a tax cut, it means working
people will have to pay those benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opponents charged that the ads were, in fact, negative.
Paul Young, a New Hampshire adviser to millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who has run his own negative ads, said: ``What it says
about what Bush is doing is that he's losing to McCain.'' As for
the no-negative-ads pledge, Young said, Bush is ``basically trying
to have his cake and eat it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Spiliotes, a Dartmouth College government professor,
said the ads were on the soft side of negative. ``In any primary
contest you have to distinguish between the candidates,'' Spiliotes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to tax employer benefits _ perquisites, such as
transportation, given to an employee in lieu of a pay raise or a
bonus _ have been the focal point of the tax cut argument since
last week, in many ways illustrating the Bush campaign's eagerness
to spotlight minute details rather than broader policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly has criticized McCain's tax plan for what he
says would be a $40 billion tax on employer benefits, despite
repeated denials from McCain aides that no such increase exists in
the senator's proposal. The McCain plan would exempt employer
benefits such as dependent care, continuing education and health
premiums from being taxed. Only fringe employer benefits such as
meals and transportation would be taxable, making the amount in
question only about $3.9 billion, not $40 billion, McCain aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's economic advisers are inventing figures out of
thin air,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications director. ``I
don't know how many times we can say it. There's no $40 billion tax
increase in this proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, a senior Bush adviser, said the Bush assessment came
from figures provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a
nonpartisan source. Rove also said Bush is not handling McCain more
delicately than he is anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says nice things about Gary Bauer and nice things about
Senator Hatch,'' Rove said. ``And he tries to say nice things about
Steve Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush supporters said there was a clear strategic advantage
to the tax debate: It depicts the Texas governor as the real
conservative, challenging McCain on ideological, not personal,
grounds. Tom Rath, a Bush adviser in New Hampshire, said the tax
debate clearly shows ``McCain has moved to the left.'' And US
Representative Charles Bass, Republican of New Hampshire and a
solid Bush supporter, described the McCain tax plan as one that
would ``please Lloyd Doggett or Richard Bonior or Dick Gephardt,''
all liberal members of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   But Rath added: ``We're not criticizing him as a person. We're
saying we have a difference of opinion with him, especially as he
continues to define himself to the middle and the left.''

<P>
   If this is January, students are building Lego robots at
Middlebury College. At Smith, they are learning how to change spark
plugs and oil filters. At the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, they are making chocolate truffles or Japanese flower
arrangements, and exploring the limits of ``World Peace Using
Common Kitchen Utensils.''
</P>
<P>
   This is winter term, a time-honored tradition at colleges across
the country when for four weeks students get the chance to take
courses far beyond the bounds of the usual catalog, turning physics
nerds into swingdancers or history majors into amateur blacksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   The period is meant as an interlude _ what one academic terms
``an intellectual sorbet'' _ between more substantial courses the
rest of the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   But with tuition rising and regular courses becoming more
demanding, the January term is also producing some tension among
college officials and parents who argue ``Sex, Death, and Fly
Fishing'' is no way to spend a $32,000-a-year education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my personal opinion, I've never been a great advocate of
winter term,'' said Middlebury Provost Ron Liebowitz. ``Twelve
weeks is an awfully short period for most courses, sciences
especially, and it'd be better to have 14 week semesters, rather
than this month in the middle. In literature you could read more,
in sciences you could do more labs. I'd say about half the faculty
think (winter term) is a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern stems from general worries about slippage in the
academic calendar over the past few decades. There are no data on
the average length of the academic year, but the national
association of college registrars says the general trend shows
colleges and universities moving from a system of quarters to
semesters, which means fewer days and an exam schedule that ends
before Christmas, as well as more lighter academic offerings in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by anecdote, the more tuition has risen, the less time
students are spending in class. When Congress was reauthorizing the
Higher Education Act in 1992, it required colleges that receive
federal aid offer a minimum number of class hours, with a range
depending on type of institution; Members of Congress, staffers
say, looked at their own college-age children and wondered why they
were home so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that the academic year should mean
something,'' said Tom Wolanin, a former staff member for the
Congressional Committee on Postsecondary Education, and now a
professor of education policy at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have tried to tighten standards for January
courses, too. Middlebury has a committee to review proposals for
winter term courses, and has tried to do away with what Liebowitz
calls the more frivolous offerings (``The Films of Brigitte
Bardot,'' a longtime favorite among male students, is no longer
among the offerings.) Colby College has instituted a requirement
that students spend 30-40 hours a week on ``Jan Plan'' courses.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been hard to change the essential spirit of the January
term. Students see it as a way to enjoy being on campus with
friends without the stresses of the regular term. With many courses
taught by alumni or even students, faculty see it as a break or
time to do research.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a January term squeezed in between two four-month
semesters started, by all accounts, at Colby, according to the
college's catalog, ``out of a desire to extend to students a
greater measure of academic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic responsibility is still defined pretty loosely. Colby's
Jan Plan offerings include ``Introduction to Astrophysics,'' but
also ``Woodworking'' and ``Contemporary Wicca.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlebury, another early proponent of the winter term, offers
``Thucydides and Tolstoy on War and Peace,'' but also vocal improv
sessions and ``Introduction to the Wheel,'' which teaches students
to shape ``pots with a purpose.'' At Hampshire College, students
can spend several days a week learning to follow and identify
wildlife tracks in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Colby and Middlebury are among schools offering credit for most
courses, and even requiring students to attend winter term. Smith
and MIT, among others, offer mostly noncredit courses, what Smith
calls ``risk-free'' (read: grade free) learning.
</P>
<P>
   The cold and vast cavern of the maintenance garage on Smith's
Northampton campus is about as far as you can get from a
traditional college classroom. There, 10 young women enrolled in
``Basic Auto Mechanics'' _ the most popular of Smith's Interterm
courses _ are watching David Cleveland and Dave Motyka demonstrate
how to spin the lug nuts off the rear wheel of a Subaru Legacy. The
local version of ``Click and Clack,'' the two men are the campus'
maintenance men _ class is canceled in the event of snow, because
they will be plowing the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The students learn how to change a tire, examine a canister
puncture seal so they know what to buy, and watch as the two men
walk them through an oil change.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know if you've got a flat tire?'' one student asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of noises,'' Cleveland replies.
</P>
<P>
   She jots this down in her notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work pretty intensely during the regular semester, this is
something the college is giving back,'' said Heather Errico, a
junior majoring in sociology and economics, whose Interterm
offerings include Flamenco dancing as well as auto mechanics.
``Students don't have to take these courses, they can just stay
home in January. It says something if they come back when they
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time to be at school with your friends, without
classes, without stress,'' said Miriam Ginsburg, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are faculty who think that anything being done while the
students are at school should have some academic merit,'' said
Donna Friedman, who runs MIT's Independent Activities Program.
``But our students have such an intensity about learning, we hope
this gives them some time to take a break from that, to do
something with a different pace, explore opportunities that might
be a little off the beaten path.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while MIT faculty pushed for and won a longer school
year a few years ago, with the agreement that they could teach more
academic credit courses during January, the push is now on to hold
a limit on the number of credit courses, to preserve the sense of
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   And that, some argue, is the very essence of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher education tends to come in for what I describe as a lot
of democratic populist criticism, that is tremendously unfair,''
said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American
Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
``These things tend to strike the ordinary working Joe as
frivolous, whether it's studying Plato or tracking wildlife prints.
Maybe this isn't something you'd spend a living doing, but that's
the purpose of education, to provide a different kind of experience
than one that might be accessible in the real world.''

A BANNER ISSUE FOR GOP CONTENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It cannot be merely a cloth, not when 6,000 people rallied for
it a week and a half ago and nearly 50,000 people railed against it
on the Martin Luther King Jr.'s holiday. Nor is it merely a local
issue, relegated to some backwater that we can conveniently ignore.
It has become an issue of presidential character.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is suffering from a chronic spasm over its flying
of the Confederate flag over the state capitol in Columbia. Flag
defenders, almost all white, say the stars and bars honors their
``heritage.'' Flag critics, mostly black but aided by white
politicians and business leaders who are losing count of the
cancelled conventions by African-American groups, say the claims of
``heritage'' are disingenuous. They say Confederate nostalgia is
inseparable from slavery, lynching, and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   It is so inseparable that Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, S.C.,
said, ``The vast majority of South Carolina says it's time to bring
down the flag now. We cannot ignore that the Confederate battle
flag was taken by hate groups. It was taken by the Klan. It became
a banner of the segregation-forever movement, and we cannot be
insensitive in South Carolina to the feelings of our
African-American brothers and sisters when they see that flag.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War, 135 years dead, is alive not only in South
Carolina, but in the 2000 race for the White House. In a debate
Monday night in Iowa, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley both said the flag ``ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a relatively easy call for Gore and Bradley, since
neither Democratic candidate is likely to win the white male
southern vote in the general election. Despite the solid reelection
of President Clinton and Gore in 1996, the Republican ticket of Bob
Dole and Jack Kemp won Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia,
Texas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the Republican candidates the primary source of
curiosity. Texas Governor George W. Bush and Arizona Senator John
McCain, the two top dogs, have been absurdly toothless over this
piece of cloth. The South Carolina Republican primary is seen as a
crucial test for both Bush and McCain, coming only two-and-a-half
weeks after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   In one South Carolina campaign appearance, Bush said, ``My
advice is for people who don't live in South Carolina to butt out
of the issue.'' In another appearance, Bush said, ``I view it as a
local issue. I've spoken to this issue every time I've come to your
state and I'm not going to say anything more. The people of South
Carolina can solve the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain cannot make up his mind what to say. On Jan. 9 on ``Face
the Nation,'' McCain said the Confederate flag was ``offensive''
and a ``symbol of racism and slavery.'' But the next day he told
reporters in South Carolina, ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery;
others view it as a symbol of heritage. Personally, I see the
battle flag as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after that, in an interview at The Boston Globe, McCain
said he ``saw both sides'' of the issue, but said he too, would
``dodge'' taking a stance different from that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This dodging is dangerous for the nation. The Republicans keep
saying how they want to attract people of color. Both Bush and
McCain have earned sizable Latino support in their respective Texas
and Arizona. The national Republican Party has just launced a $10
million advertising campaign targeted to Latino voters, who are
becoming increasingly important in the four most important
electoral states, California, Texas, New York, and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But bowing at an altar of racism that is a swastika to many
African-Americans exposes Bush and McCain as men who will have no
backbone in the Oval Office over far more serious racial issues.
Instead of finding a way to laugh off the flag as a case of Civil
War shell shock, the silence of Bush and McCain sends a clear
signal that racists still have a home in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pointing out to the flag nuts that America has become
so homogenized (the flag nuts would say mongrelized) that you can
no longer tell suburban Atlanta from suburban Chicago, Bush and
McCain would rather try to get away with cuddling up with the most
divisive of white men, white men whose ``heritage'' was a war of
treason that cost this nation half a million lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of saying, ``Gee guys, have you noticed that the Civil
War is over?'' Bush and McCain have sent the signal that if you
have to pick a White House from which to launch attacks against
people of color in jobs, education, and voting rights, Bush and
McCain are your soft touches.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if Bush and McCain cannot stand up against a piece of
cloth, they cannot stand against much.

RIGHTS GROUP WARY OF FLORIDA BIBLE CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another battle over religion within public education, People
for the American Way has raised concerns that Bible history classes
taught in 14 Florida public school districts could violate the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two critical problems with what they're promoting:
their curriculum presents the Bible from a Christian perspective,
and it presents the Bible as history,'' said Judith Schaeffer,
deputy legal director for the organization. ``Both of those are
unconstitutional in a public school.''
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a civil liberties group based in
Washington, has asked the Florida Department of Education to remove
the Bible classes from a list of state-approved courses.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the group's claims, which were made in a report
earlier this month, one district said it has asked administrators
to take a look at its Bible courses while another said it stopped
offering such classes two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way alleges the classes, which have been
taught for three years, violate a 1963 Supreme Court ruling
allowing public schools to teach the Bible ``objectively as part of
a secular program of education.''
</P>
<P>
   But the organization says the classes are not objective,
claiming that one school district portrays Satan as the father of
the Jews and that another course presents biblical events, such as
Jesus's resurrection, as fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They teach the Bible as if it were history,'' said Elliot
Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way. ``Those
things described in the Bible are events that are accepted by
millions of people on faith, and appropriately so, but they're not
historical fact. To treat the Bible as a history book is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RELIGION NOTES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Calling it a deep scar on the nation, Bishop Sean O'Malley of
the Diocese of Fall River, Mass. called on Catholics to combat
racism by first questioning whether they harbor intolerant views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sin of racism has deeply marked the history of our country
where black people were subjected to forced servitude simply
because they were black,'' O'Malley wrote in a Martin Luther King
day message.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we campaign against cigarettes and drugs, we must also
launch a campaign of zero tolerance for the intolerance of
racism,'' O'Malley wrote. ``Each of us ought to begin with our own
personal conversion and testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   --Seeking to expand in size, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
this week launched an $8 million capital campaign to build a
permanent home for its Charlotte, N.C., campus. Currently, classes
are held in leased office space as well as area churches.
</P>
<P>
   With an enrollment of more than 1,200 students, Gordon-Conwell's
main facility is in Hamilton. ``My own experience throughout the
world has led me to conclude that this extraordinary institution is
one of God's leading lights,'' the Rev. Billy Graham, a trustee at
Gordon-Conwell, said in a statement.

 &HT;    Jagged Edge makes cut with `Heartbreak'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you don't like R&AMP;B balladeers of the Babyface or Brian
McKnight variety. All that love talk they talk is cool. But that
buffed-up-and-Pledged persona is just a little hard to believe. And
since they're talking about buying clothes, paying rent and never
leaving, you have to believe they're real _ see some kind of
imperfection or something _ before you can really believe what they
say.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you could appreciate a little Jagged Edge. And
the Atlanta R&AMP;B quartet of the same name provides.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers and songwriters Brandon and Brian Casey, Kyle Norman
and Richard Wingo pick up on their sophomore album where their
well-received 1998 ballad, ``Gotta Be,'' left off. First release
and current top five single ``He Can't Love U'' mellifluously adds
another layer of tangible sweet nothings that three songs later
leads to the inevitable: the altar. But just when the swoons should
really start happening, Jagged Edge's producer and label president
Jermaine Dupri reworks the ``My Way'' hit he created with pop
singer Usher into Jagged Edge's somewhat abrasive ``Girl Is Mine.''
But then, as if to sense the feelings it might have hurt, Jagged
Edge follows with ``The Healing'' and spends the rest of ``JE
Heartbreak'' claiming to be a ``True Man,'' asking ``Can I Get With
You'' and following that with a ``Promise.'' They know that the way
to forgiveness is to talk that talk and, convincingly, they do.

 &HT;    `Kate' cast takes fun, bouncy ride with Cole Porter
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best cast albums put you right in the theater. Aurally, at
least. You can practically smell the darkness and feel the
excitement. This ``Kiss Me, Kate'' is just such a recording.
</P>
<P>
   As close to flawless as artistic endeavors get, it is a witty
and buoyant update of Cole Porter's 1948 score: ``So in Love,'' ``I
Hate Men,'' ``Why Can't You Behave?'' It's sung by an equally
witty, buoyant cast that is obviously enjoying itself. Marin Mazzie
(Tony-nominated for ``Ragtime'' and ``Passion'') has never sounded
better. As Lili Vanessi/Kate the Shrew, she's called on to sing
high, sing low and show all the colors in her smooth-as-satin
repertoire. Brian Stokes Mitchell (``Ragtime's'' celebrated
Coalhouse Walker Jr.) brims with good-humored ego as Fred
Graham/Petruchio, her foil and true love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate,'' a show within a show, tells the story of a 1940s
Baltimore theater company trying out a musical version of
Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew.'' As such, the score swaggers
between the brassiness of Broadway (``Too Darn Hot'') and the
dignified words of the Bard (``Were Thine That Special Face'').
Orchestrator Don Sebesky and musical director Paul Gemignani have
gone a step further, goosing the arrangements so that they are
bolder and brighter than ever. ``Kate'' is simply joyous, making
this is a fine time to brush up your Shakespeare. And your Cole
Porter, too.

 &HT;    Mini video reviews
 &HT;    By Bob Longino, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie and Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bowfinger'' (PG-13) _ Steve Martin has come up with an
absolutely beautiful premise for a movie and landed a top-notch
co-star in Eddie Murphy. Martin, who wrote the film, plays a
hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and a gem of a way
to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit Ramsey
(Murphy). Martin's film crew ambushes the actor's everyday life.
``Bowfinger'' has a few good laughs but not much more. Sadly, it
never takes on Hollywood with the zing of ``Wag the Dog'' or the
cutting inside dope of ``The Player'' (VHS rental; DVD $26.98).
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The 13th Warrior'' (R) _ Sometimes cheesy movies can be
great cheesy fun. That's true of this rip-roaring yarn about a
medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas) who's drafted by a roving
gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a Norse village from a
mysterious enemy that comes from the mist, kills everything in
sight and leaves a trail of half-gnawed, headless corpses. Sure,
there are inevitable echoes of Monty Python, but there's little
time for irony as this flick hits the ground running and never
stops. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Twin Falls Idaho'' (R) _ Eerie and intriguing. Identical
twins Mark and Michael Polish play conjoined (the popular term is
Siamese) twins. Moving at its own slow, dreamily surreal pace _ the
brothers are the filmmakers as well _ the picture shows what
happens when a young hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the
twins, thus creating a strange _ and strained _ pas de trois.
Exploring themes of love and loneliness, togetherness and
alienation, the movie has a guarded optimism that suggests that
sometimes, wholeness can only be found by letting go (VHS rental;
DVD $27.95, including audio commentary by director-writer-stars
Michael and Mark Polish). Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``An Ideal Husband'' (PG-13) _ A less-than-ideal adaptation of
Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895 London, a respected politician's public
and private lives are threatened by a devious blackmailer who knows
a secret from his past. The fine cast includes Rupert Everett,
Jeremy Northam, Julianne Moore, Minnie Driver and Cate Blanchett.
But they're stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Illuminata'' (R) _ Best recommended to the seriously
stagestruck. John Turturro's film chronicles the shenanigans of a
turn-of-the-century New York theatrical group. Center stage is the
company's leading lady (Katherine Borowitz), who has both radiant
talent and infinite patience when it comes to her beloved's
(Turturro) unfinished play. Susan Sarandon has fun as a purringly
self-assured diva, as does Christopher Walken as a snottily
acrimonious critic. A bit fussy and overdone, but there are moments
of magic. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Animal Farm'' (unrated) _ Startling and ambitious, harrowing
and bold, it's a TV adaptation of George Orwell's classic political
fable. The book endures for many reasons, not the least being the
affecting, brazenly simple way it morphs the atrocities of Soviet
Communism under Joseph Stalin into a believable barnyard sciety.
This is a world where the animals of Manor Farm overthrow their
oppressive human masters and set up a one-for-all, all-for-one
utopia. Things go along like this until power corrupts the pigs,
who concoct a corrupt dictatorship of their own. Only today, in the
age of ``Babe,'' could the book be plausibly adapted as a
live-action film. The work here is as realistic as it gets, though
there's always something self-consciously curious, if still
thrilling, about watching a dog or a horse or a pig move its lips
properly to speak the queen's English. Grade: B+

 &HT;    Globe winners sometimes have the edge on Oscar
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so it's hard to respect an organization that's given an
acting award to Pia Zadora. But looking back over the past decade
or so, the Golden Globes, voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association, have proven to be more Oscar-prescient than the major
critics' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the Hollywood Foreign Press members? Lord knows. At
press junkets, they get their own table and make off with the best
freebies. But as to who they really are, well, let's just say their
collective record speaks louder than their individual records.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the Golden Globes, to be awarded Sunday on NBC,
aren't 100 percent accurate as Oscar prognostications. Here are a
few deviations with the suggestion that you check out the Golden
Globe choice:
</P>
<P>
   1988 BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Oscar sez: Barry Levinson for ``Rain Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe choice: Clint Eastwood for ``Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the supposedly ``commercial'' Golden Globes turn
out to have made the artier choice. In fact, Eastwood wasn't even
nominated for an Academy Award that year. The Oscars preferred Mike
Nichols (``Working Girl''), Alan Parker (``Mississippi Burning''),
Martin Scorsese (``The Last Temptation of Christ'') and Charles
``who's he?'' Crichton (``A Fish Called Wanda'').
</P>
<P>
   A nocturnally tinged biography of jazz legend Charlie ``Bird''
Parker, this is, perhaps, Eastwood's most personal film. A jazz
aficionado, he confessed, ``I'd have done this film even if the
script was no good.'' The result is a jazz riff of a movie, a
through-a-lens-darkly adulation of Parker in which it's always
'round midnight. Forest Whitaker plays Bird as a sleepy-eyed Pan _
a kind of young god with a horn. His work deservedly earned him a
best actor nod at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   1989 BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Oscar sez: Daniel Day-Lewis for ``My Left Foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe choice: Tom Cruise for ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, both Cruise and Day-Lewis played strong-minded
characters in a wheelchair. The latter, a contentious Irish poet;
the former, a contentious Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling memoirs of Vietnam vet Ron Kovic,
``Born on the Fourth of July'' is a firecracker of a film, lobbed
by that master of emotional explosives, Oliver Stone. We watch as
Kovic/Cruise is transformed from a Mom-and-apple-pie all-American
boy into an impassioned anti-war protester, leading a hippie
cavalry from his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise, who did get an Oscar nomination, was described by Stone
as ``an iron horse.'' Stone went on to admit to an interviewer,
``We had a few icy moments because I was pushing him too hard and
he said to me once or twice, `I put enough pressure on myself. I
don't need you to put pressure on me.' He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   1993 BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Oscar sez: Anna Paquin for ``The Piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe choice: Winona Ryder for ``The Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese had known about Edith Wharton's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel (she was the first female to win the prize)
since 1980 when he was given a copy by a friend. But he didn't get
around to reading it until 1987. When he did, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Though many critics found Scorsese and Wharton an odd match _ a
kind of raging bull in a china shop _ the director expertly
captured the high comedy, repressed passion and insistent protest
of Wharton's tragicomedy of manners. Set in 1870s New York, it's
the story of a socially prominent lawyer (Daniel Day-Lewis),
already engaged to a well-bred debutante (Ryder), who falls in love
with her free-spirited, globe-trotting cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer).
Using the opulence of the time to reflect the hypocrisy of these
gilded lives, Scorsese shows us small brutalities committed over
tea. Interviewers who were surprised by his utter faithfulness to
the novel were told, ``My feeling was, the book is very, very good.
So why change it?''
</P>
<P>
   1997 BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Oscar sez: Helen Hunt for ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe choice: Judi Dench for ``Mrs. Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi would have to wait a year before bringing home the
Oscar gold in the best supporting category for her brief but
memorable turn as Queen Elizabeth in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Royalty has become her specialty, at least as far as Oscar is
concerned. In ``Mrs. Brown,'' one of the odder footnotes of history
is dramatized to great effect. Queen Victoria (Dench) is shaken out
of her extended mourning for her late husband by the presence of a
brawny Scot named John Brown (Billy Connolly.) The title refers to
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's derisive nickname for her
majesty _ though never to her face. That's why he was a such a
successful diplomat.

<P>
   ``The Wood'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Rick Famuyiwa's autobiographical film debut
charts the friendship of three buddies from Inglewood, Calif.
(``the Wood'' for short).
</P>
<P>
   We meet them as adults, first Mike (Omar Epps), a groomsman for
pal Roland (Taye Diggs), due to be married any minute now. The only
problem is, no one knows where Roland has gone on this, the morning
of his wedding. So it's up to Mike and fellow groomsman Slim
(Richard T. Jones) to track down the wayward hubby-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``The Wood'' takes place in flashbacks to 1986, when
young Mike (Sean Nelson) arrives from North Carolina and learns the
SoCal ropes from young Roland (Trent Cameron) and young Slim (Duane
Finley). They compete to score the most girls' phone numbers at
school dances, and place bets on who'll lose his virginity first.
The main girl in the film is Alicia (Malinda Williams), whom Mike
pursues, first with a grope of her rear, but gradually with a
growing respect. Meanwhile, back in the present, we hang with the
adult version of the boys and see all the ways they've grown up,
and haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Epps, Jones and Diggs have such airtight rapport, you forget
you're watching actors. Their friendship rings true. ``Wood''
avoids the usual genre pigeonholing of African-American movies:
urban-gangsta drama, or raunchy sex comedy. It's a male-bonding
flick that transcends issues of race. (VHS rental; DVD available
for $29.99.)

KATE WINSLET SPEAKS HER MIND - AND THEM SOME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 21) 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say ``feminist filmmaker,'' and Jane Campion immediately comes
to mind. From ``Sweetie'' to ``The Piano'' to her latest, ``Holy
Smoke!'' she's explored the politics of male-female relationships,
focusing on strong women. So one of the last things you'd expect to
hear from the eager star of a Campion film is: ``One thing that
really sort of irritates me is feminism. It drives me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're dealing with Kate Winslet _ the outspoken star
of ``Holy Smoke!'' _ all bets are off. Winslet elaborates, ``I'm
sick of women saying, `Oh, it should be equal rights, blah, blah
blah' ... Well, actually, it !ital!is!off! pretty equal now. You
know, stop saying that. In the acting world, people say, `Oh, the
male actors make more money.' Well, so what? It doesn't really
matter. Often it is the male actor who's going to pull in the box
office.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that she thinks actresses are bimbos _ quite the
opposite. Explains Winslet, ``I don't think that many female
actresses are pin ups. It's usually the men like Brad Pitt and
Leonardo DiCaprio. It's models who are pin ups as women. That's
just the way that it seems to be. I'd certainly never say that I
have thought of myself, or even felt that people think of me, as a
sex symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clearly not a stretch for Kate Winslet to play a beautiful,
strong-willed young woman in Campion's ``Holy Smoke!'' She is those
things, in addition to being a fine actress who's already garnered
two Oscar nominations at the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest role, Winslet is a young Australian woman who
faces off with a man more than twice her age. He's been hired by
her family to ``de-program'' her from her new-found Hindu faith.
The two characters end up learning about themselves in an intense
several days together in the Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet's directness doesn't seem to have hurt her relationship
with her director and co-stars. She gives a long, warm embrace to
Campion when she enters the room, and seems to have a mutual
admiration club with co-star Harvey Keitel. She also stays in touch
with such past co-stars as Leonardo DiCaprio (``Titanic'') and Emma
Thompson (``Sense and Sensibility'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have many acting friends. We often ring each other up and
say, `Oh, God, I just did this scene today, and I didn't think it
was that good. How would you have done it?,''' said Winslet, in Los
Angeles to promote ``Holy Smoke!'' With her no-fuss makeup and
curvy figure, dressed in black slacks and a black jean jacket, she
could be mistaken for any other 20-something woman _ that is, if
most of the world didn't know her face from the biggest-grossing
movie of all time, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse Winslet of taking the typical Hollywood route
after starring in that blockbuster. Her follow-ups have been two
smaller, offbeat pictures, ``Hideous Kinky'' and ``Holy Smoke!''
Her next on-screen appearance will be as Geoffrey Rush's co-star in
``Quills,'' a picture about the Marquis de Sade due in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Says Keitel warmly, ``I have a particular admiration for Kate
that, after the success of ``Titanic,'' she didn't take roles for
the sake of financial gain. She's a great role model. I told my
14-year-old daughter, `She didn't go for the money.''' In ``Holy
Smoke!'' Keitel plays a cocky de-programmer whose affectations,
from his dyed hair to his eye for young women, are expertly torn
down by Ruth, Winslet's character. It's a sometimes shocking, often
maddening and always surprising relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet insists she hasn't set out to do ``indie'' films, even
though she's turned down such sought-after parts as the Gwyneth
Paltrow role in ``Shakespeare in Love'' and Anna in ``Anna and the
King'' (that one went to Jodie Foster). Both parts were judged too
predictable by Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, `You seem to have made this conscious
decision to do independent films,''' Winslet remarks. ``In reality,
I really haven't. After each movie, I always think, how different
can I possibly be? ... I make a decision based not on how much
money I get paid or how much exposure I would get, but based on, is
this going to challenge me, is this going to inspire me, and is
this going to make me love my job more than I already do?''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet's attitude is the luxury of someone who is not just
young and pretty, but talented and well-grounded. Her grandparents,
father and uncle have been active in the theater in England; Kate
was in her first television commercial at age 11 and launched her
film career with her astonishing turn as a homicidal teen in
``Heavenly Creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Creatures,'' Winslet has done a lot of sexy scenes.
She, to say nothing of co-star Keitel, has gotten a reputation for
disrobing on film.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel bristles at the subject. ``Actors don't do `nude scenes.'
Actors tell a story, we do what is demanded in the theater
(apparently his term for acting in any medium).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to do a `nude scene,' that would be disgusting,''
Keitel says passionately. He then adds, with a wink and a wicked
laugh, ``Besides, I've had some of my best sex with my clothes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet admits that nude _ er, scenes without clothes _ aren't
easy to do. But she too balks at the suggestion that the number and
types of such scenes she's done is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there are so few actresses who go through their
careers never having to take their clothes off in a movie,'' said
Winslet. ``In almost every movie script that I'm asked to read,
there's almost always at least one nude scene. But I'd honestly say
that I've never committed to a script feeling that there's nudity
involved that is gratuitous or unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet points to a scene in ``Holy Smoke!'' as a case in point.
In it, she finally seems to break under Keitel's deprogramming in a
very raw, emotional and totally nude scene. Adding to her
appearance of complete vulnerability, Winslet's character urinates
on herself. ``It's such an important turning point for that
character in her whole journey,'' said Winslet. ``She's really
naked emotionally, as well as physically.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been easy for the actress to laugh about her
body. As a chubby adolescent, she was tagged with the cruel
nickname of Blubber. Even after dropping several dozen pounds she
still isn't skinny, as so many actresses are. ``I used to be so
hung up about it,'' admits Winslet. ``I'd get up in the morning and
I'd say, `Oh, God, I'm such a pig.' I'd lift up my top and I'd be
looking at my waist and I'd be panicking. I finally realized that I
was spending about 90 percent of my day thinking about my body, and
I thought, `This is just so boring!'''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet says she was also jolted by an experience about six
years ago, when she temporarily lost her sight and went into a
``comalike state'' after having not eaten for 24 hours. ``That was
a real wake-up call,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though she calls the subject of weight ``boring,'' it's also
obvious that it hits close to home for Winslet. ``I don't want to
sound like this woman who's critical of people who are skinny,''
Winslet says, her words tumbling out impulsively, as they often do.
``But it does bother me that film and magazines are affecting young
women's minds to the point they feel they have to be thin to be
successful, to be beautiful, to be loved. Every nude scene that
I've done, it's a ton of body makeup. I have stretch marks like
everyone else, I have bits I don't like. There isn't any such thing
as perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet seems to have found perfect happiness, though, with her
husband of a little more than a year. She met 25-year-old assistant
director Jim Threapleton on the set of ``Hideous Kinky.'' Winslet
is obviously in love, phoning him and talking of him often when her
work takes her halfway around the world from their London home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to making decisions about roles, ultimately,
that's my decision,'' Winslet says confidently. ``But Jim reads
scripts after I read them. His opinion is more important to me than
anyone else's. He's so supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslet also credits Threapleton with helping to ground her in
her personal life. ``I identify with (Ruth, her character in `Holy
Smoke!') because she's working out issues that all young women
face,'' Winslet says. ``When I was 19 or 20, one minute I thought I
had it all sorted out and knew who I was. The next minute I could
be suicidal and confused. It's scary being young,'' she adds, with
more self-awareness than most 24-year-olds. ``I can't tell you, the
relief to be 24 and not 22 anymore. ... It's just brilliant.'' &QL;

   ATLANTA _ Susan McNeil of Conyers, Ga., who is originally from
Syracuse, N.Y., knew just where to look for a New York-style
cannoli filling requested by Jeff Vosselman of Marietta, Ga., _ an
Italian cookbook published in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   This one adds whipped cream to ricotta cheese, which should not
be mixed in a food processor because it will become too runny to
stay in the cannoli pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes that came in did not include whipped cream and
called for less chocolate. In their place they added 1 1/2 cups
confectioners' sugar and bits of candied fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part is filling the hollow pastries, which are
usually available at Harry's Farmers Markets and some supermarkets.

KUTI FOLLOWS IN FATHER'S MUSICAL FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 21) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Femi Kuti squints in the California sun and calmly begins
talking of his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Kuti, 37-year-old son of Nigerian Afrobeat superstar and
political irritant Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, is the inheritor of his
father's potent polyrhythmic sound, a syncopated, jazzy and heavily
percussive music that took James Brown's beat back to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Anikulapo-Kuti, who recorded more than 40 albums and took his
music around the world, died at age 58 in August 1997 from
complications of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the worst thing about death like that is there's
absolutely nothing you can do,'' Kuti said. ``Watching the person
die and there's nothing you can do. There is nothing more
painful.''
</P>
<P>
   While similar in many ways, Femi's music differs from his
father's in length. As demonstrated on his latest album, ``Shoki
Shoki'' (MCA/Barclay), in stores Tuesday, Kuti's songs average five
to six minutes; Fela's hypnotic jams often topped 30 minutes on
record and stretched to more than an hour in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Kuti, who closely resembles his father, first rose to prominence
in 1985 when he appeared at the Hollywood Bowl fronting Fela's
40-member Egypt 80 band. Fela had failed to make the plane, having
been arrested in Lagos on a trumped-up fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Femi, who, like his father, sings and plays
saxophone, formed his own band and toured outside Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring a band from Africa is very difficult because the
musicians see America and they want to spend the rest of their
lives here,'' Kuti said during a visit to MCA's Universal City
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is to make them understand that this band is on
a mission; this band represents the continent; this band is talking
politics. It's very important for them to represent their people
and do a good job of it. So, it's taken me quite a while to find
the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuti's 15-piece Positive Force outfit carries forth the Afrobeat
tradition pioneered in such classic Fela workouts as ``Zombie'' and
``Shakara,'' but adds refreshing elements of classic '70s soul,
most notably synthesizer and wah-wah-pedal guitar.
</P>
<P>
   One of Fela's numerous children, Kuti was born in Britain and
raised in Nigeria, quitting school at 16 to join his father's
ever-growing band, which could swell to include dozens of
musicians, backup singers and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Fela's sound developed after hearing the exhilarating,
gospel-fueled music of Brown in 1968. Fela added jazz elements and
long solo passages, dubbing the heady mixture Afrobeat. The
following year, he took his band on a long U.S. tour, where a
month's stay in Los Angeles brought him into contact with the Black
Panthers and other politicized groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fela returned to Nigeria a militant, releasing albums of
incendiary African pop that loudly took the Nigerian government to
task for corruption and brutality. The powers that be responded by
burning Fela's residence and nightclub to the ground, jailing and
torturing the band leader.
</P>
<P>
   To add to his notoriety, Fela married more than a dozen women in
a ceremony at his compound. ``Many of them were singers and dancers
in his band,'' Kuti recalled. ``It ended up where they would be
fighting and scratching each other on stage. I think my father
liked all that drama. He liked to be surrounded with all this
activity and emotion. That sort of lifestyle isn't for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuti, whose wife, Funke, sings and dances in Positive Force,
said he rarely covers any of Fela's songs on stage, preferring to
build a reputation for his own approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see an audience that knows him or his music very well,
I'll do one of his tracks as an encore once in a while to bring
back good memories,'' Kuti explained. ``Because he's already said
everything _ why am I repeating it? It doesn't make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fela's death, Femi and his sister were appointed executors
of the estate, signing a deal with MCA for an in-depth reissue
campaign for the Afrobeat legend's long out-of-print greatest
albums.
</P>
<P>
   The rollout begins Feb. 1 with the release of a new two-disc
anthology, ``The Best Best Best of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Black
President,'' followed over the next three months by 20 albums on 10
CDs. All have been unavailable domestically since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These albums have been bootlegged all over the world,'' Kuti
said. ``You never knew what you were getting or which version was
the right version. Finally, Fela's music will be heard the way it
should be heard.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Rocker of the Atlanta Braves is barely a
week into his Atonement Over America tour and already he is finding
out the high cost of blowing your yap off just for the reaction it
creates.
</P>
<P>
   Even better than that, though, his re-education had nothing to
do with the intervention of baseball Commissioner Bud Selig,
Frontier Headshrinker.
</P>
<P>
   No, Rocker was shunned by the toughest audience of all _ the
band Twisted Sister.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that for a minute. A rock band _ and a metal band at
that _ deciding that someone is too sociopathic for them. What, are
you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not. Nobody could make this stuff up, and if anyone
tried, he or she would be punched in the face on general principle.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the Sisters, whose ethereal ballad ``I Wanna
Rock,'' was the tune of choice when Rocker took the mound, found
his remarks on the shortcomings of diversity in Sports Illustrated
to be too ignorant for true headbangers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable stand for a musical group to take,
particularly since most bands, especially in this genre, pretty
much stand for anything. If you don't believe that, ask any hotel
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dee Snider and Jay Jay French, the Mozart and Salieri of
the band, found the line even they could not cross and asked the
Braves to stop playing their music for Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves so far have not responded, probably because general
manager John Schuerholz is still trying to figure out what
positions French and Snider play.
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing, we now learn that bands actually can ask
teams to take their music off a team's playlist. This may turn out
to be a more sweeping action than simply removing a CD from the
Turner Field boom box.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, we have discovered that there is no song
too obscure to be used for inspirational purposes. We're still
trying to figure out how much crank that Toyota exec took before he
agreed to make the Buzzcocks' ``What Do I Get?'' the theme for one
of their ads.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is increasing evidence that every team in the
world uses the same 10 songs, so that the audience in Indianapolis
hears the same dreadful playlist that the audience in San Diego
hears, that the audience in Boston hears, that the audience in
Edmonton hears. This explains the drops in NBA and NHL attendance
all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in that industry standard disc player, between ``Rock
And Roll, Part II,'' and ``Pump It Up,'' sits ``I Wanna Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Except in Atlanta, that is. The song brings up one of those
unpleasant truths _ that some people say stupid and hateful things
just to see who notices _ that Atlantans would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind that we're now down to nine songs, and that
(horror of horrors) the replacement might be something by Britney
Spears.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that Rocker is now limited to songs performed by
dead people. It's going to be hard for an adrenaline junkie like
him to get pumped up with a Harry Connick medley, but that's his
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Consider instead that the band's decision creates a precedent
for other bands and other misbehaving players. We know from
countless studies that players do silly and stupid things on an
almost hourly basis. Some break the law, others break the peace,
others still exhibit skull-crushing narcissism in all they say and
do.
</P>
<P>
   Role models? Some of these people can't even be roll models.
</P>
<P>
   So if Twisted Sister can object, why not Gary Glitter or O.D.B.
or David Cassidy? Why couldn't the entire music industry take a
stand for sanitized speech and behavior? Are we staring into the
maw of a brave new world of silence between at-bats?
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a thought to make the blood run cold.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be serious, though. The days of contemplative moments at
sporting events are long and safely dead. Nature _ and marketers _
abhor a vacuum, and even if ``I Wanna Rock'' never gets another
airing, there are others out there. The 1996 World Series will be
remembered for two things: The Braves beat Cleveland, and every
third batter walking to the plate to ``Macaroon.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this can't happen. There are too many players who
need the ambient noise to get from point A to point B, and by
ambient noise, they do not mean, ``Getcha Popcorn he-ah! Get it
while it's hot! Get it while it's buttered!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the germ of an idea is out there, and like a lot of other
ideas out there (say, commissioners as psychoanalysts), it's being
tried on John Rocker because he's in no position to object.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we can barely wait for his first appearance of the new
year, to the bone-jarring strains of Erik Satie's ``Gymnopedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, if you'll excuse the pun, the joint be rockin'.

   ECLIPSE-ADVANCE _ Once seen as a cause of great alarm, lunar
eclipses were cited in the Bible as ominous times when ``the sun
shall turn to darkness and the moon shall turn to blood.'' Today,
of course, we're beyond such supersititions. Or are we? With
Thursday night's coming lunar eclipse, when most of the U.S. will
se a blood red moon, we take an accounting of our preoccupation
with moonmadness - why it's part of human nature to read dramatic
meaning into the moon's movements, whether tying a full moon to a
rise in crime rates (a fallacy, criminologists say) or love. Also:
with details about when/where the eclipse will be visible and

he's''deeply sorry'' for any offense he might have given in the

Gingrich is soliciting contributions for his new grass-roots
efforts to cap taxes, reform Social Security and plan for a modern
national defense. And he's also giving two public speeches in
Washington this week, part of the post-divorce rehabilitation of
Newt. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   VERSAILLES-GARDENS (Versailles) _ The gardens of Versailles look
more like a logging camp these days than a place where nobles in
satin pumps liked to stroll. But Versailles's officials say the
destruction caused by the two fierce windstorms that roared across
Europe over the Christmas holidays may actually turn out to be a
good thing for the park, speeding efforts to restore it to its
finest days under the extravagant Louis XIV. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   HYGIENE-FILMS (New York) _ Martha Stewart owes an enormous debt
to the implacably didactic ``mental hygiene'' films that were
popular in American schools in the years 1945 to 1970. New Yorkers
unfamiliar with those films can see them this weekend at the
American Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, which concludes
its three-part series ``Mental Hygiene: Social Guidance Films
1945-1970.'' By Joe Queenan.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING-APPLIANCES (Chicago) _ To soothe the dread of a 6 a.m.
alarm clock call, wouldn't it be nice to know the coffee maker has
already started brewing? In the never-ending American march toward
the new and improved, consumers can soon buy appliances that
``talk'' to each other, so that the coffee-maker knows you have
just staggered from the bed, and need caffeine badly.
</P>
<P>
   MOSH-PIT-OFFICES (New York) _ When William Wordsworth wandered
lonely as a cloud amid all those daffodils, he addressed the
poignant dilemma of the individual trying to find a unique place
among the masses. One can only wonder how the poet would feel at a
new-media company. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>

   WHERE-TO-NAP (Undated) _ Restful destinations for the
nap-inclined.
</P>

THE LESSONS I'M LEARNING WITH A BADLY INJURED CAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HAR.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When the need arises _ and it does _ you must be able to shoot
your own dog. Don't farm it out _ that doesn't make it nicer, it
makes it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Notebooks of Lazarus Long''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus Long was a creation of science-fiction writer Robert A.
Heinlein. Long was an immortal, and the notebook is a collection of
his sayings from Heinlein's writings about the character.
</P>
<P>
   Heinlein died in 1988. But the quote he crafted above has been
running through my mind over the past few days, and soon you will
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   My cat, Ashley, is seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley is a beautiful Russian gray that has developed a charming
trick of meeting us at the head of the sidewalk when we come home
while she is outside. She will walk very deliberately in front of
us, pausing every so often to roll over on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   So far, her rollover record is 12 before we reach the porch.
</P>
<P>
   She disappeared sometime Jan. 1 and came home, injured, two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian thinks she was hit by a car. During the nine
years she has been a companion, I've never known her to run into or
ever cross the street in front of our house, but I suppose it could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   There's really no other explanation. Her tail is broken and
hangs useless, and if she lives, it will have to be amputated. But,
says the vet, there's no need of putting her through that unless
she's going to make it, so maybe we'll wait awhile.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we are doctoring and praying _ I'm a little
uncomfortable praying for a cat, but it's worked before, and
there's not much else I can do.
</P>
<P>
   Being the guy, I'm getting to do most of the ugly stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At least I'm not having to perform that other common modern male
function of going to find the car in the parking lot in the rain.
With the recent bout I've had with flu, Ashley probably would have
to be taking care of me.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I'm convinced that one reason women outlive men is
that we constantly have to go out in the rain to do things while
our womenfolk wait under shelter. But that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   How shall I put this delicately?
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with Ashley is that some of her bodily functions
aren't working exactly right, so she needs assistance in performing
them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced that God gives us children, spouses and pets to
teach us that there is no task too distasteful to perform for a
helpless loved one.
</P>
<P>
   I watched my sister-in-law slowly die of kidney failure while my
brother learned everything he needed to know to perform dialysis at
home. You do what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of all of this with Ashley is that I can't talk
to her to explain what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, I think she understands, at least a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   The least distasteful (to me) chore is giving her medicine and a
really yuckie laxative composed, I'm told, of beef-flavored
petroleum jelly. All things considered, it's a better alternative
to the other solution for that particular problem, which I've also
been doing.
</P>
<P>
   I spread a towel on my lap, pull her head back, pry open her
clenched jaws and dump all of the stuff in. The towel is important
for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When she's finished swallowing the gunk, she'll turn to me, rub
her head against me and start purring. I'm pretty sure that if my
wife were doing that to me, I might be understanding, but it'd be a
pretty good while before I started purring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ashley's getting a little better. She's less tolerant
about the medicine, and there are signs that she might be gaining
some control of her body. But it's slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we put her down?'' I asked the vet last week.
</P>
<P>
   That's awfully final, he says. We can always do that. Maybe
we'll wait for a while.
</P>
<P>
   And all the time Ashley has her head tucked under my arm just to
make the world go away.
</P>
<P>
   I think one purpose of a newspaper is to tell us about things
that other people go through so we will have some training when we
face the same or similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, Lisa Davis wrote an article in The Weekly Review
about having to put her dog, Bob, to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to realize that there is purpose in human
suffering,'' she said. ``It can draw one closer to God. For dogs,
there is no greater point. It's just suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lisa, maybe, has shown me the way.
</P>
<P>
   If the time comes, I guess we'll make the decision that has to
be made.
</P>
<P>
   But even though I can't get past the belief that perhaps Lazarus
Long is right, I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to farm this out.
</P>

<P>
   BENICIA, Calif. _ There are 103 ships tethered together in
Suisun Bay, row after row visible from the Benicia Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Throwaway ships, old Liberty ships, ships that saw action in the
Persian Gulf or were at Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7,
1941.
</P>
<P>
   The cruiser USS Oklahoma City, with a half-century of service,
was at Suisun until it was towed to sea and used as a target ship.
The tug USS Hoga, the last surviving ship from Pearl Harbor, is
listed there. The massive Glomar Explorer was on the Bay, but it's
gone now, along with hundreds of other ships the Navy set aside in
the years after the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Madsen, author of ``Forgotten Fleet: The Mothball Navy''
($36.95, Naval Institute Press), knows their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the marsh off Lake Herman Road, he stared at the
gray-slabbed ships and said, ``I took a boat ride out here three
and a half years ago and there was something about being so close
to them that stayed with me. The absolute silence of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked ships, anyway, and to look up and read the
names on the hulls. ... I wanted to know what happened to them. The
helicopter carrier Tripoli was out there, the one that got mined in
the Persian Gulf War. The tanker Santa Ynez, which was built in '43
in Sausalito, where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time that ships were mothballed all over the San
Francisco Bay Area, said Madsen, 39, who works for Federal Express
in Petaluma. They crowded Hunter's Point, Oakland, Mare Island,
Suisun Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of cruisers,'' he said. ``The Halsey. The
England. Ships I'd actually been on during Fleet Week, now just
sitting there, waiting to be scrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen remembered when he was 9 years old, standing at Fort
Baker as the battleship USS New Jersey came in under the Golden
Gate Bridge, fresh from a shelling mission off Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It was that image, and a visit to see mothballed ships at Mare
Island, that led Madsen to explore the stories of as many dying
ships as he could.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned over, pointing to a photo on page 216 of his 240-page
book. ``That salvage vessel back there is the Clamp,'' he said.
``At one time it pulled the Tolman, the destroyer in front here,
off a reef. And here they are, 45 years later, rusting together.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Madsen wrote to the Naval Institute Press in
Annapolis, Md., about doing a book on mothballed ships. It wasn't
until he got into the thick of the project that he realized how big
an assignment it was, said Madsen, who has no touch with the
military other than the fact his father was in the Army and Air
Force in World War II and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten Fleet,'' in its second printing, opens with the
stunning totals of American shipping at the end of World War II: 20
fleet carriers, with five more near completion, 8 light carriers,
70 escort carriers, 23 battleships, 2 battle cruisers, 22 heavy
cruisers, 48 light cruisers, 373 destroyers, 365 destroyer escorts,
240 submarines and hundreds of support craft.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ships came to about 1,500, the largest navy the
world has known, and the United States had to figure out what to do
with them. The answer was a mothball fleet made up of ships sealed
and shut down at harbors across the country, from Bremerton, San
Diego and San Francisco on the West Coast to Philadelphia, Bayonne,
N.J. and Boston in the East. Madsen took it on himself to find the
histories of each mothballed ship, using available records, a
15-volume naval history from Samuel Morrison and the 8-volume
Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the research,'' said Madsen, a graduate of California
State University at Sacramento who lives in Kenwood. ``I went to
the national archives in San Bruno five times, going through boxes
and boxes of records. That was the fun part.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen's wife, Lorrinda, backed the project. ``She was totally
with me on this,'' he said. ``She made me sit down and write. To be
honest, I really wrote it for her. It's not too technical, not for
the naval expert. I would ask myself, `Would she like this? Would
she find this sentence interesting?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So many stories were lost after World War II, Madsen said, not
the least of which was the history of the carrier USS Franklin. In
March 1945, two bombs hit the ship 50 miles off Japan, starting a
series of explosions that killed 724 and sent 1,700 more men into
the water. Despite a severe list to starboard, the Franklin logged
12,000 miles across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal to New
York, where she was repaired _ only to go into reserve and join the
mothball fleet at Bayonne. The carrier never left mothballs before
being scrapped in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sat there, moribund, for 20 years after the war,'' Madsen
said. ``She wasn't just a derelict, waiting to be broken up. She
had a history. Seven hundred guys were killed on her, and she still
came back. You would think the navy could've found a place for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or the Enterprise _ the most decorated ship of World War II.
You'd think they could've saved ships with histories like that. But
they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   So Madsen compiled the ships' histories, together with pictures
from their heyday. There was the carrier Bunker Hill, losing 400
men after being hit by two suicide planes off Okinawa in May 1945.
Forgotten now, the Bunker Hill's combat record was one of the best
_ 11 battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation in 18 months at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 70 photos in the book is of the Bunker Hill, turning
hard to spill burning fuel off its decks. Another is of the
Franklin, men running across its listing deck. There's a picture of
the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri, shots of the
mothball fleets and a picture from the last day the remaining four
Iowa-class battleships steamed together in line, on June 7, 1954.

   Madsen writes, too, of destroyers that survived Pearl Harbor
only to roll over and sink in a wartime typhoon, of the destroyers
that first saw action against the Nazis, of the 52 submarines sunk
during the war and the 106 that wound up mothballed at Mare Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten Fleet'' also follows the USS Birmingham to its
mothball berth in San Francisco. ``From the air, even from the
piers, there is nothing visible to distinguish her from her
sisters,'' Madsen writes. ``Some of these cruisers saw hardly any
of the war. Some saw more than their share, more than any ship and
crew should have to. One of them was CL-62: the USS Birmingham, the
`Mighty B.'''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1944, the Birmingham came alongside the stricken
light carrier Princeton at Leyte Gulf, helping battle Princeton's
fires until all but one was out. But the Princeton's torpedo
magazine exploded and ``half of Birmingham's crew were cut down
instantly as fragments from the carrier sprayed across the deck and
superstructure.'' The loss was 267 dead, 426 wounded, writes
Madsen, adding, ``The Birmingham's wounds, or at any rate her
visible and tangible ones, were repaired in San Francisco and she
returned to the Pacific, only to be crashed by a kamikaze off
Okinawa in May 1945, killing another fifty-one of her crew and
wounding eighty-one more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham lasted until the mass striking of cruisers on
March 1, 1959. Not only were cruisers taken from the Hunter's Point
docks, but also from the Philadelphia Naval Yard, where 15 of 22
cruisers were relegated to scrap in a single stroke, the same day
the battleships Tennessee and California felt the knife.
</P>
<P>
   It is in his imaginary walk-through of the Philadelphia yard
that Madsen hits the high point of ``Forgotten Fleet.'' Using naval
photos from 1955, Madsen takes the reader around the basin, from
ship to ship, talking about the history of each one. ``I started
with the idea of what it would've been like to walk down that
shipyard,'' he explained. ``I used a magnifying glass to identify
the ships, then looked up their stories. I don't know if it's a
corny idea or not, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen writes of the Philadelphia yard, ``As the visitor walked
a little farther he could note three old, nearly identical cruisers
moored at the next slip, bearing three more hull numbers:
thirty-eight, thirty-seven and thirty-six.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight? Isn't that the old San Francisco? The cruiser that
was shot full of holes at Guadalcanal as the war was just
beginning? The one whose riddled bridge windscreen, mast and bell
were now three thousand miles away in her namesake city on Point
Lobos overlooking the Pacific Ocean?''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen talks of the hit on the cruiser's bridge that killed
Capt. Cassin Young and Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan, of the limping
trip back to the New Hebrides in tandem with the light cruiser USS
Juneau, which sank after being torpedoed, taking the lives of the
five Sullivan brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen writes of the USS Houston, nearly sunk by a Japanese
torpedo _ ``Had she gone down, she would have been famous. Her
survival has assured her anonymity, if not in the history books or
in the minds of her crew, then at least here in this graveyard of
the well known and the little known.'' And he mentions the USS
Savannah, ``looking for friends in the aftermath of the bombing off
Salerno, Italy. They are just mountains of dead steel now, their
time come and gone long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten Fleet'' is, on the face of it, a sentimental book.
But it speaks to the terror and courage of men now dead, men killed
on ships that were shunted off to a corner of some naval yard to
rust, taken in their own turn to die.

</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy of 2000 has barely more than 300 ships, said
Madsen, and only 30 are left on the active roster of the mothball
fleet. The others floating at anchor, like those t Suisun Bay, are
just waiting to become scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen stared toward the ships on the water and thought back to
the slow death of a cruiser in San Francisco. ``When you looked at
the Birmingham,'' he said, ``you saw no sign of what happened when
the Princeton blew up alongside. All the ships looked the same. You
couldn't see that one of these ships had this horrible, horrible
thing happen to it.''

 &HT;    TEACHER SHORTAGES WORSEN AT URBAN SCHOOLS
 &HT;    390&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Eds: List of districts surveyed is at end of story.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The shortage of math, science and special education
teachers in big-city schools is getting worse, several urban
education groups reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with those shortages, four-fifths of the urban districts
surveyed ``allow unqualified teachers to teach'' some of their
classes, said Debbie McLean of Recruiting New Teachers, a
Massachusetts-based nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great
City Schools, was asked what the average citizen could do about the
shortage. He suggested that well-educated people in other jobs
seriously consider switching to a ``meaningful and important and
rewarding career in teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban schools have long had problems competing with suburban
school districts that offer teachers higher pay, newer schools and
less challenging working conditions. McLean said that the shortages
recently got worse because ``our booming economy offers more
opportunity and better pay (in private jobs) than in teaching,
especially in math and the sciences, where shortages are most
acute.''
</P>
<P>
   Her group, Casserly's council and the Council of Great City
Colleges of Education surveyed public-school officials and
education deans in 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Their newest survey of the ``immediate needs'' in 40 urban
districts which together recruit more than 30,000 new teachers
annually showed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortages of special education teachers existed in 97.5
percent of the districts, up from 85 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortages were also reported for teachers of science by 97.5
percent (up from 69 percent) of districts, mathematics by 95
percent (up from 67 percent) and bilingual education by 73 percent
(up from 64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But their survey of 45 college deans showed that most urban
education students are more interested in teaching in fields where
there aren't any shortages:
</P>
<P>
   _ Their students had ``strong interest'' in elementary
education, said 87 percent of the deans. Most also saw ``strong
interest'' in social studies or history (69 percent), early
childhood (62 percent) and special education (62 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ But many deans selected the category of ``low interest'' for
their students' desire to teach mathematics (56 percent) or science
(44 percent).
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Most districts are trying a variety of techniques to diminish
the shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular are recruiting at historically black or
Hispanic colleges (95 percent), helping likely teachers to qualify
for credentials (85 percent), assigning classes to teachers who
lack the correct credentials (83 percent), offering formal support
and mentoring programs for novice teachers (67.5 percent), offering
alternative certification routes to career-switchers (65 percent),
and sponsoring job fairs (65 percent). One-fourth offered hiring
bonuses to teachers in high-need subject areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-poverty urban districts have made great progress in
trying various ways to attract and retain the teachers they need
most, but we have a long way to go,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   While 73 percent of the deans said their schools emphasize urban
teaching, few reported all-out efforts to steer their education
students to high-need teaching areas. Counseling was mentioned by
64 percent, support and academic assistance for the necessary state
and national licensing exams by 56 percent, and special financial
aid by 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although half their students are working adults, barely half of
the colleges will let them take all required courses as part-timers
(51 percent). Some also schedule courses in the evening (38
percent), off-campus (22 percent), summer (20 percent) or weekends
(9 percent).

   FIRST THEY TOOK OUR LAND; NOW THEY WANT OUR CHEESE. It's gooey,
it's yellow and it sustained columnist Karen Lincoln Michel during
her days as a poor college student. It's commodity cheese. ``Unless
you fall within the lowest socioeconomic group or have lived on an
Indian reservation, you probably haven't enjoyed the dining
experience that comes when cooking with food distributed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' Michel writes. Will the
government cut cheese from the federal Food Distribution Program on
Indian Reservations? Maybe ... Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.)
says government cheese is a health risk, and that the food
distribution program ought to improve the nutritional value of the
food it sends to reservations. ``Them's fightin' words _ no matter
how you slice it,'' Michel writes in this humorous commentary.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S MORE THAN JUST A HOLIDAY. Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Jan.
17) is much more than a holiday to columnist Akilah Monifa. Monifa,
a 42-year-old African-American woman, grew up in Huntsville, Ala.
Her parents strategized and marched with Dr. King. ``I learned
about civil disobedience and protests from them when I was 4 years
old,'' she writes. ``I heard them talk of taking part in sit-ins at
segregated lunch counters.'' Her plans for observing the holiday?
``I will shed tears over the loss of a great man and a
philosopher,'' she writes. ``I will rue the fact that there are
still so many people who know little about his life and legacy. And
I will remember that the best way to honor Dr. King is by reading
his speeches and making a commitment to `walking the walk' of
diversity.'' An appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM _ ``We've reached the 21st
century, a new millennium, a new cycle,'' writes Hermene Hartman,
publisher and editor in chief of N'Digo, an African-American weekly
newspaper published in Chicago. ``What should we expect?'' In this
commentary, Hartman offers her take on what black America should
strive for in the coming years _ from confronting racism and
thinking globally to getting ``wired'' and setting your eyes on
success.
</P>
<P>
   PROP. 22: POLITICAL BELLWETHER IN CALIFORNIA _ When Californians
go the polls on March 7, they'll either vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on
Proposition 22, a ballot measure that reads: ``Only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.''
Columnist Chuck Colbert feels that this political initiative is
designed to trigger a backlash against recent significant
civil-rights gains made by the lesbian and gay community. But what
bothers him most is the unprecedented role of the Catholic and
Mormon churches in directly funding this measure. Colbert urges
Catholic Californians, who make up 25 percent of the state's
population, to say no to unjust church politics and vote ``No'' on
Proposition 22.

   FIRST THEY TOOK OUR LAND; NOW THEY WANT OUR CHEESE. It's gooey,
it's yellow and it sustained columnist Karen Lincoln Michel during
her days as a poor college student. It's commodity cheese. ``Unless
you fall within the lowest socioeconomic group or have lived on an
Indian reservation, you probably haven't enjoyed the dining
experience that comes when cooking with food distributed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' Michel writes. Will the
government cut cheese from the federal Food Distribution Program on
Indian Reservations? Maybe ... Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.)
says government cheese is a health risk, and that the food
distribution program ought to improve the nutritional value of the
food it sends to reservations. ``Them's fightin' words _ no matter
how you slice it,'' Michel writes in this humorous commentary.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S MORE THAN JUST A HOLIDAY. Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Jan.
17) is much more than a holiday to columnist Akilah Monifa. Monifa,
a 42-year-old African-American woman, grew up in Huntsville, Ala.
Her parents strategized and marched with Dr. King. ``I learned
about civil disobedience and protests from them when I was 4 years
old,'' she writes. ``I heard them talk of taking part in sit-ins at
segregated lunch counters.'' Her plans for observing the holiday?
``I will shed tears over the loss of a great man and a
philosopher,'' she writes. ``I will rue the fact that there are
still so many people who know little about his life and legacy. And
I will remember that the best way to honor Dr. King is by reading
his speeches and making a commitment to `walking the walk' of
diversity.'' An appreciation.

   PREPARING FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM _ ``We've reached the 21st
century, a new millennium, a new cycle,'' writes Hermene Hartman,
publisher and editor in chief of N'Digo, an African-American weekly
newspaper published in Chicago. ``What should we expect?'' In this
commentary, Hartman offers her take on what black America should
strive for in the coming years _ from confronting racism and
thinking globally to getting ``wired'' and setting your eyes on
success.
</P>
<P>
   PROP. 22: POLITICAL BELLWETHER IN CALIFORNIA _ When Californians
go the polls on March 7, they'll either vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on
Proposition 22, a ballot measure that reads: ``Only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.''
Columnist Chuck Colbert feels that this political initiative is
designed to trigger a backlash against recent significant
civil-rights gains made by the lesbian and gay community. But what
bothers him most is the unprecedented role of the Catholic and
Mormon churches in directly funding this measure. Colbert urges
Catholic Californians, who make up 25 percent of the state's
population, to say no to unjust church politics and vote ``No'' on
Proposition 22.

 CHRON  
 The High Cost of Dining Out: Tabs keep growing while
restaurants  keep opening  
 By Michael Bauer  
 and Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  At San Francisco's La Folie, menu prices are on
the rise. In 1995, the most expensive item was a beef tenderloin
with marrow flan in Merlot sauce for $26.50. Today, chef/owner
Roland Passot has added a slice of foie gras to the top and charges
$45.
<P>
   La Folie isn't unique. Prices at high-end and less-formal places
throughout the entire Bay Area have been on a steady rise the last
few years, and continue to escalate at an increasingly rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   EOS, a charming but modestly decorated restaurant in Cole
Valley, has gone from a neighorhood gathering place to a
destination restaurant on the national level because of chef/owner
Arnold Wong's creative fusion cuisine. When he opened the
restaurant in 1996, main courses started at $8.95 and topped out at
$14.95. But within the first year, prices almost doubled. Main
courses now range from $18 to $28.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Bay Area, diners are feeling the squeeze. Donia
Bijan opened L'Amie Donia in Palo Alto in 1994 as a rustic
neighborhood place with prices in the $15 range. Now, similar main
courses cost $25 and above.
</P>
<P>
   This huge bump in prices shoots the Bay Area into the dining
stratosphere, a spot formerly occupied only by New York City. The
reasons, experts say, have little to do with the food. Food costs
have remained fairly static, as has inflation. But rents, labor
costs and simply what is expected by the dining public have
contributed to the surge.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagat Survey, a organization that rates restaurants
nationwide (about 800 in the Bay Area), reports that last year the
Bay Area became the second city in the nation after New York City
to top the $30 mark for an ``average meal.'' In 1997 it was just
over $26.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, personal income has been rising, largely
fueled by the high-tech industry. Restaurateurs all around the Bay
Area say that business has never been better. Despite the increased
cost of eating out, the better known restaurants are so busy that
reservations often have to be made weeks in advance. And despite
what restaurateurs say is the high cost of doing business, new
restaurants continue to open at a dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on? Are rising prices reflecting the true cost
of eating out, or are restaurants simply lining their larders?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little bit of both, experts say. Owners are dealing with
higher labor costs and soaring rents, but also want to make a
little more money. Allan Ripp of the Zagat Survey notes that in the
early '90s when the economy was depressed, customer spending in
restaurants declined. During that time, value was the key
ingredient to making a restaurant work. Prices were kept low, often
artificially so, which sliced into already miniscule profit margins
run around five percent. Now that the economy is booming, he
speculates that owners see the opportunity to make up for those
leaner years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of new restaurants coming in with a little more
confidence (that they'll succeed), so the prices really are
rising,'' Ripp says.
</P>
<P>
   La Folie, which opened in 1989 as a modest French restaurant,
has been a bellwether of this climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to make money,'' says Passot. ``If we weren't, then
we'd be working for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to several reasons for the increases. He's redecorated
his restaurant three times. He's replaced utilitarian plates and
glasses with fine china, silver and crystal, and he's boosted his
kitchen staff from four to 12 people to prepare more elaborate
dishes. Despite the increased staff, Passot is still in the kitchen
nearly every night.
</P>
<P>
   When he first opened, Passot says, ``Jaimie (his wife) used to
cry every night saying, `We're not going to make it, we're not
going to make it.' '' Now, he says, they can take an occasional
vacation and are reinvesting in the restaurant _ spending $50,000
to add a private dining room, which is more than they spent on
opening the restaurant. And, he claims, they won't need to raise
prices to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years Passot has also opened Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park, both of which are more moderately priced
than La Folie _ allowing him to turn La Folie into a fine dining
destination. The stylish brasseries each seat more than 200 diners
(La Folie seats 80) and the prices are in the $10-$19 range. Each
Left Bank serves about 3,000 meals a week; La Folie serves about
500. A higher volume means that the price per dish can be kept
down. Plus, the style of restaurant means ingredients will
generally be less costly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't the food on the plate that's driving up prices _
it's everything surrounding the food. ``If you look at commodity
prices over the last two or three or even four years, it's a
minimal increase,'' says Andy Powning of Greenleaf produce of San
Francisco, a quality produce supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Food costs generally hover at around 30 percent of a
restaurant's expenses, experts say. The more expensive restaurants
that use caviar and the like may be a few percentage points higher,
and the neighborhood pasta house may be a few points lower.
</P>
<P>
   What you're paying for at La Folie and other high-priced places
is that perfect rose on the table, the zebra wood paneling on the
walls or the high-maintenance bamboo on the floors.
</P>
<P>
   And diners seem to be demanding these refinements. Wendy
Brucker, one of the Bay Area's top cooks who owns the
moderately-priced Rivoli in Berkeley with her husband Roscoe
Skipper, says that eating out used to be ``more about food than
anything else, but now decor is a big part of the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   She laments this transformation of restaurants into big
business. A passion for cooking was the dominant attitude when such
ground-breaking restaurants such as Chez Panisse and Zuni Cafe
opened more than two decades ago, she says. Now it's as much about
decor and entertainment for the diners, and making money for the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   She traces the change to the opening of Postrio about 10 years
ago. Wolfgang Puck showed that restaurateurs could serve cutting
edge food in big, beautiful surroundings and charge a lot for it,
the high volume ensuring a profitable business venture.
</P>
<P>
   The realization that surroundings and ambience played an
important part is what led her to redecorate a few years ago.
``That made our cost of doing business rise, and it's much more
than just rebuilding _ the upkeep is more.'' Even at that, she's
held the line with only a minimal increase in prices. Entrees
prices at Rivoli ranged from $9.75 and $14.95 in 1994; now most of
the main courses are around $16.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest factor in rising prices is labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret that there's a labor shortage and that will
make the price of labor go up,'' says Niki Leonakis, vice president
of restaurants for Kimpton Group, which owns Scala's, Grand Cafe,
Fifth Floor and Masa's, among other restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs say they are losing out to dot-com companies that
pay significantly more than the $7 to $8 an hour many restaurants
pay their kitchen crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't willing to work for what's paid in the
kitchen,'' says Arnold Wong, chef/owner of EOS, who's had a high
turnover of staff in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Bijan of L'Amie Donia says she's been lucky with a staff that
stays two to three years. ``But they're well compensated,'' she
says. ``I pay my dishwasher $11 an hour and it goes up from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a new California labor law that went into effect on
January 1 will have an even greater impact, according to Donna
Scala of Bistro Don Giovanni in Napa. Before the law was passed, to
make ends meet, many kitchen crews would sometimes pull double
shifts, getting paid time and a half for working over eight hours.
With the new law in place, restaurants must now pay double-time
after 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of real estate can also directly impact the rise
in menu prices. Restaurants today are paying significantly more
than places that opened even a year ago. In some cases landlords
base a portion of rent on the percentage of gross revenue. Because
of this, many restaurants must pay more rent when they do well and
that extra expense is often passed along to the diner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a hefty crop of moderately priced restaurants continue to
open. How are they able to be profitable despite these rising
costs?
</P>
<P>
   According to Craig Stoll of Delfina, one of the most lauded
restaurants to open last year, part of his success in pricing comes
from low food costs, but another part comes from the decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like a stripped-down restaurant,'' he explains.
The 35-seat California/Italian restaurant in the Mission District
opened with entree prices under $15, and food that's better than 99
percent of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not about luxury ingredients,'' says Stoll. ``We
emphasize plain-Jane, but good food. We use secondary cuts of meat
and wait for produce to be at the height of season so it's at its
lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken out all of the things that make it more
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The china, silverware and glasses used at Delfina are very
inexpensive _ plates, for example, are $4.93 _ whereas the plates
at stylish Fifth Floor are around $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gulisano, who owns Chow and Park Chow, two very successful
inexpensive restaurants in San Francisco, has been successful with
a similar approach, using light fixtures from Home Depot, for
example, rather than paying a designer to create them.
</P>
<P>
   At both restaurants you can get old-fashioned spaghetti and meat
balls for $6.95 and a half roast chicken for $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radical difference in our approach is that we completely
wiped off everything that we don't consider to add value to the
customer experience,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, that means expensive decor, fancy flatware and
other splashy extras. Because with restaurants now entertainment
venues as much as eating establishments, diners pay for the plate
and what surrounds it as much as they do for the food.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; The New Dish on Prices &QL;  &LR; 
In response to rising restaurant prices, The Chronicle is changing
our dollar sign ratings _ the first change in more than a decade.

<P>
   Changing the ratings involved contacting all the restaurants
we've reviewed in the past _ close to 900 _ to verify their prices
and change categories when appropriate. The changes will go into
effect on Friday 1-21 for all restaurant reviews and listings in
The Chronicle and on our Web site, www.sfgate.com.

A GREAT COLUMN, EXCELLENT _ REALLY, I CAN TELL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the great joys of doing a job really
well, I'm told, is the satisfaction of knowing you did the job
really well.
<P>
   Now, it turns out, if you're basking in that warm glow of
satisfaction, you're probably basking up the wrong tree.
</P>
<P>
   A Cornell psychologist and a grad student conducted a study that
showed that incompetent people are not only incompetent, but a key
component of their incompetence is that they lack the ability to
recognize their own incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   And competent people generally underestimate their competence.
</P>
<P>
   So no matter how you feel about your performance, you're
probably wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's likely that the study was poorly executed and
interpreted, because the researchers submitted the study for
publication in a top-notch journal, which means they probably felt
they did a darn good job on it, which means ...
</P>
<P>
   But if by chance the study does have merit, it means that you
are either a clueless and incompetent boob, or you think you are.
So why bother?
</P>
<P>
   GIVE YOUR LOVE the perfect snowball.
</P>
<P>
   Art and Jeanne Freedman just got their Valentine's edition of
the Martha (Stewart) by Mail catalog. On page 41 is the plastic
snowball maker, a scoop that ``makes perfectly round snowballs to
stack in beautiful designs or decorate snowmen ...''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog continues: ``and, of course, to throw. Long handle
helps to prevent cold, wet mittens.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes no sense. If you're worried about the kiddies getting
cold hands, why not just have the butler pack the snowballs?
</P>
<P>
   I JUMP INTO a cab, ask the driver to take me to Washington
Square in North Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you please tell me how to get there?'' he says politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you just steal this cab?'' I want to ask, but don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am new to this city,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   At Grant and Clay, he stops at a red light (not yet hip to local
driving customs) and looks around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Chinatown?''
</P>
<P>
   Fast learner.
</P>
<P>
   I've been encountering a lot of cab drivers who don't know the
city. Which can be good, since a confused cabbie is less likely to
drive like he's chasing Steve McQueen's Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently taxi school here isn't exactly the Harvard of
taxi schools. In London, for instance, a prospective cab driver
spends two or three  &UR; years  &LR; learning the city.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in London, the taxi drivers make a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEARLY DEPARTED missed connections with the hearse, so he
wasn't in his coffin when it was delivered to the wake.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to an old hippie to be late for his own funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Helms, declared dead in a recent newspaper letter, was
remembered fondly Monday night by several hundred mourners at the
Gold Coast. There wasn't a dry throat in the place.
</P>
<P>
   Pallbearers included ex-Police Chief Dick Hongisto, actor Jaime
Gomez, Wavy Gravy and D.A. Terence Hallinan, who recently came back
from the dead himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob Major examined Chet and declared him legally alive,
which seemed to pick up his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EAT, my unlicensed rogue dining critic, tried out the newly
renovated Spenger's Fresh Seafood Grotto in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a marvelous job preserving the old nautical
motif,'' Mr. Eat says, ``and they give you plenty of time to check
it out. I am now an expert on 18th century ships' steering
wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the food, as advertised, really much fresher than at the
old Spenger's?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eat says, ``I'm sure my dinner was fresh when it began its
stormy and arduous voyage from the kitchen to my table.''
</P>
<P>
   HE POWERED DOWN his Vit C, zinc, rose-petal tea with riboflavin,
multiple vitamins and minerals, chlorella green sea algae, garlic
tabs and echinacea-goldenseal, did my man McKellar, and he still
got a whopping dose of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   And so did his wife and kids. Everyone but the family dog. So
McKellar dumped the pills and is on a one-supplement regimen _
``Kibble.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T CONFUSE wrens with the wrentit, advises Meg Pauletich in
her ``Backyard Birder'' column in the Golden Gate Audubon Society
Newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrentit is found exclusively in California and Oregon. ...
They are shy but very curious and can be lured into view if you sit
quietly while pishing.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice woman at the Society explained to me that pishing is what
some bird-watchers do to lure shy birds out into the open. The
birder makes a ``Psst, psst'' sound (with his or her mouth) and the
bird emerges to check out the danger.
</P>
<P>
   The woman warned me that while pishing is common, some
bird-watcher purists consider pishing to be not kosher, in the same
way that using bird calls to lure birds into the open isn't
sporting. Unless, of course, you plan to blast the bird with a
shotgun and eat it.

DMV TO BEGIN ONLINE CAR REGISTRATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dowdy, oft-derided California Department of Motor Vehicles
will try to go user-friendly in a big way this spring by allowing
people to register their cars using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting in long, sleep-inducing lines or dropping
checks into the regular ``snail-mail,'' people will be able to pay
their annual fees by computer with a credit card, and their
registration will be instantly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will take off like wildfire is anybody's guess,
although similar programs have done moderately well in several
other states, including Arizona. And at any rate, it will start
small: When the program goes online sometime in mid-April it will
only be available to about a quarter of the state's vehicle owners.
</P>
<P>
   To get cyber with the DMV, you must be re-registering your
vehicle _ brand-new cars, because of the added paperwork, will be
ineligible. You must also be insured through either the California
State Automobile Association Northern California, CSAA Southern
California, or Mercury Casualty, the three insurance companies that
so far have agreed to participate. That comes to 4.5 million cars
or trucks every year.
</P>
<P>
   Add in 3 million boats and trailers, which don't need insurance,
and the number of Internet-eligible vehicles and vessels next year
comes to 7.5 million _ out of about 30 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DMV managers say they are excited at the prospect of
joining the cutting-edge craze of all things Internet, otherwise
referred to in this case by IBM _ the company that will install the
new system _ as an ``e-business solution.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Governor Gray Davis proclaiming that hooking government
into the newest technologies is one of his top priorities, the DMV
program is bound to be closely watched as the first major effort in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any other program in California government that
has a service even remotely like this,'' said DMV spokesman Bill
Gengler. ``It's a very big deal. We have more contact with the
public than any other department in California, and we're very
pleased we will have the opportunity to show what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-suffering public is bound to be paying close attention.
</P>
<P>
   The tediousness of dealing with the agency has long been the
butt of jokes by everyone from Jay Leno to street-corner clowns,
and even with massive efforts in recent years to streamline things
by letting people make appointments by phone and pay fees by postal
mail, the department's reputation is none too shiny, Gengler
admitted with a sigh. Major foul-ups with the agency's computer
systems in recent years _ which Gengler said have now been fixed _
didn't help
</P>
<P>
   ``That image is something we've had to contend with for a long
time, but with this program we're going to make a very positive
effort to change it,'' Gengler said. ``We're going to show we do
have a commitment to public service.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mercury and CSAA are participating because ``they chose
to voluntarily, and others in the state did not, even though we
offered it to a number of companies.'' CSAA's Northern and Southern
California divisions are rated No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, in
customer size among the state's 250 auto insurance companies,
according to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner.
Mercury is No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of installing the new system will be about $2 million,
Gengler said, but the state is paying only $400,000. The rest will
be absorbed by IBM as part of its effort to form ``a strong
partnership with the state of California,'' said Tedi Wells,
director for IBM's California ``e-business solutions'' division.
</P>
<P>
   The way the system will work, she said, is that the vehicle
owner will get a registration card in the mail with a personal
identification number (PIN). He or she can then use any computer _
at home, the library, wherever _ to dial into a DMV Web site, sign
on with the PIN, and pay by credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only take a couple minutes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McEldowney, head of the San Francisco-based Consumer Action
watchdog group, hailed the program as encouraging, but he
nonetheless saw a potential cloud on the DMV's otherwise
brightening horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, but the downside is it's yet another instance of
something encouraging people to use credit cards,'' he said. ``For
people who pay off every month, it's OK, but for consumers who
don't, it just creates more ongoing debt.'`

 _ SF CHRON  
 Businesses Turn to Professional Planners to Put a New Spin
on  Their Event 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Inman News Features is looking for a show-stopping attraction for
about 2,000 attendees at its real estate conference next month in
San Francisco.
<P>
   Inman News has done it before. When it held its ``RealEstate
Connect'' conference in July, it did so on Bastille Day, with a
French Revolution theme complete with actors in period costumes and
a mock guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for its approaching real estate conference, it's
considering a tattoo fashion show. It also might book a bizarre
local troupe called Incredibly Strange Wrestling that features
entertainers such as 300-plus-pounder ``Boom Boom Comini'' taking
on ``Rasputin'' the midget or ``Irene Butterfly'' going to the mat
with ``Poontangler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do something outlandish, something people aren't
used to,'' explained Brad Inman, founder of the Emeryville real
estate information company. ``We're introducing the real estate
industry to new technology and to do that, we want to do more than
offer cheese and crackers at the Hyatt.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wide-open world of conventions, sales meetings,
product introductions and corporate incentive programs. Program
planners are going to increasing lengths and expense to gain
attention, win customers and attract and retain employees.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on the cutting edge, those who throw parties and
conferences don't necessarily need a guillotine. But increasingly
they are turning to professional planners.
</P>
<P>
   That's true whether the event charges attendees a fee and is a
moneymaker, like Inman's conferences, or is a multimillion-dollar
freebie that a company like Sun Microsystems hosts each year to
reward top talent and boost morale.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco alone, there are about 30 event planning firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want something that a hotel isn't offering, then you
need a planner,'' said Heather Keenan, president of Key Events,
which helps Inman and others develop themes and create memorable
events. ``Or maybe you don't have time to negotiate every detail
and be on location to make sure everything is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Key Events has 10 employees and brings in more than $6 million
in annual revenues, charging clients a flat fee (usually at least
$10,000) or 15 to 30 percent of the total cost of an event.
</P>
<P>
   One recent job was a $40,000 South of Market party in a loft for
about 150 employees and friends of Smartshop.com to celebrate the
public launch of the San Jose startup's online shopping and
comparative-pricing service.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its name and niche, Key Events hired actors to
appear as Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Groucho Marx and
Barbie to ask guests questions and offer prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Key Events also participated in one of San Francisco's most
strategically important events _ this week's visitation by the
Professional Convention Management Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although gatherings of computer users, architects and
dermatologists may be much larger, few groups have as much impact
on the future of San Francisco's biggest industry as event planners
from around the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, visitors to the city generated about $6 billion in
revenues and accounted for more than 60,000 jobs. Business travel
accounts for more than half the total, including more than 1.5
million visitors who annually attend conventions, trade shows and
other group meetings in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to showcase San Francisco to convention
planners is particularly important because this is the most
influential group of buyers in the country,'' said John Marks,
president of the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the convention planners kicked off their four-day
visit to San Francisco, their first in 14 years, with a lavish
reception at San Francisco's recently refurbished City Hall. It
featured dim sum, sushi and more traditional fare, plenty of
California wine, spectacular flower arrangements and music ranging
from 10-piece orchestra to solo sax to synthesized harp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice,'' said Alene Waxler, an owner of the Alan Waxler
destination management company in Las Vegas, who has seen it all
before. ``We can bring a large volume of people into a city, so
they usually put on the Ritz.''
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000, two-hour City Hall reception was subsidized by
those with major stakes in San Francisco's convention business,
including the visitors' bureau, United Airlines and Moscone
Center's SMG Food Service.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda of the convention planners were tours of the
Moscone Center, which by 2003 will expand in size by 50 percent _
from 600,000 to 900,000 square feet _ a party at the Fillmore and a
special performance at the Marriott by the cast of ``Beach Blanket
Babylon.''
</P>
<P>
   In tourism, as in real estate, location is everything.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's City Hall is an expensive venue. It goes for
about $15,000 an evening. Other local landmarks like the Palace of
the Legion of Honor, Exploratorium, Academy of Sciences and M.H. de
Young and Asian Art museums rent out for around $10,000 to $12,000
an evening.
</P>
<P>
   An even costlier party location is the Hornet, the World War
II-era aircraft carrier docked in Alameda that rents for about
$30,000. AstraZeneca, the world's fourth-largest pharmaceutical
company, is flying in more than 6,000 employees for a huge
international sales meeting starting January 30 and will treat them
to a blowout party on the Hornet. Entertainment will be provided on
the flight deck by the Smithereens band.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of that party could top $500,000 according to Gordon
Thompson, marketing vice president for Cappa &AMP; Graham, the San
Francisco destination and event management firm that is providing
transportation for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   AstraZeneca's total transportation costs could reach $500,000,
too, and Thompson said the total bill for the entire meeting could
be $7 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another event that could drop a similar sum in the Bay Area is
the National Basketball Association All-Star Weekend February 11
through 13. Again, Cappa &AMP; Graham is providing the transportation,
including 125 motor coaches to transport thousands of players,
guests and fans of the NBA to events at the Cow Palace and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for big companies and organizations to drop
$10 million or more on sales and user conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, the San Jose networking equipment giant,
reportedly spends that much on two annual conferences.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Cisco sponsored events in Vancouver, British
Columbia, and New Orleans, where the company took over the
Superdome and installed amusement park rides for about 5,000
customers, employees and partners.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft Inc. of Pleasanton has similar-size conferences and
hosted an Earth Wind and Fire concert in the Astrodome for its
customers in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these meetings started as free customer appreciation
and education events,'' said Chris Meyer, CEO of Conference
Planners in Burlingame, which counts Cisco and PeopleSoft among its
clients. ``But the numbers became so big that companies began
charging fees, although many still subsidize some of the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, incentive travel rewards are usually entirely free
for those who win them. One of the more lavish events is Sun
Microsystems' annual three-day ``Sunrise'' party for close to 2,000
of its most productive employees plus their spouses or significant
others.
</P>
<P>
   This past October, the incentive reward bash, which is estimated
to cost $5 million or more, was held in Singapore. One evening, Sun
took over the grounds of the posh Raffles Hotel for a party.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems employees who exceeded their performance
targets were flown in from around the world. The year before,
Sunrise was held on the island of Hawaii. In 1997, Paris was the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition for the best employees, especially in high tech,
is incredible and incentive travel programs have become a really
important part of compensation programs along with stock options,''
said Bill Lazzaretti, executive vice president of Carlson
Marketing's Western region. Carlson, which is headquartered in
Minneapolis and has a major 125-person office in San Francisco, is
the biggest company in the incentive rewards field. Its clients
include Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Discovery Toys
and Freightliner.
</P>
<P>
   Incentive travel programs have become a thriving industry with a
trade association in New York. The Society of Incentive Travel
Executives notes that the U.S. incentive market totaled $22.8
billion last year, including $8.4 billion spent on travel awards.
The average spending for incentive sales programs was $1,981 per
person, and companies that used such programs reportedly boosted
sales goals by an average of 19.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lazzaretti observed that incentive travel often motivates
employees better than cash, which simply disappears when people pay
their bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are smart,'' he said. ``They don't spend money
unless they need to, and incentive travel has trophy value. You
belong to a club; you are recognized on stage; you can tell your
friends and neighbors.''

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   How to Avoid Scrutiny by the IRS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: How can small businesses decrease their odds of being audited by
the Internal Revenues Service or the Franchise Tax Board?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: With the tax-filing season almost upon us, the IRS is moving
some agents from money-laundering cases to auditing small
businesses, according to the California Society of Certified Public
Accountants in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   This means that professional services corporations, sole
proprietorships, limited liability corporations and limited
liability partnerships are more likely to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chances of getting audited, the state CPA society
came up with this checklist:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Don't fudge income. An imperfect match between what you and your
clients report could be disastrous. For small, unincorporated
businesses, tax authorities will look for discrepancies between
income reported in your tax return and income reported by your
clients or business partners.
</P>
<P>
   They provide the IRS with these forms: Form 1099 (contract or
vendor income), 1098 (mortgage or other real estate interest) and
K-1 (income from partnerships, estates, trusts, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're inclined to do the occasional ``under the table''
cash transaction, stop.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with unincorporated business such as sole
proprietorships should report all income, even if the 1099s, 1098s
or K-1s contain errors. If these forms overstate your income, you
can correct it in the expense section of your tax return by
labeling it ``1099 error amount included in income.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Don't live above your (reported) means. Do not report income
amounts that are inconsistent with:
</P>
<P>
   _your ZIP code
</P>
<P>
   _property such as real estate, cars, boats or planes registered
in your name
</P>
<P>
   _professional licenses on record
</P>
<P>
   _mortgage interest deducted
</P>
<P>
   _IRS ``Hobby Loss Rules'' (repetitive losses incurred by a
taxpayer in an activity not pursued for profit)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Don't report business expenses that look like personal expenses.
Watch out for inordinately high business expenses that could appear
to be personal in nature such as those for travel, entertainment,
legal fees and a home office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Be Careful about reporting losses from rental property. This
applies to Schedule E losses from rental property activities,
partnerships, etc. Generally, losses from passive activities such
as rental property may not be used to offset gains from active
income such as from an investment portfolio. If adjusted gross
income is greater than $150,000, no net passive activity loss is
allowed. If AGI is less than $100,000, net rental losses you can
claim are generally limited to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Know the rules for writing off bad debt. These are widely
misunderstood. For example, many small businesses operate on a
``cash basis'' method of accounting that recognizes revenue and
expenses when cash is received or disbursed, rather than the point
in time when it was earned or when the expense was incurred. You
cannot take a bad debt deduction if you are operating on a cash
basis because the transaction was never recorded as income.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Be meticulous about cash transaction reporting. If yours is a
cash-intensive business, take care to properly report cash
transactions of more than $10,000 using Form 8300. Businesses that
would expect to have cash deposits of more than $10,000 and do not
file Form 8300 _ such as check-cashing companies _ give the
impression of having unreported income.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KIN CARE REVISITED:
</P>
<P>
   My answer to a question from a flight attendant about
California's new sick leave law last Wednesday needs clarification.
The sick leave law in question is Assembly Bill 109 (commonly
referred to as ``kin care''), not AB60.
</P>
<P>
   AB109 doesn't exclude employees who have collective bargaining
contracts. However, it does exclude from coverage ``any benefit
provided under an employee welfare benefit plan subject to the
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act'' (ERISA).
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco employment lawyer Tom Geidt of Schachter,
Kristoff, Orenstein &AMP; Berkowitz says ``garden variety'' sick leave
paid out of a company's general assets rather than a special fund
are covered by California's new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that virtually all California employers _ public
and private, union and nonunion, non-union,  &LR; large and small _ must
comply with the new law,'' which allows California employees to use
up to half their annual allotment of paid sick leave to care for an
ailing child, spouse or parent.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least some airlines are claiming an exemption. A
United Airlines manager tells me his airline does have a separate
sick leave trust governed by ERISA, so it is not subject to
California's new sick leave statute.

 Pac Bell Points to Study in Long-Distance Bid  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Pacific Bell said yesterday that it has gathered more ammunition
in its bid to win approval to offer long-distance telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a new internal study of local phone service, the
telephone company declared California more open to competition than
New York, where federal and state regulators recently gave Bell
Atlantic the green light to offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell has applied for permission to offer long-distance
service in the state but first needs to convince officials that
rivals have a fair chance to sell local telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that New York has won approval, we feel that New York is
the model,'' said spokesmen Bill Mashek. ``And we beat or match
their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, last summer Pacific Bell said it switched 200,000
phone numbers to rival companies, slightly more than Bell Atlantic
for the same time period. Pacific Bell also said it had 1,000 cages
in switching offices where competitors had their equipment tied in
to the local phone system, about 20 percent more than Bell
Atlantic. However, the study did not take into account the fact
that more people live in California than New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals and watchdog groups scoffed at Pacific Bell's declaration
and bar graphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about as open as Fort Knox,'' said AT&AMP;T Corp.
spokesman James Peterson, pointing out that 99 percent of homes
still get their local telephone service from Pacific Bell. AT&AMP;T
also has protested the decision to let Bell Atlantic offer
long-distance in New York, saying the company hasn't opened up
local service to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a residential customer or a business customer,
competitors are nowhere to be seen,'' said Regina Costa,
telecommunications research director at The Utility Reform Network,
a consumer group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission expects to rule on
the company's application this summer, and then Pacific Bell plans
to seek final approval from the FCC. If approved, it hopes to start
offering long-distance by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell parent SBC Communications recently filed an
application to sell long-distance service in Texas as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell said it has already put in place much of the key
infrastructure to allow competition, such as giving other phone
companies access to its central offices and porting phone numbers
to different carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company says 1 out of 8 residential customers
use rivals to make ``local toll'' calls, which are calls to areas
13 to 25 miles from their homes. And several companies offer
high-speed Internet service over local phone lines, including Covad
Communications and Northpoint Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell says rivals simply don't want to offer local
service, because the profit margins are too slim _ or nonexistent.
The company says it can only break into the black by selling other
features, like call waiting and Caller ID, and local toll service.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Pacific Bell argues that long-distance firms, by staying
out of the local market, are keeping the more lucrative
long-distance service to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' countered AT&AMP;T's Peterson. And TURN's Costa said
she isn't convinced that Pacific Bell can reliably switch customers
over to rivals. Two outside firms began testing Pacific Bell's
systems in December but aren't scheduled to complete their review
until April.

 Net Music Customers Lose Cards  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In one of the largest credit card recalls ever, Discover and
American Express are canceling the account numbers of anyone who
ever shopped at CDUniverse, a popular online music store that was
recently penetrated by a hacker.
<P>
   Discover Financial Services is reissuing more than 10,000 credit
cards. American Express refused to say how many it was reissuing,
but it has many more customers than Discover.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, an unidentified hacker believed to be Russian
boasted to reporters that he had seized 300,000 credit card numbers
from the site and posted 25,000 on a Web site, apparently after the
music retailer refused his demand for money. The site was shut down
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The response by Discover and American Express is unusual
because, generally, companies only reissue cards when they know a
card number has been stolen or a customer reports suspicious
transactions. But in this case, American Express and Discover said
they wanted to act pre-emptively, since they weren't sure exactly
which credit card numbers may have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about any other mass reissuance of credit cards
like this,'' said Anita Boomstein, a New York lawyer specializing
in credit cards and e-commerce. ``What this demonstrates is that
(credit card firms) are trying to address as swiftly as possible a
very big problem, which is fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express spokeswoman Judy Tenzer said, ``We felt it was
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Discover and American Express are calling customers whose cards
are being canceled. Both firms said it usually takes a week or two
to receive new cards in the mail, but the companies will send them
overnight if the customer asks.
</P>
<P>
   A Visa spokesman noted that Visa doesn't issue the credit cards.
Instead, Visa will let the issuing banks decide what steps to take.
MasterCard, like Visa, also issues cards though banks and other
partners.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Wells Fargo identified 600 of its Visa and
MasterCard numbers in the CDUniverse database but hasn't detected
any unusual charges with those cards and, therefore, decided not to
reissue them, spokesman Dave Remund said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that cardholders need not worry, because even if there
were any attempts to fraudulently use the cards in the future,
cardholders wouldn't be responsible for the payments. He said Wells
Fargo wouldn't be on the hook either, because the hacker doesn't
have access to the credit card itself _ only the number. In cases
where unauthorized charges come up, he said the merchants will
generally have to eat the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan and First USA, two major Visa and MasterCard
issuers, didn't return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boomstein estimated that the decision might cost Discover and
American Express $1 per card but noted that the action will protect
them from picking up the tab if any of the cards were stolen and
subsequently misused. It will also reassure customers worried about
the widely publicized incident.
</P>
<P>
   `It's very good public relations,'' said Boomstein, a partner
with Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Reed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is trying to use information provided by Connecticut's
-based  &LR; CDUniverse to track down the hacker. American Express and
Discover spokesmen said they knew of only a few cases where the
credit cards were fraudulently used after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts say other Web sites have occasionally been
penetrated, though normally companies keep the incidents quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Web sites you've heard of'' have been successfully
attacked, said Arthur Coviello, chief executive of RSA Security
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   RSA, a Massachusetts firm that sells encryption software, only
knows about the incidents because it was asked to provide software
to help beef up the security afterward, Coviello said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many times credit cards numbers have been
stolen online. Just yesterday, the Associated Press reported that a
hacker broke into Visa's computers and threatened to release
sensitive information unless it received $10 million. But Foster
City's -based  &LR; Visa told AP the information was stolen last July
from its European headquarters in London and consisted of old files
that posed no threat to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company received a ransom demand in early December but
refused to pay anything, instead notifying Scotland Yard and the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, customers don't have to worry, experts said.
American Express, for instance, said it will always cover any
losses when a customer is victimized by online fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards generally are scrambled when sent from a user's
computer to the Web site. The problem, experts said, is that
information sometimes isn't secure enough when it is stored on the
merchants' computers linked to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Both Discover and American Express said they are working with
CDUniverse to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. ``We are
going to have the leading technology out there,'' said Brett
Brewer, spokesman for EUniverse, cq  &LR; the merchant's parent company.
``We want to be absolutely as safe as possible.''

 Schwab Meets Street, Will Cut Commissions  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Charles Schwab Corp., the biggest online stock brokerage, plans to
cut commissions for its most-active stock traders, a major
departure from its until-now inviolate $29.95 rate for Internet
trades, people familiar with the plan said.
<P>
   Separately, Schwab reported its profit for the quarter ended
December 31 rose 60 percent from the 1998 fourth quarter to $170.5
million (20 cents per share), boosted by record trading activity
and an influx of $33 billion in new money from clients.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Schwab generally disdains to compete on price,
using service, a broad menu of online features and a network of 340
branches to distinguish itself from rivals. Its online commission
is among the highest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its marketplace success, Schwab insiders said, the
company feels it must take dramatic steps to hold on to its most
profitable customers, heavy traders who might be tempted by
commissions as low as $5 at some other brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials confirmed they are considering a
volume-discount program, but declined to provide details. ``It's
something we've been thinking about. You are likely to see a
typical innovative Schwab plan,'' said Chief Financial Officer
Chris Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   Several other brokerages already extend lower commissions to
frequent traders. Menlo Park's E-Trade, for example, offers a
tiered commission system with rates as low as $4.95 per transaction
for those who trade 75 or more times per quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab usually lags the industry in price cuts. It didn't offer
its $29.95 online commission to most customers until the end of
1997, well after most competitors were already charging much less
than that for trades made by computer. Even then, it did so only
after a lot of anguish and great internal debate.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming move to &LR; ``is an acknowledgment that to stay
competitive (with heavy traders), you've got to lower your
prices,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Greg Smith. Schwab has ``lots of
perks available, but they may not be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The company recently rolled out Velocity, its souped-up computer
trading system for active investors.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's fourth-quarter results showed how previous commission
cuts actually helped raise revenue by revving up trading volume.
The company's fourth-quarter revenue of $1.13 billion was up 43
percent from the comparable period in 1998, thanks to sharply
higher trading.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's profit was in line with its projection of
fourth-quarter earnings released several weeks ago. The company's
shares fell $2, to $39, yesterday after results were announced.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, daily average trades rose 68 percent from the
previous year. By December, Schwab was carrying out 234,000 trades
a day for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schwab customers added $33.3 billion in new money to
their accounts. During the fourth quarter, Schwab opened 388,600
new accounts, ending the year with 6.6 million accounts. Customer
assets totaled $725 billion, a 47.7 percent jump from year-end
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab ``has been riding the wave'' of a booming stock market,
said Russell Keene, an analyst with the brokerage Putnam, Lovell,
de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton. ``The firm continues to attract new
business, showing its underlying strength.''

 AuctionWatch Rams Through EBay's Information Blockade  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Doing an end run around technological walls erected by eBay, a site
called AuctionWatch.com yesterday again began posting listings
taken from the Net's leading auctioneer.
<P>
   San Jose's eBay is now mulling the option of filing suit to
prevent AuctionWatch from including eBay listings on its Universal
Search service, which compiles related postings from numerous
auction sites so users can track down the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   In November, eBay successfully blocked San Bruno's AuctionWatch
from tapping into its listings. But AuctionWatch announced
 &LR; yesterday said it had found a way to get around the barrier and
once again combine eBay's listings with those from Amazon.com,
Yahoo and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't expand on the specific technical measures we used,''
said Rodrigo Sales, chief executive of AuctionWatch. ``If I did,
then they would try to block us again and we would have to get
through again and it would be a cat-and-mouse situation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said AuctionWatch had come up with a battering ram
``robust enough'' to prevent eBay from once again closing the gate.
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said his
company's engineers are now dissecting AuctionWatch's technology in
hopes of again blocking access by the aggregator's computers.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that eBay's lawyers are looking into the matter.
``We will consider all our options,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   The option of a lawsuit is highly likely. Last month, eBay filed
suit against a company called Bidder's Edge, which, like
AuctionWatch, had been incorporating eBay's listings as part of an
auction aggregation service.
</P>
<P>
   That case is still  &LR; working its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All AuctionWatch wants to do is move traffic to its site so it
can sell advertising,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   But AuctionWatch's Sales insisted that his company is providing
a legitimate service for users by compiling listings from numerous
sites in a single location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do anticipate a lawsuit,'' he said. ``However, we do
believe that we are in compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   To Sales, the key point here is who actually ``owns'' eBay's
listings. ``We believe the content is in the public domain and is
available for anyone to see on the Web,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even generated by eBay. It's generated by their user
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove agreed, conceding that descriptions and photos
submitted by users are indeed the property of the submitters. But
he stressed that additional information, such as number of bids
received and length of bidding, is produced by eBay and remains
eBay's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along that the information generated by users
is in fact the intellectual property of users,'' Pursglove said.
``But all the rest is eBay's.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales said AuctionWatch attracts ``hundreds of thousands'' of
visitors each day, compared with about 1.4 million daily eBay
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of how vital eBay's listings are to any firm that
wants to aggregate auction data, Sales observed that traffic to his
site's search service plunged by 50 percent after eBay began
blocking use of its content in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to us because it's very important to our
user base,'' Sales said of access to eBay's listings.
</P>
<P>
   Those users enjoy a streamlined way of browsing available items
for sale. For example, entering ``Sinatra albums'' on AuctionWatch
pulls up a variety of ring-a-ding records listed on Yahoo, eBay and
other services.
</P>
<P>
   To make a purchase, a user would then click a link to the actual
auction site and enter a bid following that site's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Sales contended that eBay is deliberately  &LR; trying to prevent its
users from knowing that similar items can be obtained at lower
prices from other auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the biggest player in the space, and you have the
lion's share of the market, it's certainly to your benefit for
people not to know there are other items available elsewhere,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Genni Combes, an analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q in San
Francisco, said eBay is not out of line in seeking to protect what
is arguably its single most important asset _ a relationship of
trust with users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest concern Wall Street has right now relates to
customer experience,'' she said. ``One of eBay's biggest issues is
that the further they get away from the listing, the less control
they have over customer experience. That's a valid issue.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay's Pursglove echoed this sentiment by pointing out that his
engineers tested AuctionWatch by doing searches for popular items
like Pokemon goods and Pez dispensers. The eBay listings that came
up on AuctionWatch, he claimed, were ``inaccurate and incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really worried that our users are going to be harmed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's stock gained $5.69 yesterday to close at $139.50.

executives higher performance from laptop PCs running on AC power
without sacrificing battery life when they're on the go.
<P>
   But some analysts questioned how many buyers will want to pay
the premium the new technology will add to notebook prices.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is adding the technology, which it calls SpeedStep, to its
latest Pentium III processors for notebooks. When a
SpeedStep-equipped computer is plugged into an AC outlet, it will
run almost as fast as a top-of-the-line desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   But when the machine is unplugged, it automatically switches to
a mode that requires only about 60 percent as much power, thus
avoiding rapid battery drain, while slowing processor performance
only about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first Pentium IIIs incorporating SpeedStep run at 650 or 600
megahertz in ``maximum performance'' mode. In the slower
``battery-optimized'' mode, both drop back to 500 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Users who don't care about battery life will have the option of
overriding the automatic switching and running at maximum speed
even on the go.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Intel's speediest notebook chips ran at 500
megahertz, whether on AC power or batteries. Desktop versions of
the Pentium III now run as fast as 800 megahertz. But such chips
consume so much power that if they were installed in mobile models
_ without SpeedStep _ they'd reduce battery life to levels few road
warriors would tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips are available immediately, according to Intel, and
a dozen top PC notebook-makers were on hand at Intel's San
Francisco press briefing yesterday to show off new
SpeedStep-equipped models.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive of them, however, cost almost $2,500, and
most were in the $3,000 to $4,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Those prices were one reason Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga
Information Group, was cool to the new technology. ``My problem is
that I'm not sure how many people really care about a little extra
processing speed,'' he said, ``especially when they have to pay a
premium for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the audience seems perfectly happy with the
performance of the laptops they can get now,'' he said. ``If
they're not, it's probably because notebooks have slower hard
drives and graphics, not because of the processor speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things notebook users care about are weight, ease of use
and price,'' Enderle added. ``This increases the weight as well as
the price, because you need a bigger box and room for internal fans
to dissipate the extra heat the new chips will generate'' when
running at maximum speed.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Andler, vice president of marketing at Fujitsu PC in
Milpitas, which announced SpeedStep notebooks tentatively priced at
around $3,100 and up, said ``there's definitely a premium for the
new chips,'' but he said it amounts to only about $100 for the new
600-megahertz mobile Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you can get by with last year's technology, which still
delivers very acceptable performance,'' Andler said. ``This
(SpeedStep) is for people who want absolute cutting-edge
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Intel, more and more users fall into that category.
</P>
<P>
   At the press briefing, the company invited several business
customers to demonstrate how they've use prerelease SpeedStep
notebooks with high-end graphics programs to design marketing
materials and with accounting and data-analysis software to manage
business information. And four enthusiastic students from Homestead
High School in Cupertino showed off a presentation about the Gold
Rush _ complete with 3-D models, digital audio and video and
special effects _ that they'd created on SpeedStep notebook PCs
lent by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think laptop, you think `downgrade,' but not with
this,'' said student Michael Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Several notebookmakers, including Toshiba and Apple, have for
years given users an option to reduce the clock speed of their
processors, which results in a modest increase in battery life. But
SpeedStep reduces not only the clock speed, but also the voltage
going to the processor _ from 1.6 to 1.35 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Because power consumption is proportional to the square of the
voltage times the frequency, the new technology reduces power
requirements more substantially. In yesterday's briefing, Intel
showed a notebook that had been consuming 11 watts when running at
650 megahertz on AC power drop to 6.5 watts when it was unplugged
and fell back to 500 megahertz.

 Microsoft Earnings Beat Experts' Estimates  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft's second-quarter profits beat analysts' forecasts by 2
cents per share, largely on the strength of its Office software and
a rebounding Asian market, despite a hefty charge associated with
settling a private antitrust lawsuit.
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash., software giant netted $2.44 billion (44
cents per share) in profits, up from $1.98 billion (40 cents) or &LR; 
40 cents a share  &LR; in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding paying
a reported $275 million to settle a suit brought by Caldera Inc., a
Salt Lake City software firm, earnings per share were 47 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thompson Financial was 42 cents per share. The ``whisper
estimates'' _ numbers analysts give to big brokerage-house
customers that are also circulated on the Internet _ were 44 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with how the quarter came in,'' said new Chief
Financial Officer John Connors. ``There was some uncertainty
regarding Y2K, but overall, we're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was a general slowdown in growth of personal
computers as businesses focused money and effort on staving off
potential Y2K glitches, strong sales of its Office 2000 suite of
business software , &LR; and SQL Server 7.0 database boosted Microsoft's
overall revenue, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter ended December 31 totaled $6.11 billion,
an 18 percent rise over $5.2 billion for the same quarter a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a solid quarter, with no surprises really; they
continue to fire on all cylinders,'' said Art Russell, analyst at
Edward Jones. ``Office 2000 continues to fuel their results
near-term.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said, improving economic conditions in
Asia and a concomitant increase in sales of PCs fueled a 56 percent
advance in revenue from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also enjoyed a $436 million gain in its investment
income due to healthy performances by a number of companies
Microsoft has a stake in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much in line with expectations,'' said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst who follows Microsoft for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``It's a reasonable report, but when you look at the investment
income increase, it's not all that exciting after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Connors said the company expects ``healthy''
results for the following two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that it will take until the fourth quarter for
Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system to have an impact on
earnings. The operating system officially launches February Feb.
 &LR; 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a company on the threshold of a new generation of
products, and we are enthused,'' Connors said. ``However,
competition is fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings statement was the first authored by Connors, who
replaced Greg Maffei as Microsoft's chief financial officer earlier
this month. Maffei left the company to run Worldwide Fiber, a
Vancouver, British Columbia, telecommunications firm.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Microsoft founder Bill Gates promoted his
second-in-command Steve Ballmer to the chief executive post. Gates
will remain chairman and become ``chief software architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday also marked Microsoft official rebuttal to a federal
judge's November 5 ``findings of fact'' that the company is a
monopoly that harmed consumers and stymied competition.
</P>
<P>
   In its 70-page response, Microsoft said it disagrees disagreed
 &LR; with many of the court's findings and said the dominance of its
popular Windows operating system doesn't constitute a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares rose $3.06, closing at $115.31. In after-hours
trading, shares dropped to $112.50.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Chef Shows His Sweet Side   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The cover of David Lebovitz's ``Room for Dessert''
shows a beautiful marjolaine _ layers of flavored creams between
nut meringues. It looks mouthwatering, gorgeous _ and complicated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's a shame, because Lebovitz's book actually specializes in
far simpler creations. The marjolaine, with three pages of
instructions, is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   But the cover is about all there is to fault about the dessert
book from the author, former pastry chef at Chez Panisse and the
now-closed Moonsoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovitz learned his craft on the job rather than at a culinary
school. He cooked at the more casual cafe upstairs from Chez
Panisse, but was fascinated by the desserts being turned out by
Lindsey Shere downstairs. Eventually he was recruited to join the
pastry team, and the influence shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desserts were never extravagantly or elaborately decorated at
Chez Panisse,'' he writes. Instead he learned how to work with the
freshest ingredients and turn them into something simple and
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   His book is a masterful selection of such creations, many
accompanied by glossy photographs by Michael Lamotte.
</P>
<P>
   His section on cakes is composed mostly of single layer cakes
that don't need to be split, filled and assembled. Instead, he
pairs his sweets with poached fruit like the pistachio and cardamom
cake with apricots poached in Sauternes, or just with whipped cream
like with his plum and huckleberry upside down cake and the lovely
maple walnut-pear cake.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit desserts seem to be Lebovitz's specialty. He includes a
terrific section in the front on the varieties of fruit he likes
best, like Latin and Asian bananas instead of the commercially
produced yellow Cavendish and Gros Michel. Colorful photographs
accompany his descriptions, along with tips for picking what's
ripe.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit dessert section features recipes like intense very
spicy caramel pears and poached fruit compote, which is really more
of a method than a recipe. He gives suggestions, but leaves the
actual creating to the reader.
</P>
<P>
   He also has chapters on custards and souffles, sorbets and ice
creams, cookies and candies, and liqueurs and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   All his recipes have a personal style, with more tips and
techniques than many cookbooks. It's as though he wants you to know
all of the secrets to making a dish turn out right.
</P>
<P>
   The results are wonderful. The desserts may be simple, but
they're delicious and beautiful enough to be served as easily at
the end of a formal dinner party as at a family gathering.

VERY SPICY CARAMEL PEARS
</P>
<P>
   Use a baking dish that will hold the pears in a single layer.
That way they all will get thoroughly infused with the spice
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   15 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   4 Bosc, Comice or Butter pears
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light or dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Cognac, brandy or rum
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely crush the spices with a mortar and pestle, or break
them up in a plastic bag by smashing them with a rolling pin or
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and quarter the pears, and core them, slicing away the
fibrous parts in the center. Cut the butter into small pieces and
put in a baking dish with the brown sugar. Put the baking dish in
the oven for a few minutes to melt the butter. Arrange the pears in
the baking dish, add the spices and liquor, and toss everything
together so the pears are evenly coated.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the baking dish with foil and bake 30 to 45 minutes, until
the pears are baked through. (The baking time will vary depending
on the pears you use. Firm Bosc pears will take 45 minutes, but
softer Comice and Butter pears will take about 30 minutes.) Remove
the dish from the oven two or three times during baking and stir
the pears so they will be flavored on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The pears are ready when they can be easily pierced with the tip
of a paring knife. Remove them from the oven and lift them out of
the baking dish with a slotted spoon. Scrape the juices and spices
from the baking dish into a heavy saute pan.
</P>
<P>
   Add the heavy cream to the pear juices and spices on the stove
and cook over medium heat until the mixture turns a deep color,
thickens and caramelizes. Strain the finished caramel over the
pears and serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Vintners Angry Over Use of `Napa' on Some Wine 
 Labels  By Gerald D. Boyd 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The California wine industry has two highly
visible images: For the consumer, California wine flows from this
huge faceless source that appears benign, romantic and unending;
for industry members, it is an ever-changing dynamic of intrigue
and fierce competition.
<P>
   A recent sale added fuel to the fire of wine industry intrigue
that shows potential for confusion in the marketplace. On January
3, Beringer Wine Estates announced the sale of its Napa Ridge brand
to the Bronco Wine Co. On the surface there's nothing unusual about
this transaction, but between the lines, it could be possible cause
for concern for the wine consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Ridge was the brainchild of Beringer Wine Estates, a
venerable Napa Valley wine company that reinvented itself in recent
years. Under a line of visionary leaders, Beringer gathered into
its fold Meridian Vineyards, Chateau St. Jean, Chateau Souverain,
Stags' Leap Winery and St. Clement, not to mention an import
collection from France, Chile and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Franzia family owns the Bronco Wine Co., headquartered in
the Central Valley town of Ceres. In the last few years, the
Franzias have been buying up brands, mainly in the North Coast.
Napa Ridge now becomes part of a quartet of four North-Coast wine
brands with a Napa appellation in their name: Napa Creek Winery,
Napa Creek Cellar, Domaine Napa and the recently resurrected
Rutherford Vintners.
</P>
<P>
   From the first Napa Ridge wines in 1986, the brand name has been
controversial. Critics, most of whom are other Napa vintners,
complained that Napa Ridge was trading off the good name of Napa
Valley when the wines were not made from grapes grown in the
valley, and thus the wines did not have ``Napa character.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Napa Ridge wines were made in Sonoma County by a
talented winemaker named David Schlottman. Using grapes from a
number of sources throughout the state, Schlottman made some of the
best varietal wines on the market for the price.
</P>
<P>
   Bronco Wine Co. paid approximately $40 million for the Napa
Ridge brand asset and inventory; no winery, vineyards or other real
estate are included. And the deal doesn't include Schlottman, who
will continue to make wine for Beringer Estates. Bronco also plans
to build a large winery near the Napa airport.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Bronco gets a wine brand with a Napa name but no
Napa connection. And Bronco is facing a proposed ban from the Napa
Valley Vintner's Association on any geographic wine brand that is
not made from a minimum of 85 percent grapes from that region.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, Bronco can legally use ``Cellared and Bottled
in Napa, California'' on Napa Ridge wines made in the new Napa
winery, even though the grapes for the wine may come from vineyards
outside the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The whole geographic question relating to wine labels is a bone
of contention right now in the wine industry, although it doesn't
seem to have much impact on wine consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sale of Napa Ridge was purely a business decision and
although the question of the geographic name did have some role in
the decision, it wasn't the driver,'' says Tor Kenward, vice
president of Beringer winery operations. He added that the Napa
Ridge brand went from sales of 1 million cases to about 400,000,
while Meridian and Beringer Founder's Estate brands have
experienced steady growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kenward told Potpourri that pressure concerning the use of the
name ``Napa'' on non-Napa wines has been from neighbors and other
Napa vintners, with very little coming from consumers. Jim Carter,
general manager of Napa Ridge Winery for Bronco Wine Co.,
acknowledged that the geographic question was a consideration in
the sale. Carter says that Bronco's Napa Creek Winery brand may or
may not be made from Napa-grown grapes, while Napa Creek Cellar and
Domaine Napa are made from Napa grapes.
</P>
<P>
   So why should consumers be concerned about the future of Napa
Ridge wines? After all, the wines sell for $8 to $11, a moderate
price for a ready-to-drink wine. Buying a wine by appellation
should insure the consumer a certain style and quality, the same
criteria that would be applied to a wine purchased from a favorite
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Ridge wines offer good quality at good value, but they are
not from the Napa Valley and no matter how you cut it, that's
deceptive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is no longer Beringer's and one can only hope that
Bronco will maintain the high quality standards of the wine. As for
the brand name, Bronco now has four wine brands carrying a ``Napa''
name, so how is the consumer supposed to know which wine to trust?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Label Says What? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is the first in an on-going series of occasional
commentaries about wine labels, not wine quality, that either
intentionally or unintentionally mislead the consumer with
confusing wording, statements or graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The dubious honor for the first label in this series goes to the
recently released Clos Du Val 1998 Carneros Single Vineyard
Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   In a release that accompanied the wine, the source of the grapes
is identified as ``Clos Du Val's own Carneros vineyard property,''
but the label states only ``Single Vineyard.'' Does this mean that
Clos Du Val owns only one vineyard in Carneros? And does the
``single vineyard'' have a name, like Martha's Vineyard or Robert
Young Vineyard? Could you be more forthcoming, Clos Du Val?

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Price Doesn't Pay Off In Juice With Calcium   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Everyone knows the traditional health benefits _
all that vitamin C _ of orange juice. But in recent years, orange
juice producers have gone a step further by adding calcium to the
beverage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todays panel tasted eight different orange juices fortified with
calcium. All come in cartons in the refrigerator section, and all
have the same amount of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Prices varied greatly from brand to brand as well as store to
store. We found as much as a dollar difference for the same brand
in different stores.
</P>
<P>
   The panel definitely did not like the taste of the
calcium-fortified orange juice as much as the regular orange juices
tasted recently. The juice panelists liked best at this tasting is
made from concentrate, but overall the panel liked
not-from-concentrate juices more. These accounted for four of the
top five.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunnyside &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $2.99 at Cala Markets) came in first.
Not only is it from concentrate, it's also the second lowest priced
of all of the juices. One panelist described the juice as having a
``nice citrus kick,'' and another particularly liked the acidity.
Others found the juice slightly bitter and ``pithy.'' One would buy
it; four might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Horizon &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $3.99-$4.99 at some supermarkets) came in
second, but the panel was decidely split. Three tasters liked this
juice best, but two others ranked it very low. Three would buy it;
two might.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Tropicana &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $3.99-$4.19 at many
supermarkets). Panelists all commented on the tartness; two
described it as tasting more like grapefruit juice than orange
juice. Two tasters also objected to the high amount of pulp. Two
would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Florida's Natural &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $3.99 at some supermarkets)
came in fourth. Four panelists liked the sweet orange flavor; one
particularly liked the balance. However, one dissenter described it
as tasting like ``orange drink.'' Two would buy it, two might buy
it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunkist &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $4.19 at Safeway) came in fifth. Again,
panelists were split. Two liked the sweet-tart balance, but others
thought it was chalky, artificial tasting and bitter. One would buy
it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Lucky (at Albertsons), Minute Maid and
Tropicana Season's Best, but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Lesli Neilson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in
San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park. All

 AT THE SOURCE: Bees Make Keeper's Business Buzz   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 NAPA COUNTY, Calif. _  How do bees pay their rent? In honey, of
course.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, this is not a third-grade joke, but the real-life
arrangement of a rather unusual Bay Area business. Marshall's Farm
has its office and its honey house _ where honey is extracted and
bottled _ in American Canyon (Napa County), but its real business
locations are all over the greater Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Beekeeper Spencer Marshall sets up his hives wherever his bees
will find suitable blossoms _ manzanita blooming in the Sierra
foothills in early spring; the bean fields of the San Joaquin
Valley; the various plantings at Boyd's Napa Valley Organic Berry
Farm (blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries all
yield distinctly flavored honeys); coastal Blue Gum eucalyptus; and
wildflower mixes specific to Bay Area locations, from the foggy
Marin coast to arid stretches of eastern Alameda County.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, son of Lodi farmers, had a career in carpentry and
remodeling, but bees and beekeeping were his first love: His
grandmother kept bees in Oregon, and he started working with bees
when he had to spend large amounts of time at the family farm after
his father suffered a severe injury.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his wife, Helene, a sculptor and ceramic artist, got
together 10 years ago, he found a partner equally enamored of bees
_ though Helene Marshall is not a hands-on beekeeper. ``I never
wanted to stick my hands into a hive full of bees,'' she says. But
she enjoys the marketing, designing labels and connecting with
customers at farmers markets. So by the mid-'90s, the Marshalls had
become full-time honey producers.
</P>
<P>
   While they do market some blends, they are strong proponents of
eating honey harvested in the immediate neighborhood, saying that
these honeys are a homeopathic remedy for pollen allergies. The
honey, they say, should have been harvested within a 50-mile radius
of your home. Their recipe: One tablespoon of honey a day keeps the
allergist away.
</P>
<P>
   Possible health benefits aside, these regional honeys have
distinct flavors, ranging from light and floral to dark and almost
smoky. In part, Marshall's honeys retain the characteristics of
their microclimate and crop because they are minimally treated _
strained through cheesecloth to remove such solid particles as
bees' wings, but not filtered, and never heated.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may crystallize when left in a cold place (``never
refrigerate honey,'' says Helene Marshall), honey can be easily
reliquefied by placing the jar in a larger container filled to the
top line of the honey with warm water. You can also put the jar
(well closed!) on the dashboard of your car or in a sunny window on
a warm day. Honey, says the beekeeper's wife, keeps forever.
</P>
<P>
   As to those bees paying their rent: The Marshalls contract with
growers and homeowners to let them set up hives on their properties
_ some on a permanent basis, many others just for the short time
that a particular group of plants is blooming. The property owner
typically gets about six pounds of honey for hosting a hive for a
year. Output varies, but most hives produce 900 to 1,000 pounds of
honey, of which the beekeepers harvest between 100 and 150 pounds
(the rest is left for the colony's own needs).
</P>
<P>
   At present, Marshall's maintains about 500 hives _ down from 650
at peak time. Aside from reaping their sweet rewards in honey,
there is an ecological advantage for people who play ``foster
parents'' to the bees. The bees pollinate their plants, resulting
in bigger crops _ the natural way.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Marshall's Farm honey is sold at many farmers markets, &LR; 
 &LR; including the Saturday Ferry Plaza market and the Sunday market &LR; 
 &LR; at Marin Civic Center; and at grocery stores including Whole &LR; 
 &LR; Foods markets in Marin, San Francisco and the East Bay, and &LR;   &LR; Wild
Oats in Marin and Berkeley. Prices range from $4 to $8 for &LR; 
 &LR; 8-ounce jars. Marshall's ships products by UPS and can be &LR; 
 &LR; reached by phone at (800) 624-4637 or at &LR;  www.marshallshoney.com.

 WORKING COOK: Citrus Puts Sunshine in Winter Meals  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; This time of year, there aren't a whole lot of
fruits in season. Fall persimmons are starting to turn brown in the
fruit crate, while summer melons are woody and almost flavorless.
<P>
   Luckily, we have citrus, and citrus' juicy zinginess plays a
large role in two recipes this week.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Meyer Lemon and Vodka Linguine, was created by Food
Section staffer Lesli Neilson one night when she needed a quick but
interesting dinner at home.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer lemons, fragrant and gently acidic, join hands with vodka
and capers to play off the cream in the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh pasta is available refrigerated in most supermarkets.
Compared to dried pasta, its light texture goes well with cream
sauces, and it takes half the time to cook. However, if you don't
have fresh pasta, dried will work just fine, too.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Dish _ Smoked Pork Stir-Fry With Kumquats and
Black Bean Sauce _ calls on several prepared ingredients for an
easy but complex meal.
</P>
<P>
   Many supermarkets now stock packaged shredded carrots and
cabbage. Boneless smoked pork chops, which come fully cooked, also
are unbelievably easy to use. Since both the pork and the black
bean sauce contain a lot of sodium, be sure to cut the chops
thinly. The delicate slices of tart-sweet kumquats also help offset
any saltiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Now &AMP; Later recipe, Lentil Vegetable Soup with Pancetta,
also gets smoky flavor from pork. Two separate cooking times allow
the vegetables to cook evenly and still let the lentils be infused
with flavor. Cubes of carrot and bell pepper create a mosaic of
color in an otherwise muddy brown soup.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; MEYER LEMON &AMP; VODKA LINGUINE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe was created by Food Section staffer Lesli Neilson.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 small handful rock salt
</P>
<P>
   1 small leek
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vodka
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Meyer lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cream
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh linguine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon caper juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs fresh dill, finely chopped for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the rock salt to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the leek in half lengthwise and rinse under cold running
water until all the sand is gone. Thinly slice the leek against the
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leek
and garlic and cook until lightly brown. Add the vodka and reduce
until almost dry. Add the Meyer lemon juice and cream. Cook over
low heat until the cream begins to thicken and bubble, 3 to 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, add the linguine to the boiling water. Bring the
water back to a boil, stirring the pasta occasionally to keep it
from sticking. Cook until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes for fresh
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Add the capers and caper juice to the sauce, stir to
incorporate. If the sauce has become very thick, thin it with a few
tablespoons of the pasta-cooking water. Season the sauce with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta and immediately pour it into the skillet of
sauce. Add the dill and stir carefully to coat the pasta with the
sauce.

</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken or vegetable stock or low-sodium broth
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup diced jarred roasted red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut 2 of the carrots, 4 of the celery stalks and 1 of the onions
in half. Place in a stock pot with the lentils, water, 1 bay leaf
and the rosemary sprigs. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
until the lentils are almost tender but still hard in the center,
about 20 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon salt and pepper to taste; simmer
until the lentils are tender but not mushy, about 5 to 10 minutes
longer. Drain, reserving the liquid. Let cool. Discard the
vegetable pieces and bay leaf.
</P>
<P>
   While the lentils cook, chop the remaining vegetables and
optional pancetta into small dice; finely chop the rosemary
needles.
</P>
<P>
   Fry the pancetta in a large heavy stock pot over medium-low heat
until some fat is rendered. There should be enough fat to sweat the
vegetables, but if there is not enough or you aren't using
pancetta, add olive oil. Add the chopped vegetables, rosemary and
red pepper flakes and sweat for about 15 minutes. The vegetables
should release their liquid but do not let them brown.
</P>
<P>
   Add the lentil-cooking liquid, the remaining bay leaf, the stock
and tomato puree to the vegetables. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
and simmer until the vegetables are tender but not mushy, 15 to 20
minutes.

   Add the diced peppers and the lentils to the soup and heat
through. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Brussels Sprouts Get a Makeover   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  One of the trendiest restaurants to open last year
was Gordon's House of Fine Eats in the emerging Multimedia Gulch
west of Potrero Hill. Because it's such a cutting-edge place in an
equally cutting-edge neighborhood, it seems ironic that one of the
most delicious dishes on the menu is a Brussels sprouts salad.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can hear the chorus of ``yucks'' beginning now. Brussels
sprouts are one of the most underappreciated _ and disliked _
vegetables in existence. But I guarantee that Gordon Drysdale's
treatment could single-handedly turn their reputation around.
</P>
<P>
   The salad is a combination of Brussels sprout leaves, crispy
bacon, caramelized onions and pieces of egg, all moistened with red
wine vinaigrette. The combination of smoky, sweet, acidic and
savory takes away that strong cabbage flavor that many people find
objectionable, and makes this salad sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   While the preparation isn't complicated, it takes time to deleaf
all the little heads _ up to 80 if you're going to serve eight _ so
you might want to turn it into a party and ask everyone to help.
</P>
<P>
   At Gordon's, dining is a party every night. The place has a
chic, modern industrial warehouse look, with live music nightly and
a wide range of dishes. The menu is divided into categories:
Healthful, which includes a vegetable burger; Comfort, including
matzo ball soup; Local Favorites like the salad of coastside-raised
Brussels sprouts; Luxury, with the likes of Coquille Saint-Jacques
in a cream sauce; and International _ pork ossobuco with brown
butter spaetzle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And for dessert, a fresh made doughnut plate, proving once again
that everything old is new again.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Gordon's, 500 Florida St. (at Mariposa), San Francisco; &LR;

GORDON'S WARM BRUSSELS SPROUT SALAD WITH BACON &AMP; EGGS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Dressing
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 small garlic cloves minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   The Salad
</P>
<P>
   80 Brussels sprouts (about 5 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1 large red onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups 1/4-inch cubes of artisan bread flavored with herbs,
crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound bacon, cut in 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the dressing:  &LR; Combine the shallots, garlic, thyme and
vinegar in a bowl. Set aside for at least 30 minutes. Whisk in the
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the sprouts:  &LR; Cut each Brussels sprout in half.
Place cut-side up on a work surface and make a V-shaped cut to
remove the core and any stem nubbin. The leaves will fall off and
separate. Rinse sprouts and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the onion, stem to root, into 1/4-inch thick slices. Melt
the butter in a skillet. Add the onion and saute over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until golden and sweet, about 10 minutes. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the eggs, still in their shells, in a small saucepan;
cover with cold tap water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and
let sit for 9 to 11 minutes. The yolks should be firm, but slightly
undercooked. Peel the eggs and cut each into 8 chunks. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the bread cubes with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and
place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until golden brown,
stirring occasionally. This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the bacon in a saute pan over moderate heat until golden
and crisp, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon
to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan
until nearly smoking. Add the Brussels sprout leaves and toss until
wilted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the
reserved onion and bacon. Cook, tossing, until hot. Add the
vinaigrette and toss to distribute evenly. Add the croutons and
eggs, toss gently to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately.

MAKING MUSIC WITHOUT THE INSTRUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, DJ turntables outsold guitars, and digital production
became de rigueur for garage bands and superstars alike. Musical
reshuffling and cheap digital tools are phenomena that intertwine
as they accelerate. At their logical extreme is a product like MTV
Music Generator.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, this kind of nonlinear editing package would
have set you back four figures. Now it's a $40 toy for the Sony
PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has done digital sound production will instantly
recognize Music Generator's layout: 24 vertically stacked sound
channels, volume controls for crescendos and fades, tempo controls
and reverb settings. A transpose button takes care of key changes.
</P>
<P>
   Into this grid, riffs are cut, copied, pasted and stacked like
Lego blocks. The Music Generator's sound library contains more than
a thousand riffs, subdivided into various flavors of electronica
(trance, drum and bass, house, beat), which sound great. Techno was
born digital; it likes to be chopped up.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Generator's guitar riffs sound terrible _ something
about rock 'n' roll suffers a horrible groaning death on the
dissection table.
</P>
<P>
   One level deeper into the software, you can edit the riffs
themselves, assembling bass lines, percussion, melody, vocals and
sound effects from 2,000 instrument samples. If it were not well
organized, the library would be overwhelming (there are 39 flavors
of high-hat drum alone).
</P>
<P>
   But the samples are all onomatopoeic (``electric wah,''
``softsynth,'' ``vinyl crackle,'' ``wave crash'' and ``high ooh''
all sound like their titles), and navigation is highly intuitive.
You could burn half a day just building riffs.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find what you want in the sound library, you can
record samples from audio CDs or create your own samples with an
on-screen keyboard, either by pasting notes onto the track or by
recording them as a real-time performance, using your own rhythm to
tap them in (Parappa the Rapper, eat your heart out).
</P>
<P>
   Once the sample is loaded, it's subject to another level of
tweaking in the sample editor, which allows you to snip or loop the
sample, add vibrato or pan between speakers. At that point, you are
working with a waveform diagram of the sound. You're adding delay
and feedback. You're cutting out unwanted frequencies. You're
applying phase effects. All the filter settings are adjustable, in
case you care to buff the sine waves.
</P>
<P>
   But after all that microscopic effort, it's gratifying to
surface _ a couple of taps of the triangle button call the whole
Legoland-style sound castle into view, all 24 channels, 50 bars at
a time, as the playback marker sweeps from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about digital recording is that it allows
people with no musical literacy to read a sound structure _ a
score, minus the pitch notation. It also decouples instrumental
skill from compositional skill.
</P>
<P>
   Musical instruction used to be a requirement for budding
composers. Now plenty of outstanding techno, hip-hop and house
music is created by people who couldn't play guitars to save their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   They could probably play video games, however. And video games
are oddly akin to music. Both require manual dexterity and
practice. The adult complaint of ``I can't work the controller'' is
directly analogous to ``I can't work the piano.'' If you haven't
practiced, you're probably going to be limited to ``Chopsticks''
and ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.'' You're not going to be able
to play Lizst. You're not going to be able to play Tekken 3.
</P>
<P>
   Both music and video games contain chords. On a piano, there are
thirds and fifths. On a game pad, there are three-button
combination moves. Each has a set of rhythms and patterns, a
grammar, and leaves room for stylistic variation. At the end of the
day, the video game console is a kind of instrument. It's an
instrument of motion in a virtual environment.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the game controller is a surprisingly good
physical interface for programs like the Music Generator. Looking
at the layout, I initially thought that the software would be
better suited to a keyboard and mouse (Sony does sell a mouse for
the PlayStation).
</P>
<P>
   But after five minutes, this veteran gamer could edit and
assemble sound samples with shocking speed because all of the
software's editing routines have been mapped onto the button
combinations I've been using in martial arts and 3-D platform
games. It's like playing a well-practiced piano tune _ the finger
movements are almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, two serious drawbacks to this software. One
is the memory limitation. A PlayStation memory card was not
designed to store audio samples, so it tops out quickly, which
limits the number of sounds you can use.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is that there's no way to transmit your work,
which precludes any kind of creative exchange or communication
across a network.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, you could record your music using the
PlayStation's audio-out jacks and convert it into an MP3 file, but
that information can't be rejiggered once it's recorded.
Alternately, you could upload memory card data using a peripheral
like Interact's Dexdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these problems will go away when the Music Generator is
released on CD-ROM later this year, paving the way for thousands of
armchair DJs to swap audio tracks and sound samples. Real-time
digital jam sessions have always been plagued by network lag, but
they're listed on the set of forthcoming features.
</P>
<P>
   For college students with high-bandwidth connections, it just
might work. In the meantime, 14-year-old sound designers can spend
hours cutting together audio tracks on their PlayStations.
</P>
<P>
   Garage bands are so, like, 20th century.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When William Wordsworth wandered lonely as a cloud
amid all those daffodils, he addressed the poignant dilemma of the
individual trying to find a unique place among the masses. One can
only wonder how the poet would feel at a new-media company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Screaming Media, created in 1996 to provide customized
information gathered from hundreds of digital sources to
subscribers, mostly special-interest and corporate Web sites. It is
in the fashionably raw Starrett-Lehigh Building at 601 W. 26th St.
</P>
<P>
   Most Screamers, as the employees are known, spend their days
trolling the Internet for content or signing on new clients. They
sit in a vast open room, designed by Hut Sachs Studio, in which
views of the Hudson River are upstaged by numerous hulking shapes,
each a different color, pale yellow to deep-sea blue, and tattooed
with Futurist exhortations ``curated'' by the graphic designer
Milton Glaser. These are the conference rooms and ``phone booths,''
giving employees visual relief from their monitors _ and their only
chance to congregate in semiprivacy.
</P>
<P>
   In this landscape of anonymous desks and striking sculptural
forms, Andrew Meranus, 28, a team manager, says it's inspiring to
share a table with five other people; at a glance he can take in 60
more co-workers and supervisors. ``It keeps you energized, looking
at all these people with one mission,'' he said. ``No one's hiding
behind a closed door or cubicle.'' For privacy, there's his cell
phone, and the street.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, a company integrating a 24-hour cable channel with a Web
site network, all geared to women, is lodged within the top floors
of the old Nabisco factory (Chelsea Market is downstairs) and
houses an even greater range of activities _ from filming live
interviews with the likes of Meryl Streep to writing adventures for
Oxygen's Web site superheroine, Break-Up Girl. The key to the plan
is ... a tire rack.
</P>
<P>
   Fernau &AMP; Hartman architects, of Berkeley, Calif., have used
metal-frame shelves commonly found in car repair shops to provide
storage and to arrange flexible work stations. In-line-skate wheels
attached to tracks on the shelves allow desks to slide together as
needed to become conference tables.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Huang, 30, a producer, sits at a rust-colored desk attached
to the tire rack, dubbed ``the zipper.'' When she looks up, she is
sometimes blinded by the lights of television cameras at the center
of the open space, when, for instance, ``Pure Oxygen,'' a show that
begins on Feb. 2, is being taped. From a balcony, a D.J./announcer
spins music during the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to it after a while,'' Ms. Huang said. ``I did,
by putting on earphones.'' In fact, Ms. Huang said she was learning
a lot just by watching from her desk. When she needs to
concentrate, she comes in early or stays late, sometimes till 3
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming Media and Oxygen use architecture to hammer home the
message that this generation of new-media worker bees is not about
to do business as usual. And while there isn't much new about
office spaces that try to liberate their workers from cubicles,
these companies have an even more expansive vision of the workplace
as playground where recess is taken very seriously. Free of corner
office suites, hierarchical office planning, even walls, these new
domains celebrate community over privacy, collaboration over
solitary invention.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies wanted design on a budget. Oxygen spent
approximately $60 a square foot; Screaming Media, an extremely
modest $45.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling around Oxygen's hangar-size office on Ninth Avenue and
15th Street, Kit Laybourne, the director of animation and the
husband of Oxygen's co-founder Geraldine Laybourne, called the
space, which he helped conceive, part learning institution, part
nourishing community, but basically ``a digital sweatshop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a cool office that was fun to work in so that we'd
attract digital kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fernau, its architect in association with the Phillips
Group of New York, called his approach to the design an
improvisation act. His job: ``accommodating chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   His overt attempts to transform O2 into a visible motif, with
fish tanks bubbling away in conference rooms and scrims rippling in
jet streams, get lost in the hubbub. Yet, some neologisms have
taken hold. Employees at Oxygen do speak of working ``on'' or
``off'' the zipper (yet on a recent visit, no desks appeared to
have been moved together).
</P>
<P>
   At Screaming Media, the looming structures that float throughout
the space are known as pods, while blue curving tables for
temporary workers are called ponds. (``Very Bilbao,'' said Martha
Stewart, who is creating a completely open floor of offices for her
company in the same building.)
</P>
<P>
   Jane Sachs, Screaming Media's architect, said she was inspired
in these sculptural gestures by Richard Serra and Frank Gehry _ but
primarily by her 20 years as a potter. She added: ``To leave it
open would have been deadly. With a sea of desks, it would have
looked like the drones in `Metropolis.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another influence on the design was Jay Chiat, the chairman of
Screaming Media, and most recently of Chiat/Day, the advertising
agency, where he gave staff members laptops and told them to work
wherever they liked. At Screaming Media, Chiat has a desk in the
middle of the space. ``Everyone knows who's important here,'' he
said. ``They don't need offices to establish that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Oxygen, his counterpart, Ms. Laybourne, does have an office,
with walls of wavy translucent garden-shed plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geri has evolved,'' Fernau said. ``She was out in the open in
her last office, but kept retreating to the conference room. So we
gave her an office.''

 The High Cost of Dining Out: Tabs keep growing while
restaurants  keep opening  
 By Michael Bauer  
 and Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  At San Francisco's La Folie, menu prices are on
the rise. In 1995, the most expensive item was a beef tenderloin
with marrow flan in Merlot sauce for $26.50. Today, chef/owner
Roland Passot has added a slice of foie gras to the top and charges
$45.
<P>
   La Folie isn't unique. Prices at high-end and less-formal places
throughout the entire Bay Area have been on a steady rise the last
few years, and continue to escalate at an increasingly rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   EOS, a charming but modestly decorated restaurant in Cole
Valley, has gone from a neighorhood gathering place to a
destination restaurant on the national level because of chef/owner
Arnold Wong's creative fusion cuisine. When he opened the
restaurant in 1996, main courses started at $8.95 and topped out at
$14.95. But within the first year, prices almost doubled. Main
courses now range from $18 to $28.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Bay Area, diners are feeling the squeeze. Donia
Bijan opened L'Amie Donia in Palo Alto in 1994 as a rustic
neighborhood place with prices in the $15 range. Now, similar main
courses cost $25 and above.
</P>
<P>
   This huge bump in prices shoots the Bay Area into the dining
stratosphere, a spot formerly occupied only by New York City. The
reasons, experts say, have little to do with the food. Food costs
have remained fairly static, as has inflation. But rents, labor
costs and simply what is expected by the dining public have
contributed to the surge.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by the Zagat Survey, which rates
about 800 restaurants nationwide, last year the Bay Area became the
second city in the nation after New York City to top the $30 mark
for an ``average meal.'' In 1997 it was just over $26.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, personal income has been rising, largely
fueled by the high-tech industry. Restaurateurs all around the Bay
Area say that business has never been better. Despite the increased
cost of eating out, the better known restaurants are so busy that
reservations often have to be made weeks in advance. And despite
what restaurateurs say is the high cost of doing business, new
restaurants continue to open at a dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on? Are rising prices reflecting the true cost
of eating out, or are restaurants simply lining their larders?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little bit of both, experts say. Owners are dealing with
higher labor costs and soaring rents, but also want to make a
little more money. Allan Ripp of the Zagat Survey notes that in the
early '90s when the economy was depressed, customer spending in
restaurants declined. During that time, value was the key
ingredient to making a restaurant work. Prices were kept low, often
artificially so, which sliced into already miniscule profit margins
run around five percent. Now that the economy is booming, he
speculates that owners see the opportunity to make up for those
leaner years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of new restaurants coming in with a little more
confidence (that they'll succeed), so the prices really are
rising,'' Ripp says.
</P>
<P>
   La Folie, which opened in 1989 as a modest French restaurant,
has been a bellwether of this climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to make money,'' says Passot. ``If we weren't, then
we'd be working for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to several reasons for the increases. He's redecorated
his restaurant three times. He's replaced utilitarian plates and
glasses with fine china, silver and crystal, and he's boosted his
kitchen staff from four to 12 people to prepare more elaborate
dishes. Despite the increased staff, Passot is still in the kitchen
nearly every night.
</P>
<P>
   When he first opened, Passot says, ``Jaimie (his wife) used to
cry every night saying, `We're not going to make it, we're not
going to make it.' '' Now, he says, they can take an occasional
vacation and are reinvesting in the restaurant _ spending $50,000
to add a private dining room, which is more than they spent on
opening the restaurant. And, he claims, they won't need to raise
prices to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years Passot has also opened Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park, both of which are more moderately priced
than La Folie _ allowing him to turn La Folie into a fine dining
destination. The stylish brasseries each seat more than 200 diners
(La Folie seats 80) and the prices are in the $10-$19 range. Each
Left Bank serves about 3,000 meals a week; La Folie serves about
500. A higher volume means that the price per dish can be kept
down. Plus, the style of restaurant means ingredients will
generally be less costly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't the food on the plate that's driving up prices _
it's everything surrounding the food. ``If you look at commodity
prices over the last two or three or even four years, it's a
minimal increase,'' says Andy Powning of Greenleaf produce of San
Francisco, a quality produce supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Food costs generally hover at around 30 percent of a
restaurant's expenses, experts say. The more expensive restaurants
that use caviar and the like may be a few percentage points higher,
and the neighborhood pasta house may be a few points lower.
</P>
<P>
   What you're paying for at La Folie and other high-priced places
is that perfect rose on the table, the zebra wood paneling on the
walls or the high-maintenance bamboo on the floors.
</P>
<P>
   And diners seem to be demanding these refinements. Wendy
Brucker, one of the Bay Area's top cooks who owns the
moderately-priced Rivoli in Berkeley with her husband Roscoe
Skipper, says that eating out used to be ``more about food than
anything else, but now decor is a big part of the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   She laments this transformation of restaurants into big
business. A passion for cooking was the dominant attitude when such
ground-breaking restaurants such as Chez Panisse and Zuni Cafe
opened more than two decades ago, she says. Now it's as much about
decor and entertainment for the diners, and making money for the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   She traces the change to the opening of Postrio about 10 years
ago. Wolfgang Puck showed that restaurateurs could serve cutting
edge food in big, beautiful surroundings and charge a lot for it,
the high volume ensuring a profitable business venture.
</P>
<P>
   The realization that surroundings and ambience played an
important part is what led her to redecorate a few years ago.
``That made our cost of doing business rise, and it's much more
than just rebuilding _ the upkeep is more.'' Even at that, she's
held the line with only a minimal increase in prices. Entrees
prices at Rivoli ranged from $9.75 and $14.95 in 1994; now most of
the main courses are around $16.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest factor in rising prices is labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret that there's a labor shortage and that will
make the price of labor go up,'' says Niki Leonakis, vice president
of restaurants for Kimpton Group, which owns Scala's, Grand Cafe,
Fifth Floor and Masa's, among other restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs say they are losing out to dot-com companies that
pay significantly more than the $7 to $8 an hour many restaurants
pay their kitchen crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't willing to work for what's paid in the
kitchen,'' says Arnold Wong, chef/owner of EOS, who's had a high
turnover of staff in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Bijan of L'Amie Donia says she's been lucky with a staff that
stays two to three years. ``But they're well compensated,'' she
says. ``I pay my dishwasher $11 an hour and it goes up from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a new California labor law that went into effect on
January 1 will have an even greater impact, according to Donna
Scala of Bistro Don Giovanni in Napa. Before the law was passed, to
make ends meet, many kitchen crews would sometimes pull double
shifts, getting paid time and a half for working over eight hours.
With the new law in place, restaurants must now pay double-time
after 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of real estate can also directly impact the rise
in menu prices. Restaurants today are paying significantly more
than places that opened even a year ago. In some cases landlords
base a portion of rent on the percentage of gross revenue. Because
of this, many restaurants must pay more rent when they do well and
that extra expense is often passed along to the diner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a hefty crop of moderately priced restaurants continue to
open. How are they able to be profitable despite these rising
costs?
</P>
<P>
   According to Craig Stoll of Delfina, one of the most lauded
restaurants to open last year, part of his success in pricing comes
from low food costs, but another part comes from the decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like a stripped-down restaurant,'' he explains.
The 35-seat California/Italian restaurant in the Mission District
opened with entree prices under $15, and food that's better than 99
percent of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not about luxury ingredients,'' says Stoll. ``We
emphasize plain-Jane, but good food. We use secondary cuts of meat
and wait for produce to be at the height of season so it's at its
lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken out all of the things that make it more
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The china, silverware and glasses used at Delfina are very
inexpensive _ plates, for example, are $4.93 _ whereas the plates
at stylish Fifth Floor are around $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gulisano, who owns Chow and Park Chow, two very successful
inexpensive restaurants in San Francisco, has been successful with
a similar approach, using light fixtures from Home Depot, for
example, rather than paying a designer to create them.
</P>
<P>
   At both restaurants you can get old-fashioned spaghetti and meat
balls for $6.95 and a half roast chicken for $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radical difference in our approach is that we completely
wiped off everything that we don't consider to add value to the
customer experience,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, that means expensive decor, fancy flatware and
other splashy extras. Because with restaurants now entertainment
venues as much as eating establishments, diners pay for the plate
and what surrounds it as much as they do for the food.

with the Napa label that do not have ``Napa character.'' What can
consumers do about this false marketing?

 CALIFORNIA WORKERS LAGGING IN HEALTH COVERAGE  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California companies are less likely to offer health insurance
to their employees than companies in other states, but those that
do offer it provide richer benefits than employers elsewhere,
according to a study being released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 48 percent of California firms offered their workers health
insurance in 1999, compared with 61 percent of firms nationwide,
the report from the Kaiser Family Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the state's low rate of employer-provided
coverage is one reason 7 million Californians, or 22 percent of the
population, remain uninsured. ``That is in part why California
ranks fifth among states in terms of the percentage of population
that is uninsured,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is that Californians are not offered health
insurance as frequently as their counterparts across the country,''
said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Foundation, a nonprofit
research group in Menlo Park that is independent of the Oakland
health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that when they are offered (health
insurance), it costs them much less,'' Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said it is unclear why California lags in
employer-sponsored health insurance. Conventional wisdom suggests
that the state's workforce is concentrated in smaller firms and in
industries less likely to make insurance available.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, California firms are only slightly smaller on average
than national companies and are not skewed toward industries with
low rates of health insurance,'' the report stated, adding,
``California firms of all sizes and industry categories offer
health insurance at lower rates than firms nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hyde, president of Lifeguard Inc., a nonprofit health plan
in San Jose, said the findings were particularly perplexing given
that employers in California generally pay lower premiums than
employers in other states.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of insurance were the key, he said, California
should have a higher percentage of people who are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he suspects that the findings may be skewed by
Southern California, which has a much higher percentage of
immigrant workers who haven't yet won insurance coverage as a
routine benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in the Bay Area may be different (from) what's
going on in East L.A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When California firms do provide health insurance, they are more
likely to cover part-time and temporary workers and domestic
partners of employees. Also, California employees pay a smaller
portion of premiums and have a greater choice of plans than workers
in other states, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, firms with fewer than 10 workers were least
likely to offer health insurance; only 55 percent of such companies
nationwide and 41 percent of California employers provided this
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Among firms with 10 to 50 employees, 62 percent of California
companies offered insurance, compared with 75 percent nationwide.
California even lagged among the largest firms, those with more
than 1,000 employees; 94 percent of California companies offered
health benefits, whereas 99 percent of companies nationwide did so.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 81 percent of employees who are covered have a
choice of two or more plans, compared with 65 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Single California workers with health benefits paid an average
of only $21 per month for coverage, or 11 percent of the actual
insurance cost; the national average was $35 per month, or 16
percent of the premium.
</P>
<P>
   For family coverage, the average Californian paid $117, or 24
percent of the premium cost, compared with a national average of
$145, or 32 percent of the insurance cost.
</P>
<P>
   California employers also defined family more broadly; 31
percent of employer-paid plans in California covered unmarried or
same-sex partners, compared with 18 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in California were also more likely to offer health
benefits to part-time workers (55 percent in California versus 41
percent nationally) and temporary workers (6 percent here, 3
percent across the nation).
</P>
<P>
   The findings are based on interviews with benefits managers at
743 private-sector California firms chosen at random. Their
responses were compared with data from an earlier national
employers' survey done by Kaiser. The Health Research and
Educational Trust and the Center for Health and Public Policy
Studies at the University of California at Berkeley helped prepare
the latest report.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that in California, as in the nation, employers
experienced an average 4.8 percent increase in insurance premiums
to 1999. Small businesses got steeper increases (6.1 percent in
California versus 7.6 percent nationally).
</P>
<P>
   The survey found one other difference between California and the
nation as a whole. HMOs are the most common insurance plan in
California, whereas preferred provider organizations PPOs  &LR; were the
most popular plan nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs require insured patients to visit physicians and
specialists who are part of the HMO. PPO plans also try to steer
patients toward selected physicians, but patients can see
physicians outside the PPO, if they are willing to pay extra or the
doctor is willing to accept PPO rates.

 IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE, BIG DEBATES ARE IN THE DETAILS  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush says Arizona Sen. John
McCain's plan to reform campaign finances would destroy the
Republican Party. McCain says Bush's proposal for Social Security
is ``all hat and no cattle.'' Vice President Al Gore accuses former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley of ignoring education, while Bradley
says Gore's health care plan ``just nibbles around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric from the campaign trail makes it sound like the
forthcoming primary season will be a pitched battle for the heart
and soul of each party. But the brash campaign talk masks a simple
truth: Within each party, there is a remarkable consensus on
political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are both pro-choice, pro-trade, pro-gun-control
mainstream Democrats who favor an enlarged federal role in
improving health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are both anti-abortion, pro-trade,
anti-gun-control conservatives who favor significant tax cuts and a
stronger national defense. Other Republican candidates who have
staked out radically different positions _ on matters such as
isolating China, abolishing the federal income tax and banning gays
from government _ have failed to register much support.
</P>
<P>
   The real disputes, among each party's front-runners, are in
subtle but important details.
</P>
<P>
   Is it more conservative to reduce taxes by $483 billion over
five years (Bush), or to devote half that amount to tax cuts and
the other half to debt reduction (McCain)? Is it wiser to expand
Medicaid to include more children (Gore), or to replace Medicaid
with a more generous federal subsidy for everyone (Bradley)?
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not about sharp ideological clashes,'' said
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a
centrist Democrat think tank. Instead, Marshall and other observers
suggest, the policy disputes may speak more toward &LR;  what sort of
president each candidate would be rather than what specific
policies they would sign into law.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, says his proposals show he is not beholden
to special interests. Bradley says his plans are ``bigger'' and
``bolder'' than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some clear policy differences, but the policy
differences illustrate different styles of leadership,'' Bradley
said in an interview last month. ``It comes down to whether you are
going to take on something that is bolder or whether you are going
to do something more marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for voters is to sort out the differences in the
midst of a campaign that often gets distracted by relatively
insignificant matters.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally televised debates of the past few weeks have
concentrated on topics such as why Bradley voted against flood
relief for Midwest farmers in 1993, why Gore voted against a
tobacco tax in 1985, and whether Bush and McCain can be trusted to
oppose legal abortions even though neither will use it as a litmus
test for selecting a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls reveal that issues have not polarized voters. Even
on issues where candidates have detailed clear-cut policy
differences, many voters may believe that the distinctions will be
blunted by the time any proposal works its way through Congress and
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, the campaign has been consumed with a
debate over health care policy, which has been the subject of hours
of debate, dozens of position papers, and reams of talking points
faxed to journalists covering the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed a plan that would do away with Medicaid and
provide tax subsidies to buy private insurance. Bradley estimates
his plan would cost about $65 billion a year and provide insurance
to 95 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would expand Medicaid and Medicare, provide small tax
breaks for the purchase of private insurance and guarantee coverage
for children. Gore says his plan would cost about $25 billion a
year and provide insurance to up to 90 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Though tens of billions of dollars separate the plans, most
voters would be hard-pressed to explain the difference or figure
out how each plan would affect their own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the candidates have used their positions as a
springboard to explain why they would be a better president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back into the framework of what kind of leader do
you want in the Oval Office?'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
``Do you want someone like Al Gore, who is a fighter, someone who
rolls up his sleeves, or someone like Bradley, who approaches it as
if it's an academic exercise?''
</P>
<P>
   Voters can be forgiven if they get the two confused. An analysis
by Congressional Quarterly of the 103 most important votes during
the eight years that Bradley and Gore served together in the Senate
found that they voted together 72 percent of the time. The greatest
difference came on defense matters, where Gore tended to be more of
a hawk, voting in favor of spending on items such as the B-2 bomber
and against cuts in U.S. troop levels.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush and McCain have used strong words
to contrast their competing plans for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has advanced a plan that would cut taxes $483 billion over
the next five years, nearly $2,000 for every man, woman and child.
The biggest cuts would be enjoyed by the rich and the poor. McCain
would cut taxes by about half as much, $237 billion over five
years. His tax cuts are focused on the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns have characterized the race as a battle over who
is more conservative. Bush represents the supply-side camp, which
believes tax cuts spur economic growth. McCain says he is the true
conservative for committing more dollars to paying off the federal
debt.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that the distinction constitutes a
voting matter. But whether the candidates come across as credible
may make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these disputes are what is animating the
public,'' said Marshall Whitman, a fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank. ``If 1992 was, `the economy,
stupid,' '' Whitman said, echoing Clinton campaign manager James
Carville's line, ``then 2000 is, `It's integrity, stupid.' ''

 LADY LUCK JILTS RENO'S HISTORIC MAPES HOTEL  &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ It looks like luck is running out for the famous
old Mapes Hotel and Casino, a national historic landmark that the
city of Reno views as a civic eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   Unless preservationists win a last-ditch reprieve in federal
court on Friday, the Mapes will be blown up at 8 a.m. January 30,
Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mapes is demolished, it would be the first time a
building listed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's
most endangered landmarks list has ever been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that happens, the building will be reduced to Art Deco
rubble in only 7.5 seconds. Already, holes have been punched in the
side of the Mapes to ready it for a process called implosion, which
uses 250 pounds of dynamite to cause the building to fall in on
itself. The contractor plans to sell souvenirs _ $1 a brick.
</P>
<P>
   The impending end of the Mapes has dominated the news in
northern Nevada for months _ the papers have been full of it, it's
on television and radio talk shows, and there is enough chatter on
the Internet to fill the chat rooms of a small hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mapes is not a small hotel _ it is 12 stories of ruined
grandeur right where Reno's main street meets the Truckee River, in
the neon heart of the biggest little city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's where high rollers and celebrities came to stay and gamble
and watch floor shows. It was the first combination hotel, casino
and entertainment center in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe stayed there
and when a kid named Sammy Davis Jr. made his nightclub debut in
the World Famous Sky Room, the Mapes  &UR; was  &LR; Reno. It is on the
National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy to lose this,'' said Richard Moe, president of
the national trust. ``It is a beautiful building and part of the
heritage of Reno. It would be like San Francisco tearing down the
Mark Hopkins or the Palace hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of Reno's history. I'll be sad to see it go,''
said Jeff Griffin, Reno's mayor, who paints himself as a realist
with a heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business decision. I wish we could save it too, but we
can't. It's been vacant for 18 years. This is about money. ... it's
not personal. The City Council made a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The city bought the Mapes after other plans to reuse the
building fell through, and then tried to find what Griffin calls
``a white knight'' to rescue the hotel. The attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the City Council looked at six proposals to the
rehabilitate the Mapes, rejected them all by a 5-to-2 vote, then
voted unanimously to demolish the place.
</P>
<P>
   The people who want to save the Mapes, Griffin said, ``should
get over it and get on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not likely to happen. The preservationists say the city
rejected perfectly viable options, including a proposal by
Nationwide Capital Services, an Oakland company that wanted to turn
the Mapes into an assisted living center for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The company's $23 million offer is still open, said Karl
Diaz-Hoffman, president of Nationwide Capital Services. His firm,
he said, has ``a good track record'' and was involved in
rehabilitating the old Sainte Claire Hotel in San Jose, and putting
together the deal that transformed the old Cogswell College on San
Francisco's Nob Hill into the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Hoffman says the city of Reno had ``a hidden agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are happy to bring senior citizens to (downtown) Reno to
lose their money, but they don't want them to live there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question their good faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Griffin vehemently denies that the city has a secret plan
for the Mapes site or that it has any sort of secret agenda. It is
all aboveboard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mapes was a symbol of what Reno used to be, it is also a
symbol of what Reno is now.
</P>
<P>
   Reno began as a stop on the California trail used by the
Forty-Niners, and then it was a railroad town, a cow town, and a
place known for somewhat relaxed standards of conduct. Prizefights
were held in Reno when they were illegal everywhere else, and there
was also prostitution (now illegal) and gambling (now legal).
</P>
<P>
   Grafted to the honky-tonk downtown was a pastoral small city and
a modest university. Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Nevada's most famous
author, called Reno ``The City of Trembling Leaves,'' after the
aspens that graced its quiet neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Reno boomed after World War II. Back in those days, divorces
were not handed out as easily as they are now. There had to be
grounds _ serious ones _ before a couple could legally split in
most states. But Nevada was more relaxed about these matters, and
it took only six weeks to establish legal residence.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands and thousands of disappointed lovers flocked to
Nevada, stayed at dude ranches or the Riverside Hotel or the Mapes
in Reno, got a divorce at the Washoe County Courthouse, walked out
on the Virginia Street Bridge, and threw their wedding rings into
the Truckee River.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the newly minted gay divorcees, as they were known,
would head to the brand new Mapes casino for a drink, or to gamble,
or to dance the night away at the Sky Room.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Mapes, the widow of Charles W. Mapes, was the force
behind the Mapes Hotel. Her idea was brilliant: a combination
hotel, casino and posh nightclub with big-name entertainment. No
place else in Nevada had such a thing, especially not Las Vegas,
where the casinos looked more like motels and shady characters ran
the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mapes family had lived in Reno since 1880, and Gladys Mapes
was so prominent in town that she was called ``Mrs. Reno.'' The
hotel opened two weeks before Christmas 1947.
</P>
<P>
   It was both new and old: Mapes frugally had used some old plans
to design the new hotel, which was why the Mapes looked like a
classic the day it opened. It was the last hotel in the country
built to the 1930s Art Deco style.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., who admires the Mapes, recently
called it ``an architectural treasure'' and ``one of Reno's most
notable and distinguished landmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mapes had a short career. Gladys Mapes died in 1974, and
the property went to her son, Charles Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mapes clan, Las Vegas was already
replacing Reno as the gamblers' mecca. And, to make matters worse,
Charlie Mapes soon made unwise investments that drained the hotel's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   He mortgaged the Mapes to bankroll another casino. The casino
flopped, the bank foreclosed in 1980, took over the Mapes and
kicked Charlie Mapes out of his own hotel. He was 86ed, forbidden
to even set foot in the place.
</P>
<P>
   The bank brought in a trustee to run the Mapes, but the new
operation failed. The Mapes closed forever two weeks before
Christmas 1982, exactly 35 years after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   There was bitterness and shock in Reno. ``There are a lot of
great memories about the Mapes,'' said Mayor Griffin. ``A lot of
people remember their prom night up there. And a lot of them lost
their virginity up there. Or a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The years went on; Las Vegas became world famous, and Reno began
to have trouble. Gambling was not a monopoly any more: California
started a lottery, Indian gaming began to flourish. Even towns like
San Pablo opened casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In Reno, they tried everything from seriously considering
covering the downtown with a giant dome, to vintage car shows, air
shows, rodeos, hot August nights and cool fall evenings, to opening
the national bowling center in a building that looks like a bowling
ball.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno struggled with a new image, the Mapes stood by the
river, dark and empty, the World-Famous Sky Room the nest of
pigeons, a reminder of better days, a symbol of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the city simply gave up and folded its hand, landmark
or not. Griffin and the City Council want to reposition Reno as a
four-seasons destination city for conventions and business. They
talk about golf courses and winter sports and other attractions.
``It's too bad the Mapes didn't fit into it,'' said Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The preservationists are still fighting to save the Mapes _ they
have polls showing public support, and they went to court several
times over the Mapes issue, alleging violations by the City Council
of Nevada's open-meeting laws and other irregularities. They lost
twice, then took their case to the Nevada Supreme Court and lost
again.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are in federal court in Reno, alleging that the
demolition will pollute both the air and the Truckee River. A
hearing is set for Friday at the federal courthouse. But the odds
for saving the Mapes are long.
</P>
<P>
   In the meanwhile, people show up every day near the Mapes,
taking a last look, watching an old friend die. ``I'm fascinated
with the building and its history,'' said Brian Medley, who is 25,
too young to have firsthand experience with the Mapes in its glory
years. ``To see it destroyed is just ... just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wouldn't happen anywhere else,'' said Tim Nelson, a
visitor from Petaluma. ``If this were anywhere else, they would
kill to have this building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Petaluma, they tore down the old city hall in 1955, I think
it was, and the very people who voted to tear it down now regret
it,'' said Nelson. ``That's what will happen here, too. They will
be very sorry they did this.''

 NO WONDER WE YELL AT THE SCREEN  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I was yelling at my TV, as I assume everyone
yells at the TV, but it occurred to me that maybe I'm getting a
little too cranky, as in: Frazzled codger standing on street
corner, shaking cane at world.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly I holler at quiz shows and news programs, but maybe I
need to change up. So today I'm going to yell at a movie that I
haven't even seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane,'' the true story of boxer Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, isn't. A New York Times writer noted that there is a wide
chasm between the true story and the movie. Entire major characters
and story elements were invented.
</P>
<P>
   I know: Stop the presses! Hollywood fudges on facts!
</P>
<P>
   It could've been a lot worse. I've seen a tiny bit of the
movie-making biz first-hand and I bet someone on the ``Hurricane''
production team wanted to change the hero from a black prizefighter
to an Eskimo figure-skater who is framed by the sheriff in ``Smokey
and the Bandit.''
</P>
<P>
   I hear it's a great movie, a tear-jerker and soul-stirrer. But
as a true story, it's a scam, a sham, a fib and a flim-flam film.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to mess with the facts, don't present it as the
truth. Call it ``The Typhoon'' and have Rupert ``Typhoon'' Cartier
not only get out of prison but also save the world from the evil
Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   I'll still see ``The Hurricane'' because I'm a big Denzel fan
and a sap for boxing/prison movies. So if you're in the theater and
someone is hollering at the screen, cut me some slack.
</P>

 SF CHRON  
 Nasdaq Suddenly Vulnerable  
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Investors in Nasdaq stocks have endured several bad scares so far
this year. Accustomed to seeing these stocks shoot steadily higher,
they have been shocked to suddenly find that they don't always do
so.
<P>
   The seemingly invincible, tech-laden Nasdaq composite index,
which trounced the other market indexes with a phenomenal 86
percent gain last year, has suddenly begun behaving like an
also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 trading days of the year, through Friday, the
Nasdaq composite tumbled five times _ including gut-wrenching,
single-day free-falls of 3.2 percent, 3.9 percent and 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq also has had several strong up days this year,
however, and the net result is that it is only slightly in the red
_ down 0.1 percent from the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It trails the Dow Jones industrial average, which is up 2
percent, but it has a slight lead over the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index, which is down 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stocks are normally quite volatile, but the volatility
has been accentuated this month.
</P>
<P>
   Experts blame this on investor confusion about the implications
of the America Online-Time Warner merger deal, the widespread
chitchat about possible Federal Reserve interest-rate boosts and
uncertainty about year-end earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Nasdaq's shakiness signal the end of the tech-stock
boom _ or even the beginnings of a major correction? Have
tech-stock valuations become so preposterously bloated that even
some of the wildest speculators are turning chicken?
</P>
<P>
   One expert who thinks so is San Francisco money manager Stewart
J. Pillette of Pillette Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that the largest-capitalization companies in the
Nasdaq composite index _ those that make up the subindex called the
Nasdaq 100 _ could fall by an average of 40 percent during the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Pillette feels that Internet-related stocks, a major contingent
in the Nasdaq 100, will lead the way down. He says their prices
have been bid up to ``ludicrous'' levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, these companies will have to prove that they can
earn money,'' Pillette observes. ``That's going to be hard for a
lot of them. The problem with the Internet stocks is that they have
been priced for perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Internet stocks haven't been the least bit daunted
by the lack of earnings up to now. But Pillette says they will
become less tolerant if the Federal Reserve _ as widely expected _
continues to boost interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The more that interest rates rise, Pillette explains, the less
important future earnings become, because they have to be
discounted more heavily. And future earnings are the only kind that
most Internet companies can boast just now.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, however, regard the Nasdaq's tepid performance
this year as a harmless consolidation. They say there has been a
confluence of wet-blanket events that have stalled the mighty
juggernaut _ but only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Many tax-conscious investors, for example, reportedly waited
until the turn of the year to sell shares in which they held huge
profits so they wouldn't be taxed on the capital gains until April
2001. This artificially buoyed stocks during December and have
artificially depressed them so far in during  &LR; January.
</P>
<P>
   Tech-stock prices also were pumped up during December by
attempts by mutual fund managers to window-dress their portfolios.
They bought a lot of the stocks that performed well during 1999 so
they could display them in their year-end reports to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be very short term,'' says Marshall Acuff, a
market strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``There is
a certain amount of gamesmanship involved in managing money short
term, and that played out in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some investors undoubtedly have bailed out because
tech-stock prices seem to have gotten ahead of themselves or
because of interest-rate jitters. Higher interest rates make bonds
relatively more attractive and also put a crimp in corporate
earnings by increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DelMonte, a Danville retirement planner, points out that
the Nasdaq rose by more than 20 percent during December alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely rational and reasonable to expect a
correction after that,'' he observes. ``The markets get
irrationally exuberant and then irrationally pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, you would be foolish to bet against high technology
in the long run, most experts believe. feel. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Looking out through this year and the following year,''
Acuff says, ``I think the market eventually will come back to
communications and technology, because the economic climate is
disinflationary. That kind of climate is good for companies that
are very successful in growing unit sales, because you can't raise
prices. Unit growth is the thing that is driving the techs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, makes much the same point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still an information-based economic expansion we're
going through,'' he remarks. ``The bulk of the strength in the
economy is in high-tech and telecommunications equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   While tech stocks have been faltering this year, so-called value
companies _ those with solid, established businesses but relatively
low price-earnings multiples _ have acquired a following.
</P>
<P>
   Sprightly performances by such old-line companies as General
Motors, Procter &AMP; Gamble and duPont have helped keep the Dow Jones
industrials ahead of the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlossberg warns that it might be premature to move in a
big way into value stocks. ``Many are too cyclical and sensitive to
interest rates _ more sensitive than technology.'' He concedes that
``you're going to see a lot of volatility in the tech sector, given
the extent of the run-up last year.'' But the sector ``will
continue to benefit from strong earnings growth and an upbeat
outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Marcouiller, a vice president with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in
St. Louis, agrees that tech stocks will be volatile _ as they
almost always are.
</P>
<P>
   But he adds: ``If your favorite technology stocks have come down
several points, that is an excellent buying opportunity, because
over the next few weeks, things should resolve themselves to the
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that the Nasdaq composite will finish 2000 at 4,800
to 5,000, a gain of roughly 18 percent to 23 percent for the year.
He sees the S&AMP;P 500 reaching 1,700 _ for a 16 percent gain _ and
the Dow industrials at 13,000, a 13 percent gain.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Comparing Online Brokers on Costs 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you know of a Web site that compares the transaction costs
charged by each of the discount brokers on a level playing field? I
mean an analysis that takes into account such things as margin
interest rates, or having to maintain a certain minimum account
size.
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Take a look at the Gomez Advisors Web site at www.gomez.com.
Gomez, a Massachusetts firm that monitors all kinds of
financial-service firms, rates more than 50 online brokers
according to a broad range of criteria _ among them, ``overall
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall cost, Gomez explains, takes into account ``a basket of
typical services and purchases,'' additional fees, minimum balances
and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of cost alone, Gomez rates Firstrade _ with a $6.95
commission per trade _ No. 1 among the brokers. It edged out No.2
Brown &AMP; Co. _ which charges only $5 per trade _ in part because
Brown requires a $15,000 minimum balance.
</P>
<P>
   However, Firstrade ranks only 19th based on all the Gomez
criteria. Gomez scolds the firm for not providing after-hours
trading or ``real-time'' account information and for providing only
``limited'' research resources. Gomez also complains that
Firstrade's Web site ``performed poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be yet another demonstration of that old adage:
You get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   But if cost is all that matters to you, then go for it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Taxing Net Profit
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been approached by people asking how much money I am
willing to accept for my Internet domain. I've suggested $50,000.
If someone is willing to pay this, how would my profit be taxed? I
have owned the domain for two years, so I think I qualify for
long-term capital-gains treatment, which would limit the federal
tax to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably are correct, says Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller, but he declines to give a definitive
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has outstripped the tax law,'' he explains. ``The
laws regarding capital assets and capital gains were made long
before there was an Internet.'' It is conceivable, he says, that
for some obscure reason your gain would have to be treated as
ordinary income, subject to tax at your full rate.
</P>
<P>
   Weller suggests that you apply to the IRS for an official
ruling. The IRS will examine the facts in your case and issue a
private ruling that would be binding on the agency _ provided the
facts you supply are full and correct.
</P>
<P>
   Applying for such a ruling isn't easy. The forms are tricky and
the procedure requires a dismal trek through the federal
bureaucracy. If you decide to seek a ruling, get help from a
certified public accountant or tax lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Paying the Penalty
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I retired at the age of 54 and began withdrawing funds each
month from my individual retirement account. I have been paying
regular income tax on the withdrawals, plus the 10 percent penalty
imposed because I hadn't reached age 591/2. I finally reached that
age last May 19. Will I have to pay a penalty on all of last year's
withdrawals, or only those that preceded May 19?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only those that preceded May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Check your account statements and figure out how much you
withdrew last year, both before that milestone and after it. You
will have to spell out the details on IRS Form 5329 when you
prepare your tax return.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the financial institution that holds your IRA
will separate penalty and non-penalty distributions on the annual
form it sends to you and the IRS. Some institutions _ for example,
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. _ do this routinely.
</P>
<P>

moneybag &LR; sfgate.com, or to Arthur M. Louis, Moneybag column, 901

 Microsoft's Samaritan Reprised  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The Good Samaritan computer consultant who bailed out Microsoft
Corp. by paying an errant $35 bill for the software giant's Hotmail
e-mail service has received a thank-you check for $500 from the
world's most valuable company.
<P>
   Rather than cash the check, though, Michael Chaney placed it up
for auction yesterday on eBay. He pledged to match the highest bid
and donate all proceeds to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to give it to charity anyway,'' Chaney, 31, said
by telephone from his Nashville office. ``If I can make more than
$500 on eBay, it will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday afternoon, only one bid had been received. It
was for the check's face value.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing began on Christmas Day, when Chaney learned in
an online discussion group that access to Hotmail had been cut off
because Microsoft had neglected to pay a routine fee for control of
the www.passport.com Web address.
</P>
<P>
   The address is needed for Hotmail users to submit their
passwords to Microsoft's computers.
</P>
<P>
   More out of curiosity than anything else, Chaney visited the
site of Network Solutions, which controls registration of Web
addresses, called up the outstanding bill for www.passport.com and
paid the tab with his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, Hotmail was up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   Diane McDade, a spokeswoman for Microsoft's MSN.com portal,
which includes Hotmail, said it took the company some time to
figure out what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted that the fault did not lie with Microsoft. Instead,
she laid blame for the incident on Network Solutions, which McDade
insisted had been in error when its computers automatically
deactivated the www.passport.com address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up to date on payments, as far as we knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McDade said Microsoft appreciated Chaney's good
deed and decided that $500 was a suitably generous reward. The
company also sent him some software, which did not arrive over the
weekend with the check.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney said he was pleasantly surprised by the size of the
check. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized that,
because of all the publicity the Hotmail episode had garnered, the
check might be worth more than its face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it could be a funny little conversation piece,'' he
said. ``Maybe for some tech millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of those tech millionaires now bid the pricer higher on
eBay, Chaney said he will match up to $2,000 in proceeds and give
all the money to a charity of the winning bidder's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be glad to get this whole Hotmail thing behind him.
Since news of the bill paying got out, Chaney said he has done
about 20 interviews with reporters and received roughly 250 e-mail
messages congratulating him on his coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my 15 minutes,'' he said. ``I guess now I'll go back
to living in obscurity.''

 Wells Fargo Chairman Reduces Role  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Wells Fargo Chairman Paul Hazen has stepped down from management 14
months after engineering the sale of the San Francisco bank to
Norwest Corp.
<P>
   In a memo to bank employees last week, the 58-year-old Hazen
said he was transferring his operating responsibilities, including
supervision of Wells' corporate banking business, to Chief
Executive Officer Richard Kovacevich. Hazen said he would remain as
board chairman and continue to represent the bank with customers,
international partners and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me more time in terms of things I'm interested in
doing,'' Hazen said in an interview. ``And it appropriately allows
(Kovacevich) to run the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan-born, Arizona-raised Hazen was Wells' CEO from 1995
until 1998, when Minneapolis' Norwest bought the bank, took its
name and moved its headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiters had predicted Hazen would reduce his role
at Wells. ``It's difficult for someone who has been CEO of a
sizable organization to move into a role where he is not in the top
job,'' said Tony Price, managing director of Russell Reynolds
Associates in San Francisco, before Hazen's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen sold the once-mighty Wells after it had been weakened by
its hostile takeover of Los Angeles' First Interstate. Wells tried
to digest its conquest too quickly, prompting computer breakdowns
and customer defections.
</P>
<P>
   Several more recent megamergers, such as Bank One's purchase of
First Chicago in the Midwest, have also experienced marketing or
computer glitches that hurt profits and sent stock prices plunging.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Wells-Norwest combination is winning plaudits
from analysts. Its shares rose 1.3 percent in 1999, compared with a
4.4 percent fall in the PHLX/KBW index of large bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wells ``should report earnings in line with projections
made before the merger, and I don't think any of the others can say
that,'' said Joseph Morford, an analyst with the brokerage Dain
Rauscher Wessels. The bank is releasing fourth-quarter earnings
today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Norwest was in the driver's seat when the two banks
combined to form the nation's seventh-largest bank, the two sides
carefully managed the transaction as a merger of equals. Kovacevich
avoided forcing Norwest's ways on Wells by selecting his management
team and business practices from both banks.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen, known as a reserved, analytical executive, said he chose
Norwest as partner because of its laid-back merger philosophy.
``The First Interstate experience was absolutely paramount in my
mind,'' said Hazen. ``There was no way I was going to deliver to
Wells employees an experience like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said he had wanted to leave management for some time but
stayed to reinforce a merger-of-equals image. Specifically, he and
Kovacevich were eager to contrast their situation with Bank of
America, where Hugh McColl, CEO of North Carolina's NationsBank,
forced out his BofA counterpart, David Coulter, 16 days after the
two banks combined in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview several weeks ago, Hazen stressed his symbolic
role. ``The juxtaposition of what has occurred here and what
happened there _ there's symbolism that I'm still here and that I'm
engaged in the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said yesterday that he isn't interested in other executive
positions, but plans to step up his activity on other corporate
boards. Among his other board memberships, Hazen is a director of
Britain's Vodafone AirTouch, a telecommunications company waging a
hostile bid for German rival Mannesmann.

 2 Bay Area Computing Trendsetters Financed Again  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A pair of Bay Area companies that are riding two of the hottest
trends in computing yesterday reported in separate announcements
new funding from a parade of high-tech heavyweights led by Dell
Computer.
<P>
   TurboLinux, a San Francisco purveyor of business solutions built
around the ``open-source'' Linux operating system, said it had
raised $57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CenterBeam, a Santa Clara startup that provides a
complete package of hardware, software, services and support to
small businesses for a flat monthly fee per user, said it has
collected more than $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new money represents a second round of funding for each
company. In each case, Dell, now the leading supplier of PCs in the
U.S. market, was the lead investor.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 other technology companies joined Dell in making
what TurboLinux called the largest private funding round to date
for a Linux company. The list includes such major players as
Compaq, Fujitsu, Inprise, NEC, Novell, SCO, Seagate and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Also participating in TurboLinux's second round were its
original investors, August Capital, Broadview International and
chipmaker Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Intel also teamed with Dell in making its first equity
investment in CenterBeam. Other new investors include one of
CenterBeam's customers, Tangent Fund Management, and Impact Venture
Partners. Microsoft tops the list of first-round investors coming
back for more, along with CrossPoint Venture Partners, Accel
Partners, New Enterprise Associates and USWeb/ CKS.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to new Intel-powered PCs equipped with the latest
Microsoft software, CenterBeam's ``subscription computing'' plan
gives small businesses affordable access to technologies and
services usually available only to large corporations, including
wireless local-area networking, high-speed Internet access, 24/7
tech support, nightly backups of every PC and an array of Web-based
business services. The service typically costs $165 per user per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in August, the CenterBeam program has until now been
offered only in the San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento and San
Diego areas. The company said the latest funding will enable it to
offer its service nationwide. This week, a spokesman said, the
company is rolling out the program in Denver, Detroit, Phoenix,
Washington D.C., Dallas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, in view of Dell's role in the latest funding,
CenterBeam said it has use Dell desktop and notebook PCs at all of
its customer sites.
</P>
<P>
   TurboLinux's products are based on the same ``open source''
software used by other Linux distributors, such as Red Hat and
Caldera, but each company adds some unique enhancements of its own.
TurboLinux, which has offices in Tokyo; Beijing; and Sydney,
Australia, and operated until last June under the name Pacific
HiTech, specializes in developing Asian-language versions of the
upstart OS.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also a leader in Linux ``clustering,'' a
technique that links several computers to provide extra performance
and reliability for busy Internet servers and other demanding
applications.

   &UR; MARKET _ &LR;  Investors in Nasdaq stocks have endured several bad
scares so far this year. Accustomed to seeing these stocks shoot
steadily higher, they have been shocked to suddenly find that they
don't always do so.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly invincible, tech-laden Nasdaq composite index,
which trounced the other market indexes with a phenomenal 86
percent gain last year, has suddenly begun behaving like an
also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 trading days of the year, through Friday, the
Nasdaq composite tumbled five times _ including gut-wrenching,
single-day free-falls of 3.2 percent, 3.9 percent and 5.6 percent.

   THE DEMOCRATS: HAVE VAN? CAN TRAVEL?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore may have questioned the effects of the
internal combustion engine, but not when it comes to transportation
to the polls. Tuesday he exhorted a union audience in Knoxville,
Iowa, to pile into vans _ not cars, but gas-guzzling vans _ and
haul friends to the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24. ``I need your
willingness to take people with you to the caucuses,'' he said.
``Got a car and van? Take the van,'' Gore said. ``And, remember,
take people with you in the van.''

   THE REPUBLICANS: SKEPTICAL ON TAXES

   A recent poll conducted jointly by the two largest newspapers in
Texas showed that while voters in Gov. George W. Bush's home state
strongly support him, half of the respondents said they did not
believe he could cut taxes as much as he has promised, nor do they
favor one of his pet issues, vouchers for private schools. The
Dallas Morning News-Houston Chronicle poll was conducted from Jan.

significant and one clearly falls within the poll's margin of

a virtual dead heat there, the polls found. Independent voters say
they are more likely to vote in the Republican primary for McCain,

discovered other elected officials at rather crowded addresses in
Compton and suggested it was part of an effort to sway elections
improperly. Clifford Klein, head of the special investigations unit

THE AD CAMPAIGN: BUSH RETURNS TO HIS TAX PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reflecting a continuing emphasis on tax cuts, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas began running a new 30-second spot in New Hampshire
on Tuesday emphasizing his plan.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Framed by a window overlooking a gray harbor,
Bush speaks directly to the camera, which is focused tightly on his
face. The only graphics used in the spot flash the governor's name,
in black lettering. Portrait shots of Bush alternate with campaign
footage from previous commercials, showing the candidate talking to
supporters outside a New Hampshire town hall meeting and working a
crowd in warmer weather. At the conclusion of the spot, Bush, with
his signature half-grin, asks the viewers for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: Bush: ``There's a debate in New Hampshire on taxes
critical to America. We can cut taxes for working families and
protect Social Security. But it takes leadership. Washington
politicians want to keep your money in Washington. Not me. I
believe taxes are too high. The people of New Hampshire understand
that you deserve your money back. And cutting taxes helps keep the
economy growing. On Feb. 1, you settle the debate: tax cuts or
bigger government. I'd appreciate your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: New Hampshire is indeed in the midst of its own tax
debate. In response to a state Supreme Court ruling, New Hampshire
lawmakers approved a new statewide property tax last November, a
decision that rekindled the state's historic anti-tax fervor and
prompted vows of legal challenges. Bush's plan calls for $483
million in cuts over five years. His argument that cutting taxes
``helps keep the economy growing,'' originates in a long-treasured
tenet of Republicanism. Bush argues that it was the Reagan
administration's tax cuts in the 1980s that fueled the bullish
economy of the 1990s, but others give credit to, among other
things, the Clinton administration's championing of deficit
reduction and the boom in the information and technology sectors.
Critics of the Bush's proposal add that it gives wealthy taxpayers
a disproportionate share of the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Bush's return to the airwaves with his tax-cut
message is another strategic move in the competition between the
governor and his chief rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, over how
best to guide the economy. (McCain has unveiled his own plan to
reduce taxes by about half of what Bush proposes.) In style, the
commercial relies heavily, as have so many before it, on the
candidate's easygoing demeanor. It presents him as a folksy
tax-slashing Washington outsider, and he comes across as less stern
than McCain and much less stiff than the publisher Steve Forbes. In
this sense, the commercial may be more effective as a means of
reinforcing his image than in selling his tax plan. Many New
Hampshire voters have been telling reporters that they are focusing
less on the details of the plans than on the character of the
candidates. Still, the commercial looks a lot like Bush's other
spots, and some viewers may not even realize that it is a new one.

TIME TO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS ON THIS `PARTY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Reform Party is
a joke.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to take my word for it. A front-page report in
Thursday's Fort Worth Star-Telegram detailed the ``circuslike
atmosphere'' enveloping the party that Ross Perot built.
</P>
<P>
   The article featured a telling comment by the chairman of the
political science department at Carleton College in Minnesota:
</P>
<P>
   ``To call it a party is charitable. It's more like the Hatfields
and the McCoys.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's more like the Three Stooges _ or the Four
Stooges, if you toss in Perot with the likes of Jesse Ventura, Pat
Buchanan and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to toss in Perot. The truth is, any attempt to
figure out what's going on with the Reform Party must begin with
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   As the Star-Telegram report pointed out, Perot has been
strangely quiet during the ongoing feud between Reform Party
members who still look to him for leadership and those who are
loyal to Ventura. The Minnesota governor is the Reform Party's top
elected official.
</P>
<P>
   But we should not be deceived. Perot created the party from the
ample fabric of his own ego, and he will not stand by idly while
upstart egomaniacs reshape his creation.
</P>
<P>
   Perot would like us to believe that he founded this so-called
party for the purpose of implementing fundamental changes in the
American political system. But Perot really founded the Reform
Party to serve as a vehicle for his occasional forays into
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Perot doesn't care about the system. He doesn't care about
anything except propelling himself into the spotlight and upstaging
the efforts of others to deal with the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk about Buchanan or Trump or Ventura carrying the
Reform Party banner into the presidential election is a waste of
everybody's time as long as Perot is lurking in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   If Perot wants to be his party's nominee, he will be the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Scheming Weasel's recent low profile, in fact, might be part
of his strategy for launching another presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that most Americans correctly identified him as a
goofball after his first two runs for president, Perot could be
permitting the goofy triumvirate of Buchanan, Trump and Ventura to
showcase their goofiness in an attempt to rehabilitate his image by
comparison. After months of listening to brain-dead pronouncements
from those three nitwits, Perot might figure, voters could mistake
his ``clean-out-the-barn'' shtick for deep thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, of course, it just plain doesn't
matter whether the Reform Party nominates Ross, Pat, Donald or
Jesse _ or Larry, Moe or Curly. The nominee will be a nonfactor in
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Reformers were so annoyed by the decision of
the Commission on Presidential Debates to restrict participation in
the general-election debates to candidates who rack up at least 15
percent in the presidential preference polls. It is perfectly
obvious that the Reform candidate, no matter who it is, will never
secure 15 percent _ in the pre-election opinion polls or at the
polls on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Any assessment of the Reform Party's past, present or future
must start with the understanding that it never was, is not and
never will be a legitimate political party.
</P>
<P>
   When Perot captured 19 percent of the vote in 1992, don't
forget, he ran as an independent. When Perot headed the Reform
Party ticket in `96, he tallied 8 percent _ partly because voters
were on to his scam and partly because they could see that his
``party'' wasn't a party at all.
</P>
<P>
   For all the whining about the two-party system, it's a system
that has served this country well. Those who claim that there's no
difference between the Republican and Democratic parties are mostly
people who would like to see those parties embrace radical
positions that would be destructive to the parties and to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The two-party system is not in danger _ not from the Reform
Party, anyway.

THEY DON'T CALL IT `PORK CAKE' FOR NOTHING

<TEXT>
<P>
   It never ceases to amaze me what the readers can find.
</P>
<P>
   A reader in Tennessee requested a recipe for a cake that her
deceased mother-in-law used to bake at Christmas. Called ``pork
cake,'' it was a rich, dense cake that included no pork, she said.
Well, she was half-right, and her mistake is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   This old cake, dating at least to Colonial times, includes
ground pork fat that works in the batter the way shortening or
butter works in more modern, more ``affluent'' baking, where we can
simply stop by the grocery store to get ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe is from Ann C. Holmes, who says it's an old
recipe from her home state of South Carolina. The second, a modern
version, was sent in by Cheryl Jacoby, North Richland Hills, who
found it in the ``Owens Country Cookbook.''

TEXAS BIBLE TEACHER BUILDS NATIONAL WOMEN'S MINISTRY

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ark.) 
 
By RICHARD VARA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``We all know who this one is,'' Beth Moore said as
she held up a Superwoman costume and peals of laughter rang from
2,000 women filling the sanctuary of First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the woman who is busy, busy, busy,'' Moore said,
pumping up the volume with each ``busy'' to her audience's delight.
``She is happiest not only controlling her life, but also the lives
of those around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the woman with the bumper sticker that says, `God
could not be everywhere, so he created me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience howls.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a women's Bible study class a la Beth Moore. The
energetic Moore, 42, can create solemn silence as easily as she
drives home a biblical principle. ``Everyone in sin is a slave to
Satan,'' she told her hushed audience. ``It is (Christ's) truth
that sets us free.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's unpretentious, galfriend approach to the Scriptures has
led to a growing national reputation as a Bible teacher and author
with sales of nearly 1 million books. Her 2000 schedule includes
Bible studies in Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, and Canada, the
Philippines and the filming of a woman's Bible study, ``Jesus the
One and Only,'' in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks to an average of 5,000 to 8,000 women at her national
engagements, which begin on Friday evenings and conclude Saturdays.
She reaches tens of thousands more through her Bible study books
and audio and videotapes, which have propelled her to the top of
evangelical women speakers in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started working with Beth (in 1995), she was
well-known in the Houston area and South Texas, mostly in Southern
Baptist churches,'' said Chris Adams, Women's Enrichment Ministries
specialist for LifeWay Christian Resources in Nashville, Tenn.
``She is known all over the country now. She has gone way beyond
Southern Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, Moore's life was shattered by depression
and anxiety as she confronted memories of childhood abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In her far northwest Houston office that serves as headquarters
of her Living Proof Ministries, Moore unflinchingly related how the
memories surfaced just as she was developing as a Bible teacher at
First Baptist in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such deep wounds from childhood, and everything erupted
to the surface of my life at this time,'' said Moore, who was born
in Arkadelphia, Ark., and moved to Houston with her family as a
high school sophomore. The abuse came from outside the immediate
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had horrible nightmares, horrible, just a terrible time of
defeat,'' Moore said. ``Everything I ever hated about myself I saw
during those months.''
</P>
<P>
   The depression and emotional pain even shook her marriage to
Keith Moore, a home-services company co-owner. They married in 1978
after they graduated from Southwest Texas State University in San
Marcos. Her condition worried her daughters, Amanda, now a college
sophomore, and Melissa, now a high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it not been for my children, I would have despaired of
life,'' Moore said. The pain hurt &UR;  &LR; her effectiveness in Sunday
School teaching classes and speaking engagements. ``It would have
been clear to anyone in any audience that I had no business at a
microphone whatsoever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore's dark night of the soul did not shatter her faith.
Instead, it led to spiritual growth. ``It almost killed me,'' she
said with no hint of sorrow. ``What it did _ Hallelujah, Lord! _
was kill the old me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through counseling and her granitelike faith, Moore said, she
learned to forgive others _ and herself. ``I take full
responsibility for my sins, but I had to learn not to repent of
sins that weren't mine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her faith relationship with God was profoundly deepened. ``I
went from living for him to living on him,'' she said. It taught
her humility and empathy for the human condition. ``That's why I
can stand up (on a church platform) with passion; I have hurt like
(other women) have.''
</P>
<P>
   But she does not want to become ``a victim.'' She speaks about
abuse only when necessary. ``I don't want to become an issue-driven
speaker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore came to realize that the speaking spotlight was not on
her, but on her life and her faith. That is why she named her
ministry Living Proof when she incorporated it five years ago.
``Living Proof is proof that God still work in the reality of
life,'' she said. ``That his Word still speaks, still transforms,
that it has the power to change lives. I am one of those lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her authenticity and honesty are not lost on audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes across as a godly woman but a very real woman,''
said Carole Menefee, who sells educational software. Menefee has
followed Moore's development for nine years as a Sunday School
student and Bible study participant.
</P>

UPSCALE PREPARED-FOOD DELICACIES ARE JUST A CLICK AWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce went mainstream this past holiday season, as many
consumers pointed and clicked their way through their Christmas
list.
</P>
<P>
   Can the grocery list be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Online grocery purchasing has had its trials. Although there are
huge start-ups in some areas of the country, home delivery of
tomato juice and canned soup has hardly become the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared food is also getting a tryout on the red-hot Internet.
Some companies have tried and, so far, failed. On a foodie's
recommendation, we tapped into www.cookexpress.com, and were
confronted with ``CookExpress.com has suspended service until
further notice. We hope to reopen for business the beginning of the
year, after we have completed a key round of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   But other businesses are building clientele in this nascent
business. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   Balducci's
</P>
<P>
   Address: www.balducci.com
</P>
<P>
   What you'll find: Caviar to dessert. A room-stopping beef
Wellington (to serve 10-12) is $144.95. (To stop a smaller room,
beef Wellington to serve 4-6 is $74.95). Brodetto, an upscale
casserole of lamb with eggs, peas and Parmesan, is $41.95.
</P>
<P>
   Prices: From the extravagant to the affordable. Most of us
couldn't make a daily menu of this food, but much of it would fit
into a special-occasion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery charge: The shipping here is a straight $1.50 a pound.
Each item online is marked with the shipping weight, making the
math easy. Who would use this: Folks who miss the shopping life of
New York City. A host who'd like to order the centerpiece (such as
Chateaubriand) and fill in around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: All sorts of branding comes with the Balducci's package _
the ice packs carry the company's green logo, as do the foam
containers. And the Web site _ check out the Balducci cam.
</P>
<P>
   Drawback: The food arrives fully frozen. When you're talking a
big old slab of meat, that means days of defrosting in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Custom Creation Foods
</P>
<P>
   Address: www.customcreationfoods.com
</P>
<P>
   What you'll find: An assortment of fish cakes, sauces, some
heat-and-serve appetizers of the breaded variety, soup, rubs, and
pestos and herb butters.
</P>
<P>
   Prices: A serving of fire-roasted tomato bisque, which would
serve three adequately as an appetizer, is $3.75. A dozen 3-ounce
shrimp cakes are $21.99.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery charge: Way too high. For an order of soup, shrimp
cakes and a pound of beurre blanc dill sauce (a total order of
$29.99), the shipping added up to $36.16 and was broken down to
$4.06 for the foam cooler, $3.75 for dry ice and $28.35 for the
actual shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Who would use this: A lot of the items, like tuna and crab
cakes, would be ideal for a first course or entertaining. The sauce
we ordered was terrific. Since sauces can transform a simple piece
of grilled fish or seared chop, we'd recommend a supply of the
sauces for the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: The company included a sampler pack of appetizer nibbles
at no charge. For what the shipping cost, we figured we paid
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Drawback: The menu is not varied and some items, like the frozen
herbs, are a bit silly.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Home Bistro
</P>
<P>
   Address: www.thehomebistro.com
</P>
<P>
   What you'll find: A full selection of complete entrees (more
than 50), soups and appetizers. The food is vacuum-packed in bags
and then flash-frozen. The items are delivered frozen and can go
directly from the freezer to a pot of boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Prices: Entrees are around $9.95. A ``chef's favorite sampler''
is $89.95. That sampler (with each item serving two people)
includes smoked salmon and mozzarella ravioli, lobster bisque with
bread bowls for serving, beef stir-fry, salmon fillets and shrimp
in lobster sauce, and blackened chicken breast in champagne sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery charge: The most reasonable of the group we sampled.
The more food you order, the more reasonable the shipping. For
orders of more than $250, add 15 percent for shipping. An order $35
or less cost $10.95 to ship.
</P>
<P>
   Who would use this: Busy adult households. Singles who don't
care to cook. Seniors who are watching their health and want frozen
dinners beyond the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: This site offers nutritional figures for all of its
dishes. Gift certificates are also available.
</P>
<P>
   Drawback: Orders take from five to 10 business days for
delivery.
</P>

HOUSTON: she is teaching you.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Steve Seelig, who chairs the ministry's board, works
with Moore every day. He calls her the ``real deal. She knows
exactly where these women live and what is going on in their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministering to adult women was not what Beth Moore had in mind
when she graduated from Northbrook High School in northwest
Houston. ``I wanted to be a lawyer. My grandfather, whom I never
knew but read about, was a very well-respected attorney in Arkansas
and had served in the state legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   She changed her mind after receiving what she considers a call
from God a year later. She accompanied a group of sixth-grade girls
to a church summer camp. She remembers waking one morning and
feeling that God had called her. ``I have chosen you; you are
mine,'' is what she remembers hearing or feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to draw any mystical picture, but it was such a
clear thing, I literally felt chills,'' she said. ``I could feel
the hair stand up on the back of my neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a mystical kid. I was a thinker, I was cerebral. I
was not the kind of person to have an experience like that.'' She
sought out the camp director, who advised Moore that she may have
been called to ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she walked down the aisle of Spring Woods Baptist
Church and committed herself to ministry, but with no clear idea of
exactly what kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not feel God was calling me to the seminary,'' she said.
She decided to continue her university studies and remained open to
ministry opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I knew to do that: It was my blonde
personality rather than good sense,'' said Moore, unable to stifle
her impish humor.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage, she taught a sixth-grade Sunday School. ``I
didn't realize it until much later that I knew nothing about the
Bible,'' she said. But she was familiar with physical exercise, and
soon she was teaching an aerobics class to the sounds of Christian
contemporary music. ``It is still one of the favorite things that
God has ever given me to do,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   As she taught the exercise class, Moore learned to communicate
her faith in Christ. In 1982, she moved to First Baptist as a
member and to begin Christian aerobics classes there. She was
invited to speak to the church's annual women's retreat _ an
engagement that Moore considers the formal start of her speaking
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   She was told that she had speaking ability. ``It had never
occurred to me, never,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She began a monthly prayer breakfast for women, then took on the
challenge of a Sunday School class for women a little older than
she was. ``It was the most miserable year of my life,'' she admits.
``I had no idea of how to study Scriptures. It was the biggest
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she attended a Bible class led by the Rev. Buddy
Walters, now a minister in Mississippi. She dreaded the class
because she thought Scriptures study would be boring. But she found
Walters to be an inspiring teacher.
</P>
<P>
   She soon developed into an intense student, researching on her
own to glean spiritual insights. ``That's when I went from being a
speaker to being a teacher,'' Moore said. Her reputation for
fact-filled, inspiring lessons began to grow. But her Bible studies
really grew after her personal spiritual turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   From a weekly class of 200 women in First Baptist's chapel, she
began to attract more than 2,000 women per class. The Bible study
was moved to the 4,000-seat sanctuary. And she was approached by
the Southern Baptist Convention's LifeWay Christian Resources about
publishing her Bible studies. Her nine books have become best
sellers for the denomination's publishing arm, Broadman and Holman,
in five years. Book royalties support her ministry, which has one
part-time and two full-time employes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore still teaches a co-ed Bible study class Sunday mornings at
First Baptist and is delighted that her daughters attend the class.
The filming of the Holy Land Bible study in March will not permit
Moore to hold her usual spring 11-week study at First Baptist, but
she will hold a fall study at the church.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore doesn't want her Bible studies to be merely ``Christian
pep rallies.'' She is convinced that the Bible holds the key to a
joyful, satisfying life but not to transient happiness or
problem-free living.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in agony out there,'' Moore said. ``They are
looking for answers; their lives are in shambles. So I prefer to
teach rather than give a little bit of motivation or
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't worry about the future or whether her ministry will
continue to ascend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not impressed with me. God giveth and God takes away,''
Moore said about popularity. But she has been down in the pit and
does not want to fall again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want God to keep my heart worse than I want health or
prosperity.''

THE LESSONS I'M LEARNING WITH A BADLY INJURED CAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When the need arises _ and it does _ you must be able to shoot
your own dog. Don't farm it out _ that doesn't make it nicer, it
makes it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Notebooks of Lazarus Long''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus Long was a creation of science-fiction writer Robert A.
Heinlein. Long was an immortal, and the notebook is a collection of
his sayings from Heinlein's writings about the character.
</P>
<P>
   Heinlein died in 1988. But the quote he crafted above has been
running through my mind over the past few days, and soon you will
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   My cat, Ashley, is seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley is a beautiful Russian gray that has developed a charming
trick of meeting us at the head of the sidewalk when we come home
while she is outside. She will walk very deliberately in front of
us, pausing every so often to roll over on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   So far, her rollover record is 12 before we reach the porch.
</P>
<P>
   She disappeared sometime Jan. 1 and came home, injured, two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian thinks she was hit by a car. During the nine
years she has been a companion, I've never known her to run into or
ever cross the street in front of our house, but I suppose it could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   There's really no other explanation. Her tail is broken and
hangs useless, and if she lives, it will have to be amputated. But,
says the vet, there's no need of putting her through that unless
she's going to make it, so maybe we'll wait awhile.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we are doctoring and praying _ I'm a little
uncomfortable praying for a cat, but it's worked before, and
there's not much else I can do.
</P>
<P>
   Being the guy, I'm getting to do most of the ugly stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At least I'm not having to perform that other common modern male
function of going to find the car in the parking lot in the rain.
With the recent bout I've had with flu, Ashley probably would have
to be taking care of me.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I'm convinced that one reason women outlive men is
that we constantly have to go out in the rain to do things while
our womenfolk wait under shelter. But that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   How shall I put this delicately?
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with Ashley is that some of her bodily functions
aren't working exactly right, so she needs assistance in performing
them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced that God gives us children, spouses and pets to
teach us that there is no task too distasteful to perform for a
helpless loved one.
</P>
<P>
   I watched my sister-in-law slowly die of kidney failure while my
brother learned everything he needed to know to perform dialysis at
home. You do what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of all of this with Ashley is that I can't talk
to her to explain what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, I think she understands, at least a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   The least distasteful (to me) chore is giving her medicine and a
really yuckie laxative composed, I'm told, of beef-flavored
petroleum jelly. All things considered, it's a better alternative
to the other solution for that particular problem, which I've also
been doing.
</P>
<P>
   I spread a towel on my lap, pull her head back, pry open her
clenched jaws and dump all of the stuff in. The towel is important
for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When she's finished swallowing the gunk, she'll turn to me, rub
her head against me and start purring. I'm pretty sure that if my
wife were doing that to me, I might be understanding, but it'd be a
pretty good while before I started purring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ashley's getting a little better. She's less tolerant
about the medicine, and there are signs that she might be gaining
some control of her body. But it's slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we put her down?'' I asked the vet last week.
</P>
<P>
   That's awfully final, he says. We can always do that. Maybe
we'll wait for a while.
</P>
<P>
   And all the time Ashley has her head tucked under my arm just to
make the world go away.
</P>
<P>
   I think one purpose of a newspaper is to tell us about things
that other people go through so we will have some training when we
face the same or similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, Lisa Davis wrote an article in The Weekly Review
about having to put her dog, Bob, to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to realize that there is purpose in human
suffering,'' she said. ``It can draw one closer to God. For dogs,
there is no greater point. It's just suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lisa, maybe, has shown me the way.
</P>
<P>
   If the time comes, I guess we'll make the decision that has to
be made.
</P>
<P>
   But even though I can't get past the belief that perhaps Lazarus
Long is right, I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to farm this out.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently purchased a portable compressor and paint spray
gun that I plan to use for painting furniture and cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   I have had no experience with using a sprayer, but have been
told that some practice is advisable to insure getting a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any tips you can offer to make the job easier and to
cut down on the number of mistakes I'm likely to make?
</P>
<P>
   A: When spraying keep the gun moving so it is always parallel to
the surface being painted.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment with how far from the surface the gun is held until
you get an even spray pattern, then maintain this same distance for
all subsequent spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Don't swing your arm in an arc that will bring it closer at the
center of the stroke; this will result in a heavier coating in the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes should overlap each other by about one-third as you go
back and forth, and the trigger on the spray gun should always be
depressed as long as the gun is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Also, make sure that you swing the gun past the edge of the
surface at the end of each stroke before starting the return
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our bathroom has a vent fan installed in the outside wall and
we want to install a second exhaust fan in this bathroom because
the original one doesn't seem adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cut through the outside wall again, couldn't I
install the second exhaust fan in the ceiling and just let it blow
the exhaust air up into the attic above?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is not a good idea to vent a bathroom fan directly up into
the attic above, no matter how well ventilated that attic is.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture can accumulate up there and create condensation and
mildew problems _ especially in winter.
</P>
<P>
   You might look into the possibility of replacing the existing
fan with a larger one that will move more air; otherwise the second
exhaust fan should be vented directly to the outside through a wall
or through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to install a second sink in our master bathroom and I
have been told that the drain line for this sink must be connected
to the main vent or stack that goes up through the roof of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really necessary for each sink to be connected to this
vent pipe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Venting of each sink or other plumbing fixture is required by
all plumbing codes because if each drain line were not vented it
would not drain safely and properly.
</P>
<P>
   Air would not be able to enter that drain line as waste water
runs out, and a lack of such venting could result in a siphon
action as the waste water runs out.
</P>
<P>
   This could result in sucking water out of the trap, thus
allowing noxious sewer gases to enter through the sink drain
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The building I live in has a flat roof over my upstairs
apartment and there is apparently no insulation in this roof.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer the heat is so intense that my air conditioner
cannot keep the apartment comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything I can put on my ceiling to insulate it and
keep out the heat?
</P>
<P>
   A: If there is enough space between your apartment ceiling and
the roof above it then you might be able to have a contractor blow
loose fill insulation into the space between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Another option _ if there is plenty of headroom in your
apartment _ would be to install a suspended or hanging ceiling
under the existing one. This would permit you to add insulation in
the space between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise there is little you can do from below.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you can work on the roof you can cut down on the
amount of heat gain from the sun by painting the roof with a
reflective coating such as a white or aluminum roof coating.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SPRAY GUN TECHNIQUE'' goes with this
column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Overlapping strokes with spray gun and moving gun so
that it is always parallel to the surface will result in a smoother
job.

   One winter, during a flu season almost as violent as this one, I
had an interview scheduled in Maine with the state's attorney
general. I also had a wicked cold. But I was a spanking new
reporter, terrified at the thought of missing a deadline, so I
swallowed a variety of over-the-counter promises, snorted too much
nasal spray and boarded a very small commuter plane.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I landed in Augusta, my ears were so stuffed that
everything echoed, and the ground shifted and rolled when I walked.
I arrived, on schedule, at the Statehouse. Then, just as promptly,
I passed out. I conducted the interview while lying on a couch
sipping tea. When the attorney general said his goodbyes, he
suggested _ quite kindly, considering the circumstances _that next
time I should ``please just stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the people who are hacking and sneezing all around
this time of year _ on buses, in offices, on airplanes _ it is
advice not easily followed. Why  &UR; don't  &LR; we just stay home?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried,'' said Rita, my hairdresser, who worked the week
before Christmas despite aching muscles and a headache so fierce
she squinted while she snipped. ``I called and told them I wasn't
coming in, and they said yes I was, there were clients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should,'' said Dr. Stuart Lewis, an assistant professor of
clinical medicine at the New York University School of Medicine,
who admits to coming to work feeling lousy because his patients
depend on him to send  &UR; them  &LR; home to bed. ``My wife is always
asking me the same question,'' he says with a laugh, ``and I have
to explain it's because I'm totally indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis tells his patients to call in sick when they have a fever
(meaning they are most likely to be contagious) or if they feel too
ill to concentrate on their work. Staying home won't make you any
better, he explains, but it will make you more comfortable. And, as
the attorney general of Maine made clear, it will keep everyone
else at the office from catching what you've got. Bringing a virus
to work allows that virus to get down to work. Germs ``are very
efficient at going from one person to the next,'' Lewis says.
``That's what they do for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives this advice knowing it will be ignored, just as he so
often ignores it himself. ``People drag themselves to work feeling
lousy because it's much harder to be at home than at work,'' he
says. A day at home is divided between soap operas you aren't able
to follow and thoughts of all the work you aren't getting done.
Better to hoard those sick days for a return of the Black Plague,
or, even worse, a day when your child is too sick to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Sick kids. Ahhh. Now, there's a whole other can of germs. Just
ask Mrs. Klein, our school nurse. Recently my son's sore throat,
which I'd hoped was nothing when he woke up, had blossomed into an
unmistakable something by lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   When I apologized for sending him in the first place, Mrs. Klein
just laughed. ``I've gotten notes that say, `She was throwing up
all night, but she seems better now,''' she said. With two sons of
her own, she tries to be understanding. ``No one has time for their
kids to be sick,'' she said. ``They have meetings. They have places
to be. They need their kids to be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   I should note that Mrs. Klein had a cold on the day we spoke,
but she came to work anyway because she knew it was hard to find a
substitute nurse. She is very careful, she says, to wash her hands
constantly. But kids can't be counted on to wash theirs. They can,
bless them, be counted on to sneeze on their best friend's snack.
And those very efficient germs can be counted on to travel from
friend to parent, who then goes off to work and sneezes on the rest
of us.
</P>
<P>
   If I sound a little cranky about this it's because I'm not
feeling all that hot myself. In spite of a flu shot last fall, my
throat now has the unmistakable warning tickle and my nose is
starting to run. I managed to oh-so-casually mention this to all
the doctors I spoke to for this column, but none of them were
terribly impressed and none had a miracle cure. Sounds like a cold,
they said. Stay home if you run a fever and just let it run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad,'' added Dr. Jonathan Jacobs, an
infectious-disease specialist at the Weill Medical College of
Cornell University in Manhattan, ``that we're not doing this
interview in person.''

   CHICAGO _ To soothe the dread of a 6 a.m. alarm clock call,
wouldn't it be nice to know that the clock has told the coffee
maker to start brewing the coffee?
</P>
<P>
   In the never-ending American march toward the new and improved,
consumers will soon be able to buy appliances that ``talk'' to each
other, so that the coffee maker knows you have just staggered from
the bed and need caffeine badly.
</P>
<P>
   That is just the beginning of the gee whiz contrivances on
display at the International Housewares Show in Chicago this week,
where 1,900 exhibitors from around the world are trotting out the
very latest for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its alarm clock that alerts the coffee maker, Sunbeam is
offering a scale that points you toward the right path. If the
scale shows a recent weight gain, for example, it sends a message
to a kitchen computer that calls up healthier recipes. If the
reading on the Sunbeam blood-pressure monitor is too high, the
device can send an automatic e-mail message to a physician.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, of course, whether anyone is clamoring
for all this high-tech assistance around the house. It also remains
to be seen whether people who still cannot program a VCR, and there
are plenty of us, will ever be able to learn how to program the
computerized appliances to do their tricks.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of affluence, manufacturers are courting consumers
with a promise to pamper. As ever, decadence is as popular as sin.
But they do not put it quite that way. Now, luxury is packaged as
virtue. Buying and having the best, it seems, is seen simply as a
matter of being prudent and thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Smart is the buzzword in the product booths here. A microwave by
Sharp Electronics Corp., for example, flashes ingredients, recipes
and cooking instructions that have been downloaded from a Web site.
The idea is that any kitchen amateur can come home and whip up
Tuscan farfalle.
</P>
<P>
   Even buying a kitchen knife is now apparently an intellectual
pursuit. ``It's the physics of the blade,'' Brad Daggett, a
spokesman for Chicago Cutlery, said, explaining why a $100 chef's
knife is a more intelligent purchase than one for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Casey Weiss, a spokeswoman for the International Housewares
Show, said: ``People want to look smart. We're all about image.''
</P>
<P>
   The iron, too, has gone high tech. Krups is displaying its V-70
Intelligent model, with a thermoscale that gauges when the
temperature is right for pressing a shirt. ``No more spit tests,''
said Jodi Dixon, who displayed the $99.99 iron, which comes with a
vulcanized rubber case, for the consumer who wants to be safe and,
of course, smart.
</P>
<P>
   But if deep thinking is the pitch, it is the deep pockets that
make the housewares show go around. ``God bless Bill Clinton, or is
it Alan Greenspan, or maybe its Bill Gates, I don't know,'' said
Lisa Callaghan, a spokeswoman for All-Clad Metal Crafters, which
sells a two-quart saucepan for $130. ``But we have this wonderful
economy and people can afford to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, apparently, that people can have their cake and eat
it, too. Ms. Callaghan told of a shopper who bought two sets of the
handsome cookware, one for cooking and one for displaying.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Tropical is selling indoor waterfalls for nearly $1,300.
Sanyo is coming out with a chair that massages, $2,600, and a foot
massager, $300. The chair comes with a control panel with options
for massage, tapping, stretching or the combination. There is even
a calf vibrator, with fast and slow speeds. Its makers insist that
it is the closest thing to having a masseuse in the family room,
with a motor that kneads as if hands are coming out of the
reclining chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not cheap,'' Mitsunori Kurisu, the chief planner for Sanyo,
said. ``But people are out working hard, they need to come home and
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to be pampered without paying a fortune,
Conair is marketing a device that turns a bathtub into a whirlpool
for $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Callaghan's view, there is more to conspicuous
consumption than impressing friends and relatives, although that
does not hurt. ``Consumers are just getting sick of disposable
products,'' she said. ``They want to buy things that will last.
They want something they can hand down to their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   The little ones might prefer the fish motion lamp or the Denver
Bronco football bank among the new products on display. For Fido
and his owner, there is a water bottle that allows them to bond by
drinking from the same cup (two different water sources) in their
travels. ``This way, the owner and dog can share something,''
Howard Shapiro, of Cool Pooch Products, said.
</P>
<P>
   The show has had its usual retinue of celebrities, including an
actor who plays Clean in television advertisements, and Linda
Evans, with her facial toning mask, Rejuvenique. The biggest
attraction by far was Emeril Lagasse, the celebrity chef of the
Food Network, who was promoting a line of cookware.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers grow too old to stay out late, they want nice
things around them at home; at least that is what the manufacturers
are betting. ``People feel like, `I'm spending all this time at
home, and I want something to show for it,''' Ms. Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   China, for example. Just as people do not typically wear
business suits every day anymore, she said, people less often use
formal china for dinner parties. ``They might have an Asian theme,
so they'll go out and buy a set of square plates, even though
they're only going to use them once all year.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It's gotten upscale, but not formal. They're
calling it `casual elegance.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the marketeers aiming their pitches, it is time for the
smartest buyers, as always, to beware.

WILL MEDIA DRUG FLAP TURN OUT TO BE A BUST?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ABC will rake in millions on beer commercials
this year, as the network did last year, year before last, and
particularly the year it aired its comprehensive drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you remember ``March Against Drugs.'' It was the 1997
campaign targeting marijuana and other illicit drugs as death
sentences for body and soul. The government-sanctioned anti-drug
messages were everywhere. They were inserted with corporate
blessing into all programming, from sitcoms to dramas to the
nightly newscast anchored by Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Other than someone profiting handsomely from selling illegal
substances, who wouldn't agree that the campaign was a good, even
great, thing? But there was a problem then, just as there is a
problem now as the networks and the federal government, dumb and
dumber, try to dig themselves out of another public relations hole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ABC went after only those vices that are illegal, while
glorifying those that are. Like alcohol. Marijuana and cocaine and
crack can fry your brain. But beer is fun, beer is good times, beer
is living a carefree existence with beautiful women and strong,
buffed men. At least it looked that way in the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Was ABC not aware that alcohol abuse is involved in 95 percent
of all violent crimes committed on college campuses, where beer is
the drug of choice? Or that teen-agers are twice as likely to use
alcohol as marijuana?
</P>
<P>
   I thought of ``March Against Drugs'' as the latest
government-sanctioned anti-drug campaign hit the skids. And what
timing all around. Mediascope, the media research entity, was all
set to deliver the good news that depictions of illicit drug use
are down in prime-time programming. Pill popping, needle sticking,
powder sniffing, all down.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't agree on its positive intent?
</P>
<P>
   Then Salon.com took all of it away. Poof. Just like that. The
Internet magazine had posted a story showing why the numbers were
so stellar: Deals had been struck between network television and
the Office of the National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Financial deals. Deals that might include possible script
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ONDCP's media campaign uses ads and entertainment-industry
collaboration to influence the messages and images, which they hope
will affect youth attitudes about illicit drugs. Congress requires
that every federal dollar spent on media outlets is matched 100
percent in public-service activity by media organizations that
receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   This became a murky area when it appeared that the networks, for
monetary gain, could reshape scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, we still don't know. The ONDCP stands by its
assertion that it did nothing wrong, that at no time did any person
or organization affiliated with the media campaign suggest changes,
nor were any episodes or programs submitted for reconsideration in
exchange for match credit.
</P>
<P>
   Network producers agree. ``It's bizarre, just bizarre,'' was Tom
Fontana's reaction. He's a producer who co-created ``Oz,''
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and other series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never been approached by anything of this nature. Ever,''
he said. ``So I can't quite understand what they're talking about.
It's kind of surreal. Maybe I feel that way because the first I
heard of it was in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   If the drug office asked for and received scripts to doctor,
it's some form of pay-to-view arrangement. It's unfortunate,
considering that, again, the real message is being lost in the
hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Television has had difficulties in dealing with drugs and
alcohol in its story lines. Dramas that involve such substances are
almost invariably thinly disguised lessons or heavier ones, like
Kim Delaney's alcoholic arc in ``NYPD Blue.'' Comedies have had the
most difficulty putting it in perspective. They too often offer
slapstick situations _ a character slurring words or making no
sense. Or there's the crackhead on ``The PJs,'' who drew
questioning comments even before the series aired.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere have drug references popped up with more consistency
than on ``That '70s Show,'' a comedy about high school kids trying
to grow up too fast. The teen-agers are forever trying to smuggle
six-packs and kegs of beer into the basement. Their tipsy scenes
have, for some, been the highlight of a series that is struggling
in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But the study results released last week, the one showing good
news, that TV is doing something right, got no mention at all in
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   We were chasing after the bigger fish in the bigger pond, one
that may, in the long run, turn out to be nothing more than a bust
anyway.

 NOW, CLASS, BEWARE OF STRANGERS AND IRONY  (js) 
 By JOE QUEENAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of its sophistication and vertiginously high production
values, the ``Martha Stewart Living'' show is often thought of as
an entirely original concept that sprang directly from the mind of
its creator. Yet, in its obsession with the polishing of
candlesticks, the folding of towels and the almost Prussian
deployment of napkins and bed linen, Martha Stewart actually owes
an enormous debt to the implacably didactic ``mental hygiene''
films that were popular in American schools from 1945 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Buster Keaton's primitive but brilliant films paved the
way for the more technically sophisticated work of the Marx
Brothers and Woody Allen, such short films as ``Dinner Party''
(1945), ``Let's Give a Tea'' (1946) and the seminal ``Let's Be
Clean and Neat'' (1957) prepared an entire generation of Americans
for the more nuanced pleasures of Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone unfamiliar with mental hygiene films can see them this
weekend at the American Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria,
Queens, as the museum concludes its three-part series, ``Mental
Hygiene: Social Guidance Films 1945-1970'' with such classics as
``Lunchroom Manners'' (1960), ``Good Table Manners'' (1951) and the
peerless ``Cindy Goes to a Party'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   But neophytes should be forewarned that only the films dealing
with table settings and etiquette have stood the test of time. The
rest of the entries in this festival make for a cornball hoot fest.
Meaning that individuals who pride themselves on knowing the
derivation of the term ``swell'' will find a trip to Queens this
weekend unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Mental hygiene pictures were a staple of the U.S. educational
system throughout the quarter century following World War II.
Students of all ages were forced to watch these earnest but bizarre
short films, which apprised them of such things as the folly of
playing on steep precipices overlooking the ocean, the need to
minimize one's square-dancing during the early days of the
menstrual cycle, the inadvisability of shooting heroin before an
important track meet and the necessity of placing the fork to the
left of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these inadvertently hilarious films will doubtless prove
endlessly amusing to those New Yorkers who feel that a balanced
diet of irony and condescension form the cornerstone of a healthy
cultural diet. The people who made them apparently hoped that by
exposing youngsters to the pitfalls of cliff-based shenanigans,
untimely square-dancing and dangerous narcotics, they could keep
the 1950s going forever. Sadly, this did not work. Except, perhaps
in certain parts of rural Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   People who grew up in the '50s and '60s will recall these movies
with a mix of nostalgia and dread, while whippersnappers who came
of age in the '70s, '80s and '90s will perhaps have more compassion
for their parents and employers. Because, as Ken Smith, the curator
of the series, says in his book ``Mental Hygiene: Classroom Films
1945-1970'' (Blast Books, 1999), these ``attitude-building'' motion
pictures were part of a vast social engineering program designed to
present children with an alternate version of reality.
</P>
<P>
   This alternate world was a cardigan-dominated universe where
seemingly everyone was named Wally or Betty, where skirts were
perpetually being hung carefully to allow the fabric to ``rest,''
and where minority groups did not exist. But at the same time it
was a place where mashers, greasers and hep cats were always trying
to get good girls to put out, and where clean-cut guys were forever
being tempted by with-it beatniks to shake the square world and
blast off for Kicksville.
</P>
<P>
   Smith maintains in his book that the surprisingly liberal people
who made these films never, ever confused the world depicted in the
films with reality per se. As he puts it, ``Mental hygiene films
were popular because they showed life not as it was, but as their
adult creators wanted it to be.'' In other words, the producers of
these films were not as dumb as their films looked.
</P>
<P>
   Smith estimates that roughly half of the 3,000 mental hygiene
films made in this golden age of daffy didacticism have now
disappeared. This is a staggering blow to our national heritage,
which can ill afford the loss of so much genuinely comic material
in an era dominated by Adam Sandler. Indeed, one of the most
remarkable things about the films being shown at the American
Museum of the Moving Image is how much funnier they are than all
subsequent attempts to parody them.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps because the films are the work of sincere,
technically gifted but fundamentally deranged human beings. Who
else would make a film about a tot using a BB gun to shoot bottles
and getting his eye put out, and then show the pitiful tyke with an
eye patch? What kind of person would make a film about a little
girl who impales herself on a pair of scissors and then act as if
it's the kid's own fault? And why did so many of these films
feature sadistic announcers gloating over teen-agers' shortcomings
and taunting them in voice-overs?
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent generations learned to sublimate their feelings
toward teen-agers through films like ``A Nightmare on Elm Street.''
But back in the '50s, the adults just came right out and said it:
``We think you're a bunch of pathetic losers, and we hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, not everything depicted in these films is ridiculous or
stupid or cruel. The techniques delineated in ``Soapy the Germ
Fighter'' (1951), ``Dining Together'' (1947) and ``Are Manners
Important?'' (1954) are just as effective today as they were a
half-century ago. Giving Dad ``the bad news'' as soon as he walks
in from work is still the worst idea ever. Strapping jocks who
start hanging out with drug kingpins are casting themselves as the
fall guys in a real-life tragedy. And being sorry won't mend a
broken leg, now, will it?
</P>
<P>
   But for every case where mental hygiene films illustrate a
time-tested truth, there are an equal number of instances where
they deliberately confuse young people by presenting a hopelessly
skewed vision of reality. ``Shy Guy'' (1947), starring Dick York
and narrated by Mike Wallace, is completely off base in suggesting
that bashful males can become babe magnets by displaying their
impressive soldering techniques.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that exposing impressionable young men to
lurid photographs at lunch time was ever a widespread or even
effective homosexual courting mechanism (``Boys Beware,'' 1961).
Marijuana is not ingested through a ``pot needle.'' Soiled clothing
has never prevented pretty girls from landing Mr. Dreamboat, and in
some cases it may have helped. And no scientific data linking the
consumption of beer with heroin addiction has yet emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their obvious failures as social engineering tools,
mental hygiene films have contributed immensely to the culture we
live in. Such market-driven social engineers as Martha Stewart
learned everything they know about vacuous pushiness from these
motion pictures. Spy magazine, ``Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' Chevy
Chase's demeanor and Miller Lite's ``Meet Dick'' television
commercials are all direct descendants of these films, as are the
legions of diabolically frumpy, bespectacled ``irony girls'' who
patrol Gotham's bistros from dusk till dawn. In this sense, we as a
people remain enmeshed in that perpetual commute between
Squaresville and Blastoff Canyon. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON_ So you resolved to have a stress-free but fashionable
year, and already you have frizzy hair, a stain on your skirt, a
run in your stockings and a suitcase so overstuffed it won't close.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. A world of quick fixes is on the way with the
answers to some of the fashion, beauty and travel problems that
plague readers most.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to present a more polished appearance, but I don't
have time to spend on makeup.
</P>
<P>
   A: Makeup artist Bobbi Brown says a woman needs to spend only
eight minutes a day on her face _ five minutes for morning makeup,
two minutes for an evening touch-up and one minute preparing for
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, look for double-duty products to save time. Many makeup
companies today offer foundations that are applied by sponge but
have the feel of powder. This is great for touch-ups, too. Or use
the same color powder for eye shadowing and lining.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does it take me so long to get ready for special events?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe you don't spend as much time as you think. A survey by
Gillette for Women, reveals that one in five women takes 90 minutes
or more to get ready for special evenings out. Some 61 percent take
an hour or more, while only 6 percent say they manage to get it
together in less than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I cannot seem to find a makeup foundation that matches my
skin.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you want to be computer perfect, try Elizabeth Arden's
Custom Color Foundation. A hand-held computer scanner ``reads''
your skin color, after which you are given a choice of matte or
natural finish, then a choice of the sheer, medium or full-coverage
formula. The cost is $42.50 for a 1-ounce bottle, plus a small vial
for travel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite lipstick has been discontinued. What do I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or e-mail the company. Ask for any remaining stock of
your color. Also ask if they will reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I found success with chemotherapy but lost my eyebrows in the
process. How can I draw on matching brows?
</P>
<P>
   A: Senna Cosmetics sells the Form A Brow Kit, including three
bendable plastic cutouts of brow shapes, three powder colors, a
brow brush and a coloring brush. The $35 kits are available in
neutral for brunettes, blondes or redheads and dark for black hair.
To order, phone 800-537-3662.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help! I've gained five pounds and my evening gown won't fit.
</P>
<P>
   A: Girdles and industrial-strength bodyshaping undergarments are
readily available and can make inches of difference. Take your
evening gown with you for try-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you have 24 hours and good health, try fasting while
drinking 16 glasses of water. Obviously this one-day diet is a
no-no for diabetics or anyone with kidney or other problems, but
for a healthy person, the ocean of water can set up a reaction that
debloats the body quickly. Stop drinking water a few hours before
the big event, and remember, this is not a long-term diet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a date with the woman of my dreams but a tough work
week has me pooped. Any secrets for a drug-free power surge?
</P>
<P>
   A: As a matter of fact, there are a few secrets. While a body
deprived of sleep can only catch up by sleeping, you might try
exercise or taking a hot bath or shower. Or eat a chocolate candy
bar or power bar. Other quick-energy fixes include foods rich in
riboflavin, zinc and vitamins B6, B12 and E. The best all-around
quick-energy foods are eggs, milk, chicken, nuts and liver.
</P>
<P>
   One quick fix for looking better is standing tall with proper
posture. Then forget yourself and concentrate on the person of your
dreams.

TRUE FASHION EMERGENCIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I spilled soup on my silk blouse, and I have an important
meeting. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people swear by club soda or a piece of ice in a napkin.
Others use baby wipes, and still others carry packets of Shout
Wipes. Talcum powder can absorb oil-based stains. Vinegar can
remove deodorant. If the garment is dark or colored, do not scrub
with white paper or cloth. Either can leave behind a residue as
well as permanently damage the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The following method usually has good results: Quickly back
fabric with a towel, then blot the stain with a cloth or a paper
towel. Dab from outside with a damp cloth. Pat the fabric dry.
Never rub. Repeat until the stain is gone, then use a hair dryer
set to cool to dry the fabric without leaving a ring. Dry-clean the
garment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a spot on my tie, but I don't know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try club soda, ice in a napkin, a spray spot remover or
talcum powder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a run in my last pair of pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   A: If it can still be hidden under your skirt or pants, stop the
run with a dab of nail polish. If you have another pair of
pantyhose with a run in only one leg, cut the bad legs off each
pair and layer. Yes, you'll have on two panties but only one pair
of stockings.
</P>
<P>
   Or go barelegged. Believe it or not, this is the trend today. In
New York, few women wear stockings, choosing tights or high boots
in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The hem is coming out of my skirt, and there's no time for a
needle and thread.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the fabric is thin and pliable, use tape, either double-
or single-sided. If the fabric is thick and nubby (boucle wool, for
example), reach for a stapler.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My shirt collar size appears to come in sleeve lengths fit
only for an ape. What can I do about sleeves that go beyond my
fingertips?
</P>
<P>
   A: An alterations expert can nip those sleeves off fairly
quickly, but perhaps not quickly enough. If you can keep your
jacket on, a temporary measure is to use safety pins to take up the
slack in your sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I like the look of push-up sleeves, but mine always seem to
be falling down and can't get up.
</P>
<P>
   A: Roll your sleeves around fat rubber bands or look for the
handy new scrunchie bands made specifically for this.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, no! My zipper's stuck.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try ``greasing'' the zipper teeth with soap, then zipping
back and forth bit by bit. If something is stuck in a nylon zipper,
grasp the zipper firmly and pull it apart, then zip backward and
forward to repair. Metal zippers are more difficult to ``repair''
once the teeth have separated, but not impossible. Patience helps,
or seek professional help at a shoe and leather repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I stepped in a crack the first time I wore my new stilettos.
Now the leather heel is ripped and rippled.
</P>
<P>
   A: For tiny shoe touch-ups, cover scratches with indelible ink.
For bigger jobs, your shoe repairman can usually work miracles on
damaged heels. But if you're in a hurry, carefully pull the leather
back into shape, fusing in place with a little Sobo glue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I accidentally slammed the car trunk on the dry-cleaning and
tore a jagged hole in my best suit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
$$$
</P>
<P>
   A: Reweavers can accomplish miracles. Prices start at $20, with
a 1 -inch hole in a wool suit running about $30. The bigger the
hole, the more costly and time-consuming the job. Turnaround time
is usually about a week, although you might find a weaver who can
handle your job on an emergency basis. Look in the Yellow Pages
under ``Weavers'' or ``Alterations.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I lost the back to my earring. Should I glue it to my ear?
</P>
<P>
   A: We wouldn't hear of it. Instead, try a tiny bit of cork from
a wine bottle as a stop-gap measure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm out of shampoo and conditioner, and don't have time to
run to the store.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have a mild dish detergent or liquid hand soap, either
of these can sub for shampoo. Instead of conditioner, try vinegar
and water, then rinse in cold water. If hair appears too dry, rub a
small dab of petroleum jelly on your hands and through your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I woke up with horrible bags under my eyes. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Camomile tea bags, cucumber slices, ice and cold water have
all been known to reduce swelling from crying or colds. Also,
Pond's has a product that looks and smells like cucumber slices.
Cucumber Eye Treatments ($8) is a jar of 24 pads saturated with
cucumber extract, aloe, camomile and green tea. Keep it in your
refrigerator and use as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always cry at weddings, and my eyes look red and awful.
</P>
<P>
   A: Retire to the nearest restroom for brief relief. Wet folded
paper towels or a washcloth in cold water, squeeze dry, then press
gently to your eyes for a few minutes. Then tilt your head back and
add Visine, Vaso Clear, Ocu Clear or Prefrin eyedrops to take the
red out. Repair eye makeup and head to the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I ate the whole thing _ the garlic pizza, that is _ and now
the boss wants to have a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is why we eat the parsley or carry little vials of those
powerful Rembrandt breath drops. If you've tried both of those and
you still smell like a Naples restaurant, try brushing your tongue,
an overlooked area of the body that often holds onto smelly
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've tried using lip liner but my mouth always ends up
looking like a kid's coloring book.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try a lip liner the same shade as your lips, not your
lipstick. The purpose of a liner is basically to keep lipstick from
bleeding off your lips and into the tiny creases around your mouth.
Lip liner is not to keep you coloring within the lines. (P.S. Most
men are scared silly by women with dark lip liner and paler
lipstick.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I hide dark circles under my eyes?
</P>
<P>
   A: One superior product is Touche Eclat (Radiant Touch). It
comes in a handy gold tube. Depress a button and the cream
concealer appears on a handy brush. It provides instant lightener
around the eyes with no messy fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the weather turns hot, perspiration melts the makeup off
my face.
</P>
<P>
   A: Several makeup companies, from Chanel to Origins, offer
lotions specially formulated to reduce facial perspiration and
shine. You may not feel cool as a cucumber, but your face will keep
its powdered, matte appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My skin gets dry and itchy the minute the central heat comes
on.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9 million Americans suffer chronic dry, itchy skin _
and not just in the winter. While your case may be a condition
requiring the attention of a dermatologist, you might try Aveeno
products first. Formulated with natural colloidal oatmeal, this
line includes Bath Treatment, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Moisturizing
Lotion and Shower and Bath Oil. They contain no fragrance, lanolin,
dyes or parabens that often cause allergic reactions for sensitive
skins. Look for Aveeno products at drug and mass merchandise
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need a face lift, but it's only a few weeks until my class
reunion. There's no time for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A: Estheticians can work wonders with today's micro-peels
(sometimes called lunch-hour peels), often accomplished with mild
fruit and vegetable acids. Inquire at your local day spa, facialist
or beauty salon. Strong peels, however, should never be undertaken
lightly. And don't have a facial at the last minute before a big
event as your skin might break out as toxins are released. If
you've never been big on skin care, merely drinking eight glasses
of water a day and using a good quality skin cream can give skin a
dewier appearance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STRESS-FREE TRAVEL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Airplane travel always dries my skin. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: If possible, leave your face makeup-free and apply a
nongreasy moisturizer once an hour. Many travelers swear by
Prescriptives In Flight Cream.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I travel abroad, my hotels never offer washcloths for
cleaning my face.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Clean in a Minute. Moisten the small mitt, then quickly
and gently remove all facial and eye makeup, including waterproof
mascara. Wash the mitt with soap, rinse, and it's ready for use
again. It is made of nonallergenic polyester cloth, and should last
through six months of constant use. The price is $19.95, including
shipping and handling. Phone 800-769-1396.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I prevent overpacking for a trip?
</P>
<P>
   Professional packers suggest that clients make a list of outfits
for each day they will be traveling. If there are special
activities, such as weddings or sports, or if you anticipate
changing for dinner in the evenings, include these occasions on the
list. Outfits may, of course, be worn more than once and even
laundered or dry-cleaned on longer trips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a perfect travel wardrobe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Save space in your suitcase by sticking to a color scheme so
you won't need as many shoes and can take one all-purpose coat.
Unless you will be under the closest fashion scrutiny, black shoes
will be fine with navy or brown.
</P>
<P>
   If you find it difficult to stick with a color scheme, try this
plan instead: Take four or five matching tops and bottoms and at
least three jackets that can go over any of the tops and bottoms.
For example, jackets in fuchsia, red and white could be worn over
ensembles of navy, black, brown and gray, giving you a dozen
different looks. Changes of scarves and jewelry add even more
looks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I keep my clothes from wrinkling in the suitcase?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there is the old standby method of hanging wrinkled
clothes in a steamy bathroom to dewrinkle. But some people swear by
clothes that incorporate the stretch fiber Dupont Lycra. They say
they throw clothes in a suitcase any old way, not even folded, and
the outfits arrive looking like a million bucks. Another travel
secret involves wearing stretch velvet three seasons of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've overstuffed my suitcase, and it won't close.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a common problem as most travelers take too many
clothes, rather than too few _ and more than a few are known to
overshop while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   If you anticipate this problem, pack your suitcase at least 12
hours ahead of time. Remember, carefully folded clothes take up
less room, plus you can always stuff small items into shoes or
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Pack as much as possible into your suitcase, then zip it up. If
your case is soft-sided and one side of the case is bulging, lay
the suitcase down on that side. Air will gradually be forced out of
the case, and you'll be able to pack more. If you start early
enough, you can repeat this procedure several times.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned shoppers always include a large fold-flat bag in their
luggage in case they happen on the kilim carpet of their dreams or
a camel saddle too elaborate to pass up.

NOTED DIRECTOR IS NAMED UW PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Jory, a figure of national stature in the American theater,
will leave his directorship of the Actors Theatre of Louisville
after 31 years to become a professor in the University of
Washington's School of Drama.
</P>
<P>
   Jory, 61, is scheduled to begin teaching both acting and
directing at UW in the fall. He is best known for creating the
Humana Festival of New American Plays, which debuted in 1979, and
was responsible for directing 31 world premieres in the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Jory had worked recently as an invited guest artist at UW and
that set in motion negotiations between the noted director and the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Nash Gates, chair of the School of Drama, was ecstatic
about the new hire, which she said was the ``most exciting'' in her
six years of directing the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People we have here are excellent, but Jon is a star,'' Gates
stressed. ``He is very well known nationally and very visible. This
school has been a well-kept secret _ we're ranked fourth nationally
by U.S. News &AMP; World Report. We know we're good, but now others
will have to pay more attention to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jory, whose name is synonymous with theater in Louisville, was
drawn to the UW position because of his interest in passing on the
legacy of what the Yale graduate has learned during his life in
theater, both in Louisville and at the Long Wharf Theatre in New
Haven, Conn., where he was a founding artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Jory was in rehearsal yesterday and unavailable for comment, but
released a statement about his new position: ``I have looked for a
place where I can work with the highest-caliber, like-minded people
to pass on what I've learned to the next generation. I found it
here at the University of Washington School of Drama.''
</P>
<P>
   At UW, the new professor will be joining his oldest daughter,
Jessica, who is a junior there studying theater. Jory's wife,
Marcia Dixcy Jory, is a costume designer and dramaturge.
</P>
<P>
   Jory is a figure of such national stature that his hiring
prompted a comment from UW President Richard McCormick, who said he
was ``thrilled'' by the addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arrival,'' McCormick said, ``is a testament to the stature
of the UW School of Drama throughout the theater and higher
education communities in this nation.''

<P>
   It took more than half a century, but the consumer model of the
Dick Tracy two-way wrist radio is almost here. With the relentless
miniaturization of technology, the time has come for wrist devices
that have function lists as long as your arm: depending on design,
they double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers,
computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice
recorders, automobile security keys, television and VCR remote
controls, health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global
Positioning System monitors, altimeters, games and simple
amusements. Some can even serve as admission passes for ski lifts
and museums. And, almost as an afterthought, they tell time.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example of the pocket watch, which first moved to
the wrist less than a century ago, more than a dozen different
types of electronic gadgets are strapping on straps and competing
for space on the narrow stretch of body between the hand and the
forearm. Until the time when such devices are implanted directly
into the brain, which is still some years away, the wrist is the
most convenient place on the body to wear technology. It does not
encumber the hand, does not intrude on most manual tasks, moves
easily in front of the eyes and is easier to reach than, say, the
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timex is interested in the real estate of the wrist,'' said
Susie Watson, a spokeswoman for Timex Corp. She declined to discuss
some of the specific ideas Timex has for the wrist, but she agreed
that it was the next big technology battleground. ``It's location,
location, location,'' she said. ``The wrist is the most exciting
and accessible place on the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Advances in circuit integration and power management have
enabled these devices to shrink from handheld sizes to belt-clip
sizes, and the move to the wrist is seen as just another inevitable
progression. As cell phones and other gadgets become even smaller,
attaching a wristband may become a necessity to keep tiny phones
and pagers from getting lost in a pocket or purse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this
month, both Motorola and Samsung demonstrated working prototypes of
a digital phone watch _ the closest thing yet to the fanciful
two-way wrist radio worn on the comics pages by Dick Tracy, whose
fondness for exotic gadgets predated James Bond by a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The two-way wrist radio made its debut in the Dick Tracy strip
in January 1946, said Max Allan Collins, a novelist and filmmaker
who wrote the strip from 1977 to 1993. Collins said the strip's
creator, Chester Gould, had later said he had originally wanted
Tracy to wear a wrist TV but that his editors had called the idea
too far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the nerdy Batman, who wore all his gadgets on a belt
strapped over his leotard, Dick Tracy always favored elegant
wrist-based technology that fit in more with business attire, said
Collins, who made it a point to visit the Consumer Electronics Show
every year he wrote the strip. He gave Tracy a wrist computer in
the early 1980s and a digital camera wristwatch soon afterward,
which the detective used to send pictures of fingerprints and crime
scenes wirelessly back to the police labs.
</P>
<P>
   (The always prescient Tracy invented TV surveillance cameras in
the early 1950s and investigated video piracy in the early 1980s.
In the early 1990s, he tracked bad guys by triangulating on their
cell phone calls, a technique that only recently has become popular
with the FBI.)
</P>
<P>
   The Samsung phone, expected to reach the market before the end
of the year, uses speech recognition to allow the wearer to
``dial'' the wristphone by speaking the numbers, and a tiny
speakerphone eliminates the need to use an earpiece. A Samsung
spokesman said it was safe to assume that the first units would
cost more than the average detective's per diem.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's version of the wrist phone also uses speech
recognition but requires an ear-bud speaker and a microphone cord.
Motorola said other prototypes of the wrist phone were being
tested, all based on Motorola's popular V Series of small digital
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The wrist computer made its real-world debut in 1994, the wrist
TV (in an ungainly size) in 1998 and the Casio TV Remote Control
Watch in 1999. Casio's beefy GPS watch arrived last year.
</P>
<P>
   Seiko-Epson built a prototype wrist TV in 1982, only 18 years
after Dick Tracy got one. Over the years, several other companies
have built prototypes, but to get a decent-size color screen (say,
2{ inches diagonally) and enough battery power to run it for an
hour or two, the video watches had to weigh more than a pound. Last
year, researchers at Microtune in Texas shrank a TV receiver and
tuner to microchip size, and new screen and battery technologies
could bring a wristwatch TV to market in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mark Knox, senior manager of Samsung's digital group,
said a more intriguing possibility was a wristwatch-style
television receiver and tuner that would attach to a pair of
high-resolution display eyeglasses. The wrist-TV-and-eyeglasses
combination could conceivably float the equivalent of a 60-inch
HDTV picture in front of the wearer's eyes. ``This is not a
this-year thing,'' Knox said, ``but it could be a next-year
thing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Timex teamed up in 1994 to combine the
functions of a Windows-based personal information manager with a
wristwatch, in the form of the Timex Data Link watch. Curiously,
Casio has been promoting its PC Unite watch as a ``world's first.''
Casio says the device will be able to synchronize with Microsoft
Outlook files and hold telephone numbers, schedules and to-do lists
_ just like the Timex Data Link. It can also exchange data with
Palm PDAs and Windows CE-based pocket PCs and even other PC Unite
watches.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 music players are taking different forms, ranging from
Sony's prototype Memory Stick MP3 player, about the size of a
cigarette lighter, to Samsung's prototype headphones with an MP3
player and Memory Stick slot. It was no surprise, then, to see a
couple of MP3 watches on display.
</P>
<P>
   Casio's Wrist Audio Player, one of three exotic watches the
company demonstrated, will be able to store about 30 minutes of MP3
music files. The files are downloaded to the watch from a PC. The
capacity of the MP3 watch doubles to about an hour for
lower-quality MP3 files, like audio books. The Casio Wrist Audio
Player will be available in the spring at about $250.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung also demonstrated an MP3 watch prototype, along with an
MP3 telephone that held an entire audio CD's worth of music,
although the company appeared more proud of what it said was the
world's first TV pocket phone. The TV phone has a 1.8-inch color
screen that can display VHF and UHF broadcast channels in 256
colors.
</P>
<P>
   A Sony spokesman noted that its tiny MP3 player could easily be
moved to the wrist. He also speculated that wrist-based MP3 players
might also double as voice recorders in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Casio's Data Bank Camera Watch includes a tiny black-and-white
digital camera that takes low-resolution images. The camera stores
up to 100 postage-stamp-size images that can be viewed on the watch
face or transferred to a computer or small printer via an infrared
link. The most common use for this watch, a Casio spokesman
predicted, will be to snap pictures of people's faces to affix to
the back of their business cards. Look for it in May at about $200.
</P>
<P>
   Seiko Instruments, which introduced a wrist computer called the
Ruputer in 1998, has a new ``thermic'' watch that is powered by
body heat instead of batteries. As soon as the watch is removed
from the wrist it goes into power-saving hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Often forgotten in this vaudeville of tricks is the fact that
some new watches also tell time with atomic precision. Atomic
precision these days means that the watch will neither gain nor
lose a second in some 20 million years, which more than covers the
probable warranty period. Today's atomic clocks are so accurate
that they have to be adjusted periodically to account for
fluctuations in Earth's rotation. There is no such thing as an
atomic wristwatch yet, but the next best thing is a radio-receiver
watch that picks up the WWVB radio signal broadcast from the
National Institute of Standards and Technology. Such wristwatches
use the radio signal to adjust and maintain atomic time, even
adjusting for daylight time, and the date.
</P>
<P>
   Timex has a new technology called Flextime, built into its
Beepwear line of pager watches, that automatically sets and keeps
the correct time even as the wearer changes time zones. When the
pager is turned on and is in the paging coverage area, Skytel keeps
track of Coordinated Universal Time, used by GPS satellites, which
are in turn maintained by the atomic clocks operated by the
government. Every four minutes or so, the pager gets a signal with
the precise time and date. Once a day, any time drift is corrected,
to the second. The Beepwear Pro watch is about $175, plus about $10
monthly for local paging service.
</P>
<P>
   The original Beepwear watches used to be so bulky that wearing
one was like wearing half a tennis ball on your wrist, but newer
models have been streamlined. They can receive news, sports and
weather updates, and keep track of more than 100 contacts.
</P>
<P>
   A new watch made by Swatch even tries to set a new universal
time standard it calls ``Internet Time, which divides the day into
1,000 ``beats'' of 86.4 seconds each. The center of time, 0 in
Internet time, is midnight at the Swatch headquarters in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Will Internet Time ever catch on? That sounds like a question
for Timex's TMX Mystery Answer Watch. Timex has shrunk the
venerable magic eight-ball into a wristwatch, with 14 random
enigmatic replies. Will the stock market crash today? ``Maybe.''
``Can't Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other, slightly more practical, hand, Timex has a line of
Rush watches that calculate the user's heart rate during workouts.
They also have up to 10 preset timers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark of Fitness Inc. won an award at the show for its
Wristwatch-Style Blood Pressure Monitor MF-73, as did Oregon
Scientific for its Pulsemeter Wristwatch PM-138, which uses an
optical pulse sensor to measure heart rate with a mere touch of a
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have developed prototypes of wrist-based blood
glucose monitors for diabetics, but these are still several years
away from practical consumer use.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch watches are better known for fashion than for technology,
but the company regularly attempts to push technology ahead.
Indeed, it had an early and unfortunately ungainly version of the
cell-phone watch some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be onto something with its Swatch Access technology,
which blends ``smart card'' digital storage with a timepiece. At
some ski resorts, the wearer of an Access watch can purchase and
download ski lift passes into the watch. The wearer points an arm
at a Swatch scanner and turnstiles open, sort of an E-ZPass system
for skiers. The microchip in the Access watch can also be used for
storing admission tickets to museums or concerts, or as a hotel
key.
</P>
<P>
   As it assumes a greater role in the technology world, the wrist
may also become more vulnerable to repetitive stress injuries. Of
course, Dick Tracy packed a lot onto his wrist for 54 years without
problems.

By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question I wanted to hate him. How could you not? You
hear the story: a Dallasite gives up his techie job to live in a
house for a year, legally changes his name to DotComGuy, never
leaves the property, lives exclusively off the Internet _ and you
think, ``Hello, dork.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the details are explained _ he'll make almost a
hundred grand from corporate sponsors, his every move will be
Webcasted by 18 cameras, with only a 20-second delay between his
``Truman Show''-like real life and what you see on the Net _ you
alter your opinion only slightly: ``Hello, market-savvy dork.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiply that by a Cynicism Factor of 9 (the result of spending
your days around bitter, soulless PR-hating journalists) and you
have my hatred level, achieved before ever meeting Mr. ComGuy. I
decided that we needed a article that mercilessly mocked DCG.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas every day around here,'' DCG says as I
walk into his north Dallas living room. (For security reasons,
everyone entering the house takes a Scout's Honor pledge not to
give any hints as to its location _ not hard for me, since I
circled the area lost for 25 minutes.) Because he started with
nothing 'cept a laptop in his abode, he's had to order everything
online, so all the stuff is new, from his couch (tan) to his shoes
(Nike cross-trainers) to his desktop Gateway computer system
($7K-plus), which is easier to purchase when you're spending
against your corporate salary. (Which he makes in full if he lasts
the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Or when you've got Melissa, an exec from Mall.com, sitting in
your living room, helping you spend $1,231.35 on even more goodies.
She plays Net hostess, showing me what I look like on a Webcast
(bald and fat), and pulls up the DotComGuy chat room where tens of
thousands of ``viewers'' worldwide go to chat about all things DCG.
The viewers can hear me, since anyone who enters the Dotcompound
(argh ... the puns!) has a microphone attached. The biggest
question of the moment, of course, is ``Who's the bald fat guy?''
</P>
<P>
   We move to the patio. Leaves fall into the creek, a woodpecker
taps an oak tree, DotComGuy sips a glass a grapefruit juice. ``I
feel great,'' he says. ``Last night was the first eight consecutive
hours of sleep since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   He started Jan. 1, of course, and sees little chance of going
stir-crazy by December. ``This is going to be a fun year,'' he
says. If the media attention and surprise-guest drop-bys continue _
Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent stopped by, as did a
live band and local comedians for a party _ you believe he's right.
But having fun isn't what this was about, right? It's a ridiculous
marketing gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   DCG says he understands why people would think that this
nonevent event was concocted by an evil marketing focus group, but
says it started out simply as an argument with kin during the
holidays. ``It was just a joke,'' he says about his December '98
argument. ``I told my brothers that you can buy everything (you
need) online. They didn't believe me. Finally, I said I could live
for a whole year without leaving the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he forgot the moment until 10 months later _ Oct. 3 _
when he had to spend the entire day shopping with his parents. ``I
said, `This entire day was so ridiculous. We could've bought all
this stuff online.' '' Dad, 74, and Mom, 64, didn't believe techie
son, 26. DotComGuy said, OK, looks like I need to put up or shut
up. A week later, after communing with techie friends, he
formulated plans, prepared news releases, targeted online
sponsorships. The rest is not yet history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, DotComGuy says that one of the benefits of his online
housesitting is that his community of ``users and viewers'' makes
modern market testing seem silly. ``We're not just promoting
e-commerce, we've created a community of people who actually use
the products,'' then immediately get online and discuss what sites
are doing right or wrong. ``You won't have to rely on research
studies or focus groups (for your product) _ you get immediate
feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   We take a tour inside, checking out some of the cool toys he's
purchased (''Those are from Neiman's; everyone thinks I just buy
from sponsors, but they're not a sponsor. I just liked the
stuff.'') and play a quick game of Hide From the Cameras. We end up
downstairs, where Melissa has been chatting online with
users/viewers. DCG says, ``Anyone have a question for the
Star-Telegram?'' After about 30 seconds, questions start scrolling
up the screen. I don't get to answer all of them _ although I
should say to ``julie99,'' yes, I am cute _ but I have to admit
it's pretty neat having people from all over the world asking your
take on new media and adding your paper's Web site to their
bookmarks so they can remember to read the story.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, I leave DotComGuy to his cyber dungeon, feeling a
bit wimpish. I was so unconfrontational, so unlike a capital-J
Journalist. Still, he's not doing anything, but so what? Like
politicians do? Like editors do? And his desire for this project to
be family-oriented is touching in an old-school, late-20th-century
sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my conversion brings up another point. It took
meeting him face-to-face to overcome my doubts. In other words,
it's still easier to meet halfway if I'm not sitting by myself,
watching DCG on a computer screen. There's a deep thought there
somewhere. Send me an e-mail if you figure it out.

A VIRTUAL NOBEL PRIZE MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Sweden)  (Circuits) 
(DW) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next year is the 100th anniversary of Alfred B. Nobel's ultimate
merit badges. After a century of Einstein, Bohr, Churchill,
Pasternak, Enders, Watson, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama and other
laureates, what will the world's most prestigious awards
institution do for an encore? Thankfully, the Nobel Foundation is
not expanding its categories to include political consulting or
synchronized swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the foundation is hoping to make the Nobel Prizes more
than just a spectacular credential by building on its already
formidable Web site (www.nobel.se) to create the Nobel Electronic
Museum in 2001. There will be expanded interviews with Nobel
laureates, a science and technology section highlighting practical
applications that have resulted from Nobel-winning basic research,
and a Nobel Internet Library of lectures, books and posters.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more nontechnical information to make laureates'
scientific research understandable to nonspecialists. Of particular
interest is the Wallenberg Young Scholars program, a new feature
using interactive multimedia documents that will be geared to high
school and college students.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prize rules, the nominations themselves and the
reports to the selection committees are kept secret for 50 years.
``We are presently going through the archives for 1901-1949 and
will in a year's time provide information about who nominated who
during that time period,'' Dr. Nils Ringertz of Stockholm, director
of the Electronic Nobel Museum, recently said in an e-mail message.
``Nobel laureates have been invited to write short essays,
educational documents and other material for the e-museum. Some 20
have already contributed or agreed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributions include a new short story, ``Loot,'' by Nadine
Gordimer, the 1991 literature winner, at
www.nobel.se/laureates/literature-1991-shortstory.html. The online
autobiographies address one persistent problem: the difficulty in
relating Nobel Prizes in the sciences to the institutions that
truly deserve a share of the credit. Universities like to brag
about the number of Nobel laureates on their faculties, but that
information may not be of much use to prospective students,
especially if the professors were lured there in part by promises
they would not have to do much teaching, and long after they had
done their cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   Ringertz described the computerized autobiographies as
scientific genealogy trees. ``You can see how top scientists have
moved from one center of excellence to another during their
careers,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of individual awards are rich in links. For instance,
the Chemistry Prize for 1996 went to the discoverers of a group of
giant carbon molecules that resemble the geodesic domes designed by
the late architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Look up the award
(www.nobel.se/laureates/chemistry-1996.html), and you can link to a
3-D site, the Fullerene Gallery, along with a free plug-in, that
shows you rotating fullerenes, or buckyballs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also omissions. Apparently for copyright reasons,
only the acceptance speeches by the literature Nobelists are
online. So one can read Faulkner's acclaimed acceptance speech, and
Toni Morrison's, but not the Peace Prize speeches by the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. or Elie Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Prizes are often controversial, both for who wins (Peace
Prizes to Henry Kissinger, Le Duc Tho of Vietnam and Yasser Arafat)
and who does not (Tolstoy, Ibsen, Henry James, Proust and Nabokov
for literature, and, so far, Jimmy Carter for peace). But the Nobel
Web site has essays that are surprisingly forthright about these
vagaries.
</P>
<P>
   One such essay, ``Mahatma Gandhi: the Missing Laureate,'' offers
a glimpse into a decision that was obvious only in hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 1960, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded almost
exclusively to Europeans and Americans,'' the essay says. ``In
retrospect, the horizon of the Norwegian Nobel Committee may seem
too narrow. Gandhi was very different from earlier laureates. He
was no real politician or proponent of international law, not
primarily a humanitarian relief worker and not an organizer of
international peace congresses. He would have belonged to a new
breed of laureates.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a postscript on Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1948.
After the Nobel committee decided against a posthumous award, they
held the 1948 Peace Prize in reserve and then, a year later, voted
not to spend the prize money. ``What many thought should have been
Mahatma Gandhi's place on the list of laureates was silently but
respectfully left open.''

Dr. Dre/``Dr. Dre 2001'' (Aftermath/Interscope)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dre's 1992 groundbreaking ``The Chronic'' introduced Snoop Dogg
on the classic track ``Nuthin' but a G-Thang,'' pioneered the West
Coast deep- funk production style and still stands as the blueprint
for much of today's rap. On his oft-delayed new effort _ rightfully
billed as the sequel to ``The Chronic'' _ Dre goes back to where it
all started _ catchy choruses, swaying funk grooves, lonesome
keyboards, lush strings, syncopated bass and the lazy, familiar
drawl that moved records by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Dre is reunited here with one-time protege Snoop on a number of
tracks, including the slo-mo raveup ``Still D.R.E.,'' while his
more recent find, Detroit rapper Eminem, takes the mic for the
album's highlights, ``Forgot About Dre'' and ``What's the
Difference.'' One of the few rap albums with shelf life. 3 1/2

   Sir Simon Rattle, Birmingham Contemporary Music
Group/``Wonderful Town'' (EMI Classics)
</P>
<P>
   Improving on perfection is a tall order. But in some ways it's
achieved with this splendid recording of the classic 1953 musical
about rube Midwestern sisters out to tame 1930s Manhattan. Kim
Criswell, as older sibling Ruth, lays on the brass and sass as
thickly as the role's originator, Rosalind Russell, without
smothering the quick-witted lyrics. Her counterpart, Audra
McDonald, perhaps America's most versatile young female vocalist,
delivers playful, crystal-clear renditions of near- standards like
``A Little Bit in Love.'' Thomas Hampson, who owns one of the
tenderest big male voices around, highlights a top-rank supporting
cast that also includes Brent Barrett and Rodney Gilfry. Sir Simon
Rattle's conducting makes the score quiver with humor and Jazz Age
excitement on those big-shouldered, Gershwin-esque melodies. From a
poignantly languorous ``Ohio'' to a comically red-hot ``Conga,''
this is a disc so good, you'll only wish you could see it fully
mounted on stage. 4 stars

   Lori Carson/``Stars'' (Restless)
</P>
<P>
   We've never been able to figure out why Carson remains
criminally undernoticed, but this disc should only continue to
build the case against the public's felony disinterest. The
sometime Golden Palominos chanteuse here serves up another set of
exquisitely wistful, sometimes edgy pop meditations on
relationships. The opening track, ``16 Days,'' is a stunner, a
delicate recounting of a lover's remorse and reunion to come.
``Take Your Time'' is a sweet, slightly upbeat song of patience and
love, while ``Breathe'' wonders how a lover will do so when ``all
the oxygen is used up,'' a mantric metaphor for much deeper stuff,
set to droning strings and Miles-ian muted trumpet. ``Treasure''
closes this beautiful disc wonderfully, with much fabulous stuff in
between. 3 1/2 stars &QL;

   Shivaree/``I Oughta Give You a Shot in the Head for Making Me
Live in This Dump''(Capitol/Odeon)
</P>
<P>
   The Faulknerian title gives some sense of the white-trash
sensibilities of Valley-born singer Ambrosia Parsley (she swears
that's her birth name) and her band of solid rock/country/blues
veterans. This is slow, slinky, sometimes dirgey stuff, front-porch
funnies and swampy songs of lost souls. Minus the hilarious stories
Parsley tells on stage, her coquettish voice here is closer to
Margot Timmins of Cowboy Junkies or Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star,
but with a ton of odd little production tricks. ``Arlington Girl,''
``Goodnight Moon'' and ``Oh No'' are particular highlights. A
shivaree, by the way, is a sort of cowboy clatter of a serenade,
played on pots and pans. This sounds better and quieter than that,
by a fair long ways, though it's equally charming. 3 stars &QL;

   Guy Clark/``Cold Dog Soup'' (Sugar Hill)
</P>
<P>
   While respect for growling singer-songwriter Clark is an article
of faith in the church of alternative country, there are those of
us who've waited mighty long for the low-key craftsman to cook up a
collection as consistent as his out-of-print, 1981 masterpiece
``The South Coast of Texas.'' ``Cold Dog Soup'' is the closest he's
come in two decades. Key selections include the satiric title howl
(``Ain't no money in poetry, That's what sets the poet free, I've
had all the freedom I can stand''), a warm and amusingly observed
tribute to an Ozark fiddle player (``Sis Draper'') and another one
of his exquisitely detailed anthems to Lone Star life (``Red
River''). Some cutesy novelty songs _ the self-explanatory ``Men
Will Be Boys'' and, no kidding, a singing penny ditty _ take little
away from this satisfyingly solid album. And if you like this, you
can can hear most of the majestic ``South Coast'' and other prime
Clark cuts on the 1995 Philo compilation ``Craftsman.'' 3 1/2

   Barbie, the doll that once said, ``Math class is tough,'' has
found a new way to skip strenuous schoolwork. She just didn't
register for class.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Mattel released the Barbie PC, a pink Barbie-themed
computer for girls. But to the dismay _ or possibly the delight _
of some critics, the $599 Barbie PC comes loaded with a little more
than half of the educational software found on Mattel's companion
computer for boys, the Hot Wheels PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised how different the software packages were,''
said Carol J. Burger, an immunologist and coordinator for the
Science and Gender Equity Program at Virginia Tech. Dr. Burger
first noticed the discrepancy in October when she saw newspaper
advertisements for the computers. ``It absolutely supports the
stereotype that girls are only interested in fashion and boys are
interested in more intellectual pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the software titles offered with the Hot Wheels PC but not
the Barbie PC were BodyWorks, a program that teaches human anatomy
and three-dimensional visualization, and a thinking game called
Logical Journey of the Zoombinis.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burger argued that logic programs are especially beneficial
for girls. ``One of the things girls have always been faulted for
is not having the creativity to see more than one right answer so
that they make lousy scientists and engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel denies that the distribution of software is unfair to
girls. ``In no way did we intend to slight them by withholding any
content that was on the Hot Wheels PC,'' said Dana Henry, a Mattel
spokeswoman. She said that the company wanted the two computers to
have roughly the same amount of software but said that the larger
number of popular Barbie programs, like Barbie Fashion Designer and
Detective Barbie, left less room for educational titles on the
girls' computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Barbie software hit the market there wasn't really any
software for girls,'' she said. ``We dispelled the myth that girls
didn't like using the computer or playing games.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bogue, the director of the Women in Engineering Program
at Penn State, said: ``I think that's an easy way out for Mattel to
say that. I think it's a cop-out. They really are showing lowered
expectations for girls and pandering to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost since Barbie's creation in 1959, the doll's retrograde
teen-age hostess character and Brobdingnagian anatomical
proportions have made it a lightning rod for criticism. In July
1992, Mattel released a talking Barbie doll that used the phrase
``math class is tough.'' Under fire from critics, including the
American Association of University Women, Mattel eliminated the
phrase from Barbie's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Haag, the director of research for the AAUW's Education
Foundation, said that while girls do buy popular Barbie programs
they also show broader interests that aren't reflected in
girls-only titles. ``Girls' and boys' interests in software tend to
converge a great deal so it's not necessary to pander to what we
think girls might like.''
</P>
<P>
   The omission of Logical Journey of the Zoombinis was
particularly instructive, Ms. Haag said, because it was ``a great
example of a game that appealed particularly to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Scot Osterweil, one of the creators of the Zoombinis program,
said he was taken aback by the game's exclusion. ``There's lots of
hard rigorous software that boys and girls like equally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since first spying the computer ads, Dr. Burger has spoken about
the Barbie PC at conferences and has posted messages to a mailing
list for women in science, urging others to express their concerns
to Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henry said Mattel has received only one complaint. Although
Mattel would not release sales figures for the computers, Ms. Henry
said the Barbie PC had sold about the same number as the Hot Wheels
PC.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burger won't be buying one, however. ``I did buy both my
grand-daughters toy trucks,'' she said. ``And little electric
screwdrivers to take them apart.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAINS VERSUS BEAUTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie PC from Mattel comes with more software than Mattel's
Hot Wheels PC does. But as the following comparison shows, it has
fewer educational programs. &QL;

TUNING IN TO RADIOS OF PASSING CARS, AND PASSING THE DATA ALONG
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Like easy listening? Classic rock? Howard Stern? Next time you
drive to a concert arena or down a freeway, your car radio could be
transmitting some information of its own: your listening tastes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Mobiltrak, a company based in
Birmingham, Ala., has been marketing a device that finds out what
radio stations people are listening to inside their cars.
Mobiltrak's clients include concert arenas, shopping malls and car
dealerships, all of whom pay to install the shoebox-size devices at
the entrances of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor works by picking up signals from a car radio's
oscillator, the part of the radio that tunes into the station. The
data is recorded and sent via modem to Mobiltrak, which then sends
an e-mail report to its clients on a daily or weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use Mobiltrak's device to determine whether the money
they spend on radio advertising is being spent in the right places.
Knowing the stations customers listen to as they drive in is one
way of finding this out, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to spend advertising dollars in Boston to
encourage people to come see Aerosmith, we want to determine which
radio stations have the best opportunity of reaching an Aerosmith
listener,'' said Mike Ferrel, president and chief executive of SFX
Entertainment, a major concert promoter and venue owner and
operator.
</P>
<P>
   He said SFX had paid Mobiltrak ``a number in the high five
figures'' for a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mobiltrak user, Lenny Sage, vice president of the
Universal City Nissan car dealership in Los Angeles, said, ``We
recognize that people channel surf, but with the amount of sources
we get on a weekly basis, about three to four thousand, we think
we're getting a good picture of what they listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Mobiltrak clients include radio stations themselves, which
have commissioned the company to install monitors along major
freeways and other heavily trafficked roads. ``We've wired the
entire market in Los Angeles, Phoenix and Atlanta,'' said Lucius
Stone, vice president for sales and marketing at Mobiltrak.
</P>
<P>
   Mobiltrak (www.mobiltrak.com) is not the first to monitor
people's radio choices. The British Broadcasting Corp.'s television
licensing group, for example, deploys so-called detector vans to
drive down residential streets and detect oscillator signals from
Televisions inside homes. The group then verifies with its database
that each homeowner has a license for the television set, which is
required in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mobiltrak works without the cars' occupants even being aware
that their listening habits are being monitored. That has raised
concerns among some privacy experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice is deplorable, but like so many other laws
relating to privacy, there are all sorts of loopholes in wiretap
laws,'' said David Banisar, a lawyer with Privacy International, a
privacy watchdog group based in London that focuses on surveillance
by government and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Mobiltrak and its clients maintain that the monitoring device
performs a random sweep of car radios, but does not identify the
car or its occupants, and therefore does not infringe on people's
privacy. ``It's not personal, it's generic,'' Ferrel said. ``We get
information that a car is listening to 97.5, not that the person is
listening to 97.5.''
</P>
<P>
   A random sampling of radio station ``hits'' might be considered
relatively harmless, and not much different from an Internet site's
recording the number of hits it gets. But couple the monitoring
device with a digital camera that reads license plates, critics
say, and these companies will be able to match individual car
owners to their favorite radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the opportunity and the economic motivation to match
the license to the listening data,'' said Jason Catlett, president
of Junkbusters Corp., a consumer privacy Web site
(www.junkbusters.com). ``This would be of enormous interest to
radio stations, which are paid by advertisers according to their
audience demographics. Imagine if they could prove that more than
50 percent of their audience makes over $75,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that the information could be used in the wrong
way. ``This opens an enormous can of worms where the commercial
pressure will be to refine who is listening to what station at what
time and in what place,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, professor of law
at Fordham University.

<P>
   VERSAILLES, France _ The gardens of Versailles, the result of
centuries of grooming and planning to satisfy royal whim, look more
like a logging camp these days than a place where nobles in satin
pumps liked to stroll.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is striking. In the English gardens, Marie
Antoinette's much-loved Virginia tulip tree, planted in 1783, went
down, its soil-clotted roots ripping a hole in the lawn big enough
to turn into a swimming pool. By the Temple of Love, a Corsican
pine planted for Napoleon in 1810 shattered as it crashed to the
ground. Elsewhere, 10,000 trees lie in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   But Versailles' officials say the destruction caused by the two
fierce windstorms that roared across Europe over the Christmas
holidays may actually turn out to be a good thing for the park,
speeding efforts to restore it to its finest days under the
extravagant Louis XIV, who was king from 1643 to 1715.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that much of the park, built on a drained swamp,
should have been replanted 30 or 40 years ago. Many of the trees on
Versailles' 1,500 acres were too tall and in some cases weak from
age and disease. The garden's first architect, Andre Le Notre,
foresaw trees no more than about 60 feet high. But many had grown
to more than 120 feet, and with roots close to the surface because
the water table is so high, they were particularly vulnerable to
high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a lack of funds and a general disinclination to do
anything too abrupt that might upset the public had slowed major
replanting efforts. Even when park officials had to replace 182
diseased chestnut trees, their press operation went into high gear
to explain why it was necessary. ``The storms of 1999, however,
have forced everyone's hand,'' said Hubert Astier, the president of
the state-run museum and park. ``A lot of work has to be done. The
only real issue is getting the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas storms toppled trees throughout the park, from the
groves carefully laid out near the chateau where footmen once raced
ahead of the king to make sure the fountains were on, to the more
woody areas surrounding the Trianon and the Petit Trianon. One of
the park's chief gardeners, Alain Baraton, likened the destruction
to a World War I battlefield. ``It actually looks like Verdun,''
Baraton said. ``Every space is touched. All kinds of trees are
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The government will pay some of the nearly $40 million that
repairing the chateau and the grounds is expected to cost, and the
public will help as well. What will be done with the funds,
however, is already decided. Officials developed a program for the
park nine years ago, after a 1990 storm took down 1,600 trees. The
plan aims to restore much of the park to the way it was under Louis
XIV, the flamboyant Sun King, who hovered over every intricate
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were at their peak under Louis XIV, and have never
since been so carefully, and expensively, maintained. In fact,
major renovations of the gardens have taken place about every
hundred years, usually spurred by fierce storms. As a result, a
messy collection of partial restorations accreted on top of
changing royal visions. Louis XIV himself redid parts of the park
more than once in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan that was developed by a committee of 20
experts generated little controversy. Restorations in France
generally aim to go back to the earliest version that can be
authenticated through plans, documents or paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really wasn't much argument about restoring the garden
that Louis XIV built,'' said Olivier de Rohan Chabot, the president
of the Friends of Versailles Association, a nonprofit group that
raises funds for the museum and the park. The committee generally
agreed to restore it the way Le Notre designed it and, over time,
to eliminate some of the overgrown trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the restoration will not be totally true to the original
plans. The Grove of Apollo's Baths created under Louis XVI will not
change, because the committee found his design for the grove too
beautiful to ignore. Parts of the gardens around the Trianons,
really developed by Louis XVI, will be restored to his vision,
because the Sun King spent little time on them.
</P>
<P>
   Other treasures from the Louis XIV era will be restored. The
current Queen's Garden (a not very exciting place) will be remade
into the intricate maze garden designed for Louis XIV. Under him,
the garden contained 39 little fountains, with painted statues of
animals from Aesop's fables. It was used to teach the royal
children about morality.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the intricate hedge work will also be restored, as young
trees return the gardens to their original proportions. What is
truly regrettable, officials said, is that a slower replanting
would have kept the modern apartment buildings that surround the
park out of view. That is no longer possible. ``It could take us 10
years to be able to keep the modern world from view again,'' Astier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trees like the ones planted for Marie Antoinette and Napoleon
will be replaced, species for species. The problem is that with
more than 60 percent of France's forests damaged by the storm,
getting young trees may be difficult and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, however, the storm did little harm to the garden's
statues, though in some places trees crashed through walls and
there was damage to the chateau's roof and some windows.
Nonetheless, the basic structures remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, in some ways, a polite storm,'' Astier said. ``In one
place, there was a tree that fell, but the branches parted just in
time and laid on either side of a statue, without injuring it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Louis XIII who first began a garden at Versailles. He
would ride out from Paris because the hunting was good and spend
the night in a local tavern. Soon, however, he wanted more than a
straw bed and built a small chateau.
</P>
<P>
   His son Louis XIV had the grander vision for Versailles and
eventually moved the French court there. By his early 20s, he was
something of a 17th-century jet-setter. He concentrated on the
gardens, creating a sort of amusement park, with groves and
fountains, intended to delight and surprise. He held huge parties
that went on for days, each day bringing a new spectacle: plays,
ballets, equestrian parades, fireworks. Designed to amuse, the
spectacles were also an exercise in prestige, a display of his
power and riches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the garden reflected the thinking of the time. Unlike
medieval gardens, which were islands of civilization in a chaotic
world, the Versailles gardens were designed as a monument to the
human hand on the landscape. Every vista led to infinity, as did
Louis XIV's view of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   It was not land that was particularly suited to such a garden.
No matter. It was flattened and drained. Earth was moved to create
terraces and embankments. Lakes and canals were used to drain
mosquito-infested bogs. Trees were imported from all over the
world. Those that survived were submitted to rigorous pruning and
shaping, like everything else in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   In Louis XIV's later years, the garden became less ostentatious.
Much of the trelliswork was done away with, banks of grass replaced
stone parapets, and gardens became more natural looking. Louis XV _
whether because of a lack of interest, a lack of money or a new
taste for the more natural _ let the garden continue to grow out of
its original rigid format. By the 1740s, many trees were in a poor
state, overgrown and abused by several exceptionally cold and
stormy winters.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis XV had trouble making decisions. It was left to his
successor, Louis XVI, to bring the ax down on the gardens, which he
quickly did, beginning in 1774, opting for cheaper local trees:
oaks, poplars, maples and silver birches.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years later, the gardens were in the hands of Napoleon
III and overgrown trees were once again being replaced, when
another storm accelerated the pace of those renovations.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, say Versailles officials, another restoration
should have begun. But there was no money and no clamor for such an
event. It took the storms that bracketed the last decade to make
those alterations a certainty.

BEGINNING OF TIME: JAN. 4, 1980

<P>
   Q. Why do all computers think time began on Jan. 4, 1980?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many computers think that time began on Jan. 4, 1980, because
computer programmers told them so. Although a spokeswoman at
Microsoft confirmed that Jan. 4, 1980, is the first valid date that
certain computers were instructed to recognize, any reason for
choosing that particular date wasn't readily available.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer has an error serious enough to cause it to lose
its settings and return to its default state, that is the only date
it remembers in its BIOS software. (Since not all computers have
the same BIOS code, some machines, like Macintoshes, will reset to
a different date.)
</P>
<P>
   BIOS (the letters stand for basic -input/output system) is a bit
of software that is an essential part of the computer. It is often
encoded onto the chip that holds the computer's read-only memory
and is sometimes referred to as the ROM BIOS.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS contains the code that controls the computer's hard
drive, screen, keyboard and other basic elements.
</P>
<P>
   Many older computers have the BIOS information firmly encoded
into read-only memory that cannot be upgraded, and that probably
caused problems with those computers in recognizing the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many newer machines, however, come with what is called a flash
BIOS; the BIOS is stored on a flash memory chip, which can usually
be upgraded with newer versions of the BIOS software.
</P>
<P>
   Users experiencing BIOS problems with Windows may want to look
at Microsoft's Web page on the topic at
www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/white/rtbios/rtbios9.htm.

   Power napping, in simpler times called a siesta, does not
require a king-size bed. A reclining chair, or maybe a floor mat
will do. Dr. James B. Maas, the author of ``Power Sleep'' (Villard
Books, 1998), says that even people who are not sleep-deprived can
benefit from a short daily nap. Napping, he says, increases
efficiency, reduces accidents and increases alertness. The best
plan: right after lunch (no coffee, please), set the timer for 30
minutes maximum and close your eyes. This is more easily achieved
in a home office, but some companies are increasingly accepting of
employee naps.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If a back-to-the-future project succeeds, high-tech audio may
bring to life some sounds of the past _ voices from the 19th
century recorded on fragile cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Syracuse University are developing a laser-based
device to play some of the world's oldest sound recordings, which
date from 1885. The researchers have not yet heard some of them at
all for fear of damaging their fragile surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings, part of a voluminous collection at the
university, are on brittle wax and celluloid cylinders that could
be harmed by jewel-tipped needles. The laser, which uses a weak but
highly focused light source, is a gentler way to extract the sound,
which then can be recorded digitally or on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Among the treasures in the collection are arias by the tenor
Enrico Caruso, patriotic marches, political speeches and the voice
of Pope Leo XIII, born in 1810. There are also many popular
vaudeville routines, which document harsh, freely expressed
stereotypes about immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also includes one cylinder, not yet played, that
may be extremely rare: it is labeled as the voice of the fabled
coloratura Adelina Patti in her prime, in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   The project to rerecord these sounds without damaging the
cylinders and present them to a larger public is being financed by
a grant of about $158,000 from the Institute of Museum and Library
Services, which awarded the money to the university to develop the
prototype of the laser player.
</P>
<P>
   Wax cylinders played on early phonographs were popular in the
1890s; people lined up to don stethoscope-like devices to listen to
coin-operated phonographs. Syracuse University has 22,000 of the
cylinders in its Belfer Audio Laboratory and Archive, which Susan
T. Stinson, the curator, called ``the largest known collection
outside the Library of Congress.'' The cylinders provide a powerful
glimpse of life at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material is in part a catalog of stereotypes,'' she said.
``It includes skits and popular music that are socially
unacceptable today. The Irish, Italians, Germans, blacks, Jews,
women _ all are mocked in popular songs that people took home and
thought nothing of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stinson said she hoped that the new laser player would one
day not only let Syracuse safely record its library's holdings but
also offer the service to other cylinder owners.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William A. Penn, an adjunct professor of electrical
engineering and computer science at Syracuse University, is
directing the design and building of the laser prototype. Penn has
his work cut out for him because the cylinders he will bring to
life are acoustic recordings. To make them, people talked or sang
into acoustic horns, and there was nary a noise filter in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cylinders have shrunk, and the grooves waver. The
laser beam will need to seek the bottom of these grooves and stay
there, no easy thing when riding the ups and downs of grooves
within a spiral that is something like a Slinky. Further
complicating things, there is lots of what Penn calls gunk in the
grooves, and the cylinders were recorded at various speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Penn's laser device takes up a 4-by-8 tabletop, but he
plans to shrink it, at least to something that will fit easily
through a door. To read the cylinder, the helium-neon laser beam
bounces off the hills and dales in the grooves of the cylinder,
which alters the frequency. The machine detects these small changes
in frequency to reproduce the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Many antique recordings survive, said Jay Allison, co-executive
producer of ``Lost and Found Sound,'' a yearlong look at the sounds
of the 20th century that is being broadcast on National Public
Radio. When people began to send in their recordings to his
program, Allison said, he found that they provided an evocative
window onto the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our contact with the past is through visual imagery,
and vivid as it is, sound is more powerful,'' Allison said. An avid
collector of antique recordings, Professor Allen Koenigsberg, said:
``I'm glad the new millennium is paying some tribute to what was
discovered in the last centuries of the old one. Now that they have
the funds to develop the laser, other people will hear these
marvels, perhaps in CD format.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg, who owns about 6,000 cylinders, is the author of
``Edison Cylinder Records, 1889-1912'' (A.P.M. Press, 1988) and is
a classics professor at Brooklyn College.
</P>
<P>
   The wax cylinders were a surprise hit for Edison and his rivals
at the Columbia Phonograph Co., Koenigsberg said, both of whom
intended the equipment for dictation, not music. ``They made a
fortune,'' he said, ``selling about two million cylinders a month
in the early 1900s.'' But the cylinders had much wasted space
because of their shape and were eventually replaced by flat discs
and cheaper, spring-driven gramophones that cost about $20 to $25,
a price that made the recordings popular in people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   At Syracuse University, staff members are eyeing many of the wax
cylinders in the collection, waiting to hear what may be revealed.
The recording thought to be by Patti is among the ones that has yet
to be heard. It is in a case with a slip of paper, on which are the
handwritten words, ``Adelina Patti, 1895.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patti is not known to have made any commercial cylinders,''
said John Harvith, co-author of ``Edison, Musicians and the
Phonograph'' (Greenwood Press, 1987) and a historian and an
administrator at the university. ``This is quite possibly the only
cylinder of her singing in her prime.''
</P>
<P>
   The university will trust to science for the final verification.
After the disc is played on the laser, Harvith said, the physics
department will analyze the sound waves and compare them with
recordings of the artist that were captured on 78-rpm discs in 1905
and 1906, when she was in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know for sure when we play it,'' Harvith said, ``and
we're not going to do that until we can do so safely.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A snowstorm will envelop the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
states Thursday. The day will dawn with an expanding area of snow
over the eastern Ohio Valley and interior Northeast as low pressure
moves east across the central Appalachians. Snow will spread
rapidly up the Middle Atlantic coast toward southern New England
during the morning as a new low pressure center begins to intensify
rapidly near the North Carolina coast. During midday, the snow over
the interior will taper off after leaving an average of 2 to 5
inches, but locally heavy snow will blossom near the coast causing
difficult travel from the Delmarva Peninsula to Cape Cod. Winds
from the northeast will reach 15 to 30 mph with higher gusts
resulting restricted visibility in blowing and drifting snow. The
snow will end in the Middle Atlantic states by evening, but will
continue into the night across much of New England as a potent
storm center moves east of Nantucket. Snow amounts of more than 6
inches will occur in many areas near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the west, winds from the north will deliver much
colder air across the Middle West and interior Southeast. Snow
showers and squalls will be common near the eastern and southern
shores of the Great Lakes. Elsewhere in the regions, partly to
mostly sunny skies will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Another in a series of Pacific fronts will bring patchy rain and
mountain snow from central California to the western parts of
Washington and Oregon. Meanwhile, mild conditions with a mixture of
sunshine and high clouds will cover the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus : Fairbanks Snow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interior of Alaska is a wintry desert. While snow lays on
the ground around Fairbanks continuously from October to April, the
lack of moisture makes large snowstorms uncommon. Although
Fairbanks averages about 70 inches of snow each winter season,
there are typically only three snowfalls of 4 inches or more.
Between Sunday and Tuesday, a series of storm systems brought 13
inches of snow to Fairbanks, 3 inches more than the normal for all
of January. The greatest three-day snowstorm in Fairbanks history
resulted in 34.6 inches of snow from February 11-13, 1966. &QL;

 AN INTERVIEW by JACKI LYDEN)

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   .....................
</P>
<P>
   JACKI LYDEN: Long before the world knew of Elian Gonzalez, there
was another 6-year-old Cuban boy, who also found himself in the
middle of two battling forces. He was known as ``Fidelito'' _
actually Felix Fidel Castro Diaz _ and he was the young son of a
rebel fighter named Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1954 when Castro was imprisoned by the same
Cuban government he overthrew five years later _ the regime of
President Fulgencio Batista. While in jail, Castro learned that he
was about to lose his son in a divorce case and that the boy,
Fidelito, might be taken from the country.
</P>
<P>
   ANN LOUISE BARDACH: Yes, Castro had been imprisoned after his
failed attack (in 1953) upon the Moncada military garrison (in
Santiago), and his wife at that time was Mirta Diaz-Balart. Mirta
informed Fidel Castro she wanted a divorce and that she would be
leaving the country with their 6-year-old son, Fidelito Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: The age is even the same (as Elian Gonzalez').
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Yes, and Castro took this news very badly. He went into
an incendiary rage: Not only was he going to be losing his wife
with his beloved, cherished only child at that point, but also
Mirta's family was connected to the Batista regime and had strong
U.S. ``Yankee'' connections.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: His worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: So Castro wrote a letter to his sister, Lydia, from
prison, and I quote: ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep
a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive
enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those
miserable Judases.'' Later he would write to her: ``To take this
child away from me, they would have to kill me. I lose my head when
I think about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: And indeed, Mirta does take their son to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: It speaks volumes about Fidel Castro's character. He
was in a political situation where, at any time Batista, had he
chosen to, could arrange an accident in which Castro would
``disappear.'' Castro was in no position to be making any demands
whatsoever and yet makes an unprecedented custody demand. And
again, we're talking about 1954, when men were not commonly known
to be asking for custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Who were the ``miserable Judases'' Castro was referring
to, his enemies?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Oh, the ``miserable Judases'' are the Diaz-Balarts,
Mirta's family. Her brother was Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in
the Batista government and, at one time, a very close friend of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: When Castro was finally released from prison, he was
determined to get his son back. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro did lose the first round. Mirta was able to get
a divorce and custody of the boy, or at least a temporary order. In
fact, she went off to the United States with their son. After his
release, Castro and his brother (Raul), who was in prison with him,
and his rebel supporters realized it was too dangerous to stay in
Cuba. So they went to Mexico, where Castro then plotted two
strategies. One, of course, was his triumphant return to Cuba (in
1959), and the second was how he was going to get Fidelito back.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: So what was Castro's strategy to get the boy back?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Fidel Castro, by tricking his wife Mirta, essentially,
convinces her to send Fidelito to him. Castro was arguing that it
could be the last time he ever sees his son because he's about to
begin a perilous expedition _ of course, returning to Cuba to start
a revolution. And Mirta buys this and she sends back Fidelito. But
after two weeks' time, the son is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Castro keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro installs his son, Fidelito, with a couple (who
live in Mexico). And with that, Mirta Diaz-Balart becomes
absolutely distraught. She was from a politically powerful family,
and through the agents of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, they arrange
to retain three men who follow young Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   These men accost the boy as he walks through the park with Fidel
Castro's older sisters in Mexico. On their way back home to the
house where the boy was staying, a car literally cuts them off in
the middle of the street. The men jump out of the car; they seize
the boy and return him to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Yet somehow, eventually, after the revolution is
successful, Fidel Castro convinces his ex-wife to send the boy back
down to Cuba, back down to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: In fact, Mirta brings him back. Castro takes control of
the country Jan. 1, 1959. You know, Batista flees with the national
treasury and goes into exile. And, of course, Castro then promptly
arranges for his son to be returned to Cuba, and his son is flown
down from the United States with Mirta and is reunited with his
father. From that point on, Castro has the dominant control over
Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Fidelito is sent to the Soviet Union _ what is
Russia today _ and was educated. He studied to be a physicist. (He
studied nuclear engineering in Moscow and in 1981 became director
of Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission). At one point he married a
Russian woman. Now his second wife is a Cuban woman. He lives in
Havana and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Do most people know the story of this custody battle 50
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: No, most people don't, unless they've been reading the
letters from Castro in prison or several of the biographies that
allude to them. But most people (don't know of the parallels
between the cases of Fidelito and Elian Gonzalez), not in Cuba and
not in Miami.

 AN INTERVIEW by JACKI LYDEN)  
 c.2000 National Public Radio  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   .....................
</P>
<P>
   JACKI LYDEN: Long before the world knew of Elian Gonzalez, there
was another 6-year-old Cuban boy, who also found himself in the
middle of two battling forces. He was known as ``Fidelito'' _
actually Felix Fidel Castro Diaz _ and he was the young son of a
rebel fighter named Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1954 when Castro was imprisoned by the same
Cuban government he overthrew five years later _ the regime of
President Fulgencio Batista. While in jail, Castro learned that he
was about to lose his son in a divorce case and that the boy,
Fidelito, might be taken from the country.
</P>
<P>
   ANN LOUISE BARDACH: Yes, Castro had been imprisoned after his
failed attack (in 1953) upon the Moncada military garrison (in
Santiago), and his wife at that time was Mirta Diaz-Balart. Mirta
informed Fidel Castro she wanted a divorce and that she would be
leaving the country with their 6-year-old son, Fidelito Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: The age is even the same (as Elian Gonzalez').
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Yes, and Castro took this news very badly. He went into
an incendiary rage: Not only was he going to be losing his wife
with his beloved, cherished only child at that point, but also
Mirta's family was connected to the Batista regime and had strong
U.S. ``Yankee'' connections.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: His worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: So Castro wrote a letter to his sister, Lydia, from
prison, and I quote: ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep
a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive
enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those
miserable Judases.'' Later he would write to her: ``To take this
child away from me, they would have to kill me. I lose my head when
I think about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: And indeed, Mirta does take their son to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: It speaks volumes about Fidel Castro's character. He
was in a political situation where, at any time Batista, had he
chosen to, could arrange an accident in which Castro would
``disappear.'' Castro was in no position to be making any demands
whatsoever and yet makes an unprecedented custody demand. And
again, we're talking about 1954, when men were not commonly known
to be asking for custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Who were the ``miserable Judases'' Castro was referring
to, his enemies?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Oh, the ``miserable Judases'' are the Diaz-Balarts,
Mirta's family. Her brother was Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in
the Batista government and, at one time, a very close friend of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: When Castro was finally released from prison, he was
determined to get his son back. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro did lose the first round. Mirta was able to get
a divorce and custody of the boy, or at least a temporary order. In
fact, she went off to the United States with their son. After his
release, Castro and his brother (Raul), who was in prison with him,
and his rebel supporters realized it was too dangerous to stay in
Cuba. So they went to Mexico, where Castro then plotted two
strategies. One, of course, was his triumphant return to Cuba (in
1959), and the second was how he was going to get Fidelito back.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: So what was Castro's strategy to get the boy back?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Fidel Castro, by tricking his wife Mirta, essentially,
convinces her to send Fidelito to him. Castro was arguing that it
could be the last time he ever sees his son because he's about to
begin a perilous expedition _ of course, returning to Cuba to start
a revolution. And Mirta buys this and she sends back Fidelito. But
after two weeks' time, the son is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Castro keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro installs his son, Fidelito, with a couple (who
live in Mexico). And with that, Mirta Diaz-Balart becomes
absolutely distraught. She was from a politically powerful family,
and through the agents of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, they arrange
to retain three men who follow young Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   These men accost the boy as he walks through the park with Fidel
Castro's older sisters in Mexico. On their way back home to the
house where the boy was staying, a car literally cuts them off in
the middle of the street. The men jump out of the car; they seize
the boy and return him to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Yet somehow, eventually, after the revolution is
successful, Fidel Castro convinces his ex-wife to send the boy back
down to Cuba, back down to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: In fact, Mirta brings him back. Castro takes control of
the country Jan. 1, 1959. You know, Batista flees with the national
treasury and goes into exile. And, of course, Castro then promptly
arranges for his son to be returned to Cuba, and his son is flown
down from the United States with Mirta and is reunited with his
father. From that point on, Castro has the dominant control over
Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Fidelito is sent to the Soviet Union _ what is
Russia today _ and was educated. He studied to be a physicist. (He
studied nuclear engineering in Moscow and in 1981 became director
of Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission). At one point he married a
Russian woman. Now his second wife is a Cuban woman. He lives in
Havana and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Do most people know the story of this custody battle 50
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: No, most people don't, unless they've been reading the
letters from Castro in prison or several of the biographies that
allude to them. But most people (don't know of the parallels
between the cases of Fidelito and Elian Gonzalez), not in Cuba and
not in Miami.

&HT;     FORBES PREDICTS A `SURPRISE' IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOONE, Iowa _ Other candidates may play the expectations game of
talking down their prospects so that they'll look like they ``did
better than expected'' when the votes are finally counted in
Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But publishing scion and Republican presidential contender Steve
Forbes does just the opposite. Forbes is flat-out predicting an
upset victory for his struggling candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday as snow fell on this historic railroad town and
birthplace of the late First Lady Mamie Eisenhower, Forbes
predicted a `good surprise'' in his uphill battle to defeat
Republican front-runner Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. on Tuesday sought
to lower expectations in his uphill battle to upset Vice President
Al Gore, telling reporters he'd be satisfied to get 31 percent of
the caucus vote.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' poll numbers in Iowa haven't been encouraging. He's
hovered in the 17 to 20 percent range in recent weeks. The latest
Des Moines Register poll showed Bush ahead with 45 percent and
Forbes at 18 percent _ second place among the six GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign drew encouragement from a Los Angeles Times
poll showing Forbes getting 25 percent of the Iowa Republican vote,
only 18 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insisted nothing is inevitable, telling about 60
supporters who braved the snow to see him at a town meeting: `This
is not going to be a coronation ... Do what is right. The whole
world is going to be looking at you.''
</P>
<P>
   While many pundits and political analysts have given Forbes the
political equivalent of the last rites in Iowa, Forbes insists his
campaign is alive and well and gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   `I think we're going to have a good surprise Monday night that's
going to give us a good push going into New Hampshire'' which holds
its primary Feb. 1, Forbes told reporters after the town meeting.
`I told my campaign staff, `Don't worry about the press clips. Make
sure we get the deed done on Monday night.' People are coming to
this campaign because they believe in the principles and the
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes sidestepped reporters' invitations to make a specific
prediction about what percentage of the Iowa vote he's likely to
garner.
</P>
<P>
   `Rather than play the expectations game, I want to play the real
positive agenda game, getting the real message out to people,''
Forbes said. `That's what a race is supposed to be about The rest
takes care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, `I'm looking forward to hearing the explanations
as to why some of those who do predict these things didn't predict
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Forbes' advisers were less ebullient.
</P>
<P>
   `We believe we exceed expectations with anything north of 20
percent,'' said Steve Grubbs, a senior Forbes campaign adviser and
former Iowa state legislator and GOP party chair. `We'd clearly
like to do better but clearly (20 percent) is our floor for
Monday,'' the day of the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Forbes denied his campaign had doctored a
photograph of Bush that appears in a Forbes campaign brochure. The
photo makes
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ears appear unnaturally large.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman, Eric Woolson, said the photo makes
Bush look like Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who founded the
Reform Party and ran for president in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is running a television advertising blitz
criticizing Bush's five-year gubernatorial record, responded, `The
picture is what it was and what it is, and the record is what it is
It's the record they should be worried about It's all fagade and no
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' strategy is to position himself as the true believer on
core Republican issues such as taxes, as well as reel in the votes
of Christian conservatives from conservative activist Gary Bauer
and conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has never held elective office and is financing his
campaign out of his inherited fortune from his father Malcolm
Forbes, founder of Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His Iowa campaign has been praised for its deep pockets and
organization, though it remains to be seen what it can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has deployed at least one or two paid professional
staffers to each of Iowa's five congressional districts, and he is
spending over $3 million on television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Local volunteers are manning phone banks and going through lists
to identify Forbes supporters and make sure they go to their
caucuses. The Forbes road campaign is known for its lavish
first-class buses, and no campaign event occurs without ample
refreshment for all in attendance. For example, a spread of donuts,
coffee and orange juice was served at Wednesday's morning event
here.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are challenged to bring five friends each to their
caucus meetings next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in addition to the usual campaign literature
contrasting Forbes' views with those of Bush and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who is not actively campaigning in Iowa, Forbes
distributed lists of caucus sites in Boone County.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered a step-by-step guide on what to expect at the
caucus meetings where registered voters gather in their party's
precinct caucus to debate the merits of the candidates and then
vote their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those attending the meeting here appeared to have made
up their minds about Forbes long ago.
</P>
<P>
   `He gets me excited about being an American,'' said Jo Anne
Korpi, 28, a mother of one who grows and distributes organic
produce. `Being self-employed, you get a hands-on view of the tax
system and how challenging it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Korpi said she supports Forbes' call for abolishing the
elaborate tax code and replacing it with a flat tax. She said Bush
`wants to keep the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes on Wednesday reiterated his criticism of Bush's record in
education and taxes, characterizing Bush's claims of tax cuts and
educational improvement in Texas as `illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted what he termed his `activist'' position on
abortion to Bush's `pacifist'' stance. In GOP debates, Forbes has
said he would require his running mate and federal judicial
nominees to oppose abortion. Bush has declined to make an absolute
commitment on such appointments.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm the anti-tax candidate, I'm the pro-life candidate,'' he
said. `That's why I think our support is gaining here in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Woolson of the Bush campaign responded: `You bet there's
a sharp contrast. Bush has a record of unifying people to bring
them together for the common good. Forbes has a record of dividing
people with negative tactics. He did it in (the) `96 (campaign) and
he's doing it again this year.''

 &HT;        New Computer Helps Scientists Catch up to Satellites. 
 &HT;     By Jonathan Lipman  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 -- The National Weather Service, which
suffers from the unique problem of having more satellite data than
it knows what to do with, got a huge burst in number crunching
power Tuesday as a new parallel processing supercomputer became
operational.
</P>
<P>
   The $35 million IBM SP, which has been under testing since
November, is five times faster than the old Cray C-90 that the NWS
has used since 1994 to process data from its four dedicated
satellites and ground stations. Once the IBM gets an additional
upgrade in September, it will be 28 times faster than the Cray,
pumping out 2.5 trillion calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer will handle the data assimilation and numerical
modeling for the NWS meterologists, just like the old one did, but
the increased power allows for more complicated models that will
yield more accurate and far-reaching forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we predict weather systems the size of the state of
New Jersey, and three, four, or five days in advance,'' said Louis
Uccellini, director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental
Prediction. ``Now we'll be able to predict systems the size of
individual counties within a state and extend those forecasts out
five, six, or seven days in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer will be used to predict short-term terrestrial
weather only. It will not be used for space weather predictions, or
any terrestrial climate predictions more than 14 days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the new IBM, meteorologists aren't even close from
exhausting the data that the satellites produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the good (pieces) of news in the meteorological
community is that there's a lot of data, and one of the bad
(pieces) of news is that there's a lot of data,'' said NWS director
John J. Kelly Jr. ``I'm not sure our computational power will ever
catch up with our data.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have satellite systems facing us that are going to have 200
times the amount of data coming at us,'' Uccellini said. ``And
that's all going to be put into our models.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBM runs four weather models simultaneously - one for global
predictions, and the other three for local predictions - all of
which interact. At the same time, the computer handles data
assimilation, which means taking in all the satellite and
ground-based data, sifting them for their most reliable components,
and giving each piece of data its proper weight and relevance so
that the data do not conflict when fed into the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data assimilation folks could probably use one of these
computers just for data assimilation,'' Uccellini said. ``And
they're going to be sharing with the models people.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with a computer reserved for that task, Kelly said, the
National Weather Service would like a faster computer to do
``climate and seasonal forecasting,'' that could better predict the
effects of long-term atmospheric effects like El Nino or La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly speculated on the possibility that funding for a new
climate-dedicated supercomputer may be part of President Clinton's
2001 budget, due out by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we'll talk in a couple of weeks about it,''
Kelly said, laughing.

HEDY LAMARR, 86, HOLLYWOOD TEMPTRESS OF THE '30S AND '40S 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: An abridged version, OBIT-LAMARR-ABRIDGED, is also being
filed.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of
the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930s and '40s,
especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found
dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., Wednesday. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was being investigated, a routine manner in an
unattended death, Steve Olson, a spokesman for the Seminole County
sheriff's office, told The Associated Press. The death was not
suspicious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she earned millions from her movies, she fell upon hard
times and had lived modestly in South Florida for many years. Miss
Lamarr was forever identified with ``Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film
in which she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking
sequence that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many
parts of the United States for many years. But even though most
Americans never saw it, ``Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the
actress and shaped her career.
</P>
<P>
   But as David Thomson, the film historian, said of her later
work: ``It became her lot to be cast as exotic, sultry women _ and
she did her best; but conscientiousness is not quite what we expect
in our femme fatales. Too often, she had a worried look.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the
daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied
acting with the renowned Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in a few films before ``Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent
film that was well received in Europe, where it was released as
``Symphonie der Liebe.'' Pope Pius XI denounced it, but Mussolini
issued a permit so that it could be shown at the Venice Film
Festival. It won no awards there but attracted attentive audiences,
made up mostly of men.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe,
Miss Kiesler was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz
Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then making tidy profits
by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mandl was distracted by
``Ecstasy,'' and spent a great sum of money tracking down and
purchasing prints of the film so that nobody would see it. He
explained that it was not so much because his wife could be seen
nude, but because of the look on her face during the sex scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Mandl came to regret all the money he spent buying copies of the
film. He did not get all the prints. Then the Nazis seized his
factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they claimed), and Miss Kiesler
left him (she thought he was dull) and made her way to London.
There she was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who immediately offered her a
contract to work for MGM, his Hollywood studio. Mayer changed her
last name to LaMarr after a silent film star named Barbara La Marr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was
promptly banned in New York. For a long time, it seemed as if one
had to be a judge to see ``Ecstasy'': The film was the subject of
many court tests in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When the star of ``Ecstasy'' arrived in New York on the liner
Normandie in 1937, she was determined to demonstrate that she was
more than just a pretty face. She refused to display her knees for
the photographers from the New York dailies who met the ship, and
she asked them not to refer to her as Hedy Kiesler anymore.
``Please call me Hedy Lamarr,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 she made her first American film, ``Algiers,'' with
Charles Boyer. Undergraduates at Columbia University voted her the
girl with whom they would most like to be marooned on a desert
island. Men fantasized about her, and women began to wear their
hair as she did, parted down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of some of her fellow
emigres _ Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich _ all of
whom won plaudits for their acting as well as their looks. The
reviews of Miss Lamarr's films all emphasized her beauty, but when
the scripts actually gave her something to say, the critics were
not nearly as complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she has inadvisedly been given an opportunity to
act,'' wrote Bosley Crowther, reviewing ``Lady of the Tropics'' for
The New York Times in 1939, ``it is necessary to report that she is
essentially one of those museum pieces, like the Mona Lisa, who
were more beautiful in repose.''
</P>
<P>
   When she played a seductress enchanting British plantation
owners in Africa in ``White Cargo'' in 1942, Miss Lamarr purred ``I
am Tondelayo.'' This became grist for comedians; Jack Benny made
many jokes on the radio about an imaginary salesgirl named
Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   In another of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the
ultimate haircut in ``Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949
epic. DeMille, who never overlooked the box office potential of
sexy women in the Bible and the actresses who played them, had a
clinging gown made for her out of feathers plucked from the prize
peacocks he kept on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Lamarr's other films were ``Comrade X'' (1940) with
Clark Gable; ``Boom Town''(1940), also with Gable; ``Ziegfeld
Girl''(1941), with Judy Garland and Lana Turner; and ``Tortilla
Flat'' (1942), with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield. She was
considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down
memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (``Laura'') and Ingrid
Bergman (``Casablanca'' and ``Gaslight.'') Her movies after
``Samson and Delilah'' included ``Copper Canyon'' (1950); ``Lady
Without Passport'' (1950); ``My Favorite Spy'' (1951), with Bob
Hope; ``The Story of Mankind'' (1957); and ``The Female Animal''
(1958).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her private life was messy and sad.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1939, she met Gene Markey, a writer and producer in
Hollywood, and they eloped to Mexico. She divorced Markey the
following year, complaining to a judge that they had been married
for 14 months and that in all that time, he had spent only four
evenings alone with her. The judge granted the divorce but
suggested that if she ever contemplated a future marriage, she
should spend more than a month getting to know her man.
</P>
<P>
   After her divorce from Markey, Miss Lamarr met George Antheil,
the composer of ``Ballet Mecanique'' and other works then regarded
as avant-garde, at a Hollywood dinner party. Miss Lamarr and
Antheil discussed the war and how difficult it was going to be to
stop the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Miss Lamarr recalled hearing conversations
that had occurred between Mandl and the Nazis, who seemed to place
great value on creating a device that would permit the radio
control of airborne torpedoes, with no chance of jamming. The idea,
she and Antheil decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending
synchronized radio signals on various wave lengths to torpedoes,
which could then be directed to hit their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Antheil supplied the technical expertise for the concept, and on
Aug. 11, 1942, the two received a U.S. patent for the use of
radio-controlled missiles that could be used against the Germans.
There were some doubts that Miss Lamarr had the technical
background to give much to the project, but Antheil always credited
her. The government was not initially interested in their device,
but a refined version of it was used by the U.S. military in the
1960s _ after the patent had expired. They never made a dime. In
1996, they were honored for their work by a professional
engineering society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' was Miss Lamarr's only comment.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Miss Lamarr worked hard to sell millions of
dollars in war bonds. She told an audience in Philadelphia that she
was just ``a gold digger for Uncle Sam.'' In the spring of 1943,
she married the British actor John Loder. They were divorced three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lamarr's other marriages, to Teddy Stauffer, a former band
leader who ran a nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas
oilman; and Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer, all ended in
divorce. She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder,
a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Denise. They all survive her.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her career, a certain litigiousness manifested itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 she sued Loew's Inc., and Metro Goldwyn Mayer because
they failed to pay her a contractual $2,000 a week. They said they
were unable to pay her what they owed because President Franklin D.
Roosevelt had issued a wartime executive order limiting all
salaries to $25,000 a year. The case was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   She was involved in several other lawsuits over the years that
did not work out so well. Among them was one against a Los Angeles
department store that had accused her of shoplifting (she was
acquitted of the charge, but her lawsuit against the store was
dismissed). Another was against a repairman for the Los Angeles
School District who, she said, had tried to rape her. He sued her
for causing his false arrest, and the court ordered her to pay him
$15,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Her best-known lawsuits, which occurred in the 1960s and '70s,
were directed against the publisher and ghostwriter of her
autobiography, ``Ecstasy and Me, My Life as a Woman.'' She said the
book was ``deliberately written as an obscene, shocking,
scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy, sensual, lecherous, lustful
and scarlet version'' of her life. Her suit failed. At about the
same time, the state of California sued her for $26,000 in back
taxes it claimed she owed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, living sparingly in South Florida, she was again
accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of personal care items from a
drug store), but she was not prosecuted. In recent years, Miss
Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando. Friends said she was
legally blind and did not venture out on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me?'' Miss Lamarr asked the syndicated
columnist Sheilah Graham in 1966. ``I made $7 million, and yet I
was on relief and they gave me all of $48 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so crazy about acting,'' she also told Miss Graham.
``All that makeup and getting up so early. Maybe I'll go to Europe.
Oh, they want me. I have many offers.''

   &QL;  &UR; Space Business Must Shape Up and Slim Down &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 -- Industry analysts said that aerospace
companies must take clues from the burgeoning Internet sector in
order to recover from a disastrous 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Wednesday's Washington Space Business Roundtable
luncheon also predicted more mergers like Boeing's purchase of
Hughes' satellite sector and said they expect ailing aerospace
giants like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to start selling off
excess divisions that do not fit their main mission.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a tough one for the U.S. aerospace industry.
Multiple launch failures, continued allegations of improper exports
to China, and problems with industry-built NASA missions like the
Mars Polar Lander and the International Space Station all lowered
profits for the launch industry.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite makers and other space technology companies suffered
under Congressionally-imposed export restrictions and the
evaporation of the satellite phone industry with the bankruptcy of
Iridium LLC and ICO Global Communications.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led to the luncheon's dismaying title: ``The Future
of Aerospace/Defense - How to Recover in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace companies ``need to take a hard look at the Internet
and how they can integrate it,'' said Roger Whiting, managing
director of SpaceVest, a venture capital firm that specializes in
space business.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions specialist Anita Antonnucci, of
Quarterdeck Investment Partners, agreed, saying aerospace companies
need to move away from business plans that are ``the traditional
stepchild'' of the industry and take more of ``an Internet
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovative thinking will help companies harness the
communications explosion, said Riyad Said from the investment firm
of Friedman, Ramsey, Billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that are providing higher bandwidth and services but
have no bricks and mortar have done very well'' compared to
companies with more traditional resources,'' Said said.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and ``divestments'' - selling off part of a company -
are another way for companies like Lockheed, which saw a 75 percent
stock drop last year, to rejuvenate, Antonnucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the [technology] sectors have consolidated already,''
Antonnucci said. ``Space still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Export controls remains a problem for the aerospace industry,
Whiting said, and his firm has moved it to the top of the list in
risk factors when looking at companies for potential investment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy towards export policy shifted last March amid
concerns that some companies were giving China and other nations
technology that could endanger national security. Congress ordered
licensing authority for exports transferred from the Commerce
Department to the State Department, where stricter standards and
insufficient staff have led to
</P>
<P>
   delays that companies say can be fatal to their bids for
international contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard of several contracts being lost and of growing
frustration from non-U.S. customers for'' delays caused by the
controls, Whiting said. ``I tend to doubt there's going to be any
near term relief in the future, because we're heading into an
election year and no one wants to look soft on the Chinese.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the course of the past year, the leading professional
wrestling organizations _ the World Wrestling Federation (WWF),
World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship
Wrestling (ECW) _ have come under attack from groups who say their
television shows have exceeded the boundaries of good taste and
need to be cleaned up. Here's a little taste of what you will see
(if you are watching) and what you may not want to watch:
</P>
<P>
   TV RATINGS
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are similar to movie ratings, i.e. TV-PG  &QC;  PG, TV-14  &QC; 
PG-13, TV-MA  &QC;  R (minus nudity)
</P>
<P>
   WWF: TV-PG (only when threatened by the loss of many sponsors),
TV-14 (mostly), TV-MA (could be considered this on Monday's and
Thursday's shows, but usually only appears on the 10-11 p.m. Monday
show)
</P>
<P>
   WCW: TV-PG (not often, but they want to head that way), TV-14
(usual current rating), TV-MA (were headed this way, but may not go
that way again)
</P>
<P>
   ECW: TV-PG (the ads alone are too hot for this to happen), TV-14
(what they aim for each week), TV-MA (where they would stay if they
could get advertisers to stick with them)
</P>
<P>
   SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   When they are on nationally.
</P>
<P>
   WWF: Monday, 9-11 p.m., USA; Thursday, 8-10 p.m., UPN; Sunday,
7-8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   WCW: Monday, 8-10 p.m., TNT; Wednesday, 9:05-11:05 p.m., TBS;
Saturday, 6-8 p.m., TBS.
</P>
<P>
   ECW: Friday, 8-9 p.m., TNN; Saturday, various times, various
stations.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Now it wouldn't be wrestling without it, but the push to the
``extreme'' has taken it to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   WWF: A decade ago, the big thing was blood. No blood was the
preference of owner Vince McMahon and the WWF. Today? Well, bloody
wrestlers are not unusual and McMahon himself has been a bloody
mess in at least two pay-per-views in the past eight months.
Chairs, tables, sledgehammers, shovels, martial arts weapons, bread
trays, bedpans and more have been used to ``injure'' wrestlers.
Thankfully, blood flows on something less than 10 percent of the
WWF's shows. Most of their Monday and Thursday shows have at least
one hardcore match (where everything goes and the use of weapons is
expected), but the number is on the decline because of the real
injuries that occur to the wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   WCW: A decade ago, bloody wrestlers were the big seller for the
WCW, which was the NWA at that time. Since that time, the corporate
line has pulled back to the point that there is no blood and the
hardcore matches have gone away and become more farce than fury.
While chairs, tables, guitars and baseball bats are used to
``injure'' wrestlers, that appears to be the limit that corporate
sensors are willing to allow the shows to go. Male-on-female
violence, which was surging months ago, has been cut back, but
there are still male vs. female matches.
</P>
<P>
   ECW: A decade ago, they didn't even exist. Now they are the
extreme. All their matches can be considered hardcore. There is no
limit on what can be used as a weapon. On last Friday's show, a
pizza cutter, a cheese grater and a staple gun were used to cause
some nasty cuts on the forehead of two competitors. During the
history of the Saturday show (which New York cable station MSG once
took off the air because it was too brutal for the 2 a.m.-3 a.m.
hour!), women have been ``injured,'' wrestlers have broken bones
(including a neck) and not much furniture has survived. The fights
often go out into the crowd, which is almost as dangerous as the
ring, and makes house shows a battle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   Gone is ``Pencil neck geek'' and in its place, ``Hey you
!&AMP;!!(at) jerk!''
</P>
<P>
   WWF: Since Stone Cold Steve Austin began his weekly rants over
two years ago, the use of vulglar language on Monday's program has
been steady. While Stone Cold is out of action, The Rock, Triple H
and Mick Foley have filled the role. Sexual innuendo and ``fighting
words'' are a staple of the opening of shows on Monday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   WCW: Since October, the wrestlers of WCW have loosened their
tongues even more. ``Kick your ass'' has replaced ``kick your
butt,'' and twice wrestlers have had their rants cut to commercial
because they got out of control and were repeatedly bleeped.
</P>
<P>
   ECW: Rough sport, rough language is the norm. On last week's TNN
show, New Jack had a two-minute rant (complaining about why he
wasn't allowed on television) that was edited to ``kiss my ass.''
That's not the norm.
</P>
<P>
   SEX
</P>
<P>
   It sells and don't these groups know it. What you will see may
surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   WWF: The number of women on the show has grown to a group of
about 10, who are shown off regularly. The recent pay-per-view
where a woman wrestler got topless could be topped by this
weekend's swimsuit challenge. The WWF has added to their list of
lovely ladies by using the pimp character The Godfather to bring
four to 12 area strippers to the ring weekly. The one week that the
WWF said it would clean up its act was the one week the Godfather
and his 'Hos did not appear on television. The WWF has also worked
the other side of the street, calling Val Venis a former ``porn
star'' who was made into a champion wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   WCW: In an attempt to keep up with the WWF, their stable of
women has grown, while their cheerleader/dance group, the Nitro
Girls, has disbanded. While they have not had any nudity, the WCW
has approached the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ECW: There are only three women in the ECW right now, although
they are involved in many story lines. While they have had nudity
in one pay-per-view, they haven't gotten close to the limits that
the WWF continues to push.

<P>
   Stone Cold is doing well. The franchise of the WWF underwent
neck surgery on Monday in San Antonio, Texas, and the doctors say
all went well. Prognosis is six months to 12 months before he
returns to the ring. ``SummerSlam'' is a good guess, but it
wouldn't be surprising to see Austin take the entire year off and
come back for the 2001 ``Royal Rumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Ultimo Dragon? The former Japanese WCW star, whose
career appeared to be over after elbow surgery gone bad, is
attempting a comeback. He is expected to work a few shows in
February in Mexico. If that goes well, he could return to Japan in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Get it before it gets hot? Presale for Diamond Dallas Page's
book, ``Positively Page,'' will continue at www.ddpbang.com until
the book is released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe the hype. Reports that Ken Shamrock will be back
in the WWF are premature. Shamrock and the WWF will part ways after
Shamrock's appearance at the ``Royal Rumble'' this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' of 2000? Could be a wrestling movie.
``Beyond the Mat'' by Barry Blaustein will be shown this year at
the San Jose Film Festival. The documentary, which was seen in
limited release in Los Angeles, has gotten rave reviews from
viewers and wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Candido and Tammy Lynn Sytch have landed on their feet
with Xtreme Pro Wrestling. The former ECW duo will debut Jan. 28
for the small company that also employs former ECW personalities
John Kronus, the Pit Bulls, Chastity and Nicole Bass.
</P>
<P>
   New name, same game. To avoid trouble with Warner Bros. over the
cartoon character's name, when Taz debuts in the WWF on Monday
night's ``Raw is War,'' he will be Tazz.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the WWF's co-Intercontinental champion Chyna will miss
her in February as she spends most of the month taping an episode
of NBC's ``Third Rock from the Sun'' and working on a UPN movie.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF will move one of its farm system affiliations from Power
Pro Wrestling to Memphis Championship Wrestling. The move means Jim
Cornette will lose some WWF advertising and Jerry Lawler will again
be the main man for wrestling in Tennessee. Lawler will run Memphis
Championship Wrestling, which will also have a television deal with
the local UPN affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   In its first week without facing ``Thunder,'' WWF's
``Smackdown'' increased viewership by 500,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news for WCW fans. Nitro Girl Terri Byrne, known as
``Fyre,'' was let go recently. The red-headed Fyre was one of the
most popular Nitro Girls. It appears as though the Nitro Girls may
reform in the spring with some new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Whoo!!! Guess who's going to run for governor of North Carolina
_ that's right, Ric Flair. Flair announced his intentions on ``Live
with Regis and Kathie Lee.''

 &HT;    Turmoil on the air and at the top signals big problems for WCW
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's up... but I know what's upside down ...
WCW.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Diamond Dallas Page had to say in his weekly online
commentary, and he couldn't be more right.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before last Sunday's ``Souled Out'' pay-per-view, the
WCW yanked Vince Russo's responsibility for booking the matches and
went back to the booking ``committee'' that had struggled in the
months between WCW chief Eric Bischoff's dismissal and Russo's
hiring. The result was one of the worst pay-per-views in the
history of pro wrestling and the possible jump of a dozen top
wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months after taking charge of the WCW's sinking
ratings ship, Russo's demise came quickly and unexpectedly. In
recent weeks, Russo has struggled with Turner censors to push the
sexual heat and violent content of the WCW shows in hopes of
extending the ratings rise.
</P>
<P>
   The change has disturbed many wrestlers, many of whom had
finally gotten to main-event status. The group includes Chris
Benoit, Kidman, Saturn and Dean Malenko. They are worried about
their future if people like Kevin Sullivan, Mike Graham and Kevin
Nash decide who wins the titles.
</P>
<P>
   WCW fears losing those four, especially Benoit, who is signed
through 2002. That is the main reason he replaced the injured Bret
Hart recently and defeated Sid Vicious for the WCW title.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is probably the reason his title reign lasted less
than one day.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit has good reason to be worried if Sullivan gets control
again. When Benoit arrived at WCW, it was Sullivan who helped him
garner fan appeal by feuding with Benoit in some of the best
matches in 1998. Then Sullivan brought his wife, Nancy, into the
feud and set up a fake affair between Nancy and Benoit. Funny thing
happened, though: The fake affair became very real and ended in a
messy divorce. When things became a little too real, Benoit
disappeared from the main story lines and was off television
completely for months. Many insiders say Kevin Sullivan was behind
the snubbing and has never forgiven Benoit.
</P>
<P>
   While the title reign would appear to be an olive branch, the
turnover of the title on Monday night, and Benoit's absence, would
seem to signal that problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers who are looking to get out have told Bill Busch that
if he is a man of his word, he will let them go. (Busch said when
he took the reigns of WCW this summer that if anyone wanted out,
he'd release them.) The WCW won't miss some of the characters, but
Benoit was one of the few young stars. His departure (probably
straight to the WWF) would be devastating.

BRITAIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES FOR POLICE FORCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Wednesday that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the militaristic police force of Northern Ireland,
will have its size reduced, its membership broadened to better
reflect the population of the province and its politically charged
name retired.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson told a boisterous
session of Parliament that the sweeping changes were needed to
produce a ``modern, effective police service drawing support and
strength from all parts of the community.'' He said it was time to
end the constabulary's status as a ``fulcrum for antagonistic
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ``disgrace'' and ``shame'' rang out from the
Conservative benches as Mandelson enumerated the coming reforms.
David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, told Prime
Minister Tony Blair in a voice trembling with fury that while
``nothing this government says or does can dishonor the RUC and the
men in it, this government can and does dishonor itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement signaled the beginning of another
period of rising tension over the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement is due this month from a disarmament commission
in Belfast on whether there has been any progress in the long
awaited beginning to the surrender of weapons by the Irish
Republican Army. That conclusion will have a direct bearing on a
meeting of Trimble's party Feb. 12 that will decide whether the
Ulster Unionists continue to take part in the province's new
government with Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   A negative decision would bring the Northern Ireland Assembly,
the centerpiece of the April, 1998 Ulster peace agreement, to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Ulster Unionist anger Wednesday was directed at the
decision to scrap the 78-year-old force's royal title that is
cherished by its officers and largely Protestant supporters and
reviled by its many Catholic detractors. The government plans to
rename it simply the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which the government said would be put into effect
over the next 20 months, were first laid out in September in a
report compiled by an independent international commission headed
by former Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patten.
</P>
<P>
   Under that plan, the force will gradually go from its current
strength of 13,500 to 7,500 and it will recruit from a pool of
equal numbers of Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new police code, new uniform symbols, human
rights training, a police college and severance payments that
Mandelson called ``generous and sympathetic''.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster's Protestant politicians condemned the report at the time
and had hoped to see the government turn aside some of its
recommendations, particularly the name change. ``It is a proud
name,'' Mandelson told the dismayed legislators. ``It represents a
very fine tradition. It is rightly honored by the whole of the RUC
family, but I am afraid that name is not owned by both communities
in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians revere the force's record at fighting
terrorism and celebrate its traditions of loyalty and gallantry
represented by the more than 300 of its officers who have been
killed in action and the thousands wounded and disabled. Its
membership is only 8 percent Catholic, however, and its many
Catholic critics have long accused it of being a harsh enforcer of
Protestant domination of their community, which makes up 43 percent
of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the force has undergone reforms, and attracted
more support in Catholic neighborhoods. But Catholic politicians
have still demanded that it be reconstituted and renamed.
</P>
<P>
   The constabulary is the most heavily armed police force in
Europe. The 13,500 men and women in the force police an area that
would require 4,000 officers were it anywhere else in Britain.

CLINTON PROPOSES $110 BILLION HEALTH CARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A longer version by Robert Pear will move by 8 p.m. ET.) 
(js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the threshold of his last year in office and
hoping to be remembered for bringing health insurance to millions,
President Clinton on Wednesday proposed a $110 billion package that
he called the biggest investment in health care coverage since the
establishment of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes a variety of new benefits for adults and
children, tax incentives for businesses and aid for public
hospitals, clinics and care providers to encourage them to provide
care for the uninsured. The $110 billion would be spent over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am elated that health care is an issue in the campaign,''
Clinton said at a White House ceremony. ``It is a good thing. It is
an issue in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his proposal _ which is generally similar to that of
Vice President Al Gore's programs _ ``very ambitious,'' the most
ambitious health care program, in fact, since Medicare was
established in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   While the $110 billion would be a huge expenditure even in an
era of prosperity and budget surpluses, what the president proposed
Wednesday would essentially expand existing programs rather than
create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And though Clinton pronounced himself elated that health care
has become a big issue this early in the presidential race, no one
expects his proposals to sail through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers have their own concerns this election year, and
if Clinton is to win approval for his plans he and his aides will
have to work more smoothly with Republicans than they have been of
late. Moreover, some of the proposals he made Wednesday have
already been rejected, albeit in somewhat different forms.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest part of the package would provide coverage for about
4 million parents who have low incomes and are now uninsured but
whose children are covered under Medicaid and the state Children's
Health Insurance Program, running in conjunction with the federal
government. Putting the parents under coverage would cost $76
billion over 10 years, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed putting another 400,000 children
under Medicaid and the federal-state program; offering tax breaks
to some 2 million people who care for elderly or disabled
relatives; allowing workers as young as 55 to buy into Medicare;
and allocating at least $10 billion to hospitals, clinics and care
providers that treat patients who are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides declined to say how he would pay for his
health care initiatives. More details will doubtless come out on
Feb. 7, when he proposes his budget for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's expansive mood and language Wednesday were
somewhat reminiscent of the optimism with which he unveiled his
program for universal health care early in his presidency. That
program was defeated, largely because its novelty and complexity
were politically unpalatable to too many legislators.
</P>
<P>
   About 44 million Americans lack health insurance, several
million more than when Clinton took office. Far from being a
cure-all, the package he set forth Wednesday would provide coverage
to only 5 million to 10 million of those, depending on which
estimates one accepts.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his last year in office, which begins on Thursday,
Clinton said he wished he ``could go without sleep for the whole
year'' so he could ``milk every last second'' out of his final
months and days. But he will be, increasingly, a lame duck, and his
waning power may not help his health plan's prospects on Capitol
Hill.

HART'S LATEST SECRET: HE'S A SPY NOVELIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sins of the Father,'' John Blackthorn's first thriller based
in Cuba, received generally positive reviews but little other media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, Che Guevara,'' Blackthorn's second Cuba-based novel
(William Morrow, $24) also received scant media attention when it
debuted three weeks ago. Then former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart announced
that he, in fact, is ``John Blackthorn,'' and suddenly everyone was
talking about ``I, Che Guevara.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned any book I wrote would be reviewed for the
author and not the merits of the books themselves,'' Hart said by
telephone from Colorado. ``I used `John Blackthorn' for two
reasons: to explore in fiction why Cuba has remained sort of the
dinosaur of the Cold War, and also not to upset my relationship
with certain people there. I didn't want my fiction to get in the
way of any intermediation I might do _ I have met with President
Castro on more than one occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to come clean, Hart said, not to boost ``I, Che
Guevara's'' sales, but to end ``a sort of ``Primary Colors''
situation (referring to the recent bestseller by ``Anonymous,'' who
was eventually revealed as political pundit Joe Klein) where the
only discussion of my book was who wrote it. The dust jacket was
offering so many clues _ `pseudonym of a political figure,'
`insider's familiarity with modern political campaigning.' So when
I finally agreed to reveal myself, I suppose that, to the degree it
will draw attention to the book, the publisher was pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``I, Che Guevara,'' finds Fidel Castro agreeing to
give up his office and allow free elections if the United States
will end its trade embargo with Cuba. Guevara, long believed to be
dead but in fact only in seclusion, returns with the intent of
leading a new revolution. Everything is covered by members of the
media who prove more interested in reporting salacious information
than real history.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really wanted to explore what might happen in Cuba after
Castro,'' Hart said. ``I think the communists will remake
themselves into social democrats, with the Cuban exiles becoming
the right wing. Cuba may prove a test of whether there may
genuinely be a third way from these, but there would have to be a
leader. It would be, I think, an older person. And I found myself
wondering, now, how old would Che be?''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hart said, ``I, Che Guevara'' continues to explore an
issue that formed the basis for ``Sins of the Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What, involving our country and Cuba, were the mistakes of the
Cold War?'' Hart asked. ``Why are we still, if not at war, not
recognizing this country just 90 miles away? So I premised the
first book on two small nuclear warheads being left behind after
the missile crisis in 1962. What if someone in Cuba decided to use
them now?''
</P>
<P>
   There might be more John Blackthorn/Gary Hart novels about Cuba,
but the former senator from Colorado isn't certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's complicated,'' he said. ``I write books in my off-hours
from making speeches and other appearances. They usually take me
six months, because I've always written quickly, but to write
fiction I need to have both a message for a book and a way to
entertain readers with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as using the Blackthorn pseudonym, Hart said, he recalls
a conversation he once had with mystery writer David Cornwell, who
writes bestselling novels as John LeCarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really isn't his name, you know, and it's become so
well-known he uses that pseudonym,'' Hart said. ``When I asked him
why he kept using it, he just said, `Well, readers are used to it.'
So I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart is sure Fidel Castro won't be reading ``I, Che Guevara.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's too busy with more important things to read,''
Hart said, laughing.

LASIK SURGERY CORRECTS VISION AT THE SPEED OF SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   T minus 35 minutes and counting:
</P>
<P>
   Here I am at Lasersite in Dallas. If all goes well, I'll be able
to see without glasses or contact lenses by the time I leave. I'm
about to have LASIK surgery, but first the preliminaries: A
receptionist hands me a consent form and a name tag. She asks how I
plan to pay for the surgery: cash, credit card or bank check? Cash?
Who am I, Ross Perot? I hand her my MasterCard and find some
consolation in knowing how clearly I'll see the $4,200 charge on my
next monthly statement.
</P>
<P>
   T minus 30 minutes and counting:
</P>
<P>
   I'm with my wife, the post-op designated driver. LASIK surgery
may be a modern miracle, but you can't drive home. During a
consultation the previous day, Dr. Harvey Carter says he will
perform about 60 procedures this particular Thursday. I remind him
that mine will be his most important.
</P>
<P>
   Carter says he is the first opthalmologist in Fort Worth-Dallas
to perform LASIK and has done several thousand procedures. He is
wary about claims made by some doctors whose LASIK totals multiply
faster than McDonald's sells Big Macs. By the way, one of Dr.
Carter's patients is Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. OK. He fixed
Aikman's eyes, not the Cowboys' passing game.
</P>
<P>
   T minus 28 minutes and counting:
</P>
<P>
   A staff member calls my name before I can leaf through the
reading material. I hand my wife my glasses. Won't be needing them
anymore. I'm led to a row of comfortable reclining chairs behind
the receptionist's desk. Most are occupied by LASIK patients
waiting their turn.
</P>
<P>
   A staffer administers antibiotic drops. ``Now, close your eyes
and keep them closed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had told me that LASIK surgery usually goes like
clockwork. Sure, there is the occasional blip, he says, like the
time a patient with a neurological condition failed to take his
medication and had a seizure after surgery on one eye. That
inconvenienced other patients for almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
   And there was this time when Carter discovered that his patient
had a disease of the cornea that could be detected only during a
procedure such as LASIK. Nothing catastrophic, but he postponed
doing the woman's other eye until the first had healed. The woman
and her husband were infuriated, Carter says, but he held his
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I get paid the big bucks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   T-minus 15 minutes and counting:
</P>
<P>
   Still on schedule. After a second round of antibiotic drops, the
staffer switches to antiinflammatory drops and, after those, drops
that numb my eyes. The better not to feel the laser, I'm guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in my chair, eyes wide shut, I wonder why I'm not
apprehensive. (Later, my wife tells me the receptionist was giving
anxious patients a mild sedative on request. I wonder if you can
get some to go.) This is my only set of eyes, and as imperfect as
they are, I don't want to leave in worse condition than when I
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But I hate glasses, and after 34 years of wearing contacts, my
eyes seem to be saying, ``No mas.'' So, while some guys dream about
being like Mike or jamming with the Stones, all I ever wanted was
good vision.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm about to realize that dream. I hope.
</P>
<P>
   This adventure began in October, when I had a free exam and
consultation at the Carter Eye Center in Dallas. I had to cease
wearing my gas-permeable contacts (considered hard contacts) for
three weeks before the exam, allowing my corneas to return to their
normal shape. People who wear soft lenses are required to remove
their lenses about three days before the exam. I arrived for the
exam having worn my glasses for approximately 23 days, 10 hours and
11 minutes. But who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   The exam was comprehensive, lasting 3 1/2 hours. Various doctors
and technicians administered the tests. I went from office to
office, with downtime spent in a second waiting room. I figured my
biggest challenge would be finding a way out of this maze of
offices, especially since my eyes had been dilated and everything
looked fog-shrouded.
</P>
<P>
   My vision was tested multiple times, the redundancy to ensure
that the proper base line was established. I was given a
field-of-vision test as well as several eye-pressure tests because
of a family history of glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an audience with Carter, who entered with an assistant
and another doctor in tow. Carter seemed to be in a hurry. He
talked about the procedure, asked if I had any questions. He
discussed my pre-existing conditions: really poor vision (I'm
nearsighted), dry eyes and astigmatism. But Carter said he'd seen
worse. He was cocky, but in a reassuring way.
</P>
<P>
   Then the LASIK coordinator brought me to a room where I watched
a 15-minute video about LASIK surgery, took a true-and-false test
(the answers are on the same page) and signed consent forms. I
scheduled a tentative date for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   T minus 10 minutes and counting:
</P>
<P>
   I hear a staffer giving instructions to another patient who sits
in the chair next to me. I open my eyes and steal a peek. Still
feeling calm. No inclination to see Carter's diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the holiday season, I had postponed surgery until
Jan. 6. That means more than 30 days had elapsed from when I signed
the consent forms in early December. So I returned to the Eye
Center the day before surgery, to re-sign and chat up Carter again.
``Is this your final answer?'' came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   T minus ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Alfano?''
</P>
<P>
   It's show time. I'm taken into an office where Carter and his
assistants are waiting. It's 2:10 p.m. I recline on the operating
table, and Carter tapes my right eye shut. The left eye is taped
open so I won't blink. There are no other constraints.
</P>
<P>
   I'm under the laser now, staring at its green light. An
assistant is barking out numbers, readings, perhaps calibrations.
Carter swabs my left eye and does play-by-play as the procedure
begins. He creates the corneal flap with the Microkeratome, peeling
back a thin layer of my cornea. But he stops talking when it's time
to use the laser.
</P>
<P>
   I see a blur of green (people have described it as psychedelic)
and hear the staccato burst of the laser. It smells like
something's burning. My eye? Another burst and we're done. Carter
puts the corneal flap back in place, brushes it gently and says the
procedure went great. His policy is not to do the second eye if
there are any complications.
</P>
<P>
   A minute or two later, he is working on my right eye. I now know
what to expect. The Microkeratome cutting the corneal flap, the
staccato laser bursts, the smell. We're done.
</P>
<P>
   I sit up, and Carter asks me to read the clock on the wall. It's
2:20 p.m. Amazing. LASIK surgery took just 10 minutes. No pain, no
discomfort. And I can read the time, even if I'm seeing through a
haze (very normal).
</P>
<P>
   ``You were lucky No. 50,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   My parting gift: I can see without glasses or lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Epilogue: I drive 35 miles to the Carter Eye Center the next
morning for my first follow-up exam. My left eye is stronger than
my right, but Carter pronounces the procedure a success. He is
concerned, however, about my dry eye condition. He tells me to buy
lubricating drops and apply them hourly until my next visit a week
later. He gives me a sample of lubricating gel to use at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   In a week, he'll determine whether my eyes are still too dry. He
says there are other ways to treat this condition. Don't worry
about fluctuating vision, he says. The healing process is six to
eight weeks. And if needed, Carter says, he can do an enhancement
procedure after three months. My eyes are not 20-20, but I'm
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   I leave and instinctively reach into my shirt pocket for my
glasses. This will take some getting used to.

NOVELLAS PERFECTLY CAPTURE THE DESPERATION OF TWO EASt TEXAS BOYS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Haley, Texas 1959'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Donley Watt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Novellas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cinco Puntos Press, $21.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the painful moment when the warm, familiar meadow of
childhood became an eroded wasteland filled with briars and fire
ants?
</P>
<P>
   Donley Watt does.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's third published work draws from his memories of growing
up in East Texas in the 1950s. The book comprises two novellas, the
first a son's remembrance of a job done for his father, the second
an account of a boy's unwitting complicity in a murder. In their
ability to evoke the feel of rural Texas, and to chart the origins
of restlessness, confusion and desperation in boys and men of
certain circumstances, Watt's economic style and storytelling
powers rival those of Larry McMurtry in his early works.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of June 1950, Watt's father drives him out to a
70-acre pasture the family owns in Navarro County. Besides camping
gear, food and water, the Watts have brought a double-bladed ax, a
file and a 50-gallon drum of diesel fuel. The boy will spend the
next week embarked on a monumental task: eradicating the pesky
second-growth mesquites consuming the pasture.
</P>
<P>
   While he chops, the boy ruminates: on death, sex, family and
peer relationships, homegrown race hatreds, the stark and lonely
beauty of life and labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon started to rise in the east and I easily picked up
the cow trail that led back to the bois d'arc thicket,'' Watts
writes. ``I kept my eye on the trail, stepping around the fresh cow
plops, but still managed to watch the steady movement of tractor
lights back and forth in the distance, until I encountered the
solitude of the bois d'arc woods. It's not easy out here, not for a
man or a tractor or a crawfish. Not for a boy cutting mesquite,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Each incident, recalled with economic precision, represents what
Watt calls the ``watershed times'' of his youth: ``A few critical
events, measured only in moments, set off by parentheses, nudge us
this way or that and we can never turn back.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical event that unites both stories occurs during a
family get-together at Watt's aunt and uncle's place. He recalls it
through the eyes of Donnie, the boy in the first novella.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Donnie's wild cousin offers him a ride in a Model
A. They pick up two of the cousin's friends, who are carrying an
8-foot 2-by-4. Their intention is to find a lone black man walking
along the side of the road, pull over close to him, extend the
plank and knock him down.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a brutal sport,'' Donnie says. ``I knew it at the time.
I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't back out. Not then.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the only man they spot that night runs far off the
road at the sound of the approaching automobile.
</P>
<P>
   In the second novella, though, the boys kill a black man.
Although not prolonged or grisly, the fictional crime in ``Haley,
Texas 1959'' exposes the malevolence inside all of us as surely as
recent real-life events in Jasper have done.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial scenes in both novellas sever the bonds of trust and
security between the boys and their fathers. At the conclusion of
his seven days of mesquite-cutting, Donnie realizes that, no matter
how hard he tries, he won't be able to please his father. When the
smarmy Methodist minister father in the second novella initiates a
plan to cover up his son's brutal act, evil spreads.
</P>
<P>
   This slender volume succinctly illustrates how painful memories,
filtered through an artist's fertile imagination, can become
powerful literature. Like the roots of the tenacious mesquite, the
meaning and impact of these stories can run deceptively deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haley, Texas 1959'' might be hard to find in your local
bookstore, but it's worth the effort to track it down. &QL;

VROOM! VROOM! GRAN TURISMO 2 IS REVVED UP AND READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three more reasons not to box up your PlayStation just yet:
</P>
<P>
   Gran Turismo 2 (Sony for PlayStation, $40): Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you should never have invested $300 in a Sega Dreamcast to
get better racing games. This is about as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   GT2 is a two-CD set that expertly captures just about all there
is to capture in a racing game: The tracks are brilliantly
detailed, the 3-D graphics look as if they've been torn from one of
those Stop'N Go racing mags and _ man, wonder how long it took to
do all this _ there's an army of more than 500 cars. It's gonna
take an hour to figure out which one you wanna race.
</P>
<P>
   It's gonna take even longer to finish. The races, divvied into
arcade and simulation modes via the two CDs, are satisfyingly long
and difficult. You'll be starting over so much, your fingers are
gonna bleed from hitting the gas pedal or the reset button. Wish
all games were like that.
</P>
<P>
   Wu-Tang Shaolin Style (Activision for Sony PlayStation, $40): So
rap clan Wu-Tang Clan has its own video game? What's next _ Puff
Daddy Jailbreak? Britney Spears Makeover? Backstreet Boys Vs.
Pokemon? (We all know Pokemon would win).
</P>
<P>
   Wu-Tan's foray into the vid-game realm is kinda like their CDs:
full of violent imagery (it's a fighting game). If you're cool with
your kids listening to Wu-Tang, this is nothing; if not, avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   The game is surprisingly impressive. It combines the best
elements of groundbreakers like Sega's Virtua Fighter and Sony's
Battle Arena Toshindin _ three-dimensional fighting areas, swirling
camera angles, creative weaponry _ but has some unique twists, like
cinematic battle sequences and a four-fighter option.
</P>
<P>
   And how could you put out a Wu Tang game without some new Wu
Tang music? You get three new tracks, and the scary thing is, there
are people out there who will spend $40 on this just to hear 'em.
I'm just glad Marilyn Manson hasn't put out his own game.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return (Whoopee Camp for PlayStation,
$40): Here's yet another sequel to yet another cute-critter, Crash
Bandicoot/Rayman/Mario-type game. Every game character like this
has its own little charm, and Tomba's is the ability to change into
superhero outfits that allow him to do things like fly or run at
light speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda like most of the music your kid listens to, this is
absolutely nothing new, but it does serve its purpose: to keep your
gamer occupied while you pay bills.

UNDATED: critical data.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These theories are intuitively attractive, and they fit many
of the experiences we have,'' she said. ``But it is when something
is intuitive that you need to be most careful to have adequate
scientific controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Koss pointed out that although it is true that most rape
victims are young women, most rapists are 18 to 25, and it is more
than likely that they will find victims in their own age group. She
and other experts noted that a surprisingly large number of rape
victims are young children.
</P>
<P>
   She said that other work by evolutionary scientists supported
the notion that male violence toward women may have evolved partly
as a strategy for controlling access to reproductive partners, an
interpretation consistent with Ms. Brownmiller's observations.
``But there are also roles for many other influences at the
societal level, the institutional level, the family level, the peer
level and within the two individual people,'' Dr. Koss said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics objected to the authors' use of nonhuman examples
to buttress their case. ``We can't ask a female fish whether she
appears to resist because she doesn't want to copulate or because
she is testing males for their fitness,'' Coyne said. ``But we can
ask a human female who has been raped if she participated
willingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally contentious are the authors' ideas about how women react
to rape. On the basis of a study in the 1970s by Thornhill and his
wife, Dr. Nancy W. Thornhill, they contend that young women suffer
more distress after being raped than do children or older women
past their reproductive years. This ``makes evolutionary sense,''
they say, because it is young women who risk being impregnated by
an undesirable mate.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Koss said that other studies indicated that the impact
of rape was far worse for elderly women than for younger women.
``They develop a much more pervasive fear of going out of their
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists applaud the efforts of Thornhill and
Palmer to refocus attention on rape as a sexual crime and to link
it to other evolutionary work on male and female sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Understood within the context of evolutionary theory, said Dr.
Neil Malamuth, professor of psychology at the University of
California at Los Angeles, the scientists' thesis ``is not as
preposterous as it might seem.'' While feminists like Ms.
Brownmiller perform an important service by focusing on the
violence and power components of rape, he said, ``there are aspects
of rape that really do have to do with sex.''

   RIO, Fla. _ It's been more than 50 years since the four men were
young sailors aboard the battleship they knew as ``Big Mamie,'' and
now they are old enough to know how lucky they were to survive the
air and sea attacks that pelted their ship during much of their
service during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Ryerson, Leon ``Wink'' Carman, John Wilson and Skip Sande
served together at the peak of the Africa and Pacific campaigns and
they gathered recently at Jack Baker's Lobster Shanty in Rio to
talk about the good and the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   The men, proud that none of the sailors who served on the U.S.S.
Massachusetts died in combat, most clearly recalled the first wave
of the North African invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when the word came down that we just got three
torpedoes coming at us and to stand by,'' Carman recalled with a
shake of his head. ``I remember saying to myself, `This is the last
time I'm ever going to be in the bottom of the ship.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quick-turning maneuvers miraculously evaded all three of the
``tin fish'' and the Massachusetts ultimately won the battle with
just a few dents and dings in its massive hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the 'ping, ping' of shrapnel hitting the side
of the ship,'' Ryerson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember how hot it was?'' Wilson asked, drawing a
recollection from Sande that the temperature hit 140 degrees in the
engine room where he worked during the battles.
</P>
<P>
   A sailor penned a few verses in honor of the ship to be sung to
the tune of the Notre Dame fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Cheer, cheer for the mighty Mass,
</P>
<P>
   She is the fightin'est ship of her class ... You're the queen
who rules the sea,
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, oh hail to thee.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of men served on the Massachusetts, which is now a war
memorial anchored in Fall River, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds visit the ship each year for a reunion. It was at one
of those events Ryerson realized there were four Massachusetts
veterans living within 50 miles of his Stuart, Fla., home. He was
able to reach three of them. At the luncheon with their wives, they
traded information on children and careers and told a few stories
of life on ``Big Mamie.''
</P>
<P>
   They also talked about those who did not come home from the war
and those who have died since. They talked about the hundreds of
World War II veterans that are dying every month. And they talked,
about how the government is once again allowing military honor
guards and formal flag presentations for veterans' burials.All in
their 70s and 80s, the four congratulated each other on their
fortune and wished each other good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never lost a man,'' Ryerson reminded the group.
</P>
<P>
   Carman added, ``We're all glad we can be sitting here enjoying
each other.''

GOP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL McCAIN EMBRACING POPULIST RHETORIC 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ When John McCain talks about taxes or education
on the campaign trail these days he frequently observes that
``there is a growing inequity between the haves and have nots.''
</P>
<P>
   While such commentary would not be extraordinary coming from a
Democratic politician, it is jarring coming from a leading
Republican presidential contender, whose party had repeatedly
decried class warfare waged by their liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   McCain can hardly be accused of being a liberal. He opposes
abortion, has never voted for a tax increase, and has refused to
condemn the display of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with his campaign building momentum in the key primary state
of New Hampshire, the Arizona senator has increasingly embraced a
populist rhetoric, so much so that his chief presidential rival,
George W. Bush, has accused him of talking like Democrats Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   _ On taxes, McCain defied the Republican party line by arguing
that Bush's proposal to finance tax cuts from a federal surplus,
which may or may not materialize, would be foolish when it should
be used to pay down the debt; McCain also slammed Bush's tax plan
as one that favored the rich.
</P>
<P>
   _ He regularly invokes Democratic Presidents John F. Kennedy and
Franklin Roosevelt and tells crowds, ``I am a threat to the status
quo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Many of his colleagues believe McCain's call for campaign
finance reform will put their own party at a fund-raising
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the environment, he opposes international global-warming
agreements but favors more attention on the national park system.
</P>
<P>
   _ On health care, McCain says that while he disagrees with a
centralized, government-controlled health care, he still believes
that more taxpayer funds will have to be spent to deal with the
health-care needs of the elderly and the growing number of
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   _ On law-and-order issues, McCain says that first-time drug
offenders should be allowed to go into rehabilitation rather than
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's unorthodox positions have not gone over well with
all of his party's leaders, who fear he may be helping to craft
Democratic attacks on Bush if he is the eventual GOP presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically I don't think John McCain is winning any friends
in the Republican Party by coming out with these positions,'' said
Bill Bennett, a former Reagan and Bush Cabinet member who recently
introduced McCain at a Manchester, N.H., event.
</P>
<P>
   But others say he is broadening the party ideology's appeal, and
may increase turnout among turned-off voters.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a scholar at the conservative Heritage
Foundation who is advising McCain, said the candidate's message is
``conservative, but it does recognize the importance of reforming
institutions to increase their legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has argued that he is espousing truly conservative fiscal
stands by insisting that the government pay off its debts and take
care of obligations such as Medicare and Social Security before
spending all of the surplus on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That message is getting through, at least in New Hampshire,
where polls show the Arizona senator slightly ahead of Bush and
bolstered by independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who showed up at his town hall meetings say they are
drawn to the candidate because of what they perceive as his honesty
and willingness to take on the entrenched powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with all of McCain's positions,'' said Brian
Moses, a Republican real-estate agent who came to hear McCain at a
Nashua Chamber of Commerce breakfast. ``But I would rather have
someone tell me how they really feel then have them lie to your
face to get your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bryant, a 31-year-old independent voter from Hopkinton,
said he supported McCain because he was willing ``to take on his
own party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain makes it clear, whenever he is asked, that he wants Roe
vs. Wade overturned. But he also expresses discomfort with the
emotional issues and tells voters he would rather focus on adoption
and improving foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the interest of both extremes to keep us polarized,''
he tells voters.

 &HT;    When the prices are falling, savvy shoppers rise to occasion
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sale! Clearance! Markdown!
</P>
<P>
   Three words that make any shopaholic's heart beat faster.
</P>
<P>
   We who shop till we drop think that the time and effort are well
worth it, especially if our shopping bags can be filled with such
goodies as Chaus' $58 blue silk-and-cashmere pullover for half
price _ less an additional 30 percent. Or a pair of girl's Arizona
jeans, regularly $19.99, now $4.99. Or a $98 Tommy Hilfiger denim
dress marked down to $49.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we are lovers of bargains. According to Kurt Salmon
Associates Consumer Outlook, in a survey of 1,000 men and women
nationwide, 70 percent said they buy almost all of their
merchandise (clothing) on sale.
</P>
<P>
   January _ and July _ is prime time for most retailers to clear
their racks and shelves of older merchandise, or seasonal items, to
make way for new receipts. And savvy shoppers can reap big monetary
benefits, especially if the stores offer 30 percent to 50 percent
off sale or clearance merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Cindy Johnson of Nashville, who on a
recent weekend found a lightweight gray polyester I.N.C. jacket at
Rich's Town Center that originally was $159, marked down to $79.50.
Then she received an additional 30 percent off. The total? $55.65
plus tax. ``Now that's what I call a great sale,'' said Johnson, a
teacher. Her favorites to stock up on right now? ``Shoes, sweaters
and jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Lavender of Marietta, Ga., who was browsing in Sears on a
recent Sunday, has sales shopping down to a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy anything unless it's on sal,'' said Lavender, an
administrative assistant with a brokerage firm. ``When I know the
sales are going on, my fingers begin to itch.'' Her final bargains?
A Classic Elements shirt for $9.98 and a pair of Laura Scott
trousers for $28 less 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Underhill, New York retail consultant and author of ``Why
We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) has a
word of caution for sale shoppers: Never buy anything you don't
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, in early January in London,'' he recalled during a
phone interview, ``I had come from the tropics and it was cold. I
dropped my luggage at the hotel and went to Harrods department
store where I found a camel-colored cashmere sweater at a deep
discount. I wore that sweater for more than 25 years. It filled an
immediate need and was something that I could really use.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``it was a great buy.''
</P>
<P>
   All sale purchases should turn out so well.
</P>
<P>
   Sale strategies
</P>
<P>
   To guide you through the maze of markdowns, we asked Atlanta
area retailers for their sale and clearance philosophies. Note:
Throughout the year, stores do select markdowns on merchandise in
every department. And in their newspaper ads, some retailers also
feature clip-out coupons worth 10 percent to 20 percent off already
marked down merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DILLARD'S
</P>
<P>
   The store has seasonal clearances when it marks goods up to 75
percent off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  JCPENNEY
</P>
<P>
   This retailer holds three major sales a year: Back to School,
Fall Wardrobe Event and Spring Wardrobe Event. During January,
signs seen in stores stated, ``Red Alert. Dangerously Low Prices.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LORD &AMP; TAYLOR
</P>
<P>
   The store would not comment but a January ad stated, ``Winter
fashions already reduced 25 percent to 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MACY'S
</P>
<P>
   Although officials would not comment, a recent stroll through
the Peachtree Street store revealed large signs saying ``end of
season clearance event.'' The clearance signs on several racks
said, ``price marked is 50 percent off original price.'' And some
signs had additional 30 percent off signs on clearance merchandise.
Other clearance merchandise was marked 25 percent off the original
price with an additional 30 percent off signs on clearance items.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NORDSTROM
</P>
<P>
   Holds five major sales a year: Anniversary Sale and four
Half-Yearly sales. The schedule: Half-Yearly Sale for Women and
Children (spring and summer clearance) in June; Men's Half-Yearly
Sale (spring and summer clearance) in June; Anniversary Sale
(preseason savings on new merchandise) in late July; Half-Yearly
Sale for Women and Children (fall and winter clearance) in
November; Men's Half-Yearly Sale (fall and winter clearance) late
December.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NEIMAN MARCUS
</P>
<P>
   Holds Last Call sales in January and July. The current Last Call
sale takes 40 percent off already reduced prices. You'll save as
much as 65 percent on original prices. Sale runs through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PARISIAN
</P>
<P>
   The store declined to talk but a newspaper ad this month read:
``Red Balloon Clearance, take an extra 30 percent off fall and
winter items already reduced by 25 percent to 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RICH'S
</P>
<P>
   At the store, a sale refers to current merchandise that is
reduced for a specific time period, then returns to regular price.
This is the store's way of offering value on current and forward
fashions. Clearance merchandise is permanently marked down. This
merchandise can also be marked down an additional 30 percent to 50
percent, and savings can total up to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SAKS FIFTH AVENUE
</P>
<P>
   The store has two big end-of-season sales, in July and in
January. Markdowns start at about 33 1/3 percent off the original
price.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SEARS
</P>
<P>
   It positions storewide sales around national holidays. In
January the retailer has further reductions on seasonal goods. In
women's apparel, all seasonal apparel items, including coats and
sweaters, will be approximately 30 percent off.
</P>
<P>
   How to bag a bargain
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't buy that pink taffeta evening skirt simply because it's
on sale for 50 percent off and you think you might wear it some
day. ``Buy less of the fashion forward items and more of the
basics,'' said Keith Richards, manager of strategic services for
Kurt Salmon Associates. ``Buy the black skirt that will last two to
three seasons. Or stock up on a navy blazer or dress shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children's wear, especially basics, might be a good idea to
buy only if you think your kids will fit into the clothes next
season. Or simply buy clothing that they can wear immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for fashion classics to wear right now and then put them
away for next year, suggests Sheila Kamensky, fashion director of
Rich's. These include cashmere sets and merino wool sweaters;
winter coats, including leathers; anything denim and boots.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In cosmetics, color, fragrance and treatment items are usually
not on sale, but look for soaps, bath gels, candles, hand creams
and cosmetic bags to be marked down, sometimes as much as 50
percent.

   Yet the $1,000,000 figure still appeals to us. ABC's ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' is a huge hit, with all seven episodes last
week scoring in the Nielsen prime-time Top 10 and spawning a small
school of knockoffs on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `million' still resonates powerfully in the American
brain,'' says Robert Thompson, head of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University. ``It's the cutoff point
between a lot of money and a spectacular amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Big-bucks game shows, Thompson says, ``promote this notion of
reinventing youself, this idea that you can really bypass your
social profile, your birth and in fact become a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, as Dr. Evil learned, $1 million is no longer a
spectacular amount of money. Maybe not even enough to reinvent
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get on a game show and win a million, taxes take half.
Nobody thinks of that,'' says Thomas Stanley, author of ``The
Millionaire Next Door.'' ``If you invested $500,000 you might make
$50,000 a year for life. That won't get you off the treadmill.
These people shouldn't quit their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw one of these shows in which each contestant was asked
what he or she would do if they won the big prize, in this case $2
million,'' says Michael Dean Murphy, an anthropologist at the
University of Alabama. ``Of course, that means $1 million after
taxes. (But) almost all said they wanted a big house on the beach
and a ridiculous car _ Ferrari, Lotus, Hummer _ and a condo for
dear old mom and to quit their job at Blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be other reasons beyond the chance for perceived
riches that account for ``Millionaire's'' popularity. The show
makes people feel smart because the questions are so easy,
theorizes Stuart Vyse, a psychologist at Connecticut College. ``The
questions are multiple choice, and often people at home know or can
guess the answers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Murphy says, the show seems designed to weed out
``braniacs'' by its use of questions about TV, rock music and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the knowledge being tested is just the sort expected
of the bright, perky, committed consumer,'' Murphy says. (It's)
celebrity, entertainment, media and product knowledge, with a few
questions like 'How did Socrates kill himself?' thrown in for their
perplexity value.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, prime-time game show questions were much harder,
Thompson says. The current big-bucks shows ``present the notion
that a person who is fairly good at trivia can become a
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching people just like us. They make us feel better
about being stupid.''

 &HT;    The real wealthy didn't get there by winning big, says author
Tom Stanley
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millionaires like Tom Stanley know there's one simple formula
for getting rich, and it's not winning big bucks on one of the new
TV game shows, or picking the next Microsoft on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It's this: Live within your means.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the millionaire wannabes _ or never-will-bes_ who ply
metro roads in Mercedes Benzes and live in half-million-dollar-plus
houses operate by another credo: Live within your means, even if
you have to borrow money to do it. Despite the trappings, few of
them will ever become millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, a former Georgia State University marketing professor,
spent 20 years interviewing thousands of millionaires, then used
their secrets to become one himself. In 1996, he published ``The
Millionaire Next Door'' (Longstreet, $22; Pocket Books, $14) which
has been on The New York Times Bestseller Lists in hardback or
paperback practically ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He's likely to make millions more when his latest book, ``The
Millionaire Mind,'' hits the shelves Feb. 7. It reveals more about
the personalities and habits of millionaires, building on the
moderate-living, guy-next-door picture that his first book drew.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most millionaires don't do well in school, scoring
low on SATs, and aren't deemed most likely to succeed. Another
common trait _ they have stable marriages, lasting decades. And
many still mow their own lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who's been married to the same woman for 29 years,
didn't do that well in school, but doggedly kept at it, improving
his grades from Cs to As and finally earning a doctorate in
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as a professor 10 years ago at age 45 at a peak
salary of $55,000. He still lives in the same metro Atlanta house
he built 15 years ago for less than $175,000. He wears a Seiko, not
a Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he _ like the millionaires he studied _ is frugal. He
saves or invests most of his income. He's debt-free, with no
mortgage or car notes. His wife Janet doesn't sport a big diamond _
she doesn't even like highfalutin jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be thrilled with a new tennis racket,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that the new wave of instant-millionaire game shows _
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' Fox's ``Greed'' and others
_ may actually make some people poorer. The shows may send regular
Joes scrambling to try to get on TV, into the stock market or into
lottery ticket lines in convenience stores, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an awful lot of people looking for the quick fix, the
lottery,'' Stanley says. ``But few of them ever become
millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason: Making a million is almost always a process that
takes years, but in the current get-rich-quick milieu, many people
start spending like millionaires long before their ship comes in.
</P>
<P>
   This is true regardless of income, he says. Doctors, company
execs and stockbrokers may earn big money, but if they buy trophy
homes, expensive jewelry and cars that scream ``I'm rich,'' they're
unlikely to ever really be rich. Only 6 percent of doctors and 8
percent of lawyers, many of whom earn hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year, have a net worth of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta real estate, for example, the sales of big, expensive
houses are growing faster than the number of millionaires. Since
1997, sales of $1 million-plus houses have grown 135 percent,
according to Smart Numbers, a real-estate statistical firm, while
millionaire households are up 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nuts out there,'' says Steve Palm of Smart Numbers.
``We're more leveraged in housing than we've ever been. People are
putting less down.''
</P>
<P>
   It's common for people with $75,000 incomes to buy $400,000
homes, he says. Even if they have a 20 percent down payment,
they'll still face monthly mortgage payments of more than $2,000,
twice as much as they should spend for housing according to
traditional income-to-payment formulas.
</P>
<P>
   True millionaires don't live like this, Stanley says. ``Most
millionaires' houses don't have 15-foot ceilings. Typically they
are houses that have three or four bedrooms and were built in the
'40s or '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of millionaires live in homes worth $320,000 or less. Most
wouldn't think of spending more than $400 for a dress suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Robbin, head of Ricercar Inc., an economic consulting
firm in Bethesda, Md., says about 7 percent of metro Atlanta
households are worth $1 million. According to Stanley's research,
the typical millionaire:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lives in a three- or four-bedroom house that's 20-plus years
old, has lived in it for 20-plus years, and is outnumbered in his
neighborhood 3-1 by non-millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drives American-made cars between one and six years old, and
is more likely to drive a Ford than a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Works 45-55 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Has a ``go-to-hell'' emergency fund that would allow his
family to live without lowering its lifestyle for 10 years or more.
(Most high-income earners couldn't live more than a year or two if
they quit working.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People who watch the TV shows like 'Greed' and 'Millionaire'
think 'This could happen to me,''' Stanley says.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds of it happening are terrible, says Bernard Siskin,
an expert on probabilities who co-authored the 1989 book,
``Chances: Risks, Odds &AMP; Likelihood in Everyday Life.'' You're
almost as likely to get hit on the head by a meteorite than win a
million on a game show, he says.

   Q: My husband has a wonderful recipe for Bloody Marys that calls
for sauerkraut juice, but we've had trouble finding it. We have
substituted dill pickle juice or pickled okra juice, and these will
do in a pinch. But Bloody Marys just aren't the same without
sauerkraut juice.
</P>
<P>
   _Betsy Hortman, Flowery Branch, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Enjoy your Bloody Marys just in time for the Super Bowl on
Jan. 30. Sauerkraut juice _ a blend of white cabbage, sea salt,
spices and herbs _ is a scarce commodity, but we found Biotta
Sauerkraut Juice, organically grown, ($4.99 for a 1.05 pint) at
Whole Foods Market, 2111 Briarcliff Road N.E. (404-634-7800).
Reader Hortman says that she and her husband like to wet the rim of
a glass, dip it into Old Bay Seasoning and add a peeled shrimp for
a garnish. You can also use pickled okra or green olives to
decorate the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent magazine I saw a mention for a monitor that
alerts you when a door or doorknob moves. This would be great for
when my grandchild visits. I have looked several places but no
luck.
</P>
<P>
   _Sheila Richardson, Dahlonega, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Door Guard is a great little gadget that relieves your
safety and security concerns. Simply lock the guard over an inside
door knob. When the door receives a vibration, the guard's built-in
vibration sensor will sound. We discovered Door Guard ($12.79) at
Ace Hardware, 6010-A Sandy Springs Circle (404-256-9795).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find a pair of shoes called desert boots.
These suede boots, which hit right above the ankles, were popular
about 20 or so years ago. They are very plain but comfortable. I
would like to find a pair for my dad.
</P>
<P>
   _Gregory Bowman, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We trekked all over town and found your classic desert boots
at Clarks of England stores in Perimeter Mall (770-350-0444) and
the Mall of Georgia (678-482-7433). A pair with crepe soles is
$89.99 and comes in sand, brown, black and green suede; also in
brown leather. Desert boots, which are laced with two sets of
eyelets, were introduced by Clarks in the '60s and have
periodically enjoyed the limelight. Today, young kids, as well as
their parents and grandparents, enjoy tramping around in this comfy
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order desert boots on the Web at:
www.rmconnection.com. Each pair is $88.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am wondering what happened to Dromedary
</P>
<P>
   Pitted Dates in the oh-so-familiar orange box. I have one box
left and can't find them anymore. My mother on the Mississippi
coast said she's been looking for a year and hasn't seen her
favorite brand either.
</P>
<P>
   _Sylvia Elliott, Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since 1905, Dromedary dates have been imported from what is
now Pakistan and have a stronger flavor than other dates, said a
spokesman for California Redi-Date. Unfortunately, this particular
brand of sweet fruit is hard to find in Georgia. Why? Slow sales.
But you can find these dates in Tennessee, North Carolina, New
York, California and Massachusetts. In our travels, we spotted
Dromedary dates at Bryson's Food Store in Highlands Plaza,
Highlands, N.C. (828-526-3775.) An 8-ounce box is $2.19 for either
pitted or chopped dates.
</P>
<P>
   The lost has been found: In a recent column, several readers
were looking for Sock Locks. Gail Reiken Tuzman, the distributor of
these gizmos, called to say Sock Locks, which hold socks together
during washing and drying, are available online at
www.sock-locks.com. Or you can call 973-744-5537. Sock Locks come
in colors so each member of your household can use a different
color to make sorting laundry a breeze. Each package ($2) contains
16 Sock Locks for thin pairs and four Sock Locks for pairs of thick
socks.

 &HT;    Dole to get droll on Comedy Central
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Bob Dole, funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plan for cable network Comedy Central, anyway, which
has hired Dole as a guest political commentator for its election
coverage, dubbed ``InDecision 2000.'' That means the 1996
Republican presidential candidate, the punch line of so many jokes
himself, will now share a home with the scatology-spewing kids of
``South Park'' and the frat-boy humor of ``The Man Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very funny guy,'' says Tony Fox, senior vice president
of Comedy Central. ``I know you don't often see it, but we're
giving him an opportunity to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole will be paired with Jon Stewart, anchor of Comedy Central's
mock newscast ``The Daily Show.'' He'll appear in a series of
reports throughout the campaign, the conventions and on election
night. In the past, Comedy Central has used comedians such as Chris
Rock and Al Franken in its political coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``South Park,'' Comedy Central actually toyed with
the idea of running the ``South Park'' feature film (''Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut''), but has decided to pass, says CEO Larry Divney,
because of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about running it at 2 a.m., a special evening
presentation, unsponsored. It's a tough film to put on broadcast or
cable TV unedited. I don't find a way how we could do it,
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, released last summer to surprisingly good reviews,
contained more hard-core obscenities than any film in history,
including ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're among those who believe that there just aren't
enough game shows in prime time, Comedy Central is where you need
to tune this summer. In June, the channel will premiere ``Don't
Forget Your Toothbrush,'' another knockoff of a British show (as is
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ``Mastermind,'' which ABC is
developing for the summer as well).
</P>
<P>
   The show's complicated premise is that 200 people will be
invited to a taping and all told to pack for a trip. Several people
will win trips and leave on the spot. But in order to win trips,
they have to perform in bizarre customized stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a contestant might be surprised to see their
entire first grade class marched out onstage,'' explains Debbie
Liebling, Comedy Central's head of development. ``If the player can
identify these now grown-up, fat and balding former 6-year-olds and
match them to a list of current occupations, the prize is an
instant trip to Paris.''

   In selecting whose papers to acquire, Staley has to look to the
future and focus on writers he thinks will be the subject of
biographies and other literary scholarship. He said he wants to
believe the writer has a stature that will endure, or if the writer
is new and promising, that he will be able to sustain a career. The
principal goal is to collect the complete papers rather than a
single original manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he buys the papers of a lesser artist if there is a
close association with a major figure. That was the case with
Stuart Gilbert, a friend of Joyce who wrote an early book about
``Ulysses.'' After Gilbert's death in 1969, his wife kept the
collection in her apartment in Paris. When the archive was sold to
Texas, Staley discovered a typescript of the first chapter of
``Finnegans Wake'' with corrections written in Joyce's hand. That,
he said, ``was worth more than the whole archive'' of Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes writers and other artists have made discoveries while
exploring archives. Visiting Austin, Stephen Spender found a novel
of his that he had forgotten and had it published. Vanessa Redgrave
came across Tennessee Williams' early play ``Not About
Nightingales'' and was instrumental in having it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Often universities work through intermediaries, some of whom are
book dealers. Often there are widows and widowers and executors.
Naturally, payment varies. ``They talk about million-dollar
collections,'' Staley said. ``I've never been close to that.'' He
said the I.B. Singer collection, one of the most expensive, was
valued at half a million dollars, part of which was paid by a
donor.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he bought the papers of Doris Lessing and Arnold Wesker
and _ a rare Texas acquisition _ Terrence McNally, who was born in
Corpus Christi. What about Friel, whose play is so skeptical about
the sale of literary archives? Staley said he was considering
contacting him about selling his papers to the Ransom center. If
Friel agreed, it would be a case of life contradicting art.

CALIFORNIA CITY   LOOKS FOR WAY TO HONOR SCHULZ
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Concerned about the gravity of Charles
Schulz's health, city leaders say they'll move quickly to honor the
local resident whose ``Peanuts'' characters helped put the city on
the worldwide map.
</P>
<P>
   Possible tributes discussed by a special City Council
subcommittee Tuesday range from a statue of Charlie Brown and
Snoopy to naming a city street for the 77-year-old Schulz, who
recently ended his 50-year career drawing the daily comic strip
that appeared in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz last month said it was becoming too difficult to balance
his cartoon career with his battle against colon cancer. He had
surgery in November and is undergoing chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Schulz's health have been closely guarded. He looked
frail a month after his emergency surgery, but he reportedly is
doing better now as he waits for a second round of chemotherapy to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Janet Condron said some of the proposals for honoring
Schulz have been in the works for a year in anticipation of Schulz'
50th year drawing ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the potential gravity of the situation, we are
stepping up the process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Condron said the panel hopes to come up with several possible
tributes to recommend to the full council within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea that has been proposed is to urge the White House
to honor Schulz with a Kennedy Center award for lifetime
achievement in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Ken Blackman said any tribute should be cleared
through Schulz first. ``It would be tragic to put up something he
didn't approve of,'' Blackman said.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Schulz's wife, Jean, Condron said the
cartoonist is interested in the statue ``but he is not as
interested in a street being named for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Condron earlier said the Kennedy Center honor is clearly one
Schulz would cherish. ``That is something he wants,'' she told the
subcommittee, noting the White House-sponsored award has never been
bestowed upon a cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., has said he will nominate
Schulz for the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, Congress' highest
civilian award, by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, construction is expected to begin this spring on a
17,000-square-foot museum Schulz plans to build to showcase his
half-century of work. The project is expected to take 18 months to
complete.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with whether
Colorado went too far with a law designed to shield patients
entering abortion clinics from abortion protesters and their
message.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 ``bubble law'' created an eight-foot moveable buffer
zone around anyone within 100 feet of any medical facility. A
protester can approach closer than eight feet only by obtaining
permission from the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision, which is expected by June, will
help determine the landscape not only for future protests in
Colorado, but also for states and cities around the country, some
of which already have mandatory buffer zones for
demonstrations.Throughout the arguments, the justices grilled
lawyers representing both the state of Colorado and abortion
protesters in an attempt to strike the proper constitutional
balance between a patient's right to gain access to medical
facilities and the demonstrators' right to express their views
while standing on public streets and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with this law?'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
asked attorney Jay A. Sekulow, representing a group of abortion
foes who challenged the law. ``You can say anything that you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued a similar point: ``You
certainly can convey anything you want to convey orally from a
distance of eight feet. If a patient wants to take a leaflet they
can and it would be the same if it were one foot or eight feet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sekulow, a Washington attorney who specializes in
representing anti-abortion groups, contended that giving patients
the power to muzzle protesters and forbid them to hand out leaflets
and display signs within the eight-foot zone is an unconstitutional
restraint on free speech in a public area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law turns protected speech into a crime,'' he told the
high court.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado Solicitor General Michael McLachlan argued that law
is a minimal intrusion of free-speech rights, since protesters only
face restrictions within the eight-foot zone. If the patient grants
permission, he said, the protesters may speak directly to that
person at length and hand out literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law has no restrictions on what a person can and cannot
say,'' he said, adding that the statute does not ``single out''
those who demonstrate against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Antonin Scalia, one of the court's more conservative justices,
challenged McLachlan's argument that the law was neutrally
written.``I think we know what it's aimed at, which is abortion
protesters,'' Scalia said, adding that counseling someone to
consider the consequences of abortion is ``a totally different
entity when you do it from eight feet away.''Several justices
appeared concerned that the law could was too broadly written.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if there's a labor dispute between nurses and a
hospital?'' Justice Anthony Kennedy asked McLachlan. ``Would this
law still apply?''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan said that the statute would prevent the nurses from
handing out leaflets to people entering the building unless given
permission. His answer prompted Kennedy to call the law
``whimsical'' and ``imprecise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist warned that ``we can't have
this type of law be vague.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case marked the second time the high court has considered
the Colorado law. In 1997, the Supreme Court sent the case back to
the Colorado courts with instructions to consider whether the
statute was constitutional or not in light of two high court
decisions on state laws restricting abortion protests at clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a 36-foot
demonstration-free zone around a Florida clinic. Three years later,
the justices upheld a 15-foot buffer zone around abortion clinic
entrances in New York.But in the New York case, the high court
struck down a judge's order for a ``floating buffer zone''
requiring protesters to stay 15 feet away from patients or staff
members at all times and in all places.The 1993 Colorado law,
affecting protests within 100 feet of clinics, was enacted in
response to what the state's lawyers called ``a history of
obstructive demonstrations'' outside abortion clinics. In his brief
to the court, McLachlan said protesters in effect blockaded clinics
by grabbing, surrounding and yelling at patients.The law was
challenged by Leila Jeanne Hill, Audrey Himmelmann and Everitt
Simpson Jr., who said they merely advised women of alternatives to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Both a Colorado trial court and the state court of appeals
upheld the law.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court building, Hill said she expected the justices
to rule against the law. ``I think we're going to have our First
Amendment rights back this summer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., who helped write the law
as a Colorado state lawmaker, said women should be allowed to make
``one of the most important decisions of their lives'' without fear
of intimidating protesters. ``We don't think it's too great a
burden to ask the protesters not to stand in front of patients and
try to physically or psychologically block them,'' DeGette
said.Abortion-rights advocates said Wednesday scores of abortion
clinics are targets of violence. The Feminist Majority Foundation
said 20 percent of 360 clinics that responded to a 1999 survey said
they experienced incidents such as blockades, invasions, bomb
threats or bombings within the previous year. Eighteen states are
supporting the Colorado statute.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion protesters are being supported by, among others,
the AFL-CIO and the American Civil Liberties Union, which expressed
concern about limits on protest activity.  &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

HEDY LAMARR, 86, HOLLYWOOD TEMPTRESS OF THE '30S AND '40S 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A full-length version, OBIT-LAMARR, has moved.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of
the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930s and '40s,
especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found
dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., Wednesday. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was being investigated, a routine manner in an
unattended death, Steve Olson, a spokesman for the Seminole County
sheriff's office, told The Associated Press. The death was not
suspicious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she earned millions from her movies, she fell upon hard
times and had lived modestly in Florida for many years. Miss Lamarr
was forever identified with ``Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film in which
she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking sequence
that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many parts of
the United States for many years. But even though most Americans
never saw it, ``Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the actress and
shaped her career.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the
daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied
acting with the renowned Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931. She
appeared in a few films before ``Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent film
that was well received in Europe, where it was released as
``Symphonie der Liebe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe,
Miss Kiesler was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz
Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then making tidy profits
by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mandl spent a great deal of
money tracking down and purchasing prints of ``Ecstasy,'' to keep
others from seeing it, but he did not get all the prints.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Nazis seized his factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they
claimed), and Miss Kiesler left him and made her way to London.
There she was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who offered her a contract to
work for MGM, his Hollywood studio, and renamed her Hedy Lamarr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was
promptly banned in New York. For a long time, it seemed as if one
had to be a judge to see ``Ecstasy'': It was the subject of many
court tests in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The star of ``Ecstasy'' arrived in New York in 1937. In 1939 she
made her first American film, ``Algiers,'' with Charles Boyer. Men
fantasized about her, and women began to wear their hair as she
did, parted down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of fellow emigres
like Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich, who won
plaudits for their acting as well as their looks. The reviews of
Miss Lamarr's films all mentioned her beauty, but when the scripts
called on her to act, the critics were not nearly as kind.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Lamarr's early Hollywood films were ``Comrade X''
(1940) with Clark Gable; ``Boom Town''(1940), also with Gable;
``Ziegfeld Girl''(1941), with Judy Garland and Lana Turner, and
``Tortilla Flat'' (1942), with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield.
When she purred ``I am Tondelayo,'' in ``White Cargo'' (1942), the
phrase became grist for comedians. (Jack Benny had a running gag
about an imaginary salesgirl named Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.) But she
was considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down
memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (``Laura'') and Ingrid
Bergman (``Casablanca'' and ``Gaslight.'')
</P>
<P>
   In one of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the
ultimate haircut in ``Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949
epic. Her movies after ``Samson and Delilah'' included ``Copper
Canyon'' (1950); ``Lady Without Passport'' (1950); ``My Favorite
Spy'' (1951); ``The Story of Mankind'' (1957), and ``The Female
Animal'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   In early 1939, Miss Lamarr met Gene Markey, a writer and
producer in Hollywood, and they eloped to Mexico. She divorced
Markey the following year. Her other marriages, to John Loder, the
British actor; Teddy Stauffer, a former band leader who ran a
nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas oilman, and
Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer, all ended in divorce. She
adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, a son,
Anthony, and a daughter, Denise. They all survive her.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, Miss Lamarr met George Antheil, the composer
of ``Ballet Mecanique,'' at a Hollywood dinner party. They
discussed the war, and Miss Lamarr recalled hearing conversations
that had occurred between Mandl and the Nazis, who seemed to place
great value on creating a device that would permit the radio
control of airborne torpedoes, with no chance of jamming. The idea,
she and Antheil decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending
synchronized radio signals on various wave lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Antheil supplied the technical expertise, and on Aug. 11, 1942,
the two received a U.S. patent for the use of radio-controlled
missiles. The government was not initially interested in their
device, but a refined version of it was used by the U.S. military
in the 1960s _ after the patent had expired. They never made a
dime, but in 1996, they were honored for their work by a
professional engineering society.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lamarr was involved in several lawsuits over the years. One
was against a Los Angeles department store that had accused her of
shoplifting (she was acquitted of the charge, but her lawsuit
against the store was dismissed). Another involved a repairman for
the Los Angeles School District who, she said, had tried to rape
her. He sued her for causing his false arrest, and the court
ordered her to pay him $15,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, she directed several lawsuits against the
publisher and ghostwriter of her autobiography, ``Ecstasy and Me,
My Life as a Woman.'' She said the book was ``deliberately written
as an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy,
sensual, lecherous, lustful and scarlet version'' of her life. Her
suit failed. At about the same time, the state of California sued
her for $26,000 in back taxes it claimed she owed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, she was again accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of
personal care items from a drug store), but she was not prosecuted.
In recent years, Miss Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando.
Friends said she was legally blind and did not venture out on her
own.

BOOK TALK: NO SHORTAGE OF FIRST NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the great conglomeration of book publishing began, one of
the major bleats in the industry was that in the drive for brawny
bottom lines, the first novel would become an endangered breed, as
everyone scrambled for blockbusters to please the suits who were
taking over. Like much of the whining, that turned out not to be
true. Of course, stalking the big-bang novel is always a must, but
a casual roll call of the houses this week shows that some
publishing schedules for 2000 are bursting with first novels, both
literary and commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Hardcover first novels are risky. Some people feared that
consolidation meant a loss of literary opportunity for new authors
because the bigger the company, the greater the emphasis would be
on the less chancy best-selling authors and celebrities. That was
the position taken by the Authors Guild, among others, when
Bertelsmann, the German media group that already owned Bantam
Doubleday Dell, purchased Random House Inc. two summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   What was ignored then was this singular version of supply and
demand: Long-standing literary and commercial fiction voices are
maturing, and many of them have reached a plateau economically and
critically. So new voices are needed and are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest eruption is from the very company that caused the
whimpering in the first place, Random House. Its eponymous Random
House division, consisting of the Random House and Villard
imprints, the very headlight of the mammoth publishing engine, will
bring out 24 first novels this year. It published seven in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, the division of Random House with the most distinguished
history of introducing new novelists _ including John Updike, Toni
Morrison, Ann Rice and Anne Tyler _ is publishing 18 in 2000, twice
last year's number. The company's Bantam Dell division has 13 first
novels, and its Doubleday Broadway division has 8. (The Random
House division is so charged up to make its first-novel list a
success that it has started a minimagazine, Fiction at Random,
which will have short profiles of its new novelists for sales
representatives to give to bookstores.)
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers are continuing long traditions of gambling on
high-quality first novels, among them Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
which is also owned by a German publishing concern, Holtzbrinck,
and Grove/Atlantic, independently owned.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that no corporate strategy can really stifle the
flow of first novels. That is because most people who go into book
editing do so precisely for the joy of discovery. Ann Godoff, the
Random House publisher, said: ``Publishing first novels is the
biggest crap shoot in the business, but it's also the most exciting
thing: to find first fiction and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Pavlon, a young editor at Knopf, said the adventure of
the discovery of the first novel was what attracted her to
publishing. ``What I like is the chance to participate in a
writer's beginning and to really build a career,'' she said. ``I
see a first novel very much long term, not as one book, but
contrary to popular opinion a way in which to build a long-term
relationship with an author.'' (With the relatively recent trend of
editors and authors pinballing from publishing house to house,
that's not always easy or even possible.)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, first novels have an initial printing of 8,000 to
15,000 copies; authors' advances are often about $10,000, depending
upon the breadth of rights the publisher has purchased. John
Glusman, executive editor at Farrar, Strauss, said, ``If we do a
first novel smartly, we can make some money, and that's our way of
doing things.'' And there is money to be made if the advance is not
too high, the house prints the right number of copies, and the
marketing is carefully calibrated.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's an investment in the future. We want to build a
new list; that's essential. Where are the great writers of the
future? We want literary first novels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some first novels are purchased with great expectations. For
instance, Ms. Pavlon has a first novel by Nomi Eves, as yet
untitled, that Knopf, outbidding eight other publishers, bought for
a mid-six-figure advance and will publish in September, with a
100,000-copy first printing. The novel spans 200 years in the life
of a Jewish family.
</P>
<P>
   A very few first novels make the best-seller lists. The only
first novel on the current New York Times hardcover best-seller
list is the first of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, ``The
Sorcerer's Stone'' (Levine/Scholastic).
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Entrekin, publisher of Grove/Atlantic, which has had some
great successes with first novels (for instance, ``Cold Mountain''
by Charles Frazier, a huge best seller in 1997 and 1998) tries to
sign up his first novelists for two books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less continuity now,'' he said. ``Writers don't stay
with their publishers because often their editors don't stay. If I
can sign the writer for more than one book, this allows me to
support the first book in a more aggressive way that I might
otherwise be justified in doing. It creates more of a sense that
the publisher and author are partners. The publisher may not make
money on the first book, but it establishes the writer in a way
that they may make money on the second book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want something hot and new,'' he said. ``It's the
nature of the culture, and because of that companies are run now
with a little more bottom-line concern, so you can't bring a writer
along too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ship 10,000 copies, you want to sell at least 8,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlantic Monthly Press has one first novel this spring that
it expects to help the bottom line as a best seller: ``In the
Fall,'' by Jeffrey Lent. It is a story of three generations of an
interracial family, from the end of the Civil War to the
Depression. The novel, wit a first printing of 100,000 copies, has
already been sold in six countries and to a paperback publisher and
is a Book-of-the-Month Club main selection. It was edited by
Elisabeth Schmitz, who discovered and edited ``Cold Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of all this is to keep pecking away at your personal
computer. There's a growing market for first novels, and there may
be a yearning editor looking for you.

 &HT;    `Skip' and co-star Muniz lap up limelight
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Frankie Muniz is scampering on his hands and
knees in the seventh-floor hallway of the Four Seasons Hotel. The
14-year-old actor _ who's diminutive for his age and frankly looks
11 _ is trying to make eye contact with a supremely self-possessed
Jack Russell terrier named Enzo, who regards Muniz and his antics,
sniffs, turns and provides the boy an unfettered view of his doggie
derriere.
</P>
<P>
   For being a dog and all, Enzo's playing it cool. ``He's just
like a dignified old man,'' says a representative for Warner Bros.
``Very prim and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps peevish. Enzo, who stars with Muniz in the new family
film ``My Dog Skip,'' which opens Friday, is on a multicity junket
to flog product. He's working. He has a chaperone. He has to wear a
leash. Not to mention the Warner Bros. people neglected to get
regular bottled water _ not the gross fizzy kind _ for Enzo's
lapping delight.
</P>
<P>
   A studio rep gets on the phone and dials room service
lickety-split. ``Enzo,'' she says, covering the mouthpiece, ``I
apologize. I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Enzo wants my bagel. No, no, Enzo, blurts his vaguely frazzled
trainer. So Enzo stuffs his head in my crotch. Stroke me, he begs.
Aaaah.
</P>
<P>
   Where is everybody? Enzo is whisked off by his entourage, down
the hall to another suite, where he and Muniz will have their
picture taken. Muniz plops on the couch. He's a slight, chirpy kid
with wide, animated blue eyes crowned by caterpillar eyebrows. He
not only stars in ``My Dog Skip'' but he also has his own TV show,
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a midseason Fox comedy that's getting
rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   At his master's behest, Enzo, all 20 pounds of him, hops up next
to Muniz. The dog is equal parts mutt and martinet.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer flanks the photographer, guiding every Enzo move
with a hand stuffed with yummies. Enzo's gestures are crisp and
tight, choreographed. His liquid black eyes, alert and unblinking,
follow the trainer's hand above the photographer's head. The
trainer sings, ``Kittykittykitty,'' and Enzo is fixed in hypnotic
docility. The dog has sold his soul for a beef kibble.
</P>
<P>
   Enzo (named after a French king, aptly) deserves quality water,
random neck scratches and Scooby snacks. He's stupendous in ``My
Dog Skip'' as a pet that's more than a pet _ he's the sentimental
catalyst for a young boy's growing up. He aids undersized Willie
(Muniz) in making friends, playing football and (good dog!) meeting
a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changes my life,'' says Muniz, now sitting next to co-star
Luke Wilson (``Rushmore''), who plays neighborhood hero Dink
Jenkins in the film. Based on the 1995 Willie Morris memoir about
his boyhood in '40s Mississippi, ``Skip'' also features Kevin Bacon
and Diane Lane as Willie's parents.
</P>
<P>
   His sneaker-shod feet barely touching the carpet, Muniz
confesses he hasn't read Morris' book (``I recommend you start
lying about that right now,'' cracks Wilson), but he did play a
tape of Morris reading his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to it in the car so I could get the Southern
accent, because I'm from New York,'' Muniz says. ``I went to his
house and we had lunch. He'd make me talk Southern. Every word I
messed up he'd go 'Wup!' and make me do it again. For hours.
Baseball and football were the two hardest words. I would say it
like 'basebwal.' It was cool though. We ate crawfish and moon pies.
He was the greatest guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris died of a heart attack in August, but not before he saw
the finished film and gushed about Muniz's portrayal. ``Oh, he
loved it,'' Muniz says. ``He called us right after he saw it,
saying, `That was my life on the screen!' He was crying. I'm really
happy he got to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, looking bored, finds a way to break Muniz's monopoly on
the interview: dishing doggie dirt. First, some background: Enzo's
dad is Moose, who plays Eddie on the sitcom ``Frasier.'' On the
show Enzo, 4 1/2, does backup work for Moose, 9, and Moose plays
the elder Skip in the new movie. Both dogs are the size of a small
duffel bag, covered in bristly white fur with brown spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you some Hollywood gossip,'' Wilson says in a
conspiratorial hush. ``Moose and Enzo, father and son, hate each
other. Hate each other. They live in the same house, but the yard
is separated. Can you believe it?'' Enzo's trainer confirms that
just one look at each other incites mutual snarls.
</P>
<P>
   All heads turn to this very complex hound. Enzo yawns.

   Growing Pineapple
</P>
<P>
   Q. My daughter decided she needs her own bedroom plant, and of
all things, she wanted to grow a pineapple. Luckily, we all love
pineapple because we have now eaten three in order to get the tops
for her to start, all without success. Each time we have been
careful to keep a thin layer of fruit attached to the leaves. She
suspended one on toothpicks over water, like an avocado pit;
immersed another in water up to the leaves; and planted the third
in good garden soil. I don't mind eating another one, but she is
becoming disenchanted and I would like this one actually to grow.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Then eat all of the fruit so it doesn't have a chance to
ferment and eventually rot, killing the top. Once you have a fresh
top, minus the fruit, leave the larger, spiky leaves alone, but
pull a quarter of the small lower leaves down and off, exposing the
stem, where you'll see small brown bumps called root initials _ the
structures that will become the new roots.
</P>
<P>
   Let the top dry overnight, and then bury it up to the remaining
leaves in a well-drained medium in a 4- to 6-inch pot and place it
in a humid, sunny spot where the daytime temperature is around 75.
Keep it moist but not wet, and new leaves should start growing in
about a month. Once the plant is established, give it fertilizer
diluted to half-strength twice a month during the growing season,
spring to fall. If it reminds you of a bromeliad at the florist,
that's because it is a bromeliad, and the fruit will form in the
top center of the leaves, just like a bromeliad's flower spike.
</P>
<P>
   But not right away. It will take several years, as many as five,
before it is ready to flower and fruit. In the meantime it will
grow and your daughter can practice the art of re-potting and
lugging it outdoors for the summer. By the time it is ready to
produce fruit, it will be in a 2- or 3-gallon pot, she will be an
expert at bromeliad care and, with luck, everyone will still love
eating pineapple. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Long Night to Flower
</P>
<P>
   Q. I always buy a kalanchoe for a little color in the winter,
and then I always have to throw it out because I can't get it to
bloom again. It seems such a waste. Can I get it to flower again?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is nothing quite like coming in from a bitter winter
day and seeing the mass of bright red flowers of a kalanchoe
(pronounced kal-an-KO-ee). Even the variations on red that are
available _ the softer apricot, deeper magenta or singular yellow _
brighten both the room and your soul. Compact, bushy and about a
foot tall, kalanchoe is common in winter, but once the flowers
disappear many people abandon them. That's a shame, because with a
little effort they can be forced to bloom whenever you want.
</P>
<P>
   Kalanchoe is what is known as a short-day plant, but it is
really the length of the night that matters. For kalanchoe to set
flower buds, it needs 6 to 8 weeks of days with 14 to 16 hours of
uninterrupted darkness. And uninterrupted means exactly that, so
you'll have to put it in the closet every afternoon, over in the
corner where your poinsettia spends the fall, since it needs the
same treatment. Pick the right closet, because anything in it you
might need won't be available until morning. About a month after
the dark period ends, color should be showing as the buds begin to
break.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, kalanchoe is a cinch to grow, given lots of sun
(except when it's in the closet). It thrives in warmth, 65 degrees
or more, although it tolerates temperatures just above freezing. It
should have the chance to go a bit dry between waterings, and it
likes a general fertilizer every two or three weeks when new leaves
are growing.
</P>
<P>
   When it gets too big, it can be cut back pretty hard _ leaving
only three leaves on each branch. If you do cut it back, wait until
it has at least three pairs of new leaves on each branch (about two
to three months) before tossing it back in the closet to initiate
flowering.  &QL;

`JEFFERSONS' BROKE GROUND 25 YEARS AGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BENNY LEE SMITH   
 Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this week that George and Louise ``Weezy''
Jefferson first moved ``on up'' into that deluxe apartment in the
television sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hilarious show,'' said Nick at Nite General Manager
Cyma Zaghami. ``I think the show really did pave the way for how
African-Americans were portrayed on television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jeffersons,'' which is aired weeknights at 10:30 on Nick
at Nite, was a spinoff of the groundbreaking ``All in the Family''
show. Norman Lear came up with the idea for both sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeffersons story started with the family being neighbors of
Archie and Edith Bunker. When George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley) is
blessed with a newfound fortune, it enables him to expand his
Queens-based, dry-cleaning business to include three more
locations.
</P>
<P>
   George takes the opportunity to move his wife, Louise (Isabel
Sanford), and their son, Lionel (Mike Evans, later replaced by
Damon Evans), to a luxurious Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the move was made on ``All in the Family,'' ``The
Jeffersons'' moved on Jan. 18, 1975 to their own CBS series and
lived the high life with friends and family for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those characters included television's first interracial couple,
upstairs neighbors, Tom and Helen Willis (Franklin Cover and Roxie
Roker); their daughter, Jenny Willis Jefferson (Berlinda Tolbert);
Jefferson's wise-cracking maid, Florence Johnson (Marla Gibbs);
tip-hungry doorman Ralph Hart (Ned Wertimer); neighbor Harry
Bentley (Paul Benedict); and Mother Jefferson (Zara Cully).
</P>
<P>
   To discover how much the personalities of Hemsley and Sanford
were like their characters', ask their publicist of more than 20
years Brad Lemack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isabel is exactly what you see Weezy be in the show,'' Lemack
said in an interview from Beverly Hills, Calif. ``She is a very
warm and genuinely funny person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford won the only Emmy Award for the show as Best Actress in
a Comedy Series in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Lemack said Hemsley is a great person to be around, but is quite
different from his character. ``He is very shy and a quiet guy who
loves his music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley spends leisure time writing his own New Age-type music.
</P>
<P>
   Lemack said the show's popularity has rebounded with the airing
of Old Navy commercials featuring Hemsley and Sanford and reruns of
``The Jeffersons'' on Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We receive all of their fan mail and I can tell you that the
volume is higher than it's been since the height of show,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some fan mail comes from people who grew up watching
the episodes, most comes from young Americans who are seeing the
show for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the series ended, Hemsley and Sanford have appeared in
commercials, feature films and television sitcoms. They have just
finished taping their fifth commercial for Old Navy and they have
performed voice-overs for AT&AMP;T and Lipton tea. They also make guest
appearances separately on television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Lemack said he didn't know of an official party commemorating
the show's anniversary. Instead, ``they celebrate the success of
the show every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said when Lear developed the idea of the show, Sanford
initially didn't want to do it. She wanted to continue playing the
character as Louise Jefferson on ``All in the Family,'' but later
decided to try the new show.
</P>
<P>
   Lemack said much credit for the show's success belongs to Lear
and the many writers who came up with episode after episode.
</P>
<P>
   Each week for 10 years, actors in the show held to a rigorous
schedule starting on Wednesday and going through the next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdays, they would sit around the table and read the next
script.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be their first look at the scripts and I can tell
you from being there with them that these days were always so
funny,'' he said. After the read, writers would make changes and
the actors would rehearse in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsals were also held on Thursday and Friday afternoons.
Then, the actors would go home for the weekend and learn their
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays were set aside for ``blocking,'' when the director would
tell the actors where to be when delivering the different lines for
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays were taping days. The show was taped twice with two
different audiences and the best clips from each were edited
together to form the episodes, Lemack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show was not just about ethnicity or color. It
was about people and how they responded to life situations,''
Lemack said.

MUSIC FAN CREATES MAGAZINE WITH A LONE STAR: TEXAS TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thing about Texas music, says Stewart Ramser, is that no
matter where you go in this big ol' world, people love it.
</P>
<P>
   In his travels for the business-information services provider
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, Ramser visited 15 countries in Europe and South
America. Everywhere he went, music fans were interested in the
music we take for granted: He saw a sold-out Willie Nelson show in
Stockholm, Sweden, and he saw Delbert McClinton, Chris Duarte, Ian
Moore and others slay crowds in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere, he says, there was a mystique to Texas' culture
and music. Mention the state and its musicians, and people's faces
would light up, whether they were in Argentina or Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   And one day in 1998, Ramser _ who by then was about to earn his
master's degree in business administration at UCLA _ had an idea,
one that it's hard to believe nobody had had before. He'd start a
magazine covering nothing but Texas music, its present, its future
and its past, from Lyle Lovett to Little Joe to Terri Hendrix to
the Texas A&AMP;M University marching band and beyond. Way beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As the new century begins, that dream is reality: The premiere
issue of ``Texas Music'' officially debuted Jan. 1 and is already,
says editor and publisher Ramser, selling thousands of copies off
newsstands, mainly in Austin, Houston and the Metroplex, and has
attracted more than 500 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've far exceeded our expectations on newsstand sales,
subscriptions and advertising,'' Ramser says. ``We're in good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The premiere issue features articles on Lovett, Hendrix, the
death of Bobby Fuller, the A&AMP;M band, ``Austin City Limits,''
Americana taking root in Archer City and Bob Wills _ as well as
reviews and a calendar of events. It's the product of a 1 1/2 years
of work by Ramser _ hiring staff, making industry contacts and
feeling out last March at South by Southwest what the response
might be to such a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine is also the product of Ramser's love of Texas
music and his travels around the country and the world. He
graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1992 with a
double major (finance and international business) and for the next
four years traveled for Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, doing internal consulting
and auditing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in 15 countries in four years, and when I was overseas I
always saw a great level of interest in Texas artists,'' he says.
``I was living in Paris for a while, and there was a club right
around the corner, Chesterfield's, that played Texas artists all
summer. They'd come to South by Southwest and book the talent and
an artist would play 14 nights in a row. I'd be there almost every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramser returned to the United States for good in 1996 and
enrolled at UCLA. He was just shy of his degree when, on vacation
in Hawaii, he heard a DJ ``talking about Texas music and how great
it is and I realized, `I wish I'd been able to stay more in touch
with Texas music. How could I do that?' And I immediately thought
of a magazine. I began writing a business plan in school, and I
decided to go back to Texas to get this thing started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd spend a year building the idea and seeing if it
would fly; we got such great response. Everyone we talked to said,
`This is a great idea.' There was such a need and so much interest,
I knew I'd regret not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next issue will be in some major markets in six weeks
(Ramser said the cover story is still up in the air) but Ramser
said the magazine will go from being a quarterly to a monthly in
two years, tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of money on the first issue, but now we're
getting interest from investors,'' Ramser says. ``The real risk
was, `Can we put out a great product that'll get a great start?' I
hope we can just give exposure to Texas artists and Texas music of
all genres.''

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have ever done research in a library, you have probably
encountered this annoying situation: You've found a paragraph of
helpful information in an otherwise useless book. There is no point
in lugging the book home for the sake of those 300 words.
</P>
<P>
   So you face two choices: transcribe the paragraph by hand or
trot over to the photocopy machine, stand in line, fish around for
change and make three copies the wrong size before getting one that
captures what you want.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of handheld gadgets offers a third option: scan
in the 300 words with a wireless pen-size scanner, tuck the scanner
into a pocket and transfer the data to your computer when you get
home.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds ideal. Simply holding one of these lightweight
scanners, sometimes called digital highlighters, can conjure up
visions of superior organization skills.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, you might think, you will be rolling these scanners over
phone numbers from the Yellow Pages and over Web addresses too
cumbersome to jot down. There will be no more need to clip calendar
information from magazines _ you will just scan it in.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the scanners are not quite so easy to use, but they
do show promise for researchers and mobile professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The first step, running the digital highlighters over the
desired text, takes a little bit of practice before you can get a
clean copy. And transferring that data to a computer can be
difficult for people who are not accustomed to crawling under their
desks or moving furniture to plug extra appliances into their PCs.
As with any new technology, these scanners require patience and a
willingness to tinker.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of them are now on the market: the C Pen from C
Technologies, the Pocket Reader from Siemens and the QuickLink Pen
from Wizcom Technologies. They are lightweight (about three ounces
each), include batteries (two AAAs) and are comfortable enough to
remind you of holding one of those chunky pencils in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Each pen has a tiny display screen and comes with software that
lets you transfer text from the scanner to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Reader is a good choice for people who want a
no-frills version. The other two are laden with features like
address books and Web-link databases. (The makers of the C Pen, for
example, are calling it a new kind of personal digital assistant.)
That makes them simultaneously more flexible yet more complicated
to use.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Reader is being marketed as an inexpensive option for
budget-conscious students. It sells for about $100 and is so easy
to use that you won't need the manual to get started. But it does
not let you organize your scanned data into files or edit the
scanned text on the pen's display screen, as the other two do.
</P>
<P>
   The C Pen comes in two versions, both packed with features. For
$200, you can get the C Pen 200, which comes with an address book.
The C Pen 600 costs $249 and, in addition to having an address
book, translates words into different languages.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions can also write as well as read. (To write the
letter A, for example, put the pen tip on a printed page and move
the pen as if you were drawing an oversize A.)
</P>
<P>
   But to transfer the data to a PC or laptop, the C Pen requires
an infrared port _ something that many computers, particularly
desktops, do not have unless you have installed an infrared
adapter.
</P>
<P>
   The QuickLink Pen, which sells for $149, also includes an
address book, but its display screen is cursed with a confusing
interface, and its editing software makes users jump through hoops
before seeing and editing the notes they have scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, when I tested the pen, I was plagued with technical
glitches while trying to send data to my PC. On the brighter side,
the pen can be adapted to scan data into tables, spreadsheets or
customized databases. (It also comes with a pen cap that will no
doubt be lost within a few days of use.)
</P>
<P>
   Most critical, of course, is how accurately these scanners can
record text _ a capacity known in technical circles as optical
character recognition. To find out, I headed for my cookbook shelf,
hoping to find a better way to accomplish a task I had tripped over
a few weeks ago, before a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for the trip, I found that I needed to pack a
soup recipe for a Christmas Eve meal. I was not about to add the
cookbook to my soon-to-be-overstuffed suitcase, but I did not have
a handheld scanner. So I carried the cookbook to work, photocopied
the recipe and then toted the book back home.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, with the digital highlighters in hand, I
realized that copying recipes could become much less of a chore. I
selected a recipe more suited to my immediate craving, Ben &AMP;
Jerry's hot butterscotch sauce for coffee ice cream, and sat down
to scan.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately gained a new appreciation for old-fashioned
highlighters. Those pens are forgiving. You can run that pastel
streak across a line of text, waver a little, maybe even catch only
half a word, and still get all you need. When you return to the
text, you immediately see what you meant to highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Digital highlighters, in contrast, require a steady hand and a
meticulousness that does not quite fit with the notion of saving
time. They also, by design, do not give you the advantage of
context; when you look at the scanned text later, you are looking
at it in isolation, so you cannot glance at the page to fill in any
blanks.
</P>
<P>
   The digital scanner lets you avoid carrying that page, and the
book that holds it, but there is a price for that convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't expect to zip over those references to
cups of sugar and sticks of butter. That pinch of salt might come
out as an inch of salt instead.
</P>
<P>
   With the C Pen, I ended up repeating some of the recipe
(``increase the heat,'' ``increase the heat''), after I noticed
that one line had not been scanned correctly. With QuickLink,
unsalted butter became unsalted ``bueeer.'' With the Pocket Reader,
stirring became ``stiwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those blips, however, all three pens performed
relatively well. The three versions of the recipe were legible, and
they took only a few minutes to scan and transfer to a PC. Quick
editing on the computer mended any damage.
</P>
<P>
   In another test, I glided the pens over a listing in the
eye-straining weekly calendar in The New Yorker. (Bizarre body art,
in case you didn't know, is now on display at the American Museum
of Natural History.)
</P>
<P>
   This time, the scanners faltered. They picked up the words
``nose ornament'' but garbled pertinent details like the museum's
hours and address and the dates of the exhibition. The tiny point
size (and my struggles to align the tip of each pen exactly with
the text) wreaked the havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the digital highlighters acknowledge the
limitations. For now, they say, the scanners may be mostly used by
professionals who spend a lot of their time transferring printed
words to computers _ and who have the time to get used to the
scanners' quirks.
</P>
<P>
   QuickLink, for example, is talking to the European Community
about using the pen to scan serial numbers from paper bills of the
euro and then compare them with numbers in databases to track
counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tesluk, chief executive of Siemens' Pocket Reader division,
said he expected that more people would find a need for the
scanners as the devices' capabilities improved. The scanners will
also start becoming popular, he said, when more people see others
using them _ whether for butterscotch recipes or for taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When personal digital assistants first came out, people looked
at them and said, `Do I really need this thing?,''' Tesluk said.
``Now it's hard to find someone without a Palm or other device. I
think that's the same path that this will follow as well.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was raised to believe that status meant having enough money to
pay list price for just about everything. Of course, I also was
raised to believe that if you wear pajamas with elastic cuffs, your
skin won't be able to breathe. But I have slept in sweat pants for
years without clogging my pores.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I heard about a site called www.nextag.com, where
shoppers can bargain simultaneously with a number of merchants for
merchandise that ranges from computers to books. In real life, I
would have never dared walk into a bookstore and offer to pay a
lower price than the one printed on the dust jacket. In the
cyberworld, however, that's exactly what Nextag.com seemed to
suggest. I decided to see if I could negotiate a better price on a
children's novel called ``Magic by the Lake,'' by Edward Eager
(Harcourt Brace, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it worked: the site listed prices from 10 online
booksellers, ranging from $7.39 to $11 (including tax and shipping)
and for the sake of comparison even included prices from some
sellers (like Amazon, Borders, Powell's) who do not negotiate.
Three of the merchants that indicated that they had the book in
stock _ 1Bookstreet, Kingbooks.com and AlphaCraze.com _ were
willing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   That is, their software was willing to bargain. The 50 merchants
who list about 2 million items on the site automate most of their
negotiation responses. In response to a buyer's offer, the software
may be programmed to drop prices a lot or a little _ or not at all
_ depending on factors like inventory availability and the amount a
buyer offers. Merchants can update their response strategies daily.
After a buyer and a seller agree, Nextag processes the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   I typed my offer _ $6 _ into the query box and sent it to all
three. Since I didn't know how to bargain, I figured I had nothing
to lose, not even my dignity, since I was not negotiating directly
with a human who would see my hands shaking.
</P>
<P>
   One merchant did not drop its price. But the others did, to
$7.12 and $7.94 respectively. I increased my offer slightly. In
response, both posted messages in my negotiation chart's ``status''
column to inform me that their current offers were final. Were they
bluffing? To buy time, I went to the pop psychology site
www.emode.com and took a multiple choice test to find out what
breed of dog I would be. Pekingese. That was not good news. So I
went back to Nextag.com and raised my offer a few more cents, but
neither seller budged.
</P>
<P>
   I had managed to bring the price down, however, if only by
pennies. So I ordered the book from 1Bookstreet for $7.12. As soon
as I did, a funny thing happened. I realized I suddenly had a new
definition of status: saving 27 cents. Liberated from a lifetime of
catering to retailers' pricing whims, I was now in control. I felt
that heady adrenaline rush that meant 27 cents wasn't just 27 cents
anymore. No, it was power. And it was mine.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd that I felt as if I had just uncovered some big
secret, since bargaining used to be a way of life, just not my
life. Whereas shoppers in other countries still routinely dicker
over such everyday purchases as eggs and elasticized pajamas, the
tradition has largely disappeared from the United States over the
last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   To find out why, I phoned Arun K. Jain, chairman of the
marketing department at the State University at Buffalo, who has
studied retailing practices extensively. ``When most shoppers
started to shop in department stores with fixed price tags,'' he
said, ``that's when the fixed-price concept came in.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, shoppers lost the knack of bargaining. Gayle Marco,
an associate professor of marketing at Robert Morris College in
Pittsburgh, explained why. ``To be really good at it, you have to
sit back and watch a master, someone like my mother, who can still
tell you how much she paid for a kitchen table decades ago,'' she
said. ``These days, most people lack experience. That's why a
strategy like GM Saturn's `no-dicker sticker' was so successful a
few years ago. It appealed to people who felt they would be taken
advantage of if they negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has created a new kind of marketplace, where
bargaining may once again become routine, as evidenced by the
growing popularity of auction sites like Ebay.com and Haggle.com.
Online, where you can find a slew of information like price
histories and product reviews and comparative prices.
</P>
<P>
   If you use them, you can save money. Of course, there's no
guarantee. In October, I felt smug about using the Internet to find
a 32-inch television I wanted for $647. Last week, I learned that
by using Nextag I could have saved an additional $17. It wasn't the
$17 that made me sick; it was the principle. If all prices are
always negotiable, what's the bottom? When is it safe to buy?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Bradley, Nextag's vice president for sales and customer
service, explained it this way: ``Think of it like the airlines
industry. The airlines give one price for tickets, then they can
lower it based on demand or inventory to an individual because the
rest of the world doesn't know that one passenger got the ticket
for $30 cheaper, or even $300 cheaper. Our merchants do the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you rush off to Nextag.com, however, you should know
about the site's drawbacks as well. For one thing, there is no
shopping basket ( Bradley said one will be added at some point).
Therefore, you cannot buy multiple items simultaneously, a practice
that generally reduces the shipping costs of each item. Also, make
sure that you know what you are buying. Although I tried to compare
Nextag's prices on iMacs to the suggested retail prices in the
Apple Store at www.apple.com, I could not tell from the
descriptions of the products' specifications whether I was buying
Apples or oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could just march into a real store, armed with
prices you found online, and negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The more I thought about that possibility, the better it
sounded. Earlier this week, I used Nextag.com to find the best
online prices for five other books I wanted. I printed the list and
drove to my local bookstore, primed to negotiate. But by the time I
got there, I was a little nervous. Frankly, I was hoping that the
snooty sales clerk with the ponytail would have the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, I browsed the shelves first, confirming my suspicions
that online prices were lower. I tried to convince myself that this
was outrageous, hoping to work up some useful bargaining
adrenaline. But as I approached the checkout counter, I was
thinking, ``I hope I don't end up making a scene or seeing someone
I know. . . . Will I look cheap? Will my voice crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the counter was the sales clerk with the ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I help you?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks,'' I said, and went home to order the books online.

FEROCIOUS BUZZ AT SUNDANCE, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 1,700 films applied to be part of this year's Sundance
Film Festival, which kicks off its 10-day run Thursday night in the
snowy valleys of Utah's Wasatch Range.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 850 films were entered in the dramatic competition alone,
a number the judges had to winnow to 16. In the documentary
competition, 347 films were entered, up from 210 last year, and 15
made the cut. Driven by the Internet's growing hunger for short
films and by the increasing use of the form as a steppingstone to
feature-film careers, some 2,000 shorts were submitted, several
hundred more than last year. Only 65 were selected.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a growing number of people out there want to be
filmmakers. And many of them will be found this coming week,
wearing parkas and frazzled looks, on the icy, traffic-choked
streets of Park City.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive at a tricky moment. A glut of movies, a scarcity of
available art-house screens and a growing number of
independent-flavored films from Hollywood studios have made it
increasingly difficult for novices to attract notice and gain a
foothold. ``The Blair Witch Project'' notwithstanding, the
projections are bleak for most newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Gilmore, co-director of the festival, estimates that
less than 10 percent of the films sent to the festival will have a
significant theatrical distribution, which means that a lot of life
savings will have been invested in films that end up sitting on
someone's shelf.
</P>
<P>
   So Sundance provides some sobering data for the aspiring
filmmaker. It also provides a kind of yearly barometer of the state
of the independent movement, a glimpse at the indie zeitgeist, at
what filmmakers are thinking about today.
</P>
<P>
   Among the premieres this year that are generating the most
pre-festival buzz _ something that can be had for the price of a
press agent but may actually signify substance _ are ``Joe Gould's
Secret,'' directed by and starring Stanley Tucci, the story of the
relationship between Joseph Mitchell, a former writer for The New
Yorker, and one of his profile subjects; ``American Psycho,'' the
director Mary Harron's adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel;
``Rated X,'' directed by and starring Emilio Estevez, about the
porn-producing Mitchell Brothers; ``Love and Basketball,'' directed
by Gina Prince-Bythewood in her filmmaking debut; and ``Trixie,'' a
combination film noir and screwball comedy directed by Alan
Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In the festival's dramatic competition, Marc Forster directs
``Everything Put Together,'' a film about a family tragedy; Karyn
Kusama directs ``Girlfight,'' about a young female boxer; Jon Shear
directs ``Urbania,'' about a young man who suddenly remembers an
early experience of abuse; and Kenneth Lonergan directs ``You Can
Count on Me,'' a drama about estranged siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary competition includes Fenton Bailey and Randy
Barbato's ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' about the former wife of the
television evangelist; Daniel McCabe and Paul Stekler's ``George
Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire,'' about the former Alabama
governor; Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's ``Paragraph 175,''
about homosexuals caught up in the Holocaust; and Frances Reid and
Deborah Hoffmann's ``Long Night's Journey Into Day,'' about the
South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many more films will be offered in the festival's other
categories _ American Spectrum, dedicated to emerging filmmakers;
World Cinema; Native Forum, which features films by Native American
directors; and the Midnight Madness series, for the quirkier
entries (the source of ``Blair Witch'' last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a real distinctiveness to the work this
year,'' Gilmore said. ``We really don't see the kind of
20-something angst films or the Quentin Tarantino wannabes that we
used to see. Filmmakers have come to understand that being
derivative is not necessarily going to help them find
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sundance officials say they choose the films entirely
on merit and with no eye toward any sort of cohesive theme for the
festival, there are some distinctive elements in this year's
lineup. Most readily apparent, significantly more women are among
the directors represented _ some 40 of the festival's 113 features
have female directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a trend or is it a one-year fluke?'' said Nicole
Guillemet, president of the Sundance Institute and co-director of
the festival. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sundance is expanding its digital capabilities, for the
first time offering filmmakers the option of having films shown
with a digital projector. Only a handful have accepted, leading
Gilmore to suspect that the incursion of digital filmmaking into
the independent world will be more gradual than some pro-digital
optimists have predicted.

 UNDATED: have predicted.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a growing sense in film circles that America's
independent film movement is a victim of its own success over the
last decade, and that this has altered the calculus of independent
filmmaking and with it the nature of Sundance. The feeling is that
the festival, the independent world's leading annual event, has
turned more mainstream, more commercial and, some complain, more
likely to include films that are a little less astonishing and
adventurous than in the past. If a filmmaker's reach cannot exceed
his grasp, then what's a Sundance for?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that the distribution companies are buying
fewer and fewer films, because it's more difficult to be successful
with a small, independent film,'' said Jason Kliot, president of
Open City Films and its newly formed digital subsidiary, Blow Up
Films. ``The bar has been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Kliot and his partner, Joana Vicente, have taken four films to
Sundance in five years, two of which (``Welcome to the Doll House''
and last year's ``Three Seasons'') emerged as festival favorites.
This year they have ``Chuck and Buck,'' the director Miguel
Arteta's digitally shot follow-up to ``Star Maps'' (1997), another
Sundance discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore agreed that the lure of money has altered the indie
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the major change in independent films
over the last decade, the simple answer is that they've become more
commercial,'' Gilmore said. ``When we talked about independent film
at the beginning of the decade, we talked about its impetus being
primarily creative, a desire to make a certain kind of film that
couldn't be made within the studios. The impetus still exists, but
the commercial impetus, the idea of making films to make money, has
infected the independent world more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be a fairly predictable cycle, said Jack Lechner, a
writer and former independent studio executive who was the keynote
speaker at a film financing conference in San Francisco last week.
A filmmaker wrote a script, hooked up with a producer and raised
production money _ anywhere from $20,000 for a bare-bones riff to
several million, sometimes from the bank, sometimes from friends
and relatives, often by maxing out the credit cards. The film would
then be submitted to festivals and if it was any good have a
fair-to-even shot of landing some sort of theatrical run in a
big-city or college-town art cinema.
</P>
<P>
   That is less and less the case today, Lechner said. The art
houses are no longer so hungry, and with Hollywood in the game
there are more movies competing for fewer screens. ``It's film eat
film out there,'' Lechner said.
</P>
<P>
   As cheaper, digital filmmaking becomes more pervasive, even more
first-time directors will emerge. ``If the marketplace is crowded
now, just wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Sundance remains a festival where new voices are
discovered _ consider ``Blair Witch'' again _ and where agents and
studio executives, dreaming shark dreams, pick through the annual
crop, it is increasingly something else as well.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen of the 113 feature films that were chosen to
be part of the festival, and 13 of the 17 premieres, already have
contracts with distributors _ that is, a company that will market
the movie and handle its dispersal to movie theaters. Which means
that the people bringing those films to Park City are not doing so
in hopes of lining up a distributor but in hopes of getting the
film started with a barrage of buzz and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   So the press agents are beginning to outnumber the producers,
the studios' marketing execs are as busy as their distribution
execs, and invitations to the right party are as prized as tickets
to the hottest unseen film. ``Indie-wood,'' they call it, or
``Biz-dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result is that several parallel festivals are under way
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On one level distributors are trying to attract awards and
publicity for movies that are to be released soon. At another level
filmmakers and their sales agents are trying to stir up bidding
frenzies on films that have no distributors yet, usually by not
letting anyone see the films until they are before a Sundance
audience; the hope is that the hothouse atmosphere will make
distribution executives a little looser with the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   On an even deeper level, newcomers to the process are hanging
around the fringes, networking, trying to figure out how to take
the next step up the ladder. And somewhere, down toward the bottom,
ordinary people are just watching movies for the fun and excitement
of it. But no one pays much attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   All this had led to a certain amount of careerism in the
independent film world, with directors using it as a stepping stone
and putting out films that are created to impress agents and
Hollywood executives. ``This has a lot to do with the fact that so
many independent films are getting closer to Hollywood films,''
Gilmore, the festival co-director, said. ``Filmmakers are becoming
more savvy. They go to indiewire.com every day; they read Variety.
But independent film is only interesting and only valid if it is
different from what Hollywood is doing, because Hollywood can do it
better and with more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said he is encouraged that there seem to be more films
this year exploring serious, specific themes like child abuse and
AIDS and fewer exercises in navel-gazing. But he continues to be
troubled by the lack of film literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That more of them are more career-knowledgeable than
film-literate is unquestionably true, that they know more about who
the major agents are they need to see at CAA than who Nicholas Ray
is,'' Gilmore said, referring to the powerful Creative Artists
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guillemet, the co-director, said not all of the changes are
necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival is criticized, but it is not about Hollywood,''
she said. ``You have agents, you have studios, all looking for new
talent. You cannot help this. Sometimes they buy a film, sometimes
the price is high. But the bottom line is that filmmakers are
making a film for an audience, and if the distributor is buying a
film and showing it around, well, this is what the film is for.''

   Filling a Music Library While Behind the Wheel
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to technology there's so much to do in a car. You can
listen to music, receive e-mail, make telephone calls, surf the
Web, get directions and, oh yes, drive.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Electronics has now added another diversion: making audio
recordings. It has introduced the MD Record, an in-dash minidisc
recorder that is expected to be available beginning in March, at a
price of about $700.
</P>
<P>
   With the unit, you can make your commute more productive,
recording a disc on the way to work, say, to play on your portable
minidisc player during your lunch hour. The device can record from
an optional CD or minidisc player, or from the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a 10-second storage memory, so if you hear something
good on the radio _ the beginning of a favorite song, for example _
you can hit the Record button and the entire song will be captured.
</P>
<P>
   And if you pull into the parking lot before the song is over,
the unit will keep recording even after you've shut off the engine,
locked the doors and walked away.

   HAPPY MAIL
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of e-mail greetings just got a little more personal.
A Web site called MixMe.com (www.mixme.com) offers online audio
jokes and songs that mix in the name of your intended recipients,
as well as other details like hair color or their favorite hobbies.
When they click on the link that appears in their e-mail messages,
they wind up on a Web page with cartoon characters shouting their
name and singing ballads about their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ROBOBOOM
</P>
<P>
   People concerned with population growth might be alarmed by the
new edition of the Handbook of Industrial Robotics. According to
the handbook, the number of industrial robots (meaning any
manufactured robot) has risen from 35,000 in 1982 to 677,000 in
1996 and an estimated 950,000 this year. The author of the handbook
adds that attitudes have also changed as people no longer fear that
robots will take their jobs. The handbook does not address the more
common fear that robots will one day rise up and kill their human
masters.

   Passing Out the Cigars While Linking to Web Sites
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, it's a Web site. A new service called
Thefirstday.com now offers newborns their first shot at a URL. It
offers a free Web site to new parents at www.thefirstday.com; they
can use it to post birth announcements and photographs. Relatives
and friends can log in to send greetings and, of course, to buy
gifts through Thefirstday.com's commercial sponsors. The site is
maintained until the child's sixth birthday, by which time the
little tyke should really have learned HTML.
</P>
<P>
   The site carries the Sesame Street imprimatur. But
Thefirstday.com is largely the creation of 3Buddies.com, a
marketing company that has developed a series of anniversary and
special day sites like www.thebigday.com (graduations,
anniversaries). No word on whether a Finalday.com is in the works. &QL;

   Writer Wants to Resurrect Those Paper Techie Manuals
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, David Pogue, a
computer columnist and author, has set out to clear up ``The Case
of the Missing Manuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer manuals, those mammoth impenetrable tomes that no one
ever actually reads, have gone the way of the dodo bird, replaced
by online documentation. But Pogue _ and many others who have used
it _ say that online help is not much of a help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may say `click on the view menu,' but you can't because the
Help window has covered it up,'' he said. ``You can't write on it,
underline it, look at two pages at once or read it in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   To fill the void, Pogue has teamed with a publisher, O'Reilly
and Associates, to produce manuals for popular computers and
software programs. Because Pogue is well known among Macintosh
users, the first three books will be Mac-oriented. Books covering
the Wintel platform should start appearing by mid-summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pogue, author of ``Palm Pilot: The Ultimate Guide,'' said the
$20 books would be free of jargon. ``You won't need a manual for
the manual,'' he said. &QL;

   Keeping Your Laptop Secure on Your Lap
</P>
<P>
   It's a dirty little secret about laptops: they don't really fit
well on a lap.
</P>
<P>
   When you try to use one while sitting upright in a chair, the
natural downward slope of the thighs puts the keyboard at an
awkward angle. It can also cause the machine to slide down the
legs, the dreaded ``laptop creep,'' the rate of which is directly
proportional to the amount of polyester in your suit.
</P>
<P>
   A new product developed by Seaweed, a Rhode Island design
company, aims to eliminate these problems. Called the Lap Lounger,
it is a foldable wedge of plastic that raises, levels and
stabilizes a laptop when used on a lap (think of it as something
like a three-ring binder, without the rings).
</P>
<P>
   It has nonskid surfaces, a Velcro flap to adjust the height of
the wedge, and the whole thing folds flat for storage in laptop
case.
</P>
<P>
   The device is available through some computer stores and
catalogs and through a Web site, www.laplounger.com, for a
suggested price of $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you could just do something about that suit.

   Putting MP3 Music Files Into Your Car's Dashboard
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this
month, many manufacturers were showing off products designed to
bring MP3s, the compressed music files that can be downloaded from
the Internet, to the family car.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing design was from Unitech Electronics, a South
Korean company (www.mp-3.co.kr). Called the Rome, it lists for $280
and comes with 32 megabytes of memory, enough for about a half-hour
of near-CD-quality music. The company promises a 64MB version soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome looks like an audio cassette tape, and it is designed
to fit into, and play through, most, but not all, existing cassette
decks. You just slip it into the player like a tape and use the
deck's buttons to control the sound.
</P>
<P>
   The device can also be used by itself, with earphones. Using it
that way, you can trick your friends into thinking that you have
somehow wired your brain to decode the signals directly off a
cassette tape. &QL;

   PlanetPortal.com (www.planetportal.com), based in the Research
Triangle Park in North Carolina, calls its gadget, which is still
in development, the eGoPad. The finished product is expected look
like a video-game control pod. Users will simply hit a button on
the device and get immediately connected to a specific site or to a
portal for categories like shopping, news and sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting the `late majority' _ the population segment
that's newest to the Net,'' said PlanetPortal's founder and chief
executive, Brent Kleinheksel. ``They still have a very hard time
knowing where to go on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleinheksel saids the first remotes would probably hit the
market in late May. The devices will run on Windows 98 or and
initially require a Universal Serial Bus (USB) computer connection.
(A wireless version could be available by late 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers and other online portals will
customize the pad buttons for their e-commerce partners,
theoretically increasing traffic on those sites. The anticipated
revenue increases will allow distributors to give the product to
customers at no charge, Kleinheksel said.

   MP3-Trading Service Can Clog Networks on College Campuses
</P>
<P>
   When a feisty MP3-trading company named Napster arrived on the
Internet music scene last November, it made one enemy right away.
The Recording Industry Association of America sued the company
within weeks, charging Napster with creating a haven for music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Napstr can count on a new foe: universities. Last month,
Hofstra University in New York asked its Internet service provider
to block traffic coming from Napster's software into its university
network. And the ISP, Applied Theory, based in New York City, is
warning other clients, many of which are academic institutions,
about the company.
</P>
<P>
   The design of Napster's software, which can be downloaded free
at www.napster.com, is the reason for the fuss. Napster, a start-up
company based in San Mateo, Calif., has developed a program that
acts as an intermediary between people who want to find and trade
MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   But the software does not refer people to an index of MP3 files
collected and stored on Napster's servers. Instead, it points users
to MP3 files stored on computers that have already downloaded the
Napster software. In other words, any computer that downloads the
program becomes a server of MP3 files _ unless the person
downloading it knows enough to change the program's default
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture a large university with 20,000 students, many of them
downloading this software,'' said Bob Riley, director of network
services at Applied Theory. ``More likely than not, they have set
themselves up as servers. That can consume a lot of bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hofstra, officials asked Applied Theory to block traffic from
the software after noticing that the campus network was slowing
considerably. ``They were using our bandwidth for their commercial
service,'' said Lanny Udey, associate dean for information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Richardson, the interim chief executive of Napster, said
that the company would try to find a solution to the problem. ``We
absolutely never intended to use university bandwidth to this
extreme,'' she said. She would not disclose how many people had
downloaded the software or where they were located.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the charge that the software is used as a gateway
for distributing pirated music files, Ms. Richardson said her
company bore no responsibility for such problems. The files are not
on Napster's computers, she argued, so the company has no control
over how they are obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you are the company that makes the crowbars
doesn't mean that you're responsible when one is used to break into
a house,'' she said. ``We are not the MP3 police.'' &QL;

`LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:' BETWEEN THE LINES AT THE NEW YORKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I fuss around with commas, semi-colons, dictionaries, and
wordings, and it drives me crazy,'' wrote Harold Wallace Ross, the
founding editor of The New Yorker magazine, to a friend in 1928.
``I am too virile. I ought to be building subways.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead he built his magazine, and this book, ``Letters From
the Editor: The New Yorker's Harold Ross,'' reflects how he did it.
``Don't waste your time and words on letters; you don't get paid
for them,'' Ross once advised St. Clair McKelway.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ross himself wrote so many letters that, as Thomas Kunkel,
the volume's editor, writes in his introduction, ``the ironic fact
is that the man who never wrote a word (at least under his own
name) for The New Yorker was, with the possible exception of the
protean Edmund Wilson, the most prolific writer in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross devoted several hours of his day to typing letters. ``I got
started and off I went, it seems,'' was his explanation. He
encouraged contributors: ``Maybe the only thing for you to do is to
keep on writing and become a writer,'' he wrote to John O'Hara in
1930 in response to a request for a job. He regaled his friends
with stories. He straightened the record of his life and times. He
complained bitterly and condescendingly to Raoul Fleischmann, the
magazine's financial backer, sometimes even threatening to quit. He
cajoled the members of his staff: ``White,'' he wrote by hand to
E.B. White, one of his mainstays, ``Will you pls. look in on me
when you wake up? I never disturb a sleeping man. Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kunkel's biography of Ross, ``Genius in Disguise: Harold Ross
of The New Yorker,'' he set about to dispel the prevailing
impression of his subject, who never even graduated from high
school, as ``a perpetually confused hayseed, a naif, an uncouth
provincial who succeeded almost in spite of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters collected here do the job all by themselves by
consistently conveying the distinctive clarity of Ross' voice. He
is blunt: ``We differ in almost everything,'' he wrote to Jane
Grant, his first wife, in 1928. ``We are both terribly sot. Living
with you on the basis that I have in the past is, I have concluded,
impossible. You are a disturbing and upsetting person.''
</P>
<P>
   He is sarcastic; complaining about being evicted from his
apartment for having ``persons of the opposite sex'' overnight, he
wrote to the Irving Trust Co.: ``I assumed that the management
considered that I was renting the bedrooms for the purpose of
entertaining guests in them, not to raise goldfish in them, or to
sit in alone and crochet, or to myself sleep in each one
successively for two or three hours each night ...''
</P>
<P>
   He is self-revealing; to the young Brendan Gill, who, feeling
underappreciated, had sent him the prank gift of a wood skunk, he
wrote in 1941: ``I didn't try to scare you. The profanity was
natural. My manner is not orthodox, but I've given up trying to
curb it, for often as not it serves (astonishingly) to put people
at their ease. I think it relaxes more people than it excites. I
hope so, anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   So much controversy has lately surrounded the post-Ross eras of
The New Yorker that to read this volume is to experience a
prelapsarian Eden, much of which has become familiar through
previous books and famous anecdotes. Still, it's striking to
experience firsthand Ross' famous curiosity: about the whisk brooms
used by baseball umpires to sweep off home plate; about how weather
makes its way to New York City; about the high number of one-armed
men, particularly Chinese, who played poker with him in Reno; about
the food at Dave Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles (of which he
was the financial backer); about the possibility of growing a small
watermelon that would reach full size in a northern season because
``it hasn't got so far to go,'' and about what exactly caused the
deaths of people at Hiroshima: ``how many were killed by being hit
by hard objects, how many by burns, how many by concussion, or
shock, or whatever it was?''
</P>
<P>
   His attention to grammatical and typographic detail: the
unnecessary use of italics, the definition of the word compost, the
length of paragraphs in nonfiction pieces, why the word none isn't
singular, and the too frequent appearance of words like
understandably and a little.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the quintessential Ross anecdote involves how during
World War I he was getting out ``a black market publication in
Paris'' and ``made a deal with an American Army printing company
(soldiers) to do the composition.'' The only problem was that there
weren't any English quotation marks in the French print shop they
were using, so he had to borrow them from the composing room of The
Daily Mail and carry them back and forth 12 miles every day.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing he combined his virility with his fussiness, the
qualities that made him so contradictory as well as the supremely
great editor he became.  &QL;

   BEYOND-N.H. (Seattle) _ For weeks, more than a dozen volunteers
for Al Gore have been telephoning faithful Democrats to encourage
them to vote for the vice president in the Washington state caucus
on March 7. By contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted
only a week to making such calls. His fledgling operation does not
even have an office. The differences underscore the degree to which
the candidates are prepared to march to the nomination should they
triumph in the first showdowns in Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New
Hampshire a week later. While Democratic strategists say they have
never seen a challenger with as much organizational and financial
muscle as Bradley, they argue that Gore is still better primed to
go the distance. By Richard L. Berke. 1,700 words.

&HT;        REPUBLICAN PARTY AD SPOTS TARGET HISPANIC VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 - San Antonio advertising executive Frank
Guerra is convinced that his new slate of bilingual TV commercials
can get Hispanics to reconsider voting Republican in this year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra, a staunch Republican and former campaign manager for San
Antonio Rep. Henry Bonilla, targeted the ads at a segment of a
fast-growing population who are undecided about which political
party they like, but have conservative values that Guerra said make
them perfect targets for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the ads get Hispanics to stop and think for just one
moment that perhaps the Republican party is something different
than what they thought it was,'' Guerra, who is Mexican-American,
said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee commissioned Guerra DeBerry &AMP;
Company to make the 60-second commercial in an effort to court a
segment of Latino voters that the RNC predicts will be the
``battleground segment'' of the 2000 presidential and congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC plans to broadcast the ads in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
and Iowa in the coming weeks in both Spanish and English - a first
for political advertising - depending on the market. In San
Antonio, for example, they will be in English, while TV viewers
along the border can expect to see them in Spanish, said RNC
spokeswoman Leslie Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad, filmed in Laredo, depicts a Hispanic family
celebrating the 4th of July and suggests Hispanic values and the
Republican party's values are one in the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, even my 95-year old father is today a Republican,''
a man in the ad says as his family gathers in front of an American
flag. ``He passed his values along to me and I passed them along to
my children and my grandchildren. When people ask me why I am a
Republican I tell them it is because my family's values are the
values of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra's ad took its cues from a GOP poll released last week of
1,000 Latinos of different national backgrounds across the nation.
The poll found that out of the eligible Hispanic voter respondents
who said they intended to vote, 25 percent were not tied to either
party, making them ``open to persuasion'', in the words of RNC
chairman Jim Nicholson in a statement last week.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters calculated that 45 percent would vote for a
Democratic candidate no matter what, and 30 percent would likely
vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``These voters are more conservative and more entrepreneurial,''
Nicholson said of the swing voters. ``They're sending this message:
'We're open to change. Persuade us. Make your best case.' I'm here
to promise you that we will - for their benefit and ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra said the survey showed Hispanics to be more conservative
than liberal, even if they called themselves Democrats, and gave
conservative-leaning answers on questions about education, work and
other areas. ``Once you scratch under the surface, their true
conservative nature emerges,'' Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for National Council of La Raza, a
Hispanic civil rights organization here, agreed there is a Latino
swing vote, but said they will base their decisions on what
policies candidates propose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the poll insofar as Latinos base their vote on
the person who's running and their positions on issues,'' she said.
``There is a strong core of conservatism in the Latino community of
family values. [But] they [the GOP] will not be successful unless
they take a look at their policy issues; those things are what's
critical ultimately to the Latino voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarette said Latino voters will watch for both parties'
positions on education, health care, safety and crime issues when
Congress comes back into session.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC hopes the ads will reach the swing voters, who Sanchez
said are younger, adept in English, and hold family values and a
strong work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, one of the few Hispanic members of Congress who is also
a Republican, said the ads will be useful to getting out the
party's message. ``[Hispanics] could be the big swing vote in the
next election,'' he said. ``The Spanish ads are cutting edge and
innovative, and quite frankly it's overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gonz lez, director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials, an organization representing Hispanic
officeholders at all levels from both parties, said while the ad
represents a ``step in the right direction'' for the GOP, the
coming legislative session will be the proving ground for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to address serious immigration issues, like
reducing [the citizenship application] backlog, bilingual
education, and talk to other members [of Congress] who introduce
English-only legislation?'' Gonz lez said. ``The ads are a step,
but the devil is in the details as they say.''

conclude their military campaign by Feb. 26, exactly one month
before Russia's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the deputy commander of Russian forces
in the North Caucasus, announced the goal Wednesday in an interview
with Russian reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His disclosure came as Russian forces pressed ahead with their
assault on Grozny, an offensive that is intended to provide the
Kremlin a prompt victory it can present to the Russian public as
the elections approach. But the goal may be hard to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces renewed their air and ground assault on the
Chechen capital two days ago, and apartment houses have been
pummeled, fires have broken out and much of the city has been
shrouded in thick black smoke from destroyed oil tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reports from Grozny suggested the Russian troops were
advancing slowly against a smaller but determined group of rebels,
who have mined the streets and are using small mobile bands of
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the war has been inextricably bound to Kremlin
politics. Acting President Vladimir Putin emerged as Russia's most
popular politician by serving as powerful proponent of the war in
the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to subdue Chechnya is broadly supported by Russian
society. But the rising casualty toll could become a nettlesome
issue for the Kremlin. The prospect that Russian forces might be
mired in a bitter and open-ended war during the election season
must be unattractive for the Putin team.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a sense of urgency about the
onslaught of Grozny. Russia's commanders had hoped to take the
capital by early January. After they were thwarted by stiff
resistance and bad weather the military paused to catch its breath.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian media, which had been broadly supporting the
military at the start of the war, have begun questioning what the
generals would achieve with their renewed onslaught of the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta commented that the city had
scant strategic significance since it was little more than a ruin
and since the rebels are active in the highlands and behind Russian
lines in the lowlands. In effect, it suggested, the government
seems prepared to turn Grozny into a smoking ruin in order to save
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can expect that the Russian flag will, at all costs, soon
be hoisted over Grozny,'' the newspaper observed. ``The truth is
that there is hardly a decent building left in the Chechen capital
on which the Russian tricolors can be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting rages, there were only the slimmest of prospects
of a negotiated settlement. A Chechen businessman who is supporting
Moscow's side said Wednesday that discussions were underway between
Russian officials and a group of rebel commanders. There was no
sign of a breakthrough, though. And the businessman, Malik
Saidullayev, acknowledged the talks were being carried out ``with
difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government hoped to evacuate the city by
establishing two ``humanitarian corridors'' so that Grozny's
residents could flee before the Russian military stepped up its
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7,820 people have passed through the corridors since
they were established in mid-December, according to figures made
public Wednesday. And a mere 59 people used it over a recent
24-hour period, Russian officials said. In contrast, upwards of
40,000 civilians may still inhabit the city.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the activity at the Russian air base here, just a few
miles northwest of Chechnya, pointed to the intensity of the
conflict. Many of the 180 bombing missions carried out on Tuesday
were directed against targets in the Chechen highlands, including
areas near Vedeno, a town in the Caucasian mountains and the
birthplace of Shamil Basayev, the rebel warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fighting, however, was concentrated in Grozny. The
Russians mounted their attack from three directions: the Staraya
Sunzha region on the northern outskirts of the city; Khankala, an
area east of the city, and Staropromyslovsky, a district in the
western capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said it has captured a strategic bridge, a
hospital, a cannery and a military compound. Russian troops
advanced toward Minutka square in central Grozny, but the rebels'
defenses have been well prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resistance is fierce,'' said Vadim Timchenko, the deputy chief
of operations for the Russian forces fighting in Chechnya. ``We
have to pay tribute to them. They prepared multilayer defenses in
the city. Every house has been turned into a kind of fortress. But
according to our information, they have little reserves of
ammunition and medicine.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gen. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, the commander of Russia's Interior
Troops, said that there were an estimated 2,500 militants in the
city. Troops from the interior minister and not the Army are
charged with much of the street fighting inside the city. That is
in keeping with Moscow's position that it is quelling a local
disorder and not waging a war against its own population.
</P>
<P>
   But it must seem like a war to Ovchinnikov's men. Grozny's
streets are mined and rebels have been fighting in small groups, a
tactic that gives the militants enormous mobility. Some rebel units
consisted of no more than a sniper, a machine gunner and a fighter
with a trench mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military commanders claim to have extracted a large
rebel toll in Grozny, with as many as 100 killed on Tuesday. They
say Russian losses over three days have been 23 killed and about 50
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Official figures generally understate actual Russian losses, but
even these statistics point to the intensity of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the street clashes, the pace of the Russian
advance has slowed, some Russian officials acknowledged. That did
not appear to dampen Troshev's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is giving the force any firm deadline for ending the
operation,'' he declared. But he did not hesitate to publicize the
goal: an end to the campaign by Feb. 26.

FORBES' ADS CLOUD BUSH'S SUNNY PROSPECT IN IOWA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTERSET, Iowa _ The two dozen Republicans gathered upstairs in
the 124-year-old Madison County courthouse listened attentively as
their former governor, Terry Branstad, made the case for George W.
Bush to be president. But several in the group were more concerned
about another Texan _ a Houston woman who is showing up on their
televisions a lot lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this woman who comes on and says these awful things,''
Virginia Coughenour told Branstad. ``It sounds so real. I almost
believed it. Of course, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughenour, a professional pianist and preacher's widow, is a
hard-core supporter of Bush, the Texas governor, but she fears that
less-committed Iowa Republicans are being swayed by a barrage of
commercials for challenger Steve Forbes. One features Mary C.
Wilson of Houston, who formed Taxpayers for Accountability, and
cautions Iowans: ``There's something you need to know about George
W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``something,'' Wilson says, is that Bush has a ``record of
broken promises'' on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this ad time and time and time again,'' a white-haired
man sitting in the front row said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that just watch TV..., they believe all these ads,
and they don't find out the truth,'' said Bush backer Ethel Lee
Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' ads, including one that questions the effect of Bush's
economic plan on Social Security, have created a cloud on what
otherwise seems a sunny prospect for Bush in the Iowa caucuses
Monday, the first real test of voter sentiment in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are part of an estimated $25 million _ most of
it his own money _ that publishing heir Forbes has poured into his
campaign already. While some senior Bush strategists are more
concerned about the grass-roots organization that Forbes may have
assembled with his huge outlay, it's the ever-present ads that have
the folks in the trenches worried.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings like the one here earlier this week and in calls to
Bush's state headquarters in Des Moines and to his campaign leaders
across Iowa, the governor's partisans are expressing concern that
Forbes' ads could take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of our supporters say we're seeing these Forbes ads
and (asking), what's the response, what do we tell our friends,''
said Eric Woolson, Bush's Iowa spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has become concerned enough that it has begun
airing 30-second radio spots aimed at countering the Forbes'
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The message is delivered by Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Bush
supporter and arguably the most popular Republican politician in
the state. Without mentioning Forbes by name, Grassley says ``some
presidential candidates are trying to win Iowa votes by slinging
mud and distorting records.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might receive their misleading phone calls, negative mail,
or see or hear their attack ads,'' Grassley says. ``Do what (wife)
Barbara and I do: Hang up the phone, throw the mail out and change
the station.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley says he backs Bush ``because he's running a positive
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a tax cutter...,'' Grassley says. ``He'll
protect Social Security. And don't let anyone else tell you
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley urges voters to go to the caucuses and support Bush
``if you're tired of mudslinging and name calling.'' A letter from
the Bush campaign carries a similar message from Grassley to Iowa
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush ad joins one by the Republican Leadership Council, a
group of moderate Republicans that includes a lot of Bush backers,
that takes Forbes on by name and recalls his ad blitz against Bob
Dole early in the 1996 presidential campaign. Although Dole
eventually secured the GOP nomination, many in the party believe
the Forbes ads help weaken his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, Steve Forbes has a history of unfairly attacking fellow
Republicans,'' says the RLC ad, as a picture of Dole flashes on the
screen. The ad points out that Bush's proposed tax increases in
Texas, none of which were ever enacted, were more than offset by
other tax reductions proposed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign has defended its ads as truthful and has
warned that the Bush campaign is readying a last-minute negative
onslaught of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, Forbes' national
campaign chairman, this week warned that Bush's team will ``smile
in public while going extremely negative below the radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your friends and colleagues prepared. Be prepared for an
onslaught of ugly, negative calls from the Bush campaign to Forbes
supporters,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   One politically experienced Bush supporter said that Forbes' big
ad buy could have the unintended effect of rousing the governor's
partisans, who had assumed he would be a big, easy winner in the
2000-plus precinct meetings Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use a little fear in this campaign,'' the Bush backer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern, if not fear, was definitely in evidence at the Madison
County (as in ``Bridges of Madison County``) meeting on John Wayne
Drive (named for Winterset's most famous native).
</P>
<P>
   The session was called to review caucus procedures with county
Republican leaders and volunteers, but it quickly morphed into a
Bush pep rally, with Branstad as the main cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed a little taken aback by the questions about Forbes'
ads and later said he welcomed ``a chance to set the record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   First to question Branstad about Bush was Pierre Krause, a
German-born radio station employee who is uncertain whom he will
support but leans to former Reagan administration official Alan
Keyes, the fiery conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Bush ``apparently raised taxes,'' Krause asked
Branstad, ``What is true?
</P>
<P>
   The ex-governor stressed the point made in Bush's commercial: He
signed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they can say he raised some taxes,'' Branstad said,
``but if you look at the net result'' taxes decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad, citing his own long tenure, conceded, ``It does get
confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   And an attempt at confusion is what Bush strategists believe
Forbes is really up to _ just as he was in his 1996 ads against
Dole. Studies indicate that one effect of negative ads is to make
marginal voters less like to turn out, leaving the field open to
candidates who have stronger get-out-the-vote operations.

<P>
   As smoke rolled through the hallways of Boland Hall at the Seton
Hall University campus in South Orange, N.J., before dawn
Wednesday, its 600 freshman residents were awakened by the fire
alarm, by smoke, and by the screams of other frightened students.
</P>
<P>
   Most fled in their pajamas and nightgowns and some managed to
grab sweat shirts, coats, blankets, slippers and shoes as they fled
into the bitterly cold pre-dawn darkness. Their flight was marked
by heroism, desperation and fear _ but apparently little outright
panic.
</P>
<P>
   The fire left three students dead and 58 injured. Four of the
injured were critically burned, including one who suffered
third-degree burns over most of his body. By Wednesday evening the
authorities had not yet released the identities of the three
students killed in the fire. The cause of the lethal blaze, which
reportedly started in a lounge, is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students evacuated from the six-story dormitory for
freshmen on the South Orange campus said they thought the fire
alarm, which sounded about 4:30 a.m., was the latest in a string of
false alarms rung by pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo, who is heading the
investigation, said at a news conference Wednesday that there had
been 18 false alarms in Boland Hall since September, when classes
got under way at the Roman Catholic university.
</P>
<P>
   Students described a chaotic scene as they scrambled to get out
of the burning building. Some said that fire hoses on each floor
had been disconnected just last week and were lying in piles in the
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A Seton Hall spokeswoman, Lisa Grider, said the hoses had been
disconnected because they were obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo, who is heading the investigation, said the lack of
standpipe hoses was not a factor in the fire's spread. He said the
South Orange firefighters preferred to attach their own hoses to
standpipes and did so without problems in putting out the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo also said fire extinguishers are in place in the halls
and lounge on each of the six floors in Boland. Extinguishers must
be inspected every two months, he said, and those in Boland were
last checked Nov. 23 and found to be in working order.
</P>
<P>
   One was used to fight Wednesday morning's fire by either a
student or a fireman, Campolo said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Allison Lipak, 18, of Clifton, N.J., who lived in Boland Hall,
described herself as ``angry, upset and very distraught'' by the
false alarms. She said they had been a constant problem, with as
many as six a day during final examinations in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a false alarm, until we saw all the smoke,''
she continued. ``I covered my mouth and was able to get outside
pretty quickly. People were screaming from the windows. The
firefighters were pushing us back. I think one person jumped out
the window and broke his ankle. It was the scariest thing I've ever
seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some occupants of Boland Hall joined the firefighters in hauling
ladders to a roof above a loading dock on the west side of the
dorm, then raising the ladders to third-floor windows and helping
other students escape their smoke-filled rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Wilk, 18, of Hillsborough, N.J., and her roommate, Tara
Valent, of Blairstown, N.J., both biology majors, were awakened in
their fourth-floor room by the alarm's ringing. At first they paid
no attention because, they said, dorm residents pulled the alarm
boxes as pranks.
</P>
<P>
   But when the two young women opened their door, they were hit by
rolling smoke. The hallway was filled with students trying to get
out, Miss Wilk recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming, `It's real, it's real _ fire, fire,'''
Miss Wilk said. ``We couldn't see anything; the smoke was so thick.
My eyes were burning. I couldn't breathe. I was crying. It was
really bad. We just crawled down the hall. We didn't know which way
to go because we didn't know which way the fire was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The two young women finally reached an exterior stairway and
fled down it.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside, Miss Wilk recalled, she saw some fellow freshmen,
including Wayne Milano, Dave Bruno and Justin Fox running toward
the dorm with ladders to get other students waiting at windows.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Wannamaker, an 18-year-old communications major from
Irvington, N.J., lived on the third floor a few doors from the
burning lounge. The alarm woke her too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was a fire drill,'' Miss Wannamaker
said. ``I just thought somebody was drunk and pulled the alarm.''
She opened the door and the smoke was so thick she could not see
the door of the room across the hall. She grabbed her cell phone,
called 911 and reported the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get out,'' she remembered telling the emergency
dispatcher. ``We're trapped on the third floor.'' She thought at
first about jumping but the dispatcher warned her not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my roommates was yelling, `We're going to die, we're
going to die,''' Miss Wannamaker said. While waiting for rescuers,
Miss Wannamaker tried to keep the smoke out of her room by placing
strips of wrapping tape across the top of the door and stuffing a
comforter against the bottom of the door.
</P>
<P>
   They waited at their third-floor window until rescuers arrived
with a ladder. ``They were yelling, `Hold on, hold on, we're
coming,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yatin Patel, a 19-year-old computer science major from Jersey
City, also lived about four doors from the burning lounge. Like
many others, he heard the alarm but thought at first it was false.
Then he opened his door and saw burning ceiling tiles falling into
the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hall was filled with pitch-black, thick smoke,'' he said.
Patel and his roommate retreated into the room, doused a towel with
water from the sink in the room and stuffed it beneath the door.
And then they too waited for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just yelling and yelling and screaming our room
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A firefighter eventually came to their door and told Patel and
his roommate to crawl out of the room to a stairway near the
burning lounge. Before Patel left, he said, he grabbed a sock to
place over his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just crawled through the smoke,'' he said. ``We went out on
hands and knees. I was holding onto the fireman's left leg, and my
roommate was right behind me, holding onto my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole McFarlane, 19, of Summit, N.J., remembered fleeing her
fifth-floor room down a rear stairway filled with students.
``Everybody was saying, `Go, go, go,''' Miss McFarlane said.
``Everybody was really hopping stairs two at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Lipak, the mother of Allison Lipak, expressed relief that
her daughter was unharmed. ``My heart goes out to the parents of
those poor kids who were killed and injured,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lipak described receiving a call from Allison at 4:45 a.m.,
reassuring her that her daughter was OK ``She was so upset, she was
crying,'' Mrs. Lipak said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those critically burned was Alvaro Llanos, an 18-year-old
engineering student from Paterson who won a scholarship from the
New Jersey Nets to attend Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   His sister Shirley Babilonia, 24, said that her brother, whom
she described as a dedicated student, suffered third-degree burns
from his head to his knees and was in critical condition at the St.
Barnabas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Babilonia said hospital officials called her parents, Alvaro
and Daisy Llanos, about 5:45 a.m. and told them Alvaro was in the
burn unit. They went to the hospital and saw him briefly but he was
heavily sedated and unaware of their presence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said he's going to need five operations for skin
grafts,'' Ms. Babilonia said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother had complained to his parents about the
lack of sprinklers in the dormitory and the frequent false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us constantly about false alarms,'' Ms. Babilonia
said. ``Every other day they were getting pulled out of their rooms
at 4:30 in the morning. He told us the school doesn't have any
sprinklers and they took the hoses out of the building. How can you
have students living in a dorm and not have the proper firefighting
equipment?''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall is the 13th largest Roman Catholic university in the
country, with an enrollment of about 4,700 undergraduates and 4,500
graduate students. The great majority of its undergraduates come
from New Jersey, but fewer than half of them live on the campus,
which lies about 14 miles across the Hudson River from New York
City.

SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE ON FREE SPEECH AND ABORTION CLINICS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court wrestled Wednesday with whether a
Colorado law intended to protect patients and staff members at
abortion clinics from intimidation and verbal harassment goes too
far in limiting demonstrators' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the 1993 law in a challenge
brought by three ``sidewalk counselors'' who travel around Colorado
to abortion clinics and seek to dissuade women entering the clinics
from going ahead with their scheduled abortions. The three abortion
opponents display signs and a model of a fetus, hand out
literature, and try to converse with the patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law, the only one of its kind, established a
100-foot zone around the entrance to any ``health care facility.''
Within this zone, people may not, without consent, ``knowingly
approach another person within 8 feet,'' for the purpose of passing
out literature or engaging in ``oral protest, education, or
counseling'' on a public sidewalk. A violation is a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of up to $750 or six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``converts protected speech into a crime,'' Jay A.
Sekulow, representing the three protesters, told the justices. The
plaintiffs did not challenge another portion of the law that
prohibits blocking a clinic's entrance or hindering someone from
going in or out. Consequently, Sekulow said, the case concerned
only speech in a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers representing Colorado and the Clinton
administration, supporting the state, argued that the law did not
curb any speech, because one person can speak to another from a
distance of 8 feet in a conversational tone and still be heard.
``What this statute prohibits is moving in on somebody,'' Barbara
D. Underwood, a deputy solicitor general, told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. McLachlan, Colorado's solicitor general, said the law
did nothing to curb ``uninhibited debate on all topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer seemed to agree. Addressing Sekulow,
the plaintiffs' lawyer, he pointed out that that 8 feet was merely
the distance between his own seat on the bench and that of Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, two chairs away. ``What is it that someone
can't say?'' from that distance, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the precise distance made no difference from the
point of view of the First Amendment. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist objected. ``But the distance must make some difference,''
he said, adding: ``Say you get down to 3 feet. I don't think
there's any message you can't communicate at 3 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia picked up the questioning. Two inches? An
eighth of an inch? Nose to nose?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is speech in a public forum,'' Sekulow repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Speech in a public forum typically refers to ``a soapbox where
people gather around,'' not to face-to-face conversation from a
distance of an eighth of an inch, Rehnquist observed.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before in the last six years, the justices have dealt with
restrictions on protests outside abortion clinics, upholding some
restrictions and invalidating others. But the earlier two cases
concerned court injunctions obtained by clinics to prevent repeated
incidents of violence and disruption.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, this case involves a generally applicable statute.
Some justices expressed the concern that the law was general enough
to bar such activities as union picketing outside hospitals. Others
wondered how it would apply to a high-rise building with a doctor's
office on a single floor. McLachlan, the Colorado solicitor
general, said he believed the law would place a 100-foot protected
zone around the entrance to such a building, as well as to a
free-standing clinic, although he said the Colorado Supreme Court
had not interpreted the law in that context.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's earlier rulings suggested that injunctions
should be subject to closer judicial scrutiny than a law, that is a
disputed proposition that is one of the underlying issues in this
case, Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. For example, the American
Civil Liberties Union, in a brief filed on the protesters' behalf,
said that while courts can tailor injunctions to cover specific
people who have engaged in unlawful conduct in the past, statutes
apply generally without any requirement of past misconduct, and so
should be subject to more searching review.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law does not mention abortion, and the state
defends it as a neutral statute that operates without respect to a
particular message. Scalia appeared to doubt this. ``I think we
know what it's aimed at, which is abortion protest,'' he said,
adding: ``I just wonder whether there's any justification for
singling them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asked whether the state could create similar zones
around auto dealerships or lawyers offices. Ms. Underwood, the
deputy solicitor general, said that if the state compiled a record
showing disruption and harassment of people trying to enter those
establishments, such a law would be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen other states, including New York, have laws that protect
abortion clinics specifically or medical offices generally against
physical disruption. New York, Connecticut and 16 other states
filed a brief asking the court to uphold the Colorado law as giving
states the flexibility ``to deal with serious public safety issues
by appropriate means.''
</P>
<P>
   In other court action Wednesday, a unanimous decision had the
effect of upholding the result of a closely contested 1998 election
for governor of Guam. The court interpreted Guam's law on
gubernatorial elections, which is identical to an electoral
provision in the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The territories' laws provide that the governor and lieutenant
governor ``shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast'' by
qualified voters. The question was whether this meant a majority of
the votes for those offices, or a majority of all the ballots cast
in the general election, even those ballots that recorded votes for
other offices but left the governor's line blank.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 9th U.S. Circuity Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco, the law required a majority of all the ballots cast.
Although the incumbent governor of Guam, Carl T.C. Gutierrez, had
received 3,050 more votes than his challenger, Joseph Ada, a former
governor, the 9th Circuit said there had to be a runoff election
because he had not received a majority of all ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Wednesday in Gutierrez vs. Ada, No. 99-51,
Justice David H. Souter said that was an ``odd'' reading of the
statute as opposed to the ``obvious'' reading that made Gutierrez
the winner.

WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR URGES ACTION AGAINST KRADZIC

<P>
   LONDON _ International war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte
Wednesday implored NATO to do more to arrest former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, even as her office said it hoped that
others under indictment for war crimes would turn themselves in
following the murder of a Serb paramilitary leader last week.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte met in Brussels with representatives from NATO's 19
member nations on the same day that Zeljko Raznatovic, better known
as Arkan, was being buried in Belgrade. Arkan, who was indicted in
1997 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia but never apprehended, was shot dead Saturday in the
lobby of the Inter-Continental Hotel in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after she met with NATO leaders, del Ponte
said she singled out Karadzic in her appeal for the military
alliance to do more to arrest suspected war criminals at large in
areas such as Bosnia that NATO forces control.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, she said, is ``the most wanted . . . the symbol of
this year, the fugitive who has been longest on the loose.''
Karadzic, former Bosnian Serb president, was indicted on charges
including genocide in connection with an ``ethnic cleansing''
campaign that left 100,00 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte acknowledged it would be dangerous and difficult to
arrest Karadzic, who is thought to be in the Serbian area of
eastern Bosnia and surrounded by bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan was always flanked by bodyguards, too, but one of them was
killed alongside him when at least two gunmen opened fire on his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that del Ponte prefers that Arkan and others
face justice before the tribunal at The Hague, her spokesman, Paul
Risley, said Arkan's murder may lead Karadzic and other fugitives,
including the Bosnian Serb general, Ratko Mladic, to consider
turning themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest and most secure place is the secure detention unit
run by the United Nations here,'' Risley said in a telephone
interview from The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   While many Serbs dismiss the tribunal as being beholden to NATO,
Risley noted that the international court has acquitted some
suspects and given lenient sentences to some who have cooperated
with the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past five years, the tribunal has proved to be
unpredictable,'' said Risley.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 33 suspects who have been arraigned at the
court at The Hague were apprehended by NATO, which has 20,000
troops in Bosnia more than four years after the end of the war
there. NATO Secretary General George Robertson said Wednesday that
NATO remains committed to arresting suspected war criminals when it
can, and he shared Risley's hope that Arkan's assassination would
be a catalyst for more surrenders.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said suspects who surrender and cooperate will be
treated more leniently.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan and his paramilitary unit, known as the Tigers, was
accused of slaughtering civilians in Croatia and Bosnia, allegedly
with the approval of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is
also under indictment for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts in Belgrade have speculated that Arkan was killed
by the Milosevic regime to forestall the possibility that he might
surrender and give evidence against Milosevic. The government in
Belgrade, which openly supported Arkan's activities during the wars
in Croatia and Bosnia, has denied it played a role in Arkan's
murder. The assassination of someone seen as close to Milosevic
could lead others ostensibly in the good graces of the Belgrade
regime to seek a safe haven rather than suffer a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan was seen to be distancing himself from Milosevic, and had
been in contact with Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindnic.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said that the chief prosecutor's office had had contact
with ``several individuals'' purporting to represent Arkan over the
last two years, but the discussions never reached the stage of
arranging a surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said the prosecutor's office ``surmises that most of
those attempts were to try to gather information on the nature of
the charges contained in the sealed indictment rather than to
arrange a surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Risley said it was ``possible that Arkan could have provided
information that would assist'' in the prosecution of Milosevic,
and that the judges who sit on the international court ``take into
consideration any level of cooperation shown by an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But Risley added that Arkan could not have made his own
indictment disappear, no matter what he offered up on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As for others under indictment, and presumably under the
protection of forces loyal to or friendly with Milosevic, Risley
said, ``If I were them, I'd be sweating.''

 &HT;    FINCA IRLANDA, Mexico _ A humming bird is singing among lush
green coffee trees in this forgotten corner of paradise, while a
spectacular blue butterfly makes a quick pass through a group of
wild-orange trees and yellow orchids.
 &HT;    Welcome to Finca Irlanda, an organic coffee farm in the heart of
the Sierra Madre mountains in the Soconusco region of the southern
Mexican state of Chiapas. More than 30 years after Mexico exported
the world's first shipment of certified organic coffee from Finca
Irlanda, the organic movement is growing faster than any other in
global coffee markets.
 &HT;    What started as a pioneer movement by German immigrants to
Mexico in the 1920s has today become a worldwide phenomenon for
coffee farmers, who are desperately looking for better and more
stable prices in volatile markets.
 &HT;    With certified organic coffee trading at premiums of 30 percent
to 50 percent more than the price offered for futures contracts on
the common arabica beans, farmers are eager to join the movement.
Especially since farmers around the world, particularly in Latin
America, where some 65 percent to 70 percent of all the world's
coffee is grown, have, over the last few years, suffered a string
of difficulties. The culprit? Low prices, which in recent months
have dipped to less than US$1 per pound, with production costs of
up to 90 cents per pound.
 &HT;    ``This last season, we have been selling our coffee at prices of
$1.60 a pound or above, generally about 30 percent higher than the
market price,'' says Walter Peters, the son of Finca Irlanda's
founder and its current manager.
 &HT;    Soon after Peters' father bought the farm in 1928, the coffee
market _ along with all the others in the wake of the crash of '29
_ became very volaile. To avoid the price dips and the use of
hazardous chemicals, the elder Peters decided to start producing
naturally grown coffee. He sought out the era's only existing
certifier, Demeter Bund in Germany, so that he had independent
proof to justify his claims of natural production and higher
prices.
 &HT;    While other Mexican coffee farmers in the Soconusco area at
first were highly skeptical of the late Peters' growing techniques
and use of organic compost, they soon realized that in years of low
global prices, the production at Finca Irlanda remained
economically viable.
 &HT;    ``Everybody here in the region at first thought that Mr. Peters
had some rather strange ideas,'' says Tomas Edelman, owner of the
neighboring Finca Hamburgo. ``But then, after some years with very
low prices, they realized that his production was much more stable
in an economic perspective, because he had a sustainable price.''
 &HT;    Today, hundreds of coffee farmers _ large and small _ across
Mexico, Central America and the rest of the world are joining the
growing international trend of certified organic. ``Because of
Irlanda, you have tens of thousands of other farmers growing
organic coffee,'' says David Griswold, president of Sustainable
Harvest, a small U.S. importer of select beans for the U.S.
specialty market.
 &HT;    According to Griswold, organic coffee is the fastest-growing
segment in the United States. The total U.S. market of organic
product _ including coffee _ is worth $6 billion. ``Since the
beginning of the 1990s, you've seen really explosive growth of
organic coffee,'' he says.
 &HT;    A recent report from the London-based Association of Coffee
Producing Countries reports that, at 3 percent per year, organic
coffee consumption is growing almost twice as fast globally as that
of any other kind of coffee. Yet, it still accounts for just 1
percent of the some 20 million 132-pound bags of coffee consumed on
average every year in the United States, the world's largest
consuming nation of java.
 &HT;    As pioneers of natural production, Finca Irlanda is still light
years ahead in the movement now racing through the markets in the
United States, Europe and Japan.
 &HT;    There are plenty of critics of the organic movement, whose
members question whether these products really deserve higher
premiums at market and whether they are cultivated any different
than regular coffee beans. Those criticisms are quickly shot down
by coffee people such as Griswold.
 &HT;    ``Without inspections and certification, there would not be
premiums for growers, as people would simply relabel their coffee
as organic,' regardless of the origin,'' he says. ``Certification
is a necessary step to ensure consumers get what they are paying
for, which is a coffee grown without chemicals.''
 &HT;    According to a certificate from Demeter Association, which is
one of only a handful of large certification agencies, an organic
farm must prove ``no use of synthesized fertilizer, pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides or fumigants'' while using only ``organic,
naturally produced fertilizer.''
 &HT;    To ensure that producers are growing coffee without chemicals,
farms are visited and reevaluated every year. Standards must be
followed for 36 months before certification can be considered,
while soil tests are taken to trace any possible unauthorized use
of chemicals. Demeter also demands that a producer must operate ``a
balanced farm ecosystem [and] crop diversification, which provides
a favorable environment for animals and birds.''
 &HT;    A trip through Finca Irlanda is a mind-blowing experience, with
nature and coffee existing in total harmony with each other.
Oftentimes a visitor will be more interested in the colorful flora
and fauna in the tropical rain forest than the quick injection of
caffeine gained by a sip of the brew from the juicy red berries
once they're roasted. It is also quite an adventure. ``Watch out,''
Peters shouts to a small group of visitors, as he points to a
1.2-meter-long frog snake that slithers gracefully through the
grass ahead.
 &HT;    At Finca Irlanda, many studies conducted by universities and
biologists over the years have found an impressive number of
varieties of both animals and plant species at its 790 acres of
land. Only 667 acres are used to grow coffee, while the remaining
123 acres have been maintained as a 100 to 130-feet high tropical
rain forest. ``A team of researchers from the University of
Michigan in the United States found more than 80 species of ants in
just one area of the farm,'' Peters says.
 &HT;    Peters says other research teams have detected 87 species of
spiders, more than 50 different species of tropical trees and 63
butterflies in just one particular plot of the farm. And of the
more than 8,000 plant species existing in Chiapas, more than 500
can be found within the farm land of Irlanda, he adds.
 &HT;    Peters, himself a devoted ornithologist, also estimates that
there are more than 200 different tropical birds living within the
farm. Hundreds more come to visit every year during the winter
migration of thousands of birds from Canada and the U.S.
 &HT;    That the coffee is grown in harmony with nature shows in the
lower average yields of about 4,989 pounds per acre, versus 7,484
to 9,978 pounds per acre in an average non-organic coffee farm with
intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
 &HT;    The yield is also lower because tropical trees growing between
the coffee trees reduce the density of coffee trees per hectare.
Shade-grown techniques also limit the plant's direct exposure to
the sun while allowing for flora and fauna to live alongside.
 &HT;    The organic compost is the most important aspect of natural
growing, Peters explains. ``When the first investigators came to
the farm in 1964, we realized we had to enrich the compost instead
of only making it by the pulp left after processing the coffee,''
he says.
 &HT;    Finca Irlanda now has a production of more than 1,000 tons of
organic compost a year. Besides the pulp, the compost includes
cattle manure, weeds, sugar cane bagasse, dolomite and milled
granite, most of which are produced at the farm.
 &HT;    Peters says all farm diseases or other problems are treated with
``natural enemies.'' For example, the area's volcanic soil is
enriched with dolomite limestone to lower the natural high soil
acidity. Coffee rust, a fungus that attacks the leaves and
eventually causes the trees to die if left untreated, is limited by
severe pruning. And the coffee broca, a worm that eats the berry
from the inside out and can cause losses of up to 20 percent in an
infected tree, is treated with the natural fungus entomophagous
fungi, or beauvaria bassiana, which is developed in cooked rice at
the local agricultural research stations and sprayed once every
year on all trees in areas potentially infected.
 &HT;    While many believe the movement for naturally grown products is
just a passing fad, Peters feels that organic coffee will continue
to increase its market share among consumers worldwide. ``The trend
of ecologically friendly and sustainable grown coffee is here to
stay,'' he says. ``And there is room for growth, even if that
growth comes slowly.''

 &HT;    A recent report from the London-based Association of Coffee
Producing Countries reports that, at 3 percent per year, organic
coffee consumption is growing almost twice as fast globally as that
of any other kind of coffee. Yet, it still accounts for just 1
percent of the some 20 million 132-pound bags of coffee consumed on
average every year in the United States, the world's largest
consuming nation of java.
 &HT;    As pioneers of natural production, Finca Irlanda is still light
years ahead in the movement now racing through the markets in the
United States, Europe and Japan.
 &HT;    There are plenty of critics of the organic movement, whose
members question whether these products really deserve higher
premiums at market and whether they are cultivated any different
than regular coffee beans. Those criticisms are quickly shot down
by coffee people such as Griswold.
 &HT;    ``Without inspections and certification, there would not be
premiums for growers, as people would simply relabel their coffee
as organic,' regardless of the origin,'' he says. ``Certification
is a necessary step to ensure consumers get what they are paying
for, which is a coffee grown without chemicals.''
 &HT;    According to a certificate from Demeter Association, which is
one of only a handful of large certification agencies, an organic
farm must prove ``no use of synthesized fertilizer, pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides or fumigants'' while using only ``organic,
naturally produced fertilizer.''
 &HT;    To ensure that producers are growing coffee without chemicals,
farms are visited and reevaluated every year. Standards must be
followed for 36 months before certification can be considered,
while soil tests are taken to trace any possible unauthorized use
of chemicals. Demeter also demands that a producer must operate ``a
balanced farm ecosystem [and] crop diversification, which provides
a favorable environment for animals and birds.''
 &HT;    A trip through Finca Irlanda is a mind-blowing experience, with
nature and coffee existing in total harmony with each other.
Oftentimes a visitor will be more interested in the colorful flora
and fauna in the tropical rain forest than the quick injection of
caffeine gained by a sip of the brew from the juicy red berries
once they're roasted. It is also quite an adventure. ``Watch out,''
Peters shouts to a small group of visitors, as he points to a
1.2-meter-long frog snake that slithers gracefully through the
grass ahead.
 &HT;    At Finca Irlanda, many studies conducted by universities and
biologists over the years have found an impressive number of
varieties of both animals and plant species at its 790 acres of
land. Only 667 acres are used to grow coffee, while the remaining
123 acres have been maintained as a 100 to 130-feet high tropical
rain forest. ``A team of researchers from the University of
Michigan in the United States found more than 80 species of ants in
just one area of the farm,'' Peters says.
 &HT;    Peters says other research teams have detected 87 species of
spiders, more than 50 different species of tropical trees and 63
butterflies in just one particular plot of the farm. And of the
more than 8,000 plant species existing in Chiapas, more than 500
can be found within the farm land of Irlanda, he adds.
 &HT;    Peters, himself a devoted ornithologist, also estimates that
there are more than 200 different tropical birds living within the
farm. Hundreds more come to visit every year during the winter
migration of thousands of birds from Canada and the U.S.
 &HT;    That the coffee is grown in harmony with nature shows in the
lower average yields of about 4,989 pounds per acre, versus 7,484
to 9,978 pounds per acre in an average non-organic coffee farm with
intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
 &HT;    The yield is also lower because tropical trees growing between
the coffee trees reduce the density of coffee trees per hectare.
Shade-grown techniques also limit the plant's direct exposure to
the sun while allowing for flora and fauna to live alongside.
 &HT;    The organic compost is the most important aspect of natural
growing, Peters explains. ``When the first investigators came to
the farm in 1964, we realized we had to enrich the compost instead
of only making it by the pulp left after processing the coffee,''
he says.
 &HT;    Finca Irlanda now has a production of more than 1,000 tons of
organic compost a year. Besides the pulp, the compost includes
cattle manure, weeds, sugar cane bagasse, dolomite and milled
granite, most of which are produced at the farm.
 &HT;    Peters says all farm diseases or other problems are treated with
``natural enemies.'' For example, the area's volcanic soil is
enriched with dolomite limestone to lower the natural high soil
acidity. Coffee rust, a fungus that attacks the leaves and
eventually causes the trees to die if left untreated, is limited by
severe pruning. And the coffee broca, a worm that eats the berry
from the inside out and can cause losses of up to 20 percent in an
infected tree, is treated with the natural fungus entomophagous
fungi, or beauvaria bassiana, which is developed in cooked rice at
the local agricultural research stations and sprayed once every
year on all trees in areas potentially infected.
 &HT;    While many believe the movement for naturally grown products is
just a passing fad, Peters feels that organic coffee will continue
to increase its market share among consumers worldwide. ``The trend
of ecologically friendly and sustainable grown coffee is here to
stay,'' he says. ``And there is room for growth, even if that
growth comes slowly.''

<P>
   In the hope that it will serve as an incentive for contemporary
artists to forsake the canvas for the computer keyboard, the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art is establishing a $50,000 annual
competition for Internet art, part of the museum's ambitious plan
for stimulating interest in the emerging genre.
</P>
<P>
   To be presented during the annual ceremony for the Webby Awards,
often billed as the Internet's version of the Oscars, the museum's
Webby Prize for Excellence in Online Art will go to as many as
three digital artists for their overall work, not for specific Web
sites. The cash prize, financed by an anonymous donor, will be
divided among the winners. The first recipients will be announced
at the Webby Awards 2000 event May 11 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   David Ross, the museum's director, said the new award was
designed to call attention to the Internet as a medium for creative
expression and to encourage artists to explore its aesthetic
potential. The prize, Ross said, was also meant to ``spur
additional thinking about what kind of activity takes place on the
Web in an artistic framework.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the museum will initiate a redesigned and
expanded Web site with a strong educational focus and an online
gallery, called e.space, for Internet art.
</P>
<P>
   The winners of the new Webby Prize will be selected by a
seven-member jury made up of four of the museum's curators and
three outside experts. An international call for entries will open
Feb. 21. On May 12, the day after the awards ceremony, the museum
will hold a symposium on online art, with the winning artists
invited to take part in serious discussion of the genre, Ross said.

 &HT;    FINCA IRLANDA, Mexico _ Un colibri canta entre los verdes
cafetos en esta esquina olvidada del paraiso, mientras una
espectacular mariposa azul revolotea entre un grupo de naranjos
silvestres y orquideas amarillas
 &HT;    Bienvenido a la Finca Irlanda, una granja de cafe cultivado
organicamente en el corazon de las montanas de la Sierra Madre, en
la zona de Soconusco del estado de Chiapas. Mas de 30 anos despues
que Mexico exporto el primer cargamento mundial de cafe organico
certificado desde la Finca Irlanda, esta forma de cultivo crece mas
rapido que cualquier otro mercado del sector.
 &HT;    Lo que varios inmigrantes iniciaron en Mexico en los anos 1920,
hoy se ha convertido en un fenomeno mundial para los cafeteros, que
buscan con desespero precios mejores y mas estables en un mercado
volatil.
 &HT;    En momentos en que el cafe organico certificado se negocia a una
prima del 30 por ciento al 50 por ciento por encima del precio de
los contratos a futuro de la variedad arabiga comun, los
cultivadores estan mas que dispuestos a sumarse al movimiento,
especialmente porque que los cafeteros, particularmente en
Latinoamerica, donde se cultiva casi el 70 por ciento del cafe
mundial, han sufrido numerosos problemas en los ultimos anos.
 &HT;    El culpable? Los bajos precios, que en meses recientes han
bajado a menos de US$1 por libra (una libra   0,5 kilos), con
gastos de casi 90 centavos de
dolar por libra. &HT;    ``En la ultima temporada hemos vendido nuestro cafe a US$1,60
por libra o mas, generalmente un 30 por ciento sobre el precio del
mercado,'' afirma Walter Peters, hijo del fundador y actual
administrador de la Finca Irlanda.
 &HT;    Poco despues que el padre de Peters adquirio la granja en 1928,
el mercado del cafe (con todos los demas a raiz de la depresion de
1929) cayo presa de la volatilidad. Para evitar las bajas de
precios y el uso de productos quimicos peligrosos, Peters padre
decidio comenzar a cultivar cafe por medios naturales. Peters
contrato los servicios de la unica entidad certificadora en aquel
momento, Demeter Bund, de Alemania, para probar que su cafe se
producia por medios naturales y que eso justificaba el precio mas
elevado.
 &HT;    Mientras otros cafeteros de Soconusco inicialmente se mostraron
muy escepticos sobre las tecnicas de cultivo de Peters y el uso del
abono organico, pronto se dieron cuenta de que en los anos de
precios mundiales deprimidos la produccion de la Finca Irlanda se
mantenia viable.
 &HT;    ``Todos en la region pensamos al principio que el senor Peters
tenia ideas muy extranas,'' cuenta Tomas Edelman, dueno de la
vecina Finca Hamburgo. ``Pero entonces, despues de algunos anos de
precios bajos, se dieron cuenta de que su produccion era mucho mas
estable porque sus precios eran mas estables.''
 &HT;    Hoy, cientos de productores de cafe, grandes y pequenos, de todo
Mexico, Centroamerica y el resto del mundo, se suben al carro del
cafe organico certificado. ``Siguiendo el ejemplo de la Finca
Irlanda, ahora hay decenas de miles de productores que cultivan
cafe organico,'' dice David Griswold, presidente de Sustainable
Harvest, un pequeno importador de cafes selectos para el mercado
estadounidense.
 &HT;    Segun Griswold, el cafe organico es el segmento de mas rapido
crecimiento en Estados Unidos. El mercado estadounidense de
productos organicos mueve unos US$6.000 millones. ``Desde comienzos
de los anos '90, se ha visto un crecimiento explosivo del cafe
organico,'' explica.
 &HT;    Un informe reciente de la Asociacion de Paises Productores de
Cafe, con sede en Londres, expresa que, a razon del 3 por ciento
anual, el consumo de cafe organico crece casi el doble de rapido
que cualquier otra clase de cafe. Sin embargo, todavia representa
solo el 1 por ciento de los aproximadamente 20 millones de sacos de
60 kilos de cafe que se consumen como promedio cada ano en Estados
Unidos, el mayor consumidor del mundo.
 &HT;    Como pioneros de la produccion natural, la Finca Irlanda todavia
le lleva mucha ventaja a la tendencia que ahora comienza a echar
raices en Estados Unidos, Europa y Japon.
 &HT;    La produccion de alimentos por medios organicos tiene muchos
criticos, quienes se preguntan si esos productos realmente valen
esa prima en materia de precio y si en verdad son diferentes al
cafe comun y corriente. Los defensores del movimiento, como
Griswold, defienden su postura.
 &HT;    ``Sin las inspecciones y la certificacion, no habria primas para
los cultivadores, porque los productores sencillamente indicarian
en la etiqueta que el cafe es organico, sin importar su origen,''
afirma. ``La certificacion es necesaria para asegurar que los
consumidores reciben un cafe sin productos quimicos.''
 &HT;    Segun un certificado de la Asociacion Demeter, una de solo un
punado de entidades de certificacion grandes, una finca organica
debe probar que ``no usa fertilizantes sintetizados, pesticidas,
herbicidas o fungicidas'' y que solo usa ``fertilizante organico
producido por medios naturales.''
 &HT;    Para asegurar que los productores cultivan cafe sin emplear
productos quimicos, las granjas se visitan cada ano y se realizan
reevaluaciones. Las normas deben cumplirse durante 36 meses antes
de iniciarse el proceso de certificacion y se toman muestras de
suelo para detectar la presencia de productos quimicos no
autorizados. Demeter tambien exige que los productores
``establezcan un ecosistema equilibrado y un sistema de
diversificacion de cultivos, que ofrezca un ambiente favorable para
la fauna.''
 &HT;    El recorrido por la Finca Irlanda es en extremo interesante: la
naturaleza y el cultivo de cafe coexisten en total armonia. Con
frecuencia el visitante se interesa mas en la colorida variedad de
plantas y animales de la selva tropical que en una dosis de
cafeina. Tambien es una aventura. Cuidado!, grita Peters a un
pequeno grupo de visitantes, y senala hacia una serpiente de 1,2
metros de largo que se desplaza majestuosamente sobre la hierba.
 &HT;    En la Finca Irlanda, muchos estudios realizados por
universidades y biologos a lo largo de los anos han hallado una
cantidad impresionante de variedades de plantas y animales en sus
320 hectareas. Solo 270 hectareas se usan para cultivar cafe,
mientras que las restantes 50 hectareas estan ocupadas por un
frondoso bosque tropical. ``Un grupo de investigadores de la
Universidad de Michigan hallo mas de 80 especies de hormigas en un
area de la finca,'' dice Peters.
 &HT;    El dueno de la granja afirma que otros equipos de investigadores
han encontrado 87 especies de aranas, mas de 50 especies de arboles
tropicales y 63 mariposas en una zona especifica de la finca. Y de
las mas de 8.000 especies de plantas que existen en Chiapas, en la
Finca Irlanda viven mas de 500, agrega.
 &HT;    Peters, un ornitologo devoto, tambien calcula que en la finca
viven mas de 200 especies de aves tropicales. Cientos de especies
mas pasan por el lugar cada ano durante su migracion invernal desde
Canada y Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    El cultivo de cafe en armonia con la naturaleza se refleja en el
bajo rendimiento de la finca, aproximadamente 20 bolsas de 46 kilos
por hectarea, en comparacion con 30 o 40 bolsas en las granjas
cafeteras tradicionales. El rendimiento es menor porque los arboles
tropicales que crecen entre los cafetos tambien limitan la
exposicion directa de la planta al sol, a la vez que permite el
desarrollo de la flora y la fauna en el lugar.
 &HT;    El abono organico es el aspecto mas importante del cultivo al
natural, explica Peters. ``Cuando los primeros investigadores
llegaron a la finca en 1964, nos dimos cuenta de que debiamos
enriquecer el abono, en vez de crearlo solamente a partir de la
pulpa que queda tras procesar el cafe,'' explica.
 &HT;    La Finca Irlanda produce mas de 1.000 toneladas de abono
organico al ano. Ademas de la pulpa, el abono contiene estiercol,
hierbas, bagazo de cana de azucar, dolomita y granito molido, que
en su mayoria se producen en la finca.
 &HT;    Peters afirma que todas las enfermedades se tratan con medios
naturales. Por ejemplo, la tierra volcanica de la zona se enriquece
con piedra dolomitica para reducir su alta acidez natural. Un hongo
que ataca la hoja de los cafetos y que puede matar los arbustos si
no se trata, puede controlarse eliminando todas las hojas
infectadas. Y un gusano que ataca los granos de cafe desde dentro y
que puede causar una perdida de hasta el 20 por ciento en los
arbustos infectados, se trata con el hongo natural entomophagous
fungi, que se produce con arroz en los centros locales de
investigacion agricola y se rocia una vez al ano sobre las areas
que pudieran estar afectadas.
 &HT;    Aunque muchos creen que el cultivo de productos organicos es
solo una moda, Peters opina que la cuota de mercado del cafe
organico seguira aumentando a nivel mundial. ``La tendencia de
producir cafe de una manera ecologicamente sensible llego para
quedarse,'' afirma. ``Y hay espacio para crecer, aunque ese
crecimiento sea lento.''

60 kilos de cafe que se consumen como promedio cada ano en Estados
Unidos, el mayor consumidor del mundo.
 &HT;    Como pioneros de la produccion natural, la Finca Irlanda todavia
le lleva mucha ventaja a la tendencia que ahora comienza a echar
raices en Estados Unidos, Europa y Japon.
 &HT;    La produccion de alimentos por medios organicos tiene muchos
criticos, quienes se preguntan si esos productos realmente valen
esa prima en materia de precio y si en verdad son diferentes al
cafe comun y corriente. Los defensores del movimiento, como
Griswold, defienden su postura.
 &HT;    ``Sin las inspecciones y la certificacion, no habria primas para
los cultivadores, porque los productores sencillamente indicarian
en la etiqueta que el cafe es organico, sin importar su origen,''
afirma. ``La certificacion es necesaria para asegurar que los
consumidores reciben un cafe sin productos quimicos.''
 &HT;    Segun un certificado de la Asociacion Demeter, una de solo un
punado de entidades de certificacion grandes, una finca organica
debe probar que ``no usa fertilizantes sintetizados, pesticidas,
herbicidas o fungicidas'' y que solo usa ``fertilizante organico
producido por medios naturales.''
 &HT;    Para asegurar que los productores cultivan cafe sin emplear
productos quimicos, las granjas se visitan cada ano y se realizan
reevaluaciones. Las normas deben cumplirse durante 36 meses antes
de iniciarse el proceso de certificacion y se toman muestras de
suelo para detectar la presencia de productos quimicos no
autorizados. Demeter tambien exige que los productores
``establezcan un ecosistema equilibrado y un sistema de
diversificacion de cultivos, que ofrezca un ambiente favorable para
la fauna.''
 &HT;    El recorrido por la Finca Irlanda es en extremo interesante: la
naturaleza y el cultivo de cafe coexisten en total armonia. Con
frecuencia el visitante se interesa mas en la colorida variedad de
plantas y animales de la selva tropical que en una dosis de
cafeina. Tambien es una aventura. Cuidado!, grita Peters a un
pequeno grupo de visitantes, y senala hacia una serpiente de 1,2
metros de largo que se desplaza majestuosamente sobre la hierba.
 &HT;    En la Finca Irlanda, muchos estudios realizados por
universidades y biologos a lo largo de los anos han hallado una
cantidad impresionante de variedades de plantas y animales en sus
320 hectareas. Solo 270 hectareas se usan para cultivar cafe,
mientras que las restantes 50 hectareas estan ocupadas por un
frondoso bosque tropical. ``Un grupo de investigadores de la
Universidad de Michigan hallo mas de 80 especies de hormigas en un
area de la finca,'' dice Peters.
 &HT;    El dueno de la granja afirma que otros equipos de investigadores
han encontrado 87 especies de aranas, mas de 50 especies de arboles
tropicales y 63 mariposas en una zona especifica de la finca. Y de
las mas de 8.000 especies de plantas que existen en Chiapas, en la
Finca Irlanda viven mas de 500, agrega.
 &HT;    Peters, un ornitologo devoto, tambien calcula que en la finca
viven mas de 200 especies de aves tropicales. Cientos de especies
mas pasan por el lugar cada ano durante su migracion invernal desde
Canada y Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    El cultivo de cafe en armonia con la naturaleza se refleja en el
bajo rendimiento de la finca, aproximadamente 20 bolsas de 46 kilos
por hectarea, en comparacion con 30 o 40 bolsas en las granjas
cafeteras tradicionales. El rendimiento es menor porque los arboles
tropicales que crecen entre los cafetos tambien limitan la
exposicion directa de la planta al sol, a la vez que permite el
desarrollo de la flora y la fauna en el lugar.
 &HT;    El abono organico es el aspecto mas importante del cultivo al
natural, explica Peters. ``Cuando los primeros investigadores
llegaron a la finca en 1964, nos dimos cuenta de que debiamos
enriquecer el abono, en vez de crearlo solamente a partir de la
pulpa que queda tras procesar el cafe,'' explica.
 &HT;    La Finca Irlanda produce mas de 1.000 toneladas de abono
organico al ano. Ademas de la pulpa, el abono contiene estiercol,
hierbas, bagazo de cana de azucar, dolomita y granito molido, que
en su mayoria se producen en la finca.
 &HT;    Peters afirma que todas las enfermedades se tratan con medios
naturales. Por ejemplo, la tierra volcanica de la zona se enriquece
con piedra dolomitica para reducir su alta acidez natural. Un hongo
que ataca la hoja de los cafetos y que puede matar los arbustos si
no se trata, puede controlarse eliminando todas las hojas
infectadas. Y un gusano que ataca los granos de cafe desde dentro y
que puede causar una perdida de hasta el 20 por ciento en los
arbustos infectados, se trata con el hongo natural entomophagous
fungi, que se produce con arroz en los centros locales de
investigacion agricola y se rocia una vez al ano sobre las areas
que pudieran estar afectadas.
 &HT;    Aunque muchos creen que el cultivo de productos organicos es
solo una moda, Peters opina que la cuota de mercado del cafe
organico seguira aumentando a nivel mundial. ``La tendencia de
producir cafe de una manera ecologicamente sensible llego para
quedarse,'' afirma. ``Y hay espacio para crecer, aunque ese
crecimiento sea lento.''

 DuPONT AWARDS FOCUS ON FOREIGN NEWS  
(bl) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a strong emphasis this time on international
reporting, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards for
broadcast journalism were announced Wednesday, and many of the top
honors went to prominent television journalists for work ranging
from South Africa to Eastern Europe to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Moyers and his production company, Public Affairs
Television, won the gold baton, the duPont Awards highest honor,
for a two-hour documentary on efforts by South Africans to heal the
wounds left by apartheid. The film was broadcast on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer and the ABC News program ``20/20'' won a silver
baton for a report on the neglect and abuse of handicapped children
in Russian orphanages that are little more than warehouses. The
report was produced in cooperation with the organization Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Simon and the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' also won a
silver baton for international reporting on what has been
identified as the worst atrocity of the war in Bosnia, the massacre
of 8,000 Muslims by Serbs in 1995 in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   In another award for international coverage, the PBS series
``Frontline'' and its PBS station sponsor, WGBH-TV, won a silver
baton for a story of a far larger massacre, the slaughter of
800,000 Tutsi by their Hutu enemies in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A small independent radio organization, Youth Radio in Berkeley,
Calif., received honors for work with an international theme:
broadcasting e-mail exchanges between a schoolgirl in Kosovo and a
California high school student that documented the girl's struggles
to stay alive in a deteriorating, dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the domestic area, Candy Crowley and CNN won a silver baton
for their work covering the impeachment of President Clinton, which
was cited for intelligence and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   The television station KTVX in Salt Lake City won a silver baton
for investigative reports on the bribery scandal involving the Salt
Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee. The station's reporter,
Chris Vanocur, did much of the original reporting that created
national interest in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A regional cable news channel, New England Cable News, won a
silver baton for in-depth reporting on a range of regional issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another television station, WTHR in Indianapolis, was honored
for a series of investigative reports revealing court-appointed
guardians' abuses of an elderly heiress to the Lilly pharmaceutical
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The television station WMTW in Auburn, Maine, and its reporter
Christine Young won a silver baton for investigative reports on a
conservative lobbying group, the Christian Civic League, which
revealed violations of IRS rules on funneling its donations into
campaigns against gay rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A radio production company, SoundVision of Berkeley, Calif., won
an award for a nine-hour series on National Public Radio covering a
range of issues raised by genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   The PBS series ``P.O.V.'' and its producer, Walter Brock, won a
silver baton for a portrait of Arthur Campbell, a disabled man
fighting to live independently.
</P>
<P>
   An independent producer, Stanley Nelson, won a silver baton for
a 90-minute documentary tracing the history and impact of
black-owned newspapers.

<P>
   ``Out of Order &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Donald J. Wold &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baker, $17.99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Donald J. Wold picked ``Out of Order'' as the title for his
study of homosexuality in the Bible and the ancient world, he
wasn't thinking of something as arbitrary as books being arranged
by date of publication rather than subject.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wold argues that the biblical worldview sees same-sex
acts as contrary to the created order of human nature, as a source
of ``impurity'' (a concept that he studies at some length) and as
the result of choices that, according to Scripture, can and should
be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Wold, who has a doctorate in biblical studies from the
University of California, Berkeley, concentrates on two areas:
references to homosexuality in the writings of such pagan
civilizations as Egypt and Mesopotamia, and the terminology
relating to the subject in the Old and New Testaments. He sees
attempts to create a gay-friendly interpretation of Scripture as
doomed by correct linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Order'' is written on a fairly technical level, dealing
as it does with ancient languages and history, but those who aren't
frightened by an academic approach will find it to be a
level-headed and scholarly book. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Hosanna! Music &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest release by worship leader Ron Kenoly could be
subtitled ``the miracle album.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We Offer Praises'' was recorded live in Fiuggi, Italy, where
Catholics and Protestants put aside their differences for the ``Una
Sola Voce'' unity conference.
</P>
<P>
   A unified worship service in a.MDNM/ historically divided area
is a small wonder in its own right, but the bigger miracle lies in
what Kenoly had to overcome to get to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he broke a leg when he fell while leaving a stage during
taping for a TV special, and his plans for the Italy album stopped.
But when he went for a pre-surgery consultation with an orthopedist
at his home in Florida four days later, X-rays showed no break.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoly credits prayer for his healing. That testimony is on the
album, along with the story of how he and his son survived an
airplane crash in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the uplifting testimonies, the album contains
first-rate praise and worship. Highlights include a rousing
rendition of ``Mighty God;'' a heartfelt version of Chris Falson's
outstanding song, ``I See the Lord;'' and the jazzy, ``Who's There?
God's There,'' sung by Kenoly's sons, Ron Jr. and Tony. &QL;

 `NAZI AMERICA: A SECRET HISTORY': '30s GOOSE STEP TO OKLAHOMA(EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Nazism has never found much appeal in the United
States, it has managed to infect small groups and impressionable
individuals in the decades since it first appeared on these shores.
Friday night's two-hour History Channel documentary, ``Nazi
America: A Secret History,'' traces the movement's nasty path from
the 1930s, when German-American Bundists goose-stepped through the
Yorkville streets of Manhattan, to the 1990s, when ragtag aspirants
to an Aryan Nation are preaching their doctrine of racial purity
and prowling rough country in camouflage outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the early successes of Hitler, Nazis in America
reached their peak, not a particularly high one, in the years
before World War II. The German-American Bund's doctrines, borrowed
from the group's German model, combined ethnic fellowship,
anti-Semitism and strutting by torchlight. At camps around the
country children were taught to say ``Heil Hitler!'' A rally
captured by newsreels brought 20,000 Nazis and their sympathizers
to Madison Square Garden; on the way home they were protected from
anti-Nazi protesters by New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bund was pretty much finished off by Pearl Harbor, and
10,000 German nationals, most of whom seem to have been loyal to
the United States, were interned in camps. But even after the war
Hitler's messages found an audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s George Lincoln Rockwell exhorted sympathizers of
his American Nazi Party that they should have been on Hitler's
side. Rockwell was a pioneer in denying that there had been a
Holocaust. As the civil rights battle expanded, he attracted
supporters by promising, ``I will kill every Jew, Catholic and
Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   During eruptions of white-power excrescences, law enforcement
officials were caught between First Amendment rights and pressure
to crack down on widely detested groups. In 1978 the American Civil
Liberties Union lost some members by coming to the aid of Nazis who
planned to march in Skokie, Ill., where many Holocaust survivors
lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nazi America'' discusses the continuing influence of ``The
Turner Diaries,'' a 1978 novel by William L. Pierce written under
the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald that celebrated a racist uprising
and seems to have inspired violence: a Jewish talk-show personality
in Denver, Alan Berg, was assassinated. In California, white
supremacists robbed millions of dollars from a Brink's truck. In
confrontations at Ruby Ridge in Idaho and at the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas, the authorities reacted in disputed ways
with dire consequences. Then came Timothy McVeigh and the bombing
of the federal office building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, a co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
which tracks neo-Nazi movements, estimates that some 500 such
groups are at work, what he calls ``a cesspool of vigilantes,''
with racial segregation as their objective. Hitler's legacy
persists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Changes in the Pacific Ocean are making it more likely that
winter weather in much of the United States will exhibit unusual
warmth alternating with sharp cold, scientists at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the pattern, prevalent this winter and
last, might predominate for 20 or 30 years. The finding was based
on calculations of the movement and temperature of ocean surface
waters, and the varying amounts of heat they bear, based on
measurements made by instruments aboard the Topex/Poseidon earth
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The data reflect a natural oscillation in ocean conditions, not
a sign of global climate change. Nor is the development tied
directly to El Nino-La Nina weather patterns, year-to-year
variations in ocean temperatures that set off atmospheric chain
reactions in many parts of the world, including North America.
</P>
<P>
   But if the satellite images do indeed signal the beginning of a
new climatic regime in the Pacific, there will be ``fewer and
weaker El Ninos and more La Ninas,'' said Bill Patzert, a research
oceanographer at the Pasadena laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In the natural weather phenomenon known as La Nina, sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are cooler than
normal. This sets off a train of atmospheric events that affect
weather patterns around the globe, especially in North America in
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is marked by abnormally warm sea-surface temperatures in
the tropical Pacific, which touches off a different set of winter
weather consequences, often including heavy rains across southern
tier of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a larger natural oscillation going on in the
Pacific, this one involving a flip-flop in sea-temperature patterns
on a scale of decades. When the ocean flips from one of these
states to another, Patzert said, ``it resets the stage for the
climate system; it provides a new background on which smaller
events like El Nino and La Nina can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of these alternating states of what is called the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation, sea-surface temperatures are warmer in the
eastern equatorial Pacific but cooler throughout much of the rest
of the Pacific basin. That pattern predominated from the mid-1970s
through most of the 1990s. It was also a period of more frequent
and stronger editions of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the last two years, the opposite pattern has appeared:
cooler water in the eastern tropical Pacific but warmer elsewhere.
That pattern last predominated from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While Patzert and other scientists said they believed that a
flip from one phase of the oscillation to another has occurred,
they also said it was too soon to tell whether it represented a
true shift from one multidecadal regime to the other. ``There
simply has not been enough time'' since the shift took place, said
Wayne Higgins, a senior meteorologist at the government's Climate
Prediction Center at Camp Springs, Md. Another five to 10 years of
data may be required, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a longer-term shift has occurred, and La Nina materializes
more frequently as a result, this winter's highly variable pattern
of weather in the United States would probably become more
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the positions of warm and cold air masses and storm
tracks shift so that the eastern part of the country is often
exposed to warm weather. Then the masses drift and sudden cold hits
the East. Meanwhile, the Northwest becomes stormier. Then the
pattern repeats. The Climate Prediction Center has forecast that La
Nina will persist into the spring, then fade. What will happen
after that is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   There is an additional complication just now: Atmospheric
conditions in the North Atlantic have shifted in recent days to a
new pattern in which the Northeast and Middle Atlantic are exposed
to the likelihood of cold, stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
   How that will play out over the next few weeks is not certain;
but government forecasters predict that February will be warmer
than normal in the southern tier of the country but colder than
normal in the northern tier, with above-normal precipitation in the
Northeast, Ohio Valley, Midwest and Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pacific Decadal Oscillation persists in its new state,
experts say, it might also portend drier weather and more frequent
droughts in the southern tier. Moreover, increased hurricane
activity is associated with this phase of the oscillation, and
there has been such an increase in the last five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scientists believe that large-scale climatic fluctuations like
the Pacific oscillation affect the global temperature. The last
time the oscillation was in its present state, from about 1945 to
about 1976, a global warming trend that had begun early in the
century leveled off. Then it resumed when the oscillation flipped
to its opposite state, rising in the 1990s to the highest level
ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, according to federal scientists, the
average global surface temperature has risen at a rate equal to 3.5
degrees Fahrenheit per century. (The world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer
now than in the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years
ago.) The dominant view among experts is that emissions of
heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide are
responsible for at least part of the last century's global warming
of about one degree.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been unsure what would happen to the global
temperature if the Pacific oscillation entered a new phase. Last
year, with La Nina exerting a global cooling influence, the average
surface temperature of the earth was the fifth highest recorded
since 1880. The previous year, when El Nino dominated the climate,
the average temperature was the highest.

living he earns, fishing and farming the land near the shore on the
outskirts of this modest town on the island of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   But to a visitor, Higashionna, 38, leaves no doubt that his real
passions lie in a movement he leads, one of the many groups opposed
to the relocation of a U.S. helicopter base in Nago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in this area and grew up swimming among the
coral,'' he said, casting his hand toward the blue and turquoise
bay nearby. ``We had sea turtles back then, and if you waded into
the water just waist-deep you'd be walking on coral. Now you have
to go way out to see it, but if the American base comes here,
surely it will all be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Japanese had never heard of Nago, a city of
55,000 people. But in the last few months, Japan's government has
offered a king's ransom to persuade the town, set in the country's
most remote prefecture, to accept the helicopter base.
</P>
<P>
   The blandishments include an astronomical budget of $1 billion
over 10 years to lift the town _ one of Japan's poorest _ out of
its relative underdevelopment. Nago has also been promised a spot
on the world stage, as the improbable host city in July to the
Group of Seven, the world's leading industrial powers. Already,
trucks seem to rumble in every direction as workers spruce up
public buildings, repave roads and complete a conference center
worthy of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the many who are opposed to the relocation of the
base, the government's lavish inducements have the crass feel of a
sudden and unsolicited buyout. What is worse, they say, the affair
has tapped the bitter sentiments of betrayal by mainland Japan that
Okinawans say their history is woven from.
</P>
<P>
   Far from celebrating its good fortune and looking forward to its
celebrity, this quiet community is now gearing up to resist the
base relocation with a most un-Japanese directness. Banners with
anti-base slogans flutter in the town's quiet center, while local
groups plan their moves to hold large demonstrations during the
summit meeting. Angry voters have begun a recall initiative to
unseat the mayor, who they say has caved in to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Nago are going to make it very difficult,
perhaps impossible for that base to be built,'' said Yasuhiro
Miyagi, a member of the city assembly who opposes the base.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of relocating the base from the central Okinawan town
of Ginowan stems from the rape four years ago of a 12-year-old
Japanese girl by three U.S. servicemen. To help lower tensions
after that incident, President Clinton offered to hand that base
site back to the locals within seven years _ if an alternative home
could be found.
</P>
<P>
   None of Japan's 47 other prefectures would accept a noisy new
Marine Corps helicopter base in its midst. So the Japanese
government did what it has done so often in the 40 years of a joint
security treaty between Japan and the United States: it selected an
area in tiny Okinawa, which is already home to about 75 percent of
the U.S. troops in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As Okinawa is remote to the main cluster of Japanese islands, so
is Nago to the population centers of its home island. Both Okinawa
and the city of Nago voted heavily against housing more U.S. bases
in referendums just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But engaging in the kind of behind-the-scenes political
choreography that is routinely practiced in this consensus-driven
society, Tokyo then began applying serious pressure, made all the
more effective by its huge incentive package. Week after week,
senior government officials and prominent politicians visited Nago.
Last fall, the city was named as the summit site.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two days after Christmas, during the traditional
holiday news lull when politicians often announce unpopular
decisions, Mayor Tateo Kishimoto announced that he would allow the
new base to be built, next to Camp Schwab, another Marine base on
the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Kishimoto, who declined to be interviewed, sweetened the bitter
pill with the pledge that the construction would be contingent upon
strict observance of local environmental and noise standards. But
the intended clincher was the announcement that the relocation
could go forward only if the base's presence was limited to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   But problems began springing up scarcely a week later when
Japan's defense minister, Tsutomu Kawara, met in Washington with
his American counterpart, William Cohen. At a news conference,
Kawara acknowledged that the 15-year limit had not been on the
agenda. ``Talks with the U.S. on whether to set a time limit should
come after views on the issue are coordinated domestically,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nairo Kabira, a historian at Ryukyu University in Okinawa, said:
``You might call this the fourth major betrayal of Okinawa. And in
each event, decisions have been made with no regard to the peoples
of Okinawa.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1879 Tokyo replaced the king of the Ryukyu Islands with a
governor appointed from Tokyo. In 1945, when the war with the
United States was already all but lost, Tokyo fought a last-ditch
campaign in Okinawa _ the only part of Japan to see ground combat _
in which more that 200,000 people were killed. Then, in 1952, Tokyo
allowed Washington to extend its occupation of Okinawa for 20 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has raised the success of the summit
meeting to the level of a national priority, and has even placed it
at the heart of political calculations for Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi over when to call critical national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as if it were an afterthought, government officials have
said in recent weeks that the site of the meeting could be suddenly
shifted to another city because of unpredictable weather in the
summer typhoon season.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Okinawans are already taking this to mean that
Obuchi will choose another site for his meeting if the government
fears it will be embarrassed by the threatened demonstrations
against the base. And as committed as they are to preventing
another U.S. base from rising in their midst, many say this is all
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy means to Okinawans that even if the governments of
Japan and America decide something, the people can make them take a
step back,'' said Zenko Nakamura, head of an umbrella group opposed
to the helicopter base. ``In any case, we can never live with this
project.'' &QL;

DIVIDED JUSTICES HEAR CASE PLACING LIMITS ON ABORTION PROTESTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A state's desire to protect a woman's access to
abortion met in strong debate Wednesday at the Supreme Court with
the right of protesters outside of clinics to voice their strong
objections to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently divided justices, delving into the persisting
conflict between abortion and free-speech rights, peppered
attorneys on both sides with questions ranging from how far states
may go to quell protest to how forceful protesters can be before
their actions become unlawfully intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate courtroom _ usually crowded with tourists, interested
lawyers and media during arguments _ was filled to near capacity
for the hourlong session on the emotionally charged issues of
abortion and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case is the constitutionality of a Colorado law
that sharply restricts protests within 100 feet of medical
facilities. Under the statute, protesters may not approach within
eight feet of a patient entering a facility.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who violate the law can be fined up to $750 and
imprisoned for up to six months. No one, however, has ever been
prosecuted under the 1993 law, which the state Supreme Court has
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Hill vs. Colorado, is reminiscent of the Texas Supreme
Court's July 1998 order that abortion protesters in Houston use a
``normal speaking voice'' when addressing women entering clinics,
and leave when the women they are trying to counsel indicate ``a
desire to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas court issued its mandate, which is not at issue before
the U.S. Supreme Court, after women who sought abortions complained
of aggressive protesters who allegedly hindered their access to
clinics. Likewise, the Colorado law was enacted in response to
reports of intimidation at medical facilities in Denver and other
cities in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of the Colorado case came
one week after the justices declined to review a similar appeal
from South Carolina protesters, who sought to challenge a judge's
order barring them from protesting near abortion clinics. The high
court, as is its custom, gave no explanation as to why it chose to
hear the Colorado case but declined to hear the South Carolina
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the justices, the Colorado protester's lawyer
urged the high court to strike down the state's law. Attorney Jay
Sekulow of Washington, said the statute unconstitutionally
restricts the protesters' First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado Solicitor General Michael McLachlan countered that
the statute, by preventing protesters from getting too close to
them, protects pregnant women and other patients from harassment
and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, pressing the
Clinton administration's support for the state law, said the
statute places only a minor burden on the protesters' ability to
express their opposition. The protesters remain free to oppose
abortion in speeches, discussions, leaflets and pictures, so long
as they remain at least eight feet from women entering facilities,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, expected to render their decision by July,
appeared as divided as the attorneys during the court session.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, though among the court's staunchest
opponents of abortion rights, expressed sympathy with Colorado's
effort to protect pregnant women and other patients from
intimidating protesters. He asked Sekulow, the protesters' lawyer,
whether his clients have a First Amendment right to get ``nose to
nose to someone'' seeking an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, though also an
abortion-rights opponent, said protests outside of medical
facilities are potentially intimidating. Hence, they are unlike
other displays of public opposition, such as rallies in city parks,
which the court has upheld as constitutional, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sekulow said the Colorado law's restrictions on
protests outside of clinics are as unconstitutional as limits on
political speeches on public property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is speech on a public sidewalk,'' Sekulow said of the
protests. ``There is not a First Amendment health-care exception.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the state's restriction
does not interfere with the protesters' ability to get their
message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can convey anything you want to convey orally at a
distance of eight feet,'' O'Connor said in apparent defense of the
Colorado statute.
</P>
<P>
   But other justices were just as critical of the state law.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter said the
statute's general prohibition on protests outside of medical
buildings could have the unconstitutional effect of outlawing a
slew of legal protest against other businesses. For example, the
statute could bar people from voicing their objection to lawyers
and other businesses who happen to share an office building with a
doctor who performs abortions.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan of Colorado conceded that the statute could limit such
lawful protest.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the minor obstacle the law imposes on peaceful
opposition is outweighed by the state's compelling interest in
preventing aggressive protesters from intimidating patients making
the decision to end pregnancies or dealing with serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute is designed to protect patients,'' McLachlan said.
``They are vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the eight-foot restriction still permits
protesters to make their opposition known.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, McLachlan told the justices that they
understood his argument even though he was standing more than eight
feet from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so sure,'' O'Connor interjected as the packed
courtroom burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom is expected to be filled again in April when the
court hears its other abortion-related appeal this term.
</P>
<P>
   In that case from Nebraska, the justices will consider whether
states can outlaw a surgical procedure _ usually performed late in
pregnancy _ that doctors refer to as dilation and extraction but
that opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''

 &HT;    MIAMI RELATIVES OF ELIAN FILE LAWSUIT TO FIGHT HIS RETURN TO
CUBA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

   MIAMI _ As expected, the Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban
rafter Elian Gonzalez took their fight to keep the boy in this
country to federal court Wednesday, asking a judge to overrule
federal immigration officials who want to send him back to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this lawsuit is to attempt to compel the U.S.
government to give Elian Gonzalez his constitutional rights,'' said
Spencer Eig, one of the lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed against U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
and top officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. No
date for a hearing has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Justice Department officials issued a statement
saying they will ask the federal court in Miami to move quickly on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is seen as one part of a two-prong strategy by
Elian's relatives to keep the boy from returning to communist Cuba.
The other major effort is to win passage of a resolution in
Congress that would give him U.S. citizenship or permanent
residence, which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American Congressional representatives have already been
lobbying for such a bill, which they expect to introduce soon after
Congress convenes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, head of the
Cuban-American National Foundation, the most influential
anti-Castro exile group. ``We have strong bipartisan support among
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Any such bill, however, would have to be signed by President
Clinton, who backs the INS decision to send the boy back to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Elian began shortly after he was found clinging
to an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His
mother and nine other people drowned when the small boat they were
using to flee Cuba capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban-American community immediately seized on the case,
calling Elian a ``Miracle Boy'' because he survived the ordeal at
sea. Sending him back to Cuba, they argue, amounts to abuse because
Elian would have no future there and would be paraded around by
Cuban President Fidel Castro as a symbol of his victory over the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro has been equally adamant, accusing the ``Miami
Mafia'' of Cuban exiles of kidnapping the child and keeping him
from his father and grandparents in Cuba. Massive,
government-organized demonstrations in Cuba have drawn hundreds of
thousands of people clamoring for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit comes two weeks after INS Commissioner Doris
Meissner ruled Elian must go back to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. That announcement touched off protests in Miami, as Cuban
exiles tangled traffic and sparred with police, who arrested more
than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives tried to out-flank Meissner by taking
their case to a Florida family court, where a judge ruled on Jan.
10 that Elian should be placed in the temporary legal custody of
his great uncle in Miami. The ruling would've cleared the way for
the family to file for an asylum hearing on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, quickly blocked that move by saying the family
court judge had no jurisdiction in the matter, since immigration
issues are solely a federal responsibility. INS officials also
turned down the request for an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, a Miami native, invited the family to file the lawsuit
in federal court, perhaps mindful of the explosive impact the case
has had here. She has repeatedly said federal officials would make
no attempt to forcibly remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona, asked by Reuters if the INS had
any firm plans to take custody of Elian to return him to Cuba,
``We'll wait and see what the court ruling is.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Elian's Miami relatives have little chance of
prevailing in federal court, where case law and statutes are
clearly behind Meissner's decision. Some experts believe the family
will not even get a full hearing because the judge may rule they
have no legal right to argue on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge James L. King. In
one other high-profile case related to Cuba, King ruled that the
families of several men shot down when they flew near the island
several years ago to drop anti-Castro leaflets were entitled to
damages from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, told
Cuban state news agency Prensa Latina Wednesday the she was willing
to travel briefly to the United States to pick up and return Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will only be there for five minutes, the time I will need to
pick him up wherever they have him _ in a church, in immigration or
wherever they place him. Five minutes, no more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they support the idea and would speed
processing of visa applications from Elian's father or
grandparents, but Cuban officials said they should not go unless
the U.S. can assure them they will not be entangled in U.S. legal
and political battles.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have said they will allow the boy to go
back to his father if the courts rule against them. How long it
will take to reach such a ruling, or how any Congressional action
might impact the case, are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very clear Miami's Cuban exiles will not let the issue
go away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should listen to what he has to say,'' said Marisleysis
Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``He has feelings, and I know he wants to
stay here. If that is the case, I'll take care of him like he would
be my own son.''

   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona, asked by Reuters if the INS had
any firm plans to take custody of Elian to return him to Cuba,
``We'll wait and see what the court ruling is.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Elian's Miami relatives have little chance of
prevailing in federal court, where case law and statutes are
clearly behind Meissner's decision. Some experts believe the family
will not even get a full hearing because the judge may rule they
have no legal right to argue on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge James L. King. In
one other high-profile case related to Cuba, King ruled that the
families of several men shot down when they flew near the island
several years ago to drop anti-Castro leaflets were entitled to
damages from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, told
Cuban state news agency Prensa Latina Wednesday the she was willing
to travel briefly to the United States to pick up and return Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will only be there for five minutes, the time I will need to
pick him up wherever they have him _ in a church, in immigration or
wherever they place him. Five minutes, no more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they support the idea and would speed
processing of visa applications from Elian's father or
grandparents, but Cuban officials said they should not go unless
the U.S. can assure them they will not be entangled in U.S. legal
and political battles.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have said they will allow the boy to go
back to his father if the courts rule against them. How long it
will take to reach such a ruling, or how any Congressional action
might impact the case, are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very clear Miami's Cuban exiles will not let the issue
go away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should listen to what he has to say,'' said Marisleysis
Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``He has feelings, and I know he wants to
stay here. If that is the case, I'll take care of him like he would
be my own son.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's  &UR; NEW &AMP; NOTABLE capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``YUKON ALONE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Balzar (Holt, $25) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable is a sucker for adventure stories, particularly _
given a certain publishing orgy of late _ any story that does not
take place on Mount Everest or involve bodies that will never be
found. We were happy to discover that the Yukon can be just as cold
as Everest and is not nearly so trendy. In fact, the sled dog race
called the Yukon Quest was established 15 years ago by traditional
mushers in answer to the increasingly chic Iditarod, which has
given rise to competitors (Balzar calls them ``big names in dog
mushing'') who dress like race-car drivers and have dog handlers in
matching uniforms. Not so the mushers of the Quest. They are an
odd, scruffy lot, and their race is an odd, lonely ordeal: 1,023
miles from Canada's Yukon Territory to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the
long darkness of February. Balzar spent months among these people
to profile the 1998 Quest for the ``Los Angeles Times.'' His book
is about a place where priorities are different and life is
demanding, and both are what you make of them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SUNDANCING'' &QL; 
By John Anderson (Spike, $12.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a behind-the-scenes story of the Sundance Film Festival,
and it isn't pretty. It is crowded, commercial, competitive and
very, very important to the independent filmmakers who come to
Sundance like pilgrims to a glitzy, overproduced mecca of their
dreams. They come in search of success, something that became
associated with Sundance after 1989, when Steven Soderberg's film
``sex, lies and videotape'' changed the face of both the festival
and the independent film itself. Anderson, film critic for
``Newsday,'' went to Sundance last year and spent lots of time
listening to people talk about it _ everyone from actors, writers
and directors to journalists, publicists and even a police officer
who impounded Clint Eastwood's car (``He was very personable, a
very nice person to visit with. He had his picture taken with us
and seemed to be enjoying himself.''). We must make do with the
implied presence of Robert Redford, whose reticence is notorious
and who is, one director says, like a ``phantom'' at his own
festival. Not surprisingly, he and the Sundance Institute declined
to be involved with this book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``MONSTER'' &QL; 
By Jonathan Kellerman (Random House, $25.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman is a psychologist. That gives him the upper hand in
this thriller, which begins in the exercise yard of a hospital for
the criminally insane. Kellerman's recurring character, Alex
Delaware, himself a psychologist, has come with Detective Milo
Sturgis to search for clues in the brutal slaying of Dr. Claire
Argent, who worked among the strange and frightening inmates of the
hospital. These men are incarcerated for life, having killed people
for no logical reason and with particularly disgusting and
blood-splattering abandon. How then could one of them have been
involved in a murder that occurred on the outside? You begin to
suspect the answer to this question around about Page 79, but then
suspense is not the strong suit of this book. That honor belongs to
its portrayal of these seriously dangerous men, their taste for
violence and their relationships with the people who treat them.
Delaware and Sturgis discover that Argent's murder has roots in a
dreadful crime committed nearly two decades earlier. We relive
every gory detail of it and more. Enjoy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LIFE STORIES'' &QL; 
Edited by David Remnick (Random House, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light the candles, practice the song, the ``New Yorker'' is 75
and Remnick wants you to make a fuss. By way of encouragement, he
has edited two delectable volumes. This is a collection of
profiles, biographical pieces for which the magazine is justly
famous. Included, among others, are Lillian Ross' look at Ernest
Hemingway, Truman Capote on Marlon Brando, Roger Angell on
baseball's Steve Blass, Calvin Trillin on Edna Buchanan, Henry
Louis Gates Jr. on Anatole Broyard, A.J. Liebling on Floyd
Patterson, and Susan Orlean's hilarious profile of a show dog
called Biff Truesdale. Remnick's second offering is ``Wonderful
Town'' (Random House, $26.95), a collection of short stories set in
New York and published over the years in the ``New Yorker.'' A
partial list of contributors: Philip Roth, Woody Allen, James
Thurber, John Cheever, John O'Hara, Deborah Eisenberg, John Updike,
Dorothy Parker, William Maxwell, E.B. White, Saul Bellow, S.J.
Perelman, Vladimir Nabokov, Lorrie Moore . . . we could go on and
on. Excuse us while we locate our matches and don our paper hats. &QL;

CHINESE SENTENCE A SECT LEADER FOR PRACTICING MEDICINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A leader of one of China's largest meditative healing
societies has been sentenced to prison for illegally practicing
medicine, the latest move in the government's tortured effort to
determine which such groups should be allowed and which should be
banned as superstitious cults.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a court in the eastern province of Zhejiang sentenced
Chen Jinlong, 51, the local leader of the Zhong Gong movement, to
two years for providing medical care without proper qualifications
and harming patients, a human rights monitor in Hong Kong reported.
Court officials confirmed the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong was founded in 1988, four years earlier than the
similarly popular Falun Gong movement, which was banned last July
as an ``evil cult'' after more than 10,000 members held an illegal
demonstration in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of others that have sprung up in the last 20 years
in China, the two groups claim to harness the body's qi, or vital
forces, through traditional meditation and physical exercises known
as qigong to fight disease and promote spiritual well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in the healing powers of qigong are widespread in China.
But after banning Falun Gong in July, the government charged that
its leaders had led many ill followers to their deaths by urging
them to avoid conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Like Falun Gong, Zhong Gong was started by a charismatic
individual with his own embellished variant of traditional qi
concepts, offering meditative exercises to promote health and
enlightenment. Its full name translates as China Health Care and
Wisdom Enhancement Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The founder, Zhang Hongbao, now 45, and his movement became well
known, by some accounts drawing tens of millions of followers at
its peak in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In that period the group often received favorable attention in
the official media, said Lu Siqing, director of the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in
Hong Kong. Press accounts in 1992 even said that President Jiang
Zemin had sought the aid of a Zhong Gong master to treat arthritis
and back pain, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as a fast-growing movement outside the control
of the Communist Party, Zhong Gong has had occasional run-ins with
the authorities, reports over the years indicate, with regional
offices sometimes closed down.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of Zhang, the founder, may have seemed too
great or his threat to the party too indirect for the authorities
to mount the sort of all-out suppression campaign being visited on
Falun Gong, which now has hundreds of organizers facing prison and
its exiled leader under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Falun Gong crackdown, officials have
intensified their scrutiny of other qigong groups, including Zhong
Gong. In December the police closed down the Zhong Gong society's
largest training school, in Shaanxi Province, dispersing about
2,000 students, according to the information center in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang remains in China and apparently has not been arrested, but
he is believed to be under close watch and his followers will not
divulge his whereabouts, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether Zhong Gong will be declared an
illegal cult, as Falun Gong was, or subjected to a more selective
grinding down by the authorities.

   DRY-WEATHER (Los Angeles) -- New satellite images show Southern
California could be entering a decades-long dry spell, according to
NASA scientists. But others said the evidence that our climate is
entering a long, dry cycle isn't so crystal-clear. JPL
oceanographer William Patzert said sea-surface temperatures and
sea-height indicators show a horseshoe of warm water in the
Pacific, with a wedge of cold water in the middle caused by this
winter's La Nina weather phenomenon. Patzert said he conferred with
colleagues during a meeting last week of the American
Meteorological Society, and decided the data were conclusive enough
to announce the findings. By Steve Carney. (Will move on the ``n''

   QUEEN-McCARTHY (Los Angeles) -- San Fernando Valley women who
appeared decades ago on the TV show ``Queen for a Day'' have their
own club and meet regularly for reunions. The TV program ran from
the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, entertaining viewers as it granted
the wishes of housewives, mothers and other sympathetic folks. By

   UNITED-CHARITY (Los Angeles) -- The United Way of Greater Los
Angeles will cut funds for the American Cancer Society, American
Heart Association and some scouting organizations in favor of
community based organizations. The United Way said the 15 charities
are ``good and strong: We know they will carry on successfully. Now
we must fund those smaller, local charities struggling on the front
lines against poverty.'' By Harrison Sheppard and Bhavna Mistry.

offers a comparison of how Los Angeles ranks against other cities
of its size. By Jason Z. Cohen. (Will move on the ``f'' financial

DEMENTIA EXPERTS QUESTION USE OF FEEDING TUBES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ariz., N.Y., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nursing homes and hospitals should end the widespread use of
tubes to feed people with advanced Alzheimer's disease or other
types of dementia, according to an article being published Thursday
in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The article is the second one appearing in a major medical
journal to take such a stand in recent months, and many experts on
dementia agree with the viewpoint. A similar article was published
in October in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Neither article presented new research, but the authors of both had
reviewed the medical literature and concluded that there was no
evidence that feeding tubes helped most patients, and that they
might, in fact, be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Tube feeding can cause diarrhea, bloating, infection and other
problems, and demented patients often pull the tubes out, leading
to the patients' being put in restraints.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Alzheimer's Association, Dr. Stephen
McConnell, who was not involved in either article, said: ``This is
a position we actually took years ago, that it is ethically
permissible to withdraw or withhold hydration and nutrition from
somebody in advanced stages. Now there's some scientific evidence
that tube feeding doesn't do what everybody thinks, prolong life or
make people more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said that feeding tubes, inserted through the nose or
an incision in the abdomen, are often used for the convenience of
nursing home staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in homes is that it costs more to pay a person to
feed a patient than it does to just jam in a tube and walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, insurers generally reimburse homes for tube
feeding, but not for having staff members feed patients or help
them to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The decision whether to allow the artificial feeding is among
the most difficult families must make.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Rosen, who lives in Phoenix, approved a feeding tube for her
mother, who had Alzheimer's but was still lucid when she stopped
eating. It seemed clear to Mrs. Rosen and her brother that their
mother would starve to death without the tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not putting in a tube was like murder,'' she said. Less than a
year after the tube was placed, her mother was in severe dementia.
Mrs. Rosen and her brother considered having the tube removed, but
they never could bring themselves to do it. Their mother lived
nearly 10 more years. The tube finally had to be removed when she
developed pneumonia, and she died less than a week later, at 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it all over again, I would do the same thing,''
Mrs. Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bettina Finocchio, who lives in Floral Park, N.Y., said that she
and her father and brother had decided not to tube-feed her mother,
Phyllis, who died of Alzheimer's in March, at 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all painfully in agreement,'' Ms. Finocchio said.
``It's very painful to watch someone die like that. But I think she
would have wanted it that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When her mother could no longer swallow even liquid, Ms.
Finocchio made Popsickle-like concoctions out of chicken or beef
broth, and used them to keep her mother's mouth from becoming
parched.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died at home, holding my father's hands and looking
at him,'' Ms. Finocchio said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases tube feeding fails to help demented patients, said
Dr. Muriel Gillick, author of the latest journal article and an
associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and
physician at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She said that such patients did not become better nourished or
live longer than others. And they still have lung problems from
choking on their own saliva and stomach secretions. In addition,
she said, far from being an act of kindness, tube feeding actually
causes suffering: people who yank out their tubes are put in
restraints, and then, if they become upset about being tied down,
they are given drugs to sedate them.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors should recommend against feeding tubes for people with
advanced dementia, Dr. Gillick said. Most of those patients would
be better off being helped to eat or fed by mouth, she said in a
telephone interview. She said that doctors and patients' families
needed to recognize that Alzheimer's is fatal, and that the loss of
appetite and ability to eat often marks its final stages.
</P>
<P>
   People who eat small amounts can live a year or longer, she
said, but most with advanced dementia who develop eating problems
die within six months, whether they have feeding tubes or not.
Those who stop drinking die much more quickly, in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   She and other doctors said that experience with cancer patients
who had stopped eating and drinking and who remained lucid showed
that terminally ill people not given food or water did not suffer
hunger or thirst and could be kept comfortable with ice chips and
swabs to moisten the mouth and lips. Dehydration leads them to
lapse into comas and die peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call it nature's anesthetic,'' Dr. Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans have dementia. In 1995, about 36,000
elderly patients with the disorder were given stomach tubes.

ONE WILD AND CRAZY AND POST-MODERN GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I want to be Steve Martin. I want his silver-white hair, wide
mouth, that intense WASPy quality he brought to ``Parenthood.'' I
want his celebrity, his smarts. When Larry King asks me where I was
born, I want to be able to say, ``Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   I deeply envy the man. Well, not the man so much as his works, a
fact of which I was reminded when I saw that WaterTower Theatre in
Addison, Texas, is producing Martin's acclaimed one-act play
``Picasso at the Lapin Agile.'' It caused me to reflect on all
things Steve: his movies, of course, but even more so his recent
career as a distinguished writer.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been funny, at least in public life. It's hard to
remember how innovative Martin was when he began doing stand-up in
the '70s, especially if all you have to go by are the dated skits
he performed on ``Saturday Night Live.'' (At the time hilarious,
it's now painful to watch him perform King Tut on a Comedy Central
rerun. Martin avoids watching himself in old movies and TV shows,
calling them ``strange and horrible.'') But his early concert
albums still hold up. He was the first master of the verbal
quotation marks (e.g., his goofy, sublime riff on his new drug of
choice: ``It's called a `placebo' _ it's `wild!' ''). Without his
ironic detachment, there would have been no Letterman, something
King Dave himself acknowledges by making Martin a ``Late Show''
favorite. As the ``Los Angeles Times'' put it, Martin created ``the
first purely exhilarating irony ever concocted'' which he used to
``transform stand-up comedy from a cabaret act into post-modern
art.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what I wanna do.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it's pretty well established that if you turn
anything into post-modern art, you are going to be seriously
bankable. In Martin's case, this became true because of the huge
market for post-modern art, which enabled him to make a sweet
living off post-modern phrases such as, ``Excuuuuuuse me,'' and,
``We are two wild and crazy guys.'' This led to movies, where
Martin made me and millions of others laugh with lines such as,
``He hates these cans! Get away from the cans!'' (''The Jerk'') and
``Those aren't pillows.'' (''Planes, Trains and Automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   I want to be Steve Martin for more than his oft-repeated film
dialogue, though. Movies are not all that Steve Martin is about.
They're what his fortune is all about. So, while paying homage to
his cinematic works _ from the masochistic dentist in ``Little Shop
of Horrors'' to the romantic faux-Cyrano in ``Roxanne'' to the evil
dude in ``The Spanish Prisoner'' _ we shouldn't dwell on his movie
career.
</P>
<P>
   Tangent: We also shouldn't dwell on his love life. If I were
Martin, I'd definitely spend less time buying rare art (the one
downside to being Steve Martin) and more time dating starlets.
Sure, he had that British wife, the one in ``L.A. Story,'' and she
was fine. But you figure that Steve Martin would be turning up more
often in ``Entertainment Weekly'' with, like, Catherine Zeta-Jones
on his arm, her lookin' all like, ``I am SO Steve Martin's date.''
I mean, Michael Douglas? He could totally wax Michael Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   I retract that last paragraph, because I'll never get to be
Steve Martin if I continue to write in such a juvenile way ... or,
should I say, in such a ``fashion de juvenile.'' For Martin has
become, in a very short time, one of our best humor writers, urbane
yet twisted. He wrote ``Picasso'' in 1993, and, before making ``The
Out-of-Towners'' and ``Bowfinger,'' spent three years writing short
literary pieces. Of them, Martin writes: ``They are the offspring
of an intense retrospection that enabled me to get back in contact
with my work, to receive pleasure from my work, to bring joy to my
work. They also enabled me to repeat the phrase `my work' three
times in one sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   If you missed his short essays in ``The New Yorker,'' you can
read them in his bestseller, ``Pure Drivel,'' which ``Salon''
called ``effortless and silly even as it's subtly erudite.'' It's
wonderful for many reasons _ for one, its subject matter. Martin
writes of fonts, for example, which perhaps appeals to me only
because I know several grimy writers who are obsessed with fonts.
I'm also fond of ``Writing is Easy!'', in which Martin says,
``Writer's block is a fancy term made up by whiners so they can
have an excuse to drink alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   His does more than ruminate on the arcane, although he does that
well. He is perfectly at home with universal subjects, like getting
old. (A constant theme in much of Martin's writing: the annoyingly
frequent bladder-relief operations that come with age.) In the
essay titled ``Changes in the Memory After Fifty,'' Martin suggests
this way in which the ``over-50 set can easily kill off a good
half-hour'':
</P>
<P>
   1) Place your car keys in your right hand.
</P>
<P>
   2) With your left hand, call a friend and confirm a lunch or
dinner date.
</P>
<P>
   3) Hang up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   4) Now look for your car keys.
</P>
<P>
   Or, take any chance you can to see ``Picasso.'' In it, you get a
taste of what makes Martin's works so alluring: a mix of
intelligence, self-confidence and slapstick that never fails to
charm. In this show, where a young Picasso meets with a young
Einstein at the Lapin Agile in 1904, the jokes are well-timed and
the big themes of science and art appropriately explored. But my
favorite line _ the one that explains why I wanna be Steve Martin _
is a line spoken by an old man late in the play: ``Sometimes genius
comes from strange quarters.''

ADMINISTRATION CRITICIZES BLOCKING OF ANNAN'S APPOINTMENT  
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Clinton administration said Wednesday that
it was ``unwise in the extreme'' to allow the government of Saddam
Hussein to exercise veto power over U.N. decisions on how to resume
arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing Security Council members who are blocking
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appointment of Rolf Ekeus as head of
a newly created disarmament commission for Iraq, the State
Department said that the United States stood by Annan and Ekeus, an
arms control expert who is now Sweden's ambassador in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and China have objected to the return of Ekeus,
who was executive chairman of the first disarmament commission for
Iraq from its creation after the Persian Gulf War in 1991 until
1997. They say that Ekeus, who cooperated closely with the United
States, including in the gathering of intelligence in Iraq, is
unacceptable to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow Iraq to make the decisions as some seem to want,
we are putting the whole system on its head, and we're never going
to get the disarmament the resolutions require,'' the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Wednesday. Giving Iraq veto
power, he said, is ``a prescription for problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States believes that nations that in the
past asked for more cooperation with the secretary-general _ a
Russian and Chinese demand when they deemed arms inspectors too
independent _ should now respect Annan's decision and not work
against him. ``It might be wise to give him the benefit of the
doubt,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some officials say they have been frustrated that
the American mission to the United Nations has not mounted a more
public defense of Annan in recent days, an echo of some diplomats'
comments here. The issue has been put more or less on hold in the
Security Council while negotiations continue behind the scenes in
diplomatic meetings, and through higher-level officials in national
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the American representative at the United
Nations and this month's Security Council president, said on
Tuesday that the council would have to tackle the issue but he
could not predict how or when. He also said that it was possible
that candidates other than Ekeus might have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus has said nothing publicly, but an official here said that
he is in touch frequently with Annan.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R-AND-B-MUSIC (Undated) _ There's a widening groundswell of
R-and-B artists _ and even some who fit more naturally in the
category of hip-hop _ who are sounding like an antidote to the
sameness problem: their records are more well-rounded, more
musicianly, more complete. They make a mature music, and a family
music, for living rooms, rather than for the streets. By Ben
Ratliff. (Moved). PHOTO. &QL;

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   WISEMAN-DOCUMENTARIES (subslug) (Undated) _ Who is the greatest
American filmmaker of the last 40 years? Martin Scorsese, Steven
Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, John Cassavetes, Woody Allen, Robert
Altman all have their partisans. But if the criteria includes the
most masterpieces, or the highest sustained level of
accomplishment, maybe we should also be talking about Frederick
Wiseman. Since 1967, when ``Titicut Follies,'' his portrait of a
state prison for the criminally insane, made its debut, he has made
a total of 30 complex, disturbing, illuminating documentaries, on
the average of one a year. By Phillip Lopate. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CATHERINE-KEENER-FILMS (Undated) _ It was in 1986 that Catherine
Keener decided that sitcom humor might not be her calling. At the
time, she had just got her first real break _ making her network
debut as the eldest of three daughters in a pilot called ``The Alan
King Show.'' Ms Keener, now 40, Whether in a starring role as a
helplessly distracted indie starlet in a shoestring production like
``Living In Oblivion'' (1995) or in a glorified supporting turn as
a magician's assistant and the ex-wife of an escaped convict in the
1998 crime caper ``Out of Sight,'' Ms. Keener's ability to be
effortlessly hilarious is all about appearing as if she's never
trying too hard. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NEO-NOIR-FILMS (New York) _ Film noir has gone from retro to
neo, and on Feb. 18, Film Forum begins a seven-week festival to
commemorate this resurgence. The ``Neo-Noir'' series includes
acclaimed recent movies _ ``Fargo,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``One False
Move'' _ as well as lesser-known features like ``Red Rock West''
and, for fans of the outre, a forgotten Sal Mineo film called ``Who
Killed Teddy Bear?'' Among the directors whose dark visions will be
offered are Joel Coen, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Roman
Polanski and Abel Ferrara. By David Everitt. (Moved). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BUDDHIST-SOCCER-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Cup,'' opening on Friday,
marks the directorial debut of Khyentse Norbu, 38, who is both a
high Tibetan Buddhist lama and Bhutan's first feature filmmaker. It
stars the residents of Chokling Monastery and is based in fact on
their obsession with World Cup soccer. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).

   NY-CITY-BALLET (New York) _ New York City Ballet's
post-``Nutcracker'' winter season is barely four weeks old, yet
among a growing body of regular balletgoers there is already a
sense of completion about it. Nagging doubts that in some quarters
had verged on dread are being assuaged and possibly wiped out
altogether. By Harris Green. (Moved).  &QL;

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JENNY-LIND-MUSIC (New York) _ One hundred fifty years ago, the
19th-century Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, made a revolutionary
tour of the United States, and the American soprano Barbara Bonney
has seized the occasion of the anniversary to indulge her longtime
fascination with her Swedish predecessor. On Saturday morning, Ms.
Bonney will present a workshop, ``The Legacy of Jenny Lind,'' at
the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center as the first installment
of her three-part survey of Scandinavian song over the next few
weeks. By Cori Ellison. (Moved). PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MENTZER-MUSIC (Undated) _ In a time rich in fine lyric
mezzo-sopranos, Susanne Mentzer is a quiet standout. She does not
have the biggest, most flamboyant personality or the flashiest
coloratura. What she offers is subtler: thoughtfulness,
consistency, vocal and dramatic depth and flexibility, and a
scintillating, elegant sound. Primarily an opera singer, she has
recently begun to take on concert and recital work as well. Ms.
Mentzer, who has a fondness for jeans and National Public Radio,
and none of the stigmas of the diva, is in her 10th season at the
Metropolitan Opera. By Sarah Bryan Miller. (Moved). PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON-RATTLE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Sir Simon Rattle, who turned 45
on Wednesday, was for a decade or so considered the heir apparent
to succeed Seiji Ozawa as music director of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in the event of a vacancy. In recent years, as the
likelihood of that eventuality kept receding into an indefinite
future, both Sir Simon and the orchestra seemed to cool toward the
prospect, and he was avidly courted by the Philadelphia Orchestra
to succeed Wolfgang Sawallisch in 2002. Then last June, a day after
it was announced that Ozawa would finally leave Boston in 2002 to
direct the Vienna State Opera, the Berlin Philharmonic elected Sir
Simon (italics)its(end italics) music director as of the same year.

<P>
   EGYPTIAN-ART (Boston) _ While exhibitions of Egyptian art, like
the well-traveled ``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' in the 1970s,
usually emphasized the excavation and discovery of artifacts in
ancient tombs, the museums that presented such objects were faced
with the question of how to display them. Most opted for an
atmosphere that was tantamount to reburial: dark, mysterious,
tomblike spaces. In installing the Museum of Fine Arts's permanent
galleries for Egyptian funerary arts and the art of the ancient
Middle East, the architects Jung/Brannen Associates of Boston
followed this approach but with a difference. Instead of dense,
dark spaces typical of such galleries, they have created rows of
transparent columns filled with light that serve as exhibition
cases. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS-ART (Undated) _ Until recently, the art world
sanctioned little work with overt religious content unless it
possessed a critical, subversive edge. Postmodernism, however, has
embraced religion as part of ongoing cultural phenomena. Now,
spurred by the millennium, several contemporary-art exhibitions has
been unabashedly faith-based, to borrow political argot. ``Faith:
The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Art at the Millennium,''
opening this Sunday at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in
Ridgefield, Conn., samples work by 36 living artists from six
countries who variously celebrate, wrestle with, deconstruct or
critique religion. By Ann Wilson Lloyd. (Moved).  &QL;

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-CULTURE-SHOCK (Undated) _ There she is, totally naked,
reclining on pillows in a full frontal pose, just three and a half
minutes into a prime-time public television show. It is the first
of the nude model's many appearances on the second episode of
``Culture Shock,'' whose first two installments will be broadcast
on Wednesday night. Even today, tuning in to PBS and seeing a woman
whose only bow to modesty is a well-placed hand comes as something
of a stunner. But the rest of the series _ in all, four and a half
hours in four programs _ is far tamer. ``Culture Shock'' turns out
to be elucidating and entertaining but, most of all, safe _ safe in
its choices of art to illustrate the never-ending conflict between
artists and society, between freedom of expression and censorship,
between what is conventional and what might lie ahead. By Judith H.
Dobrzynski. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-OXYGEN (Los Angeles) _ Geraldine Laybourne, 52, who built the
children's Nickelodeon television channel into an $8 billion
mini-empire, has now created a high-risk 24-hour cable venture
aimed at women called Orygen. The program will make its debut on
Feb. 2 in a half-dozen major cities and suburban areas (but not New
York and parts of Los Angeles). It will be aimed at women who are
in control of their lives, have money to spend and are eager to
find an outlet on television and on Internet sites that will
address their health issues, finances, relationships and problems
with raising children. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved). &QL;

AMERICAN RABBIS CALL   FOR ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TO SHARE
JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of American rabbis, concerned that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks might collapse over the tangled
issue of Jerusalem, called Wednesday for the two sides to share the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Jerusalem should be under the
exclusive sovereignty of one nation,'' said a statement from the
group calling itself The Jewish Peace Lobby and signed by more than
300 rabbis. ``The question is whether the pursuit of both justice
and peace requires that, in some form, Jerusalem be shared with the
Palestinian people. We believe that it does,'' the statement said
in part.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was organized by Jerome Segal, a research scholar
at the Center of International and Security Studies at the
University of Maryland, who founded the Peace Lobby a decade ago to
push Israel toward negotiating with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Now that the peace negotiations are edging toward the
final, knotty differences, Segal believes outside groups must force
debate on the most sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there has been no serious discussion inside Israel
about any general compromise on Jerusalem,'' Segal said in a
telephone interview. ``Jerusalem is still kind of viewed as the
third rail of Israeli politics, with the right claiming that the
left will redivide Jerusalem and the left saying that is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued Wednesday in part because the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is to meet with President
Clinton in Washington Thursday for talks about the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Segal and the rabbis say that the issue of the holy city is such
an emotional one that nobody has ever analyzed the actual geography
involved in detaching western Jerusalem from the the eastern
portion where all 180,000 Palestinians live.
</P>
<P>
   A survey devised by Segal with researchers from both sides found
that neither Israelis nor Palestinians viewed the borders of the
city as sacrosanct when it was broken down neighborhood by
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask people what parts of the city are important, only
the Mount of Olives and the Old City are really important to both
peoples,'' he said. The Old City constitutes only one percent of
the area of modern Jerusalem, Wednesday's statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The area within its walls is important to Jews, Muslims and
Christians because it contains the remnants of the last Jewish
temple and the third holiest mosque in Islam, which Muslims once
faced in prayer. It also includes a church on the site where Christ
was believed to have been crucified. The rabbis' statement said
that sovereignty in this area could come through creative
negotiations that would not have to apply to other lands.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested that the borders of Jerusalem, which have been
expanded again and again practically since the day Israel captured
the city in 1967, might be reduced to create a more Jewish city.
The eastern and western portions were physically divided from 1948
to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, by giving up control over the sprawling, mostly
undeveloped Arab areas, would remove from Israeli Jerusalem most
Palestinians, who would likely become citizens in a future
Palestinian state, anyway, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis who signed the statement said they felt it was a moral
question, that peace was the most important goal of the Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Jerusalem belongs to the Jews and only the
Jews, if that precludes peace, is wrong,'' said Rabbi Burton
Visotzky, a professor of rabbinic literature at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in Manhattan. ``I think in the end we will
have to live with our neighbors and there is no way around it, and
that includes Jerusalem.''
   But some who considered signing the statement _ about 1,200
rabbis were approached _ ultimately backed off because they
couldn't envision a practical way of sharing the city, among other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Others opposed the idea of Americans interfering in the
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over a city both
sides view as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   The position of most Jewish groups in the United States on the
issue of Jerusalem hues closely to the official position of all
Israeli governments, which is that it is their indivisible capital.
The degree to which any group is willing to debate that ranges from
the unwavering stance of the more hawkish groups to some elasticity
among the more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, have
committed to Feb. 13, 2000, as a deadline to develop a framework
for negotiating outstanding differences, including Jerusalem. But
those efforts have stalled somewhat and a spokesman for the Israeli
government said no change should be expected on the issue of
Jerusalem.

McCAIN CAMP CALLS VISIT BY BUSH ADVISERS `PUBLICITY STUNT' 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAISTOW, N.H. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush dispatched advisers to opponent John McCain's headquarters
Wednesday to defend advertisements critical of the senator's
tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Bush economic policy advisers Lawrence Lindsey and
Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to McCain's Alexandria, Va., headquarters
was characterized by a McCain aide Howard Opinsky as ``a publicity
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, national chairman of
the McCain campaign, accused Bush anew of trying to distort
McCain's tax plan to change the subject from his own that ``voters
do not want.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over five
years. Bush wants a five-year, $483 billion tax cut, a plan
analysts say favors America's wealthiest taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at Timberlane High School in Plaistow, N.H., Bush
defended his television advertisements. The Texas governor denied
that he was being negative by claiming that McCain's proposal to
tax employer-paid benefits would force workers to pickup their own
costs for education, transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ad that talks about a plan that is in writing,''
Bush said. ``If he (McCain) didn't mean tax `employer-paid,
non-retirement fringe benefits except dependent care and health
premiums,' if that's not what he meant, I'd like to know what he
did mean.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bush-McCain dispute escalated, a new poll found almost
two-thirds of Republican voters willing to forego a large tax cut
so the government could shore up Social Security and pay off the
federal debt, priorities pushed by McCain. The Time/CNN poll
indicates that only 29 percent of Republicans favor a tax cut of
the size proposed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Bush trailing McCain in New Hampshire, which
holds the nation's first presidential primary Feb. 2. McCain is not
campaigning in Iowa, where Bush holds a wide lead going into Monday
night's party caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Wednesday in New York, McCain told Jewish leaders
that he likely would support a U.S. aid package to help Syria and
Israel implement a peace deal and settle their long-standing
dispute over the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the senator said, any funds to achieve peace
in the Middle East should not come from the U.S. military budget.
He also said President Clinton should consult with Congress before
striking any bargain with Israel or Syria.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also told the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations that he favors moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem immediately and opposes clemency for Jonathan Pollard,
a U.S. citizen convicted of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said peace in the Middle East must be reached through
agreement of the parties, not from a dictate from the United
States. ``It's very important for the United States to be patient
and resolute in our role as a mediator. We should not impose our
will on the settlement,'' Bush said. ``There will be no lasting
peace if the parties are forced to accept the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has avoided questions recently about whether the
Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina state house is
racially offensive, on Wednesday defended Texas's recognition of
Confederate Heroes Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of our history,'' Bush said about the state
holiday, which was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate Heroes Day is one of five optional holidays for
state employees. Workers can take one of the five holidays off.

 &HT;    ADP takes last track at Windward
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPHARETTA, Ga. _ It's about time to hang a ``sold out'' sign at
Windward in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Westerra Windward has sold the final large tract, a 40-acre
piece, to Automated Data Processing for future office expansion,
and it has a preliminary offer for the last 10 acres of commercial
property. If the deal is done, all 1,200 acres of commercial land
at the prominent mixed-use development on Ga. 400 will be gone. The
last of the 2,200 acres of residential land sold out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Windward now has a daytime working population of about 15,000,
and the number soon will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now seen the complete cycle of Windward,'' said Howard
Peck, a consultant to Westerra Windward who is handling the sale of
the last tract. ``And it was developed in accordance with the
original plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck was involved in the sale of about half the commercial land
while he served as vice president at Westerra Windward.
</P>
<P>
   Westerra bought Windward from Mobil Land Development (Georgia)
Corp. in 1996. Mobil assembled land for the massive development in
the early 1980s. Its plan was simple: Build enough homes to create
a critical mass of residents that, in turn, would attract an office
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought Mobil was crazy for building so far out,''
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan worked. The first homes, built around the man-made,
190-acre Lake Windward, were so successful that a lottery had to be
held to determine who could buy the lots.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, several companies, including AT&AMP;T, GE Capital,
Equifax, State Farm Insurance and Ryder, located offices in
Windward. With its underground, concrete-encased power lines and
fiber optics, Windward quickly became the location of choice for
telecom and technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co., now McKesson HBOC, left the Perimeter Mall area for
Windward. When ETrade set up shop in Atlanta, it looked to
Windward. It did so again in 1999 when it chose to expand.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Prudential Insurance Company of America paid AT&AMP;T
about $14 million for a 62-acre tract at Windward and North Point
parkways. Prudential will use the land for up to 500,000 square
feet of office space to accommodate its growing local work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that Windward has contributed is the
fact that it set the standard for development (in Alpharetta),''
said Diana Wheeler, community development director for Alpharetta.
``Windward created the environment that allowed for a lot of
high-tech businesses to locate in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Alpharetta has created more than 55,000
new jobs, and a significant portion has been in Windward, she said.
It also set standards that other developers used for office parks
such as Hines' Deerfield and RealtiGroup's Brookside, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of jobs has attracted hotel and retail
developers. Marriott has built Alpharetta's first full-service
hotel at Windward. And Selig Enterprises is developing retail to
service the park's tenants, Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Automated Data Processing paid $5.6 million for the 40-acre
tract it bought in late December, according to Databank, an Atlanta
company that tracts deed transactions. The space likely will be
used for 280,000 to 450,000 square feet of new office space at
ADP's Windward campus, according to Databank. ADP did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ADP's campus employs about 1,500. The number is expected to
increase by 300 to 400 over the next couple of years.

 &HT;    Expo gives burgeoning poultry industry chance to preen
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's billion-dollar poultry industry puffed its
feathers Wednesday on the opening day of the International Poultry
Expo in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event is a showcase for Georgia's chicken and egg
industries, which have grown at a blistering pace in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the nation's largest chicken producer, slightly
outpacing Arkansas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Business contingents from as far away as China, Brazil, Nigeria
and Ethiopia roamed the halls of the Georgia World Congress Center,
inspecting the latest machinery and techniques for bringing chicken
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Georgia's cash receipts from poultry and eggs have
skyrocketed 75 percent to $2.8 billion, nearly half of the farm
income in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning the growth is consumers' ravenous demand for
chicken wings, chicken nuggets, chicken patties _ basically
anything chicken, often as an alternative to beef and pork.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita consumption of chicken in the United States is 82
pounds per year, according to the Georgia Poultry Federation,
almost four times the 1960 figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poultry industry is growing at a phenomenal rate,'' said
J. Craig Wyvill, a poultry specialist at the Georgia Tech Research
Institute. ``The demand for poultry is skyrocketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its exponential growth, Georgia's prosperous chicken
industry may be the next target of state officials seeking more
stringent regulations on water pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Abit Massey, executive director of the Georgia Poultry
Federation, said the poultry industry is currently working with
state and federal regulators to hash out regulations that will keep
the environment clean.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are concerned that runoff from chicken manure
could taint rivers and streams near chicken farms.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he's confident regulations that satisfy all sides
can be hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poultry industry sees more growth on the horizon. Domestic
processors are pushing increased sales through value-added chicken
products such as pre-marinated chicken and complete chicken meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making the food more convenient,'' Wyvill said.
``That's where the growth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia and Russia also provide fertile markets for poultry
consumption. Massey forecasts a 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate
for the industry during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   William Porter, a chicken farmer from Seneca, S.C., said he's
depending upon the growth of the industry. He recently expanded his
chicken-farming operation. Three additional chicken houses bring
his total investment to $900,000. His farm now handles more than
400,000 birds a year.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said banks that won't lend money to crop farmers will
open their checkbooks to chicken farmers because of the industry's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good business,'' he said.

 &HT;    New channel lures 300,000 subscribers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting's newest channel has added another
300,000 subscribers, many of which are in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The channel, Turner South, now has 1 million subscribers across
the Southeast. It has signed up one-sixth of its potential market
in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those subscribers are on cable TV rather than through
direct broadcast satellite services such as DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of tight channel capacity, most new cable channels,
including those launched by Turner Broadcasting, must first secure
a market through the satellite market rather than on cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South's initial success in on par with Cartoon Network,
launched more than five years ago. Cartoon Network, which was
trying to reach a national audience, had garnered 6 million
subscribers within its first eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South features shows catering to a Southern audience. Its
programming lineup includes such shows as ``Live From the Bluebird
Cafe,'' ``Southern Living Presents'' and games of the Atlanta
Thrashers, Braves and Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in October, the channel has a potential audience of 6
million subscribers. It's a market that extends from North Carolina
to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest deal, Turner South has signed an agreement with
Charter Communications systems in Georgia. Among the systems that
will now carry the channel are Athens, Gainesville, Smyrna,
Roswell, Newnan, Thomaston, La Grange and West Point.
</P>
<P>
   These systems represent some 225,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South is already carried on the state's largest single
system, operated by MediaOne in Atlanta. MediaOne also airs the
channel in its other metro systems, including that in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent deals, Turner South has signed up another 75,000
subscribers in systems in Alabama, South Carolina and with
BellSouth's wireless cable system in Atlanta.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the announcement came in December that Novartis would sell
its agricultural division, few analysts were surprised. But it had
to be a bittersweet moment for Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chairman of
Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   Just three and a half years earlier, Vasella had helped engineer
the formation of Novartis, which is based in Switzerland, through
the merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, promising that the two
companies' drug and agricultural holdings would create one of the
world's first ``life sciences'' conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to develop agricultural products and drugs with the
same technology, slashing research costs and bringing products to
the market faster. But the savings from shared research never fully
materialized, leaving Novartis among the handful of companies _
including AstraZeneca and American Home Products _ that have made
big bets on life sciences scrambling to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The synergies between pharmaceuticals and the agricultural
businesses turned out to be marginal,'' Vasella said. ``We decided
to move on, to focus the company more toward health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional drug industry megamergers are likely to increase the
pressure. Glaxo Wellcome's $76 billion deal this week to acquire
SmithKline Beecham _ a combination that will dwarf its competitors
_ has set a new bar, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors initially were impressed by the life sciences concept,
including the innovative biotechnology. By using gene splicing, a
technique almost routine in drug research, life sciences companies
can, for example, take a gene that wards off an insect from one
plant and insert it into another, making its offspring resistant to
pests.
</P>
<P>
   Even though life sciences was greeted with enthusiasm, it has
become one of the drug industry's biggest misadventures. The world
agricultural market sank severely last year. Commodities prices
sank. The European food market struggled, amid consumer backlash
over genetically engineered products. For most life sciences
companies earnings growth was almost nil; stock prices suffered.
</P>
<P>
   So Novartis and AstraZeneca announced in December that they
would merge and spin off their agricultural businesses. American
Home Products has been looking for a way to unload its agricultural
operations, but has yet to come up with a solution; it also has
been seeking a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   Even Monsanto, once the most vocal disciple of life sciences,
seems to be retreating. As part of its proposed merger with
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Monsanto, whose G.D. Searle unit makes the
popular arthritis pill Celebrex, announced last month that it would
sell up to 19.9 percent of its agricultural division in an initial
public offering. It also that it would cancel its $1.9 billion deal
to buy the Delta and Pine Land Co., a cotton seed business.
Analysts have speculated that Monsanto will eventually shed its
entire agricultural operation.
</P>
<P>
   A Monsanto spokeswoman said that Monsanto did not plan to
abandon its life sciences model. But the company's business
structure has clearly changed. Before its proposed merger with
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Monsanto received almost half of its sales from
agricultural products and one-third from pharmaceuticals. After the
merger, the combined company will have almost 60 percent of its
$15.5 billion in sales from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat from agriculture has not been without its
controversies. Companies that are abandoning life sciences must
develop new strategies, including finding new partners for mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, for example, had long been rumored as a potential
buyer for American Home Products, even before the latter announced
a planned merger with Warner-Lambert _ a deal that has since begun
to unravel after a higher bid for Warner-Lambert by Pfizer. But now
that Novartis has sold its agricultural unit, analysts do not think
the company will make an acquisition that would put it back in the
business. Vasella recently said that he would like to expand his
company's drug sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the number of agricultural divisions for
sale. Late last year, Novartis, Astra-Zeneca and American Home
Products, which together controlled about 26 percent of the $39
billion worldwide agricultural market, were trying to sell their
seed and crop protection holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers of agricultural businesses have become scarce,
leaving companies that have decided to remain in life sciences _
notably Aventis, created last year with the merger of Hoechst and
Rhone-Poulenc, and DuPont _ with few options if they choose to
reverse course.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   John Himes, a senior vice president at DuPont, said the
company's strategy went well beyond life sciences, as DuPont used
advanced technology for all its businesses, not just a select few.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Aventis said that it remained committed to life
sciences and that the company expected to save millions each year
through shared technologies. But even though Aventis is the world's
second-largest maker of agricultural products _ but will become No.
2 behind Syngenta, the proposed AstraZeneca-Novartis spinoff _ the
company's profit margins are some of the lowest in the industry,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aventis won't leave life sciences until they get all the
savings from the merger,'' said Sergio Traversa, a drug analyst
with Mehta Partners. ``But everybody will come to the conclusion
that agricultural and pharmaceuticals are good businesses, but they
are not good together.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several factors may explain why some drug makers were wrong
about the potential of life sciences. First, analysts believe that
drug executives, who tend to be very insular, did not fully
understand how cyclical agricultural prices could be.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is, by its nature, an unpredictable business,''
said Neil Sweig, a drug analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``The
depressed conditions in 1999 grew worse, and there are no signs of
a recovery for any time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But the short-sightedness does not end there. During the last
decade, life science companies _ including Monsanto and Novartis _
spent billions of dollars developing seeds that could lower
cholesterol and were naturally resistant to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Life science executives had thought that these genetically
modified foods would allow farmers to grow more crops with less
effort. Yet, despite being knowledgeable about trends when
introducing a prescription drug, these executives were dumbfounded
when consumers in Europe refused to eat genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage has been enormous. American farmers lost some $200
million in corn sales to Europe last year because of the backlash
over ``Frankenstein foods.'' Monsanto has been especially hard hit.
During the past several years, Monsanto has spent $8 billion
acquiring seed companies, only to be sued in December by a group of
farmers for trying to control the world seed market. The farmers
have also accused the company of rushing genetically engineered
foods to market without proper testing. Monsanto has said the suit
has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the controversy over genetically engineered foods, there
does not seem to be a market for it,'' said Bill Leach, a packaged
foods analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``People have become
very emotional about it. It's like beating your wife. There's
nothing you can say to make people happy about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monsanto may be in for even more trouble. The company's stock
has tumbled 13 percent since December's announcement of its $27
billion merger deal with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. Analysts have become
convinced that shareholders will torpedo the deal. Officials of
Monsanto declined to comment; a Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn spokesman said
the company fully expected the merger to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that the whole idea of life sciences is
flawed. ``Life sciences turned out to be a meaningless concept,''
said Andrew Cash, a chemicals analyst at PaineWebber. ``You can
make it mean whatever you want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   They also say that the drug makers' foray into life sciences is
relatively easy to explain. Despite the record introduction last
year of Celebrex, Monsanto's pill for arthritis, what drug
executives remember most about 1999 is American Home Product's
$3.75 billion settlement over fen-phen, the diet drug combination
that been linked to several heart ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Liability disasters like fen-phen are relatively rare, but drug
executives have spent many years trying to diversify to hedge such
a calamity. They have bought _ and sold _ cosmetics manufacturers,
medical device makers, confectioners and pharmacy benefit
management companies.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies entered the agricultural market with much the
same enthusiasm as they did their other businesses. American Home
Products was primarily a drug company until six years ago when it
bought American Cyanamid, a herbicides maker, for $9.7 billion.
Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz each had agricultural operations, which
became a huge division in the merger that formed Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, which was primarily a maker of agricultural and
industrial chemicals , expanded into drugs when it bought Searle in
1985. The company then increased its agricultural holdings rapidly,
often paying huge premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug companies don't want to put all their eggs in the
pharmaceutical basket,'' Sweig said. ``The problem is that the drug
companies tend to diversify into businesses that have lower profit
margins and more inconsistencies than drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   When Novartis first began its life sciences strategy in 1996,
the company's executives were encouraged by the reduction in
development costs. That soon changed, however, and even if the
world agricultural market had not collapsed, Novartis might have
abandoned the life sciences strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life sciences model did help us focus more on our total
business,'' Vasella said. ``Some of our departments did work
together. But the synergies between drugs and agricultural were not
great. When you went downstream, the businesses had different
customers and different distributors.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We were confident about selling our agricultural
unit to concentrate more on pharmaceuticals. But other companies
may not be there quite yet. You have to do it when you feel it's
the right time.'' &QL;

FED WILL NO LONGER DISCLOSE A `POLICY BIAS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it had
dropped its practice of adopting a policy bias toward raising or
reducing interest rates, and that from now on it would signal its
assessment of inflation risks through a formulaic public statement
after each meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said it was making the changes in response to
``unanticipated confusion'' among investors and economists over its
previous practice, put into effect last spring, of disclosing
whether it was formally leaning toward a shift in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosing the bias was initially seen by the Fed as a way of
transmitting to the financial markets its short- to medium-term
outlook for the economy, and therefore reducing the risk that any
change in monetary policy would destabilize the markets.
</P>
<P>
   But in a number of cases last year, financial markets read too
much into the announcements, sending stock and bond prices gyrating
on the assumption that the Fed's policy stance implied a
preordained outcome to the central bank's next policy-setting
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As the problems became evident, Fed officials said last year
that they would study how the disclosure policy _ adopted initially
as part of a gradual effort to become less secretive _ might be
changed to avoid knocking the markets off balance.
</P>
<P>
   The solution announced Wednesday seeks to maintain continued
public disclosure of the Fed's economic outlook without suggesting
that a change in policy has been all but decided. It was developed
by a working group headed by Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new procedure, the Fed will make a public statement
following every meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee. Under
the old procedure, the Fed was committed to making a statement only
in the event of a policy change or a major shift in its economic
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The public statement will contain a passage setting out the
Fed's assessment of the relative likelihood that inflation will
increase or that the economy will become weaker over the subsequent
several months. The Fed said the time frame covered by the
statement was specifically intended to extend beyond the time of
the next policy-setting meeting, and therefore not to imply that an
immediate policy shift was a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The statement would contain wording chosen from among three
options. If the committee views the likelihood of growing inflation
pressures to be equivalent to the risk of a slowing economy, the
statement will state that the risks are ``balanced with respect to
prospects for both goals,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed is clearly more concerned that a strong economy might
generate rising prices, the statement will state that the risks are
``weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened
inflation pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Fed by concerned mainly that the economy is slowing
to a rate below its capacity for non-inflationary growth, the
statement would read that the risks were ``weighted mainly toward
conditions that may generate economic weakness,'' the central bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A committee view that the risks are unbalanced would not
necessarily trigger either a current or a subsequent policy move,''
the Fed said. ``Given the inherent uncertainty about future
developments, policy actions often importantly depend on the flow
of new information and the committee's judgment about its
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not only will there be no mention of a formal policy bias in the
public statement, but the Fed will no longer vote on such a policy
formulation and will not include any bias in the document it
prepares at each meeting specifying how the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York should carry out monetary policy through its open market
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The bias was originally intended to suggest the direction that
the Fed might move if it were to shift policy before the subsequent
meeting, a rare event. The Fed said Wednesday that even though it
is dropping the bias as a policy tool, it still had the ability to
raise or reduce rates between meetings, though it stressed that it
would do so only in ``exceptional circumstances.''

LET'S HEAR IT FOR REARRANGING THE NATURAL ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not one to be second-guessing the circle of life, but lately
I've wondered if maybe the Grand Scheme Designer might have made an
error in the order in which we go through our earthly rites of
passage. To wit: Women, I think, should have sons before they have
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, I'm not condoning premarital sex. And neither am I
thinking we should all count on divine conception. In fact, I don't
care much How it happens. Just Why it should. Which is this:
</P>
<P>
   Guys are annoying. They have Annoying Guy Habits (AGH!s). They
will drive you crazy with these habits and, if you are a normal
woman, eventually you will deeply resent the guys in your life
simply for being themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, boys have the same habits, because _ and I think
I'm right about this _ boys are guys, only with smaller frames and
smaller egos. But something happens when those smaller guys happen
to be your sons. You find excuses for them. You justify their
AGH!s, and suddenly see them as AAH!s (Awfully Adorable Habits).
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that you end up raising the very people who make
you crazy.
</P>
<P>
   But if you had raised your boys first, before your man made you
crazy, maybe you could see absolutely Adorable in your guy whereas
all you now see is highly Annoying. And then everyone would be
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   Here are the examples:
</P>
<P>
   1. Annoying Guy Habit (AGH!): He never remembers to do anything
on his own.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for your gentle reminders, the trash would never
be taken out, the dishes would never be cleared, the bills would
never get paid. If you didn't take on the household tasks you do _
because someone has to and your guy won't _ the children would be
wearing clothes two sizes too small, the pets would die of
dehydration and the only thing in the house that would work would
be the cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The ungrateful wretch has no idea what you do.
</P>
<P>
   Awfully Adorable Habit (AAH!): He needs you.
</P>
<P>
   Your son can't find his underwear although it's always stacked
neatly in his top drawer. He can't remember to brush his teeth. He
doesn't know the names of all the kids in his class, so he can't
help with composing the valentines for his class party. He looks at
you as you get up to do his work with a slightly annoyed look on
your face, and then he says it, sweetly: ``Mom, you're so pretty.''
You happily fetch the underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Your son understands the real you.
</P>
<P>
   2. AGH!: He's overly obsessed with gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that man go when he's supposed to be helping you pick
out something nice for his mother's birthday at the department
store? Does he really think she wants the Palm Pilot he's been
coveting in the electronics department? And why does he spend so
much time pushing that stupid little pencil into that Pilot when it
doesn't help him actually make it on time to the school plays? And
speaking of school functions and high-tech toys, can't he leave the
cellphone in the car when he's watching your kids' soccer and
baseball games? Surely he can be incommunicado for one hour of his
life and actually be at the game he's watching.
</P>
<P>
   Who does he think he is, anyway _ the president?
</P>
<P>
   AAH!: He's got an affinity for technology.
</P>
<P>
   Your son is clearly a genius. He showed a real talent for video
games at a tender age, and so you've spent hundreds of dollars on
the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, the Color Game Boys and all the
mind-challenging games that go with the systems. He spends a lot of
time looking at computer and TV screens, but so what?
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he'll be the next Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   3. AGH!: He won't tell you how he really feels until it's too
late.
</P>
<P>
   You thought he looked a little angry when you said that thing at
the dinner party, and on the way home you asked if he was annoyed,
but he said it was nothing. It didn't bother him. Whatever. You
asked again and again, all the way home _ and again the next
morning. He said to drop it. So you did. And you forgot about it
completely. Five years later, you're in the middle of an argument
with him, and he tells you that ``You always do this.'' He brings
up the dinner party thing in detail.
</P>
<P>
   You have no idea what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   AAH!: He'll trust you with his innermost fears if you just give
him time.
</P>
<P>
   You're sitting next to him in bed. The stories are over. It's
dark and peaceful. One night, he starts telling you about how three
years ago, in first grade, he had a horrible accident and had to
take off his underwear and wrap it up in a wad of toilet paper and
hide it in the sleeve of his jacket in his locker and all day he
worried that his locker-mate, a girl, would find it. Another night,
he starts crying, telling you about how he didn't have any real
friends in preschool. You feel his pain so completely that it makes
you cry now, too. If doesn't matter that you didn't even know about
this before.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, you know exactly what he's talking about.

AT U.N., MANDELA APPEALS FOR INTERNATIONAL HELP ON BURUNDI 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Calling the civil war in Burundi a
``self-inflicted tragedy,'' Nelson Mandela on Wednesday outlined to
the Security Council his plans and hopes for the country as he
takes on a new role as mediator and enforcer of a faltering peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, a former president of South Africa, asked for help from
world leaders, saying he had invited President Clinton, King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia and Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, among
others, to attend an international conference on Burundi in
February in Tanzania. Mandela stressed the importance of concerted
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after the council session, Mandela said
the experience of 25 years of failure to achieve a comprehensive
Mideast settlement demonstrated that Western leaders might have
succeeded had they worked together, rather than trying to take
credit for peace ``just to boost their own egos.''
</P>
<P>
   About the Burundians, Mandela said, in the end ``no one can
reach agreement on their behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the Burundians to get down to business,'' he
said, repeating a message that he also delivered last weekend in
Africa at a meeting with Burundi politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The presence and dramatic briefing of Mandela, whom Africans
appointed mediator for Burundi in December, seemed to electrify the
council chamber. The council strongly supported him with a
resolution adopted unanimously. Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative, also announced that the United States would give
$500,000 to help Mandela's work.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also demanded access and better protection for
international aid workers, as well as displaced Burundians. Two
U.N. officials were murdered in Burundi in October, leading to
reduced relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said an absence of political solutions to a long-running
ethnic conflict coupled with a failure to reorganize the armed
forces and integrate rebel soldiers together sustained a situation
in which ``the population of Burundi has become hostage to violence
from all sides in the conflict.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Annan, opening the session _ another in a series of special
meetings on Africa arranged by Holbrooke, who is council president
this month _ offered an even grimmer forecast for Burundi if
violence cannot be contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in no other country is it so easy to imagine a
repetition of what we have all sworn must never be repeated _
ethnic killing on a genocidal scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, a nation of 6.5 million people in the volatile Great
Lakes region of Africa, more than 200,000 people have been killed
in civil conflict since 1993. Twelve percent of the population has
been displaced, many recently. Thousands have left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, more than 330,000 people have been rounded up
and forced into more than 50 hastily erected camps, U.N. officials
said. A majority of those evicted are Hutu, the ethnic majority in
Burundi. The government of Pierre Buyoya, a military officer who
took power in a coup, is dominated by ethnic Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.N. relief organizations and a group of major
independent aid organizations joined in condemning the relocation
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of this action on the affected populations has been
disastrous, as the government failed to prepare the sites or to
make provisions for food, water and shelter for those relocated,''
their statement said. ``Most of those relocated have lost their
homes and possessions and are being denied access to their
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, speaking to reporters after the council session, said
the United States roundly condemned the relocation policy. After
hearing Foreign Minister Severin Ntahomvukiye of Burundi defend the
move as an antiterrorism measure, Holbrooke said he thought that
the defense was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Ntahomvukiye, who said Hutu rebels were using the Bujumbura
region to test the level of unrest that they could provoke,
nevertheless said 10 camps would be closed, though not the ones

BETTINO CRAXI, FORMER ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER TAINTED BY CORRUPTION,
65 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bettino Craxi, the first Socialist to serve as prime minister in
postwar Italy, who ended his career in disgrace and self-imposed
exile as an emblem of political corruption, died of a heart attack
in Tunisia on Wednesday, his family said. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there had been intense debate in Italy about a
possible pardon for Craxi, who had been convicted in Italian courts
of corruption and faced arrest if he returned. He had heart trouble
and diabetes, and he had kidney surgery in November at a military
hospital in Tunisia. Although some Italian leaders were disposed to
allow his return to Italy, no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   A professional politician since his youth, Craxi (pronounced
CROCK-see) rose to the leadership of the party in 1976, at the age
of 42. To the surprise of all, he quickly reorganized the party,
crushed its left wing, substituted the rose for its
hammer-and-sickle symbol, routed his rivals and abandoned outdated
Marxist ideology. His program shared little of the tone or
substance of the Socialist governments that came to power in the
early 1980s in France, Greece, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after bringing down three governments led by the
stagnant Christian Democrats, Craxi forced an early election. The
balloting inflicted losses on the Christian Democrats, held the
Communists below the peaks they had achieved in the 1970s and made
Craxi prime minister six months before his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1987, when Craxi stepped down after nearly four years
in office, ending what had been the longest continuous period in
office of any postwar Italian prime minister, he was readily
described as one of the most durable and influential figures in
Italian politics.
</P>
<P>
   His four years coincided with vigorous economic growth as big
Italian corporations adjusted to the oil crisis of the 1970s and
small companies discovered themselves as aggressive exporters. To
contain legendary Italian inflation, he decreed an end to the
automatic link of wage increases to price rises; when his decision
was confirmed by referendum, it enhanced his image as a bold
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Craxi also proved an able master of foreign policy, engaging
Italy in Europe and the Middle East. He stuck to a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization decision in 1979 to station 112 cruise missiles
at a base in Sicily, despite strong domestic opposition and angry
threats from the Soviet leadership. By 1980 his party was at the
zenith of its popularity, with 14.3 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, Craxi's personality and style gained him
more admirers and enemies than friends. His single-mindedness and
political and oratorical skills contrasted with the flowery
effusions of old-style politicians. But his enemies saw the same
qualities in a less favorable light, and ascribed to him excessive
ambition, arrogance and manipulativeness. In political cartoons, he
was invariably depicted in jackboots, resembling Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s Craxi, a tall balding man who glared
challengingly at the world through owlish spectacles, had come to
epitomize the corruption that laced Italian politics and public
life and that ultimately brought down the postwar political system
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even earlier, allegations of corruption had dogged him. In 1987,
a close associate and supporter, a builder in Milan named Salvatore
Ligresti, was involved in the first of many investigations. Craxi
was accused of nepotism. In Milan, a Socialist stronghold, Paolo
Pillitteri, a brother-in-law, became mayor, while the job of party
secretary went to Craxi's son, Bobo.
</P>
<P>
   And to cement his party's influence, Craxi had early on begun
emulating _ surpassing, some said _ the tactics of the stronger
Christian Democrats, who had used a dense system of patronage and
political and financial rewards to assure loyalty. Indeed, by the
1980s the Socialist Party was so entrenched in the public
institutions that some experts spoke of a competitive system of
taxation, in which it vied with the Christian Democrats in milking
the system to support its political programs.
</P>
<P>
   Large state-run concerns, like the ENI oil group and the big
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, were considered Socialist fiefs. The
party laid claim to one of the state television channels,
influencing its newscasts in the Socialists' favor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as the corruption investigations continued to mow down
the elite of the political establishment, Craxi fled to his summer
home in Tunisia to escape certain arrest. There he lived, bitter
and in ill health, though always arrogantly convinced of his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of his defense was always: Everyone did it, and
everyone knew, so why me? ``How do you explain that for 20 years,
when everyone knew that the system was run on illicit
contributions, that there was not a single inquiry, not a single
trial?'' he asked in a 1994 interview with The New York Times.
``The magistrates knew, so they were also responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his predecessors as prime minister, who came from
the professions or from Italy's sprawling administrative apparatus,
Craxi was never anything but a politician. In a land where people
are made to feel naked without academic titles and where ``doctor''
is the minimal form of address for professionals, Craxi was a
college dropout.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the scope of the corruption charges leveled against
him, he never gave up a relatively modest lifestyle. Though he had
a summer home in Tunisia, he lived in a rented apartment in Milan
and, unlike most Italian politicians, had no apartment in Rome but
lived in a hotel suite when he was there.
</P>
<P>
   During Craxi's tenure as prime minister, Italian society was
undergoing sweeping changes, as the numbers of industrial workers
declined and the ranks of the urban middle class swelled. To appeal
to those new groups, Craxi's party took libertarian stands on
social issues like abortion. He shed the stodgy image of the old
left-wing parties, introducing slick new party conventions designed
for television.
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, when he took office, Italian economic recovery was in
full swing. In 1983 growth was 2.3 percent and remained at that
level for the next two years. But in 1986, oil prices and the value
of the dollar dropped, aiding the anti-inflation struggle in which
Craxi played a large part. In 1984, the end of indexing wages to
inflation brought down the rise in the cost of living to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, Craxi supported Palestinian aspirations for
a homeland, but he distinguished between moderate and extreme Arab
nations. He was eager, both for domestic and party reasons, to be
on good terms with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic conflict with Washington flared after the hijacking
of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in October 1985 and the killing of
an elderly passenger in a wheel chair, Leon Klinghofer. When the
U.S. Navy forced a plane carrying Arab terrorists to land in
Sicily, the United States wanted to take the men into custody. But
Craxi asserted Italian control over its territory, taking charge of
the group and then releasing them. The prime minister was forced to
resign but returned immediately to office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he backed U.S. plans for the Middle East, agreeing to send
Italian troops as part of an international force to Lebanon. He
alone of Europe's Socialist leaders fully supported the NATO
decision to station new medium-range nuclear-tipped missiles in
Europe to counter a Soviet buildup, despite street demonstrations
in Italy and dire warnings from the Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto Craxi _ his first name gave way to the diminutive,
Bettino, just after being entered in the baptismal registry _ was
born in Milan on Feb. 24, 1934, the son of a lawyer, also a
Socialist, who had migrated to Milan from his native Sicily in
search of work. Childhood memories included a house north of Milan
where the family retreated when Milan was the target of Allied
bombing in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 his father ran for Parliament on the Popular Front
ticket, which united Communists and Socialists, and young Bettino
hung posters on walls. But that was also the year of the Communist
coup in Czechoslovakia, in which the Socialists were also victims.
His father lost the election, and the experience left Craxi a
confirmed anti-Communist.
</P>
<P>
   At 18 he joined the Socialist Party and entered Milan University
law school. The most enduring aspect of his brief university career
was meeting his wife, Anna Mancini, daughter of a Socialist rail
worker. He is survived by his wife and their son, Vittorio, always
known as Bobo, and daughter, Stefania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Craxi's precipitous downfall began in 1992. The end of the Cold
War had put an end to the standoff in Italian domestic politics
between Communist and non-Communist parties. Moreover, the ever
more evident corruption _ and the higher taxes to pay for it _
produced a voter revolution in northern Italy, led by the
separatist Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the weakness of the political establishment,
magistrates in Milan began investigating, and Craxi and the
Socialists bore the brunt of Italians' revulsion at the scale of
the bribery that came to light, which is said to have run as high
as $2 billion to $3 billion over the decades when the entrenched
political and business elite ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance alone, involving a takeover battle between ENI
and the private Ferruzzi food and chemicals group, Craxi and his
party were accused of pocketing as much as $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1993 Craxi was forced to give up his seat as party
leader. His last public appearance in Italy came in December 1993,
when he testified as a witness in the Milan trial of a financier
accused of funneling some $94 million in bribes from Ferruzzi to
politicians, including Craxi.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, faced with a warrant for his arrest, he fled to the
eight-acre plot of olive groves, palms and bougainvillea that
surrounds his summer retreat outside Hammamet, Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Craxi, who was convicted on graft and corruption charges in five
separate trials and acquitted in one, was declared a fugitive from
justice by a Milan court in July 1995, and an international arrest
warrant was issued for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government said Wednesday that it would allow Craxi
to be buried in Italy. But his daughter rejected the offer, telling
the Italian news agency ANSA: ``My father will remain here in
Tunisia. This is his fatherland now.''

COMMENTARY: `THOU SHALT NOT STEAL!'
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the tumultuous 1912 Republican Convention,
former President Theodore Roosevelt denounced the denial of
credentials to his supporters by his successor, William Howard
Taft. Teddy labeled the Taft men ``stolen delegates'' and
thundered: ``Thou shalt not steal!''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Taft's son _ Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio _ tried
to block ``Texans for Eisenhower'' from contesting the seats of the
pro-Taft Texas delegation. An Ike supporter rose to ``refuse to
allow many thousands of decent Texas citizens to be completely
disenfranchised by slick, crafty political tricks and shabby
conniving.''
</P>
<P>
   At a signal from the Ike backer Tex McCrary, a chant from the
past filled the convention hall: ``Thou shalt not steal!'' The
aroused delegates overruled Taft's credentials committee, and
Eisenhower overwhelmed the choice of the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the possible rubber match between insurgents and Old
Guard. In year 2000, the center of crafty tricks and shabby
conniving in GOP primary politics is in the state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, with dreams of being George W. Bush's
running mate dancing in his head, hopes he has reduced the onerous
obstacles to ballot access just enough to pass federal court
muster. But Pataki's New York remains the most unfair place in the
nation for rank-and-file Republicans to contest boss rule.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Albany gang's barriers forced the insurgent
Steve Forbes to spend $1.8 million to get on the ballot. In a
gentlemen's agreement this year, Bush and Forbes planned not to
challenge each other's signatures. But when Pataki was directed by
Bush to attack John McCain's names, the New York governor felt he
had to try to knock off some of Forbes' signatures as well, lest he
seem inconsistent in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dead canary has been sent,'' responds a Forbes lawyer who
has been watching mob movies. He will file a ``candidate
aggrieved'' suit and charge fraud in Brooklyn districts. But what
worries Bush's Austin-Albany axis is growing coverage of its
blatant attempt to deny New York voters the right to choose
delegates to support John McCain. It's embarrassing to admit fear
of competition.
</P>
<P>
   New York's state chairman, William Powers, cannot have enjoyed
telling many county leaders that ``the word from Austin'' was to
play hardball. His press agents contend that everybody does it,
that McCain's Arizona is worse, but none of that chaff will fool
insecurity-sensitive New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's ``silk stocking'' district (where I once happily
flacked for the Lefkowitz-Fino-Gilhooley balanced but losing
ticket), I get reports that publicity about the Austin-directed
nitpicking and arm-twisting ``could tip the district to McCain.''
Even if their man loses in court and lost a few districts to the
Bush harassment, McCain volunteers expect to place him on the
ballot in a respectable percentage of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
   Assume McCain runs strongly where allowed to compete. Because
New York is not a winner-take-all state, that would mean a vigorous
minority would appear at the national convention. Who is to say
that these insurgents will acquiesce in the presence of delegates
unfairly chosen?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has probably not thought ahead to the summer convention.
Received wisdom is certain that all will be decided by the morning
of March 8, after the New York and California primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But what if? What if, for the first time in much too long,
America were to be treated to a contested convention? Then the
Pataki-picked delegates could be challenged in the RNC's contest
committee; when its chairman, the Bush partisan Mike Duncan,
brushes off the insurgents, the fight for fairness would move to
the televised credentials committee. When it refuses to budge, on
to the convention floor with the rallying cry _ ``Thou shalt not
steal!''
</P>
<P>
   Just dreaming. As Bush stonily replied Wednesday to McCain's
call for open competition, ``there's rules.'' Who gets infuriated
these days by organized unfairness? Who will, with Teddy R.,
``stand at Armageddon and battle for the Lord''?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Teddy lost. But Ike won.

 &HT;    Big business contributed hefty share of money to Bush, report
says
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's path to the White House
was paved by ``a small group of business tycoons'' who pitched in
with a large share of the $41 million Bush raised for the two
gubernatorial races that helped position him as the GOP
presidential front-runner, according to a report issued today by
Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often has touted his donor list as evidence of his
broad-based support in Texas, but the new report says big money
played a big part in Bush's big wins in 1994 and 1998. And the
donors want more than good government, according to Craig McDonald,
director of the Austin-based group that did the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these wealthy Bush donors have sought corporate
welfare, relaxed regulatory rules or other government favors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, spokesman for the Bush presidential campaign,
said the report is misguided, and Texans know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans know that Governor Bush has received broad-based
support from all walks of life in communities across this state for
his agenda of improving schools and cutting taxes,'' he said. ``And
nearly 70 percent of Texans voted to re-elect him because of his
proven record of doing what is right for all Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of high-dollar Bush backers includes, according to
McDonald, ``corporate welfare kings, snake oil salesmen, money
launderers, tax evaders, tort dodgers, tobacco hacks and toxic
waste dumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A small group of business tycoons were instrumental in putting
George Bush in the Governor's Mansion,'' McDonald said. ``A
disturbing number of these profiteers made a fortune off government
handouts or by bending or breaking regulatory rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Washington, D.C.-based Arca
Foundation and Piper Foundation, which issue grants to nonprofit
organizations that analyze the influence of private money on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that Bush and his donors availed themselves of
the state's no-limits campaign contribution system. A quarter of
the $41 million that flowed to Bush came from 207 donors who
contributed at least $25,000 each. Of the $28 million that could be
classified by economic or ideological interests, 96 percent came
from business interests.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred donors who gave a total of $3 million were
identified in the report as ``profiteers ... many of whom made
fortunes by taking corporate welfare from the government or who
appear to have an interest in taking the regulatory cops off the
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Atop the ``profiteers'' list are Dallas brothers Charles and Sam
Wyly, whose firm, Maverick Capital Fund, received a state contract
to invest University of Texas funds in 1998. The Wyly brothers gave
Bush $210,027 for the two gubernatorial campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the top 10 was Dallas oilman Ray L. Hunt, who
contributed $105,000. The report said Hunt was involved in secret
negotiations for a major Dallas development project a year before
the city council was briefed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Oberwetter, spokesman for Hunt's firm, said the
contributions to Bush had nothing to do with anything Hunt wants
from government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks (Bush) is a good, sound conservative governor.
That's it,'' said Oberwetter.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Texans for Public Justice also says Bush got $4
million from ``tort tycoons'' who backed Bush's successful push for
an overhaul of the civil justice system. Lawmakers approved limits
on damage awards as part of the package. Bush says it was an effort
to protect businesses from frivolous lawsuits and unreasonable
damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including the Texans for Public Justice, say the laws
have stripped consumers of needed protection against businesses
that offer hazardous products.

COMMENTARY: IT'S A RED FLAG
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the flag right now, through my office window,''
said Arthur Ravenel, a state senator in South Carolina who believes
the Confederate battle flag should continue to fly over the
Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to him on the phone. ``You can see it?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes. Just about all of us can see it on the west side,
where the Senate offices are. Half of us can look right at it.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what it felt like to get all pumped up, to swell with
pride over a flag that so openly symbolized the absolute
subjugation of a race of people, a flag flown for more than a
century in the furious defense of slavery and segregation and
lynching and the like. Germans who continue to revere the swastika
and look back fondly on the era that gave us the Holocaust come to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel does not consider himself a racist and made sure to tell
me he shares an office with ``a very fine black senator.'' But he
recently referred to the NAACP, which is leading a campaign to have
the flag removed from the Statehouse, as ``the National Association
of Retarded People.'' And when the slur resulted in an uproar, he
apologized _ not to the NAACP, but to ``retarded people'' for
mistakenly associating them with the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel said the slur was a slip of the tongue but told me there
was no chance he would apologize to the NAACP. ``So far as I'm
concerned, they are the enemy,'' he said. ``They have instituted an
economic boycott of the state and that's a war of sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned that the fight over the flag had become a national
controversy and had put the leading Republican presidential
candidate, George W. Bush _ who has said the GOP should be more
inclusive _ in something of a tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his problem,'' said Ravenel.
</P>
<P>
   It sure is. Bush has been asked repeatedly if he believes
Ravenel should apologize to the NAACP. As the Texas governor is
running for president of the entire United States, not just the
right wing of the Republican Party, and not just white Americans,
it would behoove him to understand that Ravenel's remark was not
just a crack against the NAACP but a grinding insult to all black
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who faces an important primary election in South Carolina
next month, said at first that the remark was ``unfortunate,'' but
that it would be up to Ravenel to decide whether he should
apologize. Then, pressed by Alan Keyes during a presidential
debate, Bush agreed that the remarks were ``out of line and we
should repudiate them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, peculiarly, the question about whether Ravenel should
apologize remained in the air. Bush has been unwilling, for some
reason, to say point blank that an apology is called for. As late
as Wednesday a spokesman for Bush would say only, ``I think the
governor made a strong statement,'' which was a reference to his
exchange with Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has also been unwilling to take a clear stand
on the flag issue, which is first and foremost a race issue. The
Confederate flag is an affront to all black people, a symbol of
white supremacy and a comfort to bigots everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for whom the South Carolina primary is critical, said at
first that he found the Confederate flag ``offensive'' and a
``symbol of racism and slavery,'' then flipped and said it was ``a
symbol of heritage,'' then seemed to flip again in an interview
with The Times, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Bush or McCain or anybody else is serious about
a more inclusive GOP, but here's something I'm absolutely sure of.
The Republican Party will never recruit large numbers of black
voters as long as its top leaders are reluctant to blow the whistle
on the wackos and the yahoos who are still traveling beneath the
Confederate banner.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50,000 Americans showed up in Columbia on Monday to
protest the flying of the Confederate flag over the state capitol.
They marched to show that most of America has moved beyond the era
and the sordid principles symbolized by that execrable flag. Bush
and McCain may have some catching up to do.

FORMER ``QUEENS FOR A DAY'' REUNITE IN L.A.

   &LR; ``Would you (pause) like to be Queen (heavy accent on the `qu',
draw out the `een') For A Day?'' _ the late TV show emcee Jack
Bailey asking the question every woman in America wanted to hear in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For one day back when they were young, they were
the luckiest women in the country _ living the ultimate dream of a
whole generation of Alice Kramdens just getting by.
</P>
<P>
   For one happy day, when radio ruled and TV was just taking its
first baby steps, the women meeting in Billingsley's Restaurant in
Van Nuys Wednesday morning, were all winners on ``Queen For A
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, television's all grown up and turning out instant
millionaires, not queens anymore, but this whole game show, dream
business started with these women.
</P>
<P>
   They were plucked from a radio, and later TV, audience from 1945
to 1964, and put up on a throne for 13 million daily viewers to see
and envy.
</P>
<P>
   Queens Emma Sundelius and Rose Krause. Queens Lucille Helwig and
Teri Weiner. Queens Millie Brown and Leahnora Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Queen For A Day Club, which is celebrating its
54th year soon, and still meeting monthly to plan events that raise
Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only show that's formed a club like this,'' says
Queen Leahnora. ``Do you think the TV millionaires today will be
getting together like this 50 years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful, the queens agree.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Millie Brown queen number one. She was a young
wife with a one-year-old baby and a husband fighting a war ove
neighbor stopped by one morning with some tickets to a radio show
called ``Name That Tune'' being broadcast from the Moulin Rouge on
Sunset Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a babysitter and let's go,'' her neighbor said. Millie
called her mother. It was April 1, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up winning $30 for naming and singing the first line
of the tune `Stardust,' Millie said Wednesday, as the other queens
deferred to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the show was over we had to move to a smaller hall
because they needed this one for a new program they were starting
called `Queen For A Day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Millie and her neigbor wound up staying for that show, too, and
Millie was one of four women chosen to come up on stage and tell
the audience what she would like to do if she was named Queen For A
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would pack up my baby, and take the first plane to
Italy so she could meet her daddy,'' Millie said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience went wild. Before she knew it, Millie had a velvet
cape around her shoulders, a crown on her head, and was carrying a
bouquet of roses to a nearby throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the whole thing was an April Fool's Day joke,'' she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   After the show was over, Millie got the bad news. She was told
it would be impossible to fly her to Italy because there was a war
going on. How about dinner in a nice restaurant for her and some
friends, she ``I took a rain check,'' Millie laughed. ``I finally
wound up with a new watch for my husband when he got back from
overseas. We never did get that second honeymoon trip to Italy we
were promised after the war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what the TV history books would have us believe, not
all the queens were chosen because of sad stories of woe they
related to the audience, the women say.
</P>
<P>
   Tears and pathos was certainly part of the show, but so were
laughs and good times, say Queens Lucille Helwig (October 1946),
and Teri Weiner (July 1948), both residents of the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille was chosen queen by the audience after she said she
wanted to sing with a Big Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, I was driven by limo to the Santa Monica Pier
where I sang one song from the bandstand with the Lawrence Welk
Band,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teri was chosen by the applause-meter after telling the audience
she wished for some double-seater pants for her husband, Sammy a
cab driver who was always wearing out the seat of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a pair of double-seater pants that lasted Sammy five
years, and a living room of furniture, some pots, pans, electrical
appliances and perfumes I gave to my mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Krause was chosen queen in October 1958 after she told a TV
audience her two little girls, 7 and 5, wanted a piano for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that won it for me was when the girls said
if I got the piano on the show, Santa Claus wouldn't have to carry
it down the chimney Christmas eve,'' Rose said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no laughs, though, when Emma Sundelius and Leahnora
Martin told the audience why they wanted to be Queen For A Day.
</P>
<P>
   Leahnora's son had bad asthma, and she wanted a special
breathing apparatus for him. Emma's teenage daughter had polio. She
wanted special controls so her daughter could drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth a million dollars to me, being chosen queen,''
Emma said Wednesday. ``You should have seen the smile on my
daughter's face, driving that car.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only one day, but the memories have lasted a lifetime,
the queens agree.
</P>
<P>
   The day they were chosen what every woman in America wanted to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Queen For A Day.

TV CRITICS' TOUR OFFERS REMINDER THAT `RISK-TAKING TV' IS
OXYMORON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Last week's flap over the relationship
between TV networks and the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy raises an interesting question. If Washington, D.C.,
still attracts the best and the brightest _ outside of TV news, of
course _ maybe it's not a bad idea to have some whip-smart interns
inside the Beltway writing fresh, original TV scripts on their
lunch hours.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Sure, the ``just say no'' message might get a
tad dreary if it were to show up every night like the phony
suspense on a prime-time game show. But consider the alternatives:
another season of ``Suddenly Susan'' trying to find its way,
another UPN schedule unfriendly toward Mensa, another series on The
WB with a bias against actors who have to shave regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Seems to me a few outsiders offering ideas from 3,000 miles away
could be a plus. After all, risk-taking isn't a habitual thing at
networks. It's an accidental thing. ABC, looking for something
different to fill a few weeks in midsummer last year, took a flier
on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' and came out looking like a
million. Fox, trying to counterprogram against NBC on Thursday
nights last fall, took action with ``Action,'' a clever spoof of
the movie industry, and came out smelling like low tide. Why?
Because UPN went after the same viewer with a slightly sanitized
version of World Wrestling Federation mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Risk vs. ripoff. That is the question. And the answer, as on all
the game shows these days, is multiple choice. At least that is the
upshot of two weeks of midseason meetings with network executives
in Southern California. NBC says it has too many comedies. The WB
wants to add them. Fox pledges to cut back on the reality specials.
UPN embraces them. ABC is happy to ride the millionaire train into
the ground. CBS hopes it derails real soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get it right, it's cultural-phenomenon time,'' says
Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group.
``When we get it wrong, it's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow was talking about his own network's dismal fall showing.
But he could have been speaking on behalf of all networks. No one
really knows what will stick to the roof of our minds and what will
trigger the gag reflex. Even David Chase, creator of ``The
Sopranos,'' says he didn't think anyone would watch what some
critics and viewers believe is the greatest cultural advancement
since cheese in a can. Fox apparently thought the same thing: It
had a chance to pick up the series and passed.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who's to say ``The Sopranos'' would have succeeded
on Fox? At HBO, there are no commercial breaks to interrupt the
flow, so each ``Sopranos'' episode plays like a mini-movie, with
natural ebbs and flows in the storytelling. On commercial networks,
an hour-long show with four acts must artificially build to a
climax every 11 minutes so the viewer will be persuaded to come
back after the commercials. ``The Sopranos'' would be very
different show on network TV, and maybe Chase's worst fears would
be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Fox may have the next phenomenon if ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' keeps pulling down big Nielsen numbers. The comedy about a
reluctant boy genius is performing better than any new stuff the
network had on its fall schedule, which leads one to wonder why it
wasn't on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's answer is that midseason shows should not be viewed as
backups that can't crack the A list. ```Malcolm in the Middle' is
not second class to anything,'' vows Doug Herzog, president of
entertainment at Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Which explains why the network programming trotted
out over the past two weeks in Pasadena had all the appeal of a
damp shoe. CBS hoped to generate some buzz with Steven Bochco's
``City of Angels,'' a hospital drama showcasing actors of color. To
its credit, the series also features writers of color and producers
of color _ and it was conceived long before the NAACP complained
about the whiteness of network programming. But, at best, ``City of
Angels'' is a work in progress that needs better writing and more
compelling stories.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, because of the complaints from the NAACP and other
minority groups, ``City of Angels'' won't feel like a minority for
long. With their feet to the fire, all of the networks are pledging
to do better in colorblind casting. NBC West Coast president Scott
Sassa, who is of Asian descent, is pledging to add up to five
writer/producer positions a year to give minority characters the
proper support.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have as many minorities as actors,'' Sassa said, ``but
you have to have the words on the page to make it work. Television
is a writer's medium ... and we felt that attacking it at the
writer level was the most important way to make a real change over
time rather than just a cosmetic change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, ``real change'' is likely to be slow change as long as
the networks continue to follow the tradition of loading up on fall
programming at the behest of the advertising community, and dumping
weaker shows onto the midseason and summer schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year,'' Grushow said, ``seemingly every network
announces that this is the year they're going to stay open for
business over the summer. And that usually precedes an announcement
in which they name all of the shows they didn't believe in strongly
enough to run during the course of the broadcast season.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve McPherson, executive vice president of Touchstone
Television, producer of such shows as ``Felicity,'' ``Once &AMP;
Again'' and ``Popular,'' is one of many production people who blame
the existing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seasonal pilot process is really flawed process,''
McPherson said, ``and the mad rush that we're about to head into
for casting, for directors, for every aspect of it, is a really
difficult one and probably not the most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros. Television (``ER,''
``Friends,'' ``The West Wing'') hates it even more. Having also
worked on the network side as president of Fox Entertainment, he
sees the existing production system as ``ineffective and
outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely a formula to not do our best work,'' Roth
said. ``It's something that we've talked about for many, many
years. While at Fox, I talked about it constantly. ... We have to
redesign the system. We must develop a more year-round basis. We
can't enter into the kind of feeding frenzy that we're all about to
enter into for actors, for directors, for facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet they will, because changing the system is risky. And if
it's risk-taking you want, you might as well check out cable.

UNIVERSITY, MEXICO'S PRIDE, IS RAVAGED BY STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ One of the first things the administrators of the
national university here will have to do, if they ever get it back
from student strikers who have occupied it for nine months, is to
fumigate. Rats and bugs, even the odd scorpion, have run free on
the leafy campus as it sat largely empty.
</P>
<P>
   The battered look of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico, with its walls tattooed in insurrectionist graffiti and its
courtyards converted to tent camps for strikers, are only the most
visible signs of deterioration during the months of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a proud symbol of publicly financed education for the
masses, this immense university _ with 275,000 students the largest
in Latin America _ has suffered losses in students, research,
finances and especially academic stature that it will probably
never recoup.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began last April as a limited student protest seeking
to preserve free tuition and open admissions. But it soon exploded
out of the control of the administrators, President Ernesto Zedillo
and even the broad-based student organization that initiated it,
crippling the school.
</P>
<P>
   It has dragged on because of a tough, anarchic leftist movement
that took control of the student revolt, akin to the radicalism
that clashed with police last month at the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle. Its larger sworn enemy is the globally
intertwined economy and the competitive, free market policies that
are changing Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers' demand for a free higher education for the working
class was not extreme. But the strikes ran head long into a new
world and a new Mexico, where shrinking public spending can no long
promote social mobility through a huge and generous institution
like the national university.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the administration and the strikers are headed for a
showdown. Dueling referendums will allow each side to gauge its
support. A 48-hour vote organized by the students on their platform
ended Wednesday. A separate ``plebiscite'' to vote on a
counterproposal by university President Juan Ramon de la Fuente
takes place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the UNAM, as it is known by its Spanish acronym,
began when students rejected a plan by its former president,
Francisco Barnes de Castro, to raise tuition to about $75 a
semester from a mere 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers also demanded reinstatement of open admissions for
all students from a number of public high schools, canceled in
1995, and to hold a general congress of faculty, students and
workers to reorganize the university from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the strikers won battle after battle, and always
came back asking for more. In June Barnes scrapped his tuition
plan. In November he resigned in defeat. But the strikers pressed
on.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, de la Fuente, the former health minister who replaced
Barnes, offered a plan to suspend all tuition payments
indefinitely, cancel most criminal charges against protesters and
open the general congress. Although de la Fuente had ceded
practically every point, the strikers rejected his offer on the
grounds that it came from the administration, not from them.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who once ran from government troops when he was a
student protester during the uprising of 1968, considered sending
police to round up student leaders at several points, senior
officials said. So far he has favored negotiations, fearing that
any bloodshed would reawaken the trauma that still lingers from the
government's brutal suppression of the students 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to its treasurer, Jose Manuel Covarrubias, the strike
so far has cost the university about $205 million, mainly in
salaries paid to 30,000 teachers and 28,000 workers when no classes
were under way on campus.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all the scientific research in Mexico is done at
the UNAM, and with strikers camped out in the science department
and many laboratories, it has been greatly impaired. Libraries and
archives are barricaded shut. In the huge central campus vandalism
and looting, probably by outsiders, has taken a toll the
authorities will be able to calculate only after the strike ends.
</P>
<P>
   UNAM students have fled by the thousands to other universities,
mostly outside Mexico City. However, while at least 20,000 UNAM
students supported the strike, more than 228,000 registered for
classes last fall. Professors set up shop in rented nooks, on
athletic fields, even in their cars to give their courses.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning the strike had broad student support. But as
time wore on one faction, dubbed ultras by their fellow students,
rose to dominate the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon verbal battles in the students' steering committee
often raged for 24 hours and beyond. Once the ultras gained the
upper hand they purged their opponents, sometimes in fistfights. At
the height of the confrontation protest leaders circled barbed wire
around the dais where they presided to block dissenting students
from storming the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Humberto Abreu Cruz, a 27-year-old political science
student, was squarely behind the strike at first. His family's only
income comes from sales of pies baked by his mother. The fee the
administration wanted to impose was going to drive him out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   But after Barnes, the former president, withdrew his tuition
plan, Abreu thought the strike should end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the ultras' position came down to was that if the
president says yes, we say no,'' Abreu said. ``They wouldn't let me
talk in meetings. They said my word was worthless. They banned
me.''

<P>
   The strikers displayed the trappings of revolutionary Marxism,
adorning their meetings with posters of Che Guevara, Stalin and
Presidente Gonzalo, the imprisoned leader of the extremist Sendero
Luminoso guerrillas in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice they know little about these men or their ideas.
They are driven instead by the feeling of betrayal by the Mexican
government, which has withdrawn its unconditional promise to
educate them. They have a foreboding about their future in a tight
and competitive economy where their first career step could well be
unemployment. The vast university is their safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``This university gave me everything I am, my knowledge, my
friends, my girlfriends,'' said Hugo, 20, a student on strike duty
by the dry fountain in the center of the science complex. He
withheld his last name saying he feared that police might come
after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never asked me any questions about who I was,'' he said.
``That's why we can't end the strike without winning all of our
demands. The future of people like me in this university depends on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement was hard to bargain with because it was a
many-headed body with arms in every one of more than 30
departments, schools and research institutes. When the new
president, de la Fuente, agreed to talk with the strikers, they
insisted on sending 120 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership is horizontal. Our movement is a chaos of
ideas,'' said Victor Barboza, 25, a music student. ``We are looking
for an anarchic utopia far away from any political theory. We want
to practice pure democracy without any theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement fought even with those who initially supported it.
Strikers had violent clashes with the press and fell out with the
left-of-center city government.
</P>
<P>
   One group of strikers assaulted a professor who attempted to
hold an open-air class outside the campus. A demonstration in front
of the U.S. Embassy on Dec. 11 turned into a stone-throwing melee
in which 98 strikers were arrested for property destruction. On
Jan. 2 two students who were apparently trying to make small bombs
were seriously injured when the explosives accidentally ignited.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent meeting of the student strike council where the
students rejected de la Fuente's proposal, they seemed not to have
noticed that its terms meant they had won. Called for noon in a dim
and chilly auditorium, the session finally got under way after dark
and ended after dawn. The camaraderie was strong, but one speaker
after another denounced the president's offer as a plot to lull the
strikers and prepare for police to storm the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The strike left many taxpayers disenchanted with the university,
compounding de la Fuente's difficulties in retaining government
support for the old university model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The society is doubting the university,'' de la Fuente said in
an interview. ``When the strike ends, we will have to prove to the
public that it has not exhausted its usefulness.''

EMOTIONAL BRADLEY PRESSES PROPOSALS TO REFORM HEALTH CARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ Democrat Bill Bradley, the most private of the
presidential candidates in both major parties, wept in public
Wednesday, but not directly about the mounting impression that he
is losing ground to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign visit to a day-care center, Bradley's eyes clouded
with tears after a teacher and a working mother who support his
candidacy described to reporters their experiences with children
who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It led the low-key Bradley to deliver, with out-of-character
intensity, a speech about his push to expand health care with some
of the government's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Perry of nearby Pelham said one of her four sons
apologized to her for contracting a throat infection because his
uninsured care strained the family budget. She said the Clinton
administration _ which includes Gore, of course _ broke its
promises to boost health insurance for the young.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks were a set-up for Bradley to press his health care
reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, shaking his head as he approached the microphone,
was speechless for a few seconds as eyes moistened and his face
reddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's important when reality enters a political
campaign, and I think we heard that reality today,'' Bradley said
as he composed himself. ``No child should have to apologize because
he is sick.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time of ``unprecedented prosperity,'' not only can the
nation give subsidies and tax breaks to families needing health
insurance, it cannot afford not to, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want small things, nibbling around the edge ... then
I'm not your guy. If you want to do big and bold things that will
solve these problems for everybody, then I am your guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited a day-care center in Lebanon, N.H., and picked
up the endorsement of Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, a doctor, said he chose Gore after examining Gore's and
Bradley's health-care proposals and concluded Gore's incremental
approach of providing health insurance for children first was the
most workable and the most responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stop trying to hit the home run and you just do this, kid
by kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would offer to all Americans who want it the same
health-insurance coverage offered to federal employees; would make
health-care premiums tax-deductible and would guarantee health
insurance for all children, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan is aimed at providing health insurance for all
children by 2005, and then expanding coverage to adults. He also
wants to provide a prescription drug benefit with no deductible
under Medicare and allow 55- to 65-year-olds to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as big and not as sexy as Bradley's plan,'' Dean
said, ``but it works, and when it's done, kids end up with
health-care insurance instead of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was endorsed Wednesday by Oregon Gov. John
Kitzhaber, has said Gore is too willing to settle for compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not prepared to settle for 44 million Americans without
any health insurance,'' the impassioned Bradley said. ``I am not
prepared to settle for 14 million people living in poverty. I am
not prepared to settle for money destroying the democratic process.
I am not prepared for 13 kids being killed by guns every day in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief and enlivened presentation of the ground on which
Bradley stands against Gore. He has gone further than the vice
president in calling for campaign finance reform and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is well known for empathizing with, and showing emotion
to, citizens in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But for the brainy and sometimes remote Bradley, Wednesday's
episode was virtually unprecedented in his months of campaigning.
He said that for Perry, who helps her husband refurbish household
appliances, and for other families earning less than $50,000 a
year, his plan would provide health-care subsidies and exempt their
insurance payments from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, which conducts its primary Feb. 1, tears from
a Democratic presidential candidate once provided a pivotal moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edmund Muskie's political fortunes sank in the 1972 contest
after he apparently wept during a news conference called to
denounce a New Hampshire newspaper for its reports about him and
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, several years before the emotive Clinton and social
changes in the nation, crying was a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley's tears were not in reaction to his political
standing, he acknowledged a few minutes later that the notion of
Gore gaining strength, even before the first primary vote has been
cast, is ``the spin that is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times article Wednesday portrayed Gore as on the
upswing, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he rejects the idea that he is losing momentum. The
Iowa caucuses Monday and the New Hampshire primary eight days later
are just ``the opening act of this campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His organization has the money to continue through March when
the voting moves to more populous states such as New York,
California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore said: ``Senator Bradley may be looking ahead
to future contests. I'm just looking at Iowa and New Hampshire. The
majority of polls show me behind in New Hampshire. This is a real
hard-fought contest. New Hampshire is the far point on my political
horizon right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest Gore leads Bradley in Iowa and that Bradley's lead
in New Hampshire may have dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore both said the contest will be decided not only
on the issues but also on voters' decisions after meeting the
candidates in the close-up politicking style characteristic of Iowa
and New Hampshire campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to residents of a Salem nursing home, Bradley wove into
his health-care talk an unprompted defense of the way he has
conducted his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After saying that nothing is impossible to accomplish in the
United States, Bradley saw fit to add, ``I believe everything I
just told you.'' He also said that sleeping in different hotels and
motels has become bothersome, but that the discomfort becomes worth
it when he hears people's life stories.
</P>
<P>
   And in another unusual inward glance, he said that one of the
keys to campaigning for president ``is to have balance between a
sense of modesty, since it is the most powerful office in the world
and you are only one person, and a sense of confidence that you
could lead the world at this time of continued danger. And being
able to have that balance between modesty and confidence is to me
one of the important things for someone who is running for
president of the United States. I have tried to strike that over
the last year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a drizzly night late last week, more than a dozen
volunteers for Al Gore, nibbling on chicken wings, olives and
pizza, gathered at their headquarters at the Seattle Labor Temple
for a routine they have followed for weeks: telephoning faithful
Democrats to encourage them to vote for the vice president in the
Washington state caucus on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh hello _ is this the Eatons?'' asked Sara Kaplan, 76, who
has helped out in campaigns since 1946. ``I'm just calling to push
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted only a
couple of weeks to making telephone calls to identify its
supporters. His fledgling operation does not even have an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I alternate between jubilation and despair as I try to put
this thing together,'' said Matt Berman, the volunteer who runs the
Bradley campaign in Washington state. ``I wish I had another six
months _ and I wish I didn't have a family to support so I could do
this full time.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences in the Gore and Bradley operations here
underscore the degree to which the candidates are prepared to march
to the nomination should they triumph in the first showdowns in
Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New Hampshire a week later.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic strategists say they have never seen a
challenger with as much organizational and financial muscle as
Bradley, they argue that Gore is still better primed to go the
distance. Because he has traveled the country for more than seven
years as vice president, Gore has enjoyed a head-start building an
organization with help from scores of elected officials the labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are stacked with the vice president in the long
haul,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, who ran for the
Democratic nomination in 1988 and is not backing anyone this year.
``But I think you'll find Bradley will be more organized than
people will think.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's edge, Bradley is in a far better position than
his Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is
nowhere close to matching the resources of his chief opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. And unlike Bradley, who has succeeded in
the often cumbersome and costly challenge of getting his name on
ballots in key primary states, McCain has had far less success. And
he is now fighting New York state Republican leaders over whether
he'll be on the ballot in many districts in the state's March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete with Bush around the nation, McCain is
concentrating on New Hampshire and South Carolina, which holds its
contest on Feb. 19, in the longshot hope that he will catch fire
and win the nomination on sheer momentum and free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with Bradley's preparations, if he and McCain
triumph in New Hampshire they would face enormous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, literally, has all his eggs in the New Hampshire
basket,'' Biden said. The senator said he would be more worried for
Gore if Bradley, beyond matching him in organization, had McCain's
charisma. Conversely, he said, if McCain had Bradley's resources,
``This is a guy who could just catch fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, who won a surprise upset in New Hampshire against
Walter F. Mondale in 1984 but lost the nomination, said in an
interview that Bradley had surmounted many of the hurdles that had
doomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would have envied is the clean shot, the two-man
race,'' said Hart, who emerged from as the alternative to Mondale
only after New Hampshire. ``I just didn't have the money, or the
ability to organize in more than two or three states. Bradley
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he questioned whether Bradley could win the nomination.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that Gore appears to have the
support of a majority of the so-called superdelegates, members of
Congress, party officials and others who will automatically be sent
to the Democratic convention _ and who account for about 20 percent
of all delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Bradley wins New Hampshire and comes on strong, those
superdelegates could defect to him,'' said Hart, who has not
endorsed either candidate. ``But history shows that is not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. DeGraff, who runs the delegate drive for the Bradley
campaign, insisted that Gore's advantages can be overcome. ``This
is the most prepared insurgent campaign in the history of the
Democratic Party,'' he said. ``You cannot wait until victory in New
Hampshire and then get delegate slates together in New York or Ohio
or Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a delegate expert on the Gore campaign, conceded
that Bradley ``has parity in terms of resources and that has
positioned him better than other insurgencies in the past.'' But,
he said, ``He doesn't have an advantage because we have a lot more
people helping us than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush benefits from the overwhelming support of
elected officials in his party who have put their supporters to
work for him. Another advantage for the governor is that the
Republican establishment does not particularly like McCain, who has
made his independence a signature theme.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davenport, who ran the delegate operation for Bob Dole's
campaign in 1996, said even if McCain won New Hampshire, ``it would
be a near miracle'' if he could translate that into winning the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John blows him out in New Hampshire, it would be a great
shot in the arm,'' said Davenport, who is not backing either
candidate. ``But it still comes down to if you don't have the
organization to get your vote out and the money to get your message
out, it's very difficult to buck the momentum of a front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington state, organizations for Gore and Bradley are
taking shape, although the Gore operation _ buoyed by support from
most of the state's elected leaders and labor _ clearly has more of
a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 39 counties, we have organizers in 36,'' said Sandeep
Baweja, a 29-year-old lawyer who runs the Gore campaign in the
state. ``Let's say things don't go according to plan in New
Hampshire or Iowa. We have to do our share as part of the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Seattle Labor Temple in Seattle is repeated
night after night: The Gore campaign's goal is to compile a tally
of supporters and do whatever they can to prod them to caucus on
March 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following a script written by the campaign, the volunteers asked
respondents who identified themselves as Gore supporters or
undecided for their e-mail addresses so they could get on the
campaign mailing list. But if they said they favored Bill Bradley,
the scripted response was terse: ``Thank you for your time.'' The
volunteers were also instructed in the script to ``avoid mentioning
caucus date'' to Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of one evening last week, the campaign had compiled a
fresh list of the number of Gore backers, Bradley backers and
undecided. But the campaign may not have done especially well that
night. Baweja said he was instructed by headquarters in Nashville
not to release the tally ``for strategic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Baweja, the only paid Gore official in the state, draws a salary
of $30,000. The Bradley campaign's only paid staff member here is a
22-year-old, fresh out of college, who gets $500 a month to help
with administrative chores.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters here insist they are not daunted and view
Washington state as a critical western beachhead. Bradley has
courted the high- tech community and independent voters here, and
his advisers noted that this state has a history of rewarding
mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen them turn around volunteers the way we have,''
Berman said of the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, Bradley supporters could point to more
organizational strength. On the same night that Gore volunteers
were working the phone banks in Seattle, 70 Bradley volunteers
gathered nearly 3,000 miles away at the Engineer's Club in
Baltimore to assign tasks such as outreach to college students and
women in the run-up to the Maryland primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Curran, a City Council member who worked on the Hart
campaign in 1984, said Bradley was far more prepared. ``Hart seemed
a bit more helter skelter,'' he said. ``This is more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appeared that Bradley was still behind in organizing
in this state. Unlike Gore, he does not have the endorsements of
Maryland's top elected Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the meeting, someone asked Jamie Kendrick,
co-campaign coordinator in Baltimore, for the location of the
Bradley headquarters in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign headquarters is here,'' he declared, hoisting his
cell phone in the air. ``The campaign headquarters are all of you.
There is no headquarters. We are the volunteer army.''

THE NEXT `LAST OF THE MOHICANS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why on Earth would director Michael Mann go back and re-edit a
7-year-old movie when he was still trying to get his highly
acclaimed new film, ``The Insider,'' into theaters?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in that an artist is never satisfied with his
work _ and the digital technology makes changes possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mann says he was wrapping up the ``Insider'' when he was asked
if he was interested in doing a commentary for the DVD of his 1992
film ``Last of the Mohicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't want to do a commentary, but what I
really wanted to do was re-edit the film, 'cause ... the wonderful
thing about the digital world is that we can go back and revisit
these things. In theory ... we're supposed to be getting smarter as
we get older, and there were things I regretted about the way the
film was released theatrically.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems Mann sought to correct was that he cut too
much out of the film, which made some of the storylines and
characters too one- dimensional. Some of this stuff ``bothered me
for years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Mann says that unlike other directors who complain
about studio interference, all the decisions were his. ``I was just
trying to make the film too tight,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1936 movie version of James Fenimore Cooper's
classic about the American wilderness of 1757, ``Last of the
Mohicans'' starred Daniel Day-Lewis as frontiersman
Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe, who had been adopted by his Mohican father,
Chingachgook (played by American Indian activist Russell Means).
Set against the backdrop of the French and Indian War, the film is
a lush, romantic tale that also serves as a eulogy to the American
Indians who saw their world being overtaken by the white man.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Mann put back into the film was a monologue by
Chingachgook at the end that serves as ``a political analysis of
the demise of the Indian world.'' Mann also added some scenes
involving Duncan, the priggish British major (Steve Waddington) who
vies with Hawkeye for the love of Cora (Madeleine Stowe). Mann felt
that he had cut out the scenes that showed Duncan's humanity, and
because of that, viewers don't understand his sacrifice at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm a little wiser now about storytelling than
I was then,'' says Mann.
</P>
<P>
   But Mann didn't just add; he made trims as well, and therefore
the film is only four minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the changes work, you feel that the film will feel more
expansive,'' says Mann, who _ because of digital technology _ has
already re-edited ``The Insider'' for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that `Heat' (his 1995 film) got so brutalized being cut
down for television that I took my name off it. To make sure it
didn't happen here, I stretched the theatrical version so it would
go on for two nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is based on a true story and stars Al Pacino as
CBS newsman Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe as a tobacco-industry
whistleblower. The film is a likely Oscar nominee, has already won
the L.A. Film Critics award for best picture and has picked up five
Golden Globe nominations,
</P>
<P>
   Mann says the scenes he added back for television were
``wonderful'' but wouldn't have worked in the current release
because they would have slowed down the film.
</P>
<P>
   But these scenes, some of which tie up loose ends or are too
emotional, would work on television because ``TV gets cut up into
these five-, six-scene quarter hours, and since you have the
commercial breaks, you can have more content when it's segmented
like that instead of in a continuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann says that he's included all the scenes on the future DVD,
but they won't be integrated into the film as a new version.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he says that now. But given a director's prerogative
and new technology, that could change in a few years. &QL;

   Members of the Queen For A Day Club, which is celebrating its
54th year soon, and still meeting monthly to plan events that raise
funds for Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only show that's formed a club like this,'' says
Queen Leahnora. ``Do you think the TV millionaires today will be
getting together like this 50 years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful, the queens agree.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Millie Brown _ queen number one. She was a
young wife with a one-year-old baby and a husband fighting a war
oversees when her neighbor stopped by one morning with some tickets
to a radio show called ``Name That Tune'' being broadcast from the
Moulin Rouge on Sunset Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a babysitter and let's go,'' her neighbor said. Millie
called her mother. It was April 1, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up winning $30 for naming and singing the first line
of the tune `Stardust,' Millie said Wednesday, as the other queens
deferred to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the show was over we had to move to a smaller hall
because they needed this one for a new program they were starting
called `Queen For A Day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Millie and her neigbor wound up staying for that show, too, and
Millie was one of four women chosen to come up on stage and tell
the audience what she would like to do if she was named Queen For A
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would pack up my baby, and take the first plane to
Italy so she could meet her daddy,'' Millie said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience went wild. Before she knew it, Millie had a velvet
cape around her shoulders, a crown on her head, and was carrying a
bouquet of roses to a nearby throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the whole thing was an April Fool's Day joke,'' she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   After the show was over, Millie got the bad news. She was told
it would be impossible to fly her to Italy because there was a war
going on. How about dinner in a nice restaurant for her and some
friends, she ``I took a rain check,'' Millie laughed. ``I finally
wound up with a new watch for my husband when he got back from
overseas. We never did get that second honeymoon trip to Italy we
were promised after the war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what the TV history books would have us believe, not
all the queens were chosen because of sad stories of woe they
related to the audience, the women say.
</P>
<P>
   Tears and pathos was certainly part of the show, but so were
laughs and good times, say Queens Lucille Helwig (October 1946),
and Teri Weiner (July 1948), both residents of the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille was chosen queen by the audience after she said she
wanted to sing with a Big Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, I was driven by limo to the Santa Monica Pier
where I sang one song from the bandstand with the Lawrence Welk
Band,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teri was chosen by the applause-meter after telling the audience
she wished for some double-seater pants for her husband, Sammy a
cab driver who was always wearing out the seat of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a pair of double-seater pants that lasted Sammy five
years, and a living room of furniture, some pots, pans, electrical
appliances and perfumes I gave to my mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Krause was chosen queen in October 1958 after she told a TV
audience her two little girls, 7 and 5, wanted a piano for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that won it for me was when the girls said
if I got the piano on the show, Santa Claus wouldn't have to carry
it down the chimney Christmas eve,'' Rose said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no laughs, though, when Emma Sundelius and Leahnora
Martin told the audience why they wanted to be Queen For A Day.
</P>
<P>
   Leahnora's son had bad asthma, and she wanted a special
breathing apparatus for him. Emma's teenage daughter had polio. She
wanted special controls so her daughter could drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth a million dollars to me, being chosen queen,''
Emma said Wednesday. ``You should have seen the smile on my
daughter's face, driving that car.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only one day, but the memories have lasted a lifetime,
the queens agree.
</P>
<P>
   The day they were chosen what every woman in America wanted to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Queen For A Day.

IT ALL BEGINS WITH A MAGIC RAT ...

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The French bourgeoisie gets it in the neck _ yet again _ in the
bizarre satire ``Sitcom.'' It's a punky little piece that
writer-director Francois Ozon apparently feels offers new insights
into this much-explored territory by upping the kinky sex and
introductory psychology quotients.
</P>
<P>
   The film is humorous in a bratty kind of way. What's not fun,
after all, about misbehaving to the extreme and being able to blame
it all on daddy and a supernatural rat? Beats maturity, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The father in this one (Francois Marthouret) is detached going
on wicked, but his main sins involve hiding behind something to
read and spouting reasoned platitudes in response to every step his
family takes toward chaos. Oh yeah, and he's the one who brings the
cute little white vermin home from the pet shop, the one that turns
everyone who touches it into a sexual adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   Upon contact with the rodent, studious son Nicholas (Adrien de
Van) announces that he's gay. His sister Sophie, played by de Van's
real-life sibling Marina, jumps out a window and becomes a
death-obsessed, paraplegic dominatrix. Mom (Evelyne Dandry, in the
film's best-rounded and funniest performance) tries to maintain
decorum, seeks therapeutic answers and, ultimately, rat-clicks her
own way to the naughty side of her nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon also makes light of what he would call middle-class
prejudices where the family's Spanish maid and her African husband
are concerned. Outside observers would probably call that, more
accurately, playing ethnic stereotypes for cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker claims that the main point of this exercise is to
explode TV sitcom conventions. But just about everything in this
snide farce more readily references films by better European
auteurs. The intruder who unleashes the household's repressed
libidos comes from Pier Paolo Pasolini's ``Teorema'' (although Ozon
does earn cleverness points for substituting a little critter for
Terence Stamp). The resulting, playful perversions bear a nastier
charge than the numerous Pedro Almodovar films that inspired them.
The incest-for-family-harmony's-sake subplot doesn't make the case
Louis Malle's ``Murmur of the Heart'' did. And let's face it:
Surreal fetishism as a form of cultural criticism is probably
something only the late, great Luis Bunuel had the discreet charm
to pull off successfully.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unfamiliar with any or most of the names cited above,
``Sitcom'' may seem pretty outrageous. Then again, most episodes of
``The Simpsons'' make the same basic points _ with less lechery and
more laughs. &QL;

<P>
   Union membership nationwide rose faster last year than at any
time in the past two decades _ a development that labor experts
called the strongest sign yet that John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's
president, was succeeding in his efforts to reverse the labor
movement's lengthy slide.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Wednesday that union
membership rose by 265,000 last year, to 16.5 million, with growth
coming not just among government workers, but also in the private
sector, where union membership has plunged in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite significant,'' said Kent Wong, director of the
Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``After a decline that had been
continuing for several decades, the labor movement has finally
begun to see a rise in union membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the growth stemmed largely from stepped-up
organizing efforts by individual unions. They said a secondary
factor was that some growth in the unionized workforce came about
when unionized employers hired additional workers as the booming
economy added 2.7 million jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even some fierce critics of unions acknowledged that last year's
growth was impressive. Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economics
professor who is writing a book he plans to call ``The Twilight of
Unionism,'' said: ``My first reaction is it's definitely a
surprise, and a positive step for organized labor. Whether it
represents a real turnaround, we have to wait and see. What's the
biggest surprise is it's the first increase in a long time in
private-sector union membership, and that's very good news for the
labor movement.''
</P>
<P>
   With union membership falling by nearly one-fourth since 1980,
Sweeney hailed the new numbers as showing that his push to get the
nation's unions to devote more resources to recruitment was paying
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers show we've gotten this train rolling, and its
picking up speed, but we're not at our destination yet,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many groups of workers that had long shunned
unions were now seeking to join them to get more voice in their
workplace, including doctors, software workers, graduate teaching
assistants and even many workers in the anti-union South.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sweeney said unions needed to show gains for several more years
before labor began to regain some of the formidable strength it
once had. In the 1950s, unions represented 35 percent of the
nation's workforce, but last year they represented just 13.9
percent _ a figure that remained unchanged from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sweeney took the helm of the American Federation of
Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations in late 1995, he has not
just increased labor's focus on organizing, but expanded its
political clout by getting unions to devote more effort and money
to electoral campaigns. Any future increases in union membership
could further strengthen labor's clout in politics and collective
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders pointed to several major victories in last year's
efforts, among them organizing 74,000 home health aides in Los
Angeles in the biggest successful organizing drive since the 1930s,
and unionizing 5,200 Pillowtex-Cannon textile workers in North
Carolina after nine decades of failed efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, union membership among government workers has
soared as many state and city governments gave civil servants the
right to join unions. At the same time, membership in the
fast-growing private sector fell steadily as the nation's heavily
unionized manufacturing sector shed jobs and as many companies
battled organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said that in 1999 the nation's unions organized 600,000
additional workers, the most since the 1970s. But growth in labor's
ranks was far smaller than that, union leaders explained, because
of layoffs of unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics said unions added 112,000 members
in the private sector last year, the biggest increase in two
decades. The bureau reported that 9.4 million private-sector
workers were unionized last year, representing 9.4 percent of the
private-sector workforce. The bureau also found that 7.1 million
government employees were unionized, 37.3 percent of public-sector
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers has focused on organizing auto parts
plants while construction unions have mounted their biggest efforts
in decades to organize work sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private-sector growth is a clear sign that our efforts to
think strategically and creatively are beginning to bear fruit,''
said Kirk Adams, the AFL-CIO's organizing director. Adams announced
last week that he would soon leave that post to take a job as a top
assistant to the president of the Service Employees' union.
</P>
<P>
   Many labor leaders cite the Service Employees International
Union as a model for organizing. That union said it organized
155,000 workers last year, mostly health-care workers, and said it
spent $70 million on organizing, accounting for 47 percent of the
union's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bernard, director of the Harvard University Trade Union
Program, said the ambitious plans Sweneey announced in 1995 to
expand labor's ranks seemed to be succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're turning an oil tanker around, and it takes a long time
to turn it,'' she said.

 &HT;    Ohio startup airline crosses $6 million hurdle
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Startup HeartLand Airlines is a small but crucial
step closer to spreading its wings, the company announced
Wednesday: It met last Friday's deadline for raising $6 million in
local seed money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to get on with the process of building an
airline,'' said David Lightle, one of the company's owners and
director of corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Now HeartLand faces an even bigger hurdle: a second-round
venture capital goal of $50 million. If successful, HeartLand would
give Dayton International Airport its first passenger hub since
USAirways closed its Dayton hub in 1991. It plans to cater to
business travelers by offering premium service to major
destinations at coach rates.
</P>
<P>
   HeartLand recently added James Hooser as vice president for
regulatory compliance to help HeartLand Chief Operating Officer
Dennis Crabtree apply to the Federal Aviation Administration for an
airline certificate. Lightle said Hooser worked for the FAA for 20
years and has experience in the certification process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long, rigorous process. We have budgeted 10 months''
for the effort, Lightle said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers delayed announcing Friday's results because ``we were
dealing with issues of oversubscription,'' Lightle said. To raise
the $6 million, HeartLand offered a limited number of ``private
placement'' investments in $150,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   HeartLand's second-round goal of $50 million is nearly twice
what Lightle and HeartLand's other founders estimated they would
need when they started courting venture capitalists last February.
Lightle said cautious investors prodded the company to set a higher
goal to ensure it wouldn't run out of cash before it started seeing
revenues.

 &HT;    Snow in Florida? `I saw it, but I didn't believe it'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Carl Tyozandlak got to work before
daybreak Wednesday, Jan. 19, 1977, just ahead of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was already down to the upper 20s. A relentless
wind whistled in _ more than 40 miles an hour at times _ hurling
fat, fluffy flakes of snow against the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it, but I didn't believe it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   No one did.
</P>
<P>
   The phone at the National Weather Service station at Palm Beach
International Airport began ringing soon after the first flake fell
and didn't stop for hours. Tyozandlak, the observer on duty,
counted 22 calls in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers. Television stations. People who thought they
were going crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was surprised,'' Tyozandlak says. ``It's something
that never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Hurricane David two years later, the surprise
snowfall of 1977 remains a highlight of a 37-year meteorology
career that began when Tyozandlak was a teen-ager in the Army Air
Corps and carried him around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Weather records going back to the 1870s showed no hint of snow
in these parts, and it's no wonder. ``Snow requires very cold air
near the ground,'' Tyozandlak says. ``It's a form of precipitation
_ frozen rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at night, during an extended chill, the earth here radiates
enough soaked-up sunshine to discourage Frosty the Snowman from
retiring to a beachside condo. But this was no ordinary cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers documented the day:
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry, Transportation Crippled by Freezing Cold (from Post
Wire Services)
</P>
<P>
   The nation's worst siege of bitter cold in decades crippled
industry, business and transportation in the eastern half of the
nation. Temperatures plunged to near-zero levels in the Deep South
in the wake of Tuesday's hobbling snowstorm, triggering new natural
gas and power crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stories noted urgent federal action to guarantee heating
fuel to homes and hospitals across the nation, while warning that
such emergency efforts could deepen the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight days of record cold drained Florida Power &AMP;
Light, leaving 60,000 homes in Palm Beach County without power for
at least part of the night as the snow approached. Both West Palm
Beach television stations were knocked off the air, one of them for
more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   As the region's first and only snow day dawned, lots of people
were bundled up and burrowed in. Lack of heat canceled classes at
13 county schools. The snow began to fall at 6:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tyozandlak, stationed on the second floor of the old terminal
building with a dozen colleagues, began recording data immediately.
The phone calls, he soon decided, would have to wait. ``I had to
make the official record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He noted cloud height, dew point, visibility _ details now filed
away in an archive. What mattered then and now to millions of
astounded Floridians as far south as Miami is that patches of their
ever-green ground were turning white. ``We measured a quarter of an
inch of snow,'' Tyozandlak says.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uneven dusting _ up to a half inch in sheltered
pockets; little or none in sunny or wind-swept spaces _ but there
was no time for a second coat, or to confirm reports of attempted
snowball fights and snow angels. The last flurry fluttered down at
8:40 a.m. and the rising sun quickly erased any trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was back to business,'' Tyozandlak says. ``The rest of
the day was pretty much routine.''
</P>
<P>
   All schools in Palm Beach and Martin counties were closed the
following day, as an all-time low temperature of 27 was recorded at
the airport. Snowfall in North Florida was heavier, and at least
one death in Tampa was blamed on icy roads. Crops around the state
suffered severe damage: up to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tyozandlak retired in 1983. The airport weather station here has
since closed.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't snowed since.

   SARATOGA, Calif. _ Ending almost five years of secrecy,
Transmeta Corp. Wednesday announced a radical new microprocessor
design that promises tough competition for Intel Corp. The new
chips are compatible with Intel's products while consuming
substantially less power and costing less.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta's processors are designed to improve on portable
versions of Pentium-class microprocessors that power today's
personal computers by emphasizing software, and the company said it
was also pushing toward the widely anticipated post-PC era of
mobile Internet computing.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are being manufactured by International Business
Machines Corp. They are already in production, and IBM expects to
be shipping by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer design
company has become the focus of widespread speculation in Silicon
Valley, in part because of its secrecy and in part because its best
known employee is Linus Torvalds, the star programmer who led the
development of the free Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday at a press event held here at an upscale conference
center in the foothills above Silicon Valley, Transmeta executives
unveiled the first technical details of what they said was a
fundamentally new and radical approach to microprocessor design.
</P>
<P>
   With substantial support from IBM, Transmeta executives set the
company on a strategic course that competes directly with Intel,
the world's largest chip maker. In addition, the company has allied
itself with Microsoft Corp., but has also unveiled products that
will compete with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that IBM, which has committed to make
Transmeta's chips at its Burlington, Vt., semiconductor facility,
is making a major bet on the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta's Crusoe chips, which take their name from the
fictional character Robinson Crusoe and are targeted at portable
computing applications, are intended to drastically simplify
computer hardware design by shifting complex operations to software
that can be easily modified and quickly updated.
</P>
<P>
   That approach puts the company on a different design path than
Intel, which has created a more complex microprocessor family known
as IA-64 to press forward the next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Having raised about $100 million, with investors that include
venture capital firms, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures, the George Soros Fund and Deutsche Bank, Transmeta is one
of the largest gambles in recent years in Silicon Valley. It has
200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the company's founder and chief executive, David
R. Ditzel, said the company had kept a low profile in part because
it wanted to protect its ideas and in part because it wanted to
have a working product before it took its technology public.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company was aiming first at the quickly growing
mobile computing market, which many in the industry expect will
accelerate when wireless Internet connections are easily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet changes everything,'' said Ditzel, ``In the
future, you will no more want to leave your home without your
Internet connection than you do without your cell phone today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel founded Transmeta five years ago after leaving his
position as chief scientist of Sun Microsystem's research
laboratories. He also co-authored a key computer science paper on
the idea of RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, with David
Patterson, a University of California computer scientist, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   RISC sought to change computing by shifting complexity from
hardware to software, thereby streamlining chips and increasing
their speed. On Wednesday, in an interview, Ditzel said that in a
sense the Transmeta design was a return to the original RISC
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new chip, however is a processing core based
around a technology known as VLIW, or very long instruction word,
which is also being embraced by Intel and Hewlett Packard in the
new IA64 chip. VLIW attempts to speed up computing by executing
many simple instructions in parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its top-of-the-line chip, the TM 5400
would have a clock speed of 700 MHz and consume, on average, about
1 watt of power, far lower than today's low-power Intel chips,
which can consume 10 watts or more.
</P>
<P>
   That chip is targeted at sub-notebook portable computers that
run Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A second Transmeta chip, the TM3120, has a clock speed of 400
MHz, consumes about 1 watt and is intended for Internet network
appliances that run a version of the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great relationship with Microsoft,'' Ditzel said.
``It's kind of like, `Let the best software win.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for Intel said the giant chipmaker
would not comment on the new start-up, which is located a few
blocks from Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta Wednesday produced several demonstrations showing the
use of a software technology named LongRun, which is intended to
dynamically adjust the speed of a microprocessor to consume less
power as it learns about the characteristics of a particular
application.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration, the company showed its chip running a DVD
movie while consuming only a fraction of the power drawn by a
comparable Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between processors from Intel and Transmeta
is Transmeta's decision to rely principally on software both for
emulating Intel's chips and for power management.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta's software technique, called Code Morphing Software,
converts Intel computing instructions into VLIW instructions on the
fly while sacrificing little performance.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's briefing, analysts pressed the company to provide
specific performance benchmarks, which were not included in news
media materials. Transmeta officials said that a high-end Transmeta
chip would perform about as fast as a 500 MHz Pentium III
microprocessor and that a computing system based on a Transmeta
chip and its LongRun power management software would have battery
life about twice as long as a comparable Intel system.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds said that he had helped design the Code Morphing
approach and had worked on a special version of mobile Linux that
the company will use for network appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not announce specific products or customers
Wednesday, but said that computer makers in the United States and
Japan were planning to build computers based on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   A Compaq executive at Wednesday's event said his company was
``interested'' in Transmeta's chips.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At a monastery nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in
remote Bhutan, the young Tibetan monks are feverish with
anticipation. Are they awaiting the arrival of the Dalai Lama? Are
they preparing to return to their ravaged homeland? No _ they're in
the grip of World Cup obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are scrawled with soccer slogans; during morning
meditation, monks pass notes about France and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   These events are recorded in ``The Cup,'' opening on Friday,
which marks the directorial debut of Khyentse Norbu, who is both a
high Tibetan Buddhist lama and Bhutan's first feature filmmaker. It
stars the residents of Chokling Monastery and is based in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are young monks who are such soccer fanatics that they
form groups to pray for certain teams to win,'' the director, 38,
recalled on a recent visit to New York. ``I couldn't put that in
the film, because no one would believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   How can strict Buddhist practitioners, trained in the
dissolution of the ego, embrace a sports culture that prizes
aggression and victory? How can a people dispossessed of their
homeland get caught up in a tournament's nationalist frenzy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cup'' offers no simple answers. But after a decade in
which lamas have lent an otherworldly presence to a spate of
Hollywood productions _ from Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Little
Buddha'' to Martin Scorsese's ``Kundun'' to Jean-Jacques Annaud's
``Seven Years in Tibet'' _ ``The Cup'' presents a warmly human view
of Tibetan Buddhism, suffused with humor and an insider's love and
knowledge of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows an audacious young novice as he struggles to
organize a viewing of the World Cup final. He must contend with the
monastery's strict geko (or proctor) and gain the attention of its
venerable abbot. One of the movie's more striking characters is an
elderly lama known for oracular predictions and his refusal to
bathe.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his saffron robes at the headquarters of the Donald
and Shelley Rubin Foundation (an organization for the preservation
of Himalayan art), Khyentse Norbu explained why he felt the need to
include such a character. ``In Buddhism, we talk about
outrageousness and elegance,'' he said. ``These two should always
be combined. If you're too elegant, you become a slave of society.
If you're too outrageous, then you can't fit in. Well, somehow in
America, there's this idea that Tibetan monks are exotic, godly,
very pure creatures. There's a lack of that crazy wisdom, which the
old lama represents. He's a great master who has achieved a lot.
But sometimes he disappears, and where do we find him? In the local
bar, playing dice.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that Khyentse Norbu is a venerated religious
figure. Known more widely by his ecclesiastical title, H.E.
Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, he was born (or, as Buddhists
believe, came to life again) in 1961, the son of a Tibetan father
and a Bhutanese mother.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 7, Tibetans recognized him as the reincarnation of a
19th-century saint and religious reformer. ``Two Tibetans were
waiting at my parents' home in Bhutan,'' he said. ``And they sort
of drafted me.'' From then on he was raised in monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   He was 19, he said, when he saw his first film _ on a small
television while waiting in a train station in India. Later, while
teaching and studying Buddhist philosophy in London, he attended
nightly screenings where he discovered the works of Yasujiro Ozu,
Satyajit Ray and Andrei Tarkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, I thought films had to have beautiful women,
beautiful men and car crashes,'' he said. ``But there I saw simple
village life. So I thought, I can do this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The conviction became so strong that when he was approached by
Bertolucci to serve as a consultant on ``Little Buddha,'' he left
graduate school. ``What fascinated me,'' Bertolucci said, ``was his
kind of intelligence, which is very special. He has a great love of
paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By telephone from Rome, Bertolucci offered an example. ``On the
last day of shooting he seemed a bit sad, so I asked him about it.
And he said, `All this time I've been so busy, and now I'm going
back to my monastery in Bhutan, where I'll be on retreat for five
months of strict meditation, during which time I won't speak with
or see anyone.' `So,' I answered, `the time of renunciation has
begun.' He agreed, but then looked at me with a cheeky smile.
`Wouldn't the ultimate renunciation,' he asked, `be the
renunciation of renunciation?'''
</P>
<P>
   Renunciation was not uppermost in Khyentse Norbu's mind as he
set out to direct his first feature, with no more training than his
experience on ``Little Buddha,'' a three-week course at the New
York Film Academy and what he gleaned from making two short videos.
Practical considerations, he said, determined his choice of
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single monk who acts in the film lives at that
monastery,'' he said. ``And the crew could sleep there. Perhaps I
took advantage of my position as a higher lama. Because whatever I
said I had to do, the monks just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most decisions, from casting choices to camera placement, were
made using mo, the ancient Tibetan Buddhist system of divination.
``For example,'' the director said, ``I didn't know which film
stock was better. I asked, and some liked Fuji, others Kodak. I had
to make a quick decision. So I consulted the oracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Thomas, a British producer who had known Khyentse Norbu
since his work on ``Little Buddha,'' helped arrange the $650,000
financing with Palm Pictures in New York. Hooman Madj, formerly of
Palm Pictures, and Thomas served as executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   Low budget filmmaking in the Himalayas poses a challenge. ``The
nearest place for cheap camera rentals is in Australia,'' Khyentse
Norbu said. ``You have to fly the equipment in, and drive seven
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Pierre Macia chose ``The Cup'' for inclusion in the
Director's Fortnight, the prestigious film series she directs in
Cannes. ``The films I'd seen about the lives of Tibetan monks were
either proselytizing or exoticizing,'' Ms. Macia said. ``This was
something completely different. It told us about their traditions,
but it was also an extraordinary lesson in cinema, and in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bhutan's premier director is painfully aware of the
compromises he faces. ``I want to tell a story in a Bhutanese
way,'' he said, ``like the director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. In `Gabbeh,'
he told his story in an Iranian way. It's very poetic, and full of
mystery. But Iran has a government-subsidized film industry.
There's no film industry in Bhutan. So this dependence on Western
money can be quite discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he nourishes a singular aspiration. ``One day,'' he said,
``if I meet a Hollywood producer who would agree to throw his
millions of dollars into the ocean, my biggest ambition is to make
a film based upon the life of the Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
   The life of the Buddha?
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it's a dream that will never come true,'' he said.
``But film is such a powerful language. Look at these ancient
paintings,'' he said, pointing to the magnificent tangkas _ richly
detailed images of Buddhist saints and demons that line the walls.
``Well, today we have film. For me, there is no difference between
making a film and painting a tangka. It's just a different time and
medium.''

AMERICAN RABBIS CALL   FOR ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TO SHARE
JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (DELETES repetitive ``the'' in 6th graf) 
 (rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of American rabbis, concerned that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks might collapse over the tangled
issue of Jerusalem, called Wednesday for the two sides to share the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Jerusalem should be under the
exclusive sovereignty of one nation,'' said a statement from the
group calling itself The Jewish Peace Lobby and signed by more than
300 rabbis. ``The question is whether the pursuit of both justice
and peace requires that, in some form, Jerusalem be shared with the
Palestinian people. We believe that it does,'' the statement said
in part.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was organized by Jerome Segal, a research scholar
at the Center of International and Security Studies at the
University of Maryland, who founded the Peace Lobby a decade ago to
push Israel toward negotiating with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Now that the peace negotiations are edging toward the
final, knotty differences, Segal believes outside groups must force
debate on the most sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there has been no serious discussion inside Israel
about any general compromise on Jerusalem,'' Segal said in a
telephone interview. ``Jerusalem is still kind of viewed as the
third rail of Israeli politics, with the right claiming that the
left will redivide Jerusalem and the left saying that is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued Wednesday in part because the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is to meet with President
Clinton in Washington Thursday for talks about the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Segal and the rabbis say that the issue of the holy city is such
an emotional one that nobody has ever analyzed the actual geography
involved in detaching western Jerusalem from the eastern portion
where all 180,000 Palestinians live.
</P>
<P>
   A survey devised by Segal with researchers from both sides found
that neither Israelis nor Palestinians viewed the borders of the
city as sacrosanct when it was broken down neighborhood by
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask people what parts of the city are important, only
the Mount of Olives and the Old City are really important to both
peoples,'' he said. The Old City constitutes only 1 percent of the
area of modern Jerusalem, Wednesday's statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The area within its walls is important to Jews, Muslims and
Christians because it contains the remnants of the last Jewish
temple and the third holiest mosque in Islam, which Muslims once
faced in prayer. It also includes a church on the site where Christ
was believed to have been crucified. The rabbis' statement said
that sovereignty in this area could come through creative
negotiations that would not have to apply to other lands.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested that the borders of Jerusalem, which have been
expanded again and again practically since the day Israel captured
the city in 1967, might be reduced to create a more Jewish city.
The eastern and western portions were physically divided from 1948
to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, by giving up control over the sprawling, mostly
undeveloped Arab areas, would remove from Israeli Jerusalem most
Palestinians, who would likely become citizens in a future
Palestinian state, anyway, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis who signed the statement said they felt it was a moral
question, that peace was the most important goal of the Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Jerusalem belongs to the Jews and only the
Jews, if that precludes peace, is wrong,'' said Rabbi Burton
Visotzky, a professor of rabbinic literature at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in Manhattan. ``I think in the end we will
have to live with our neighbors and there is no way around it, and
that includes Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   But some who considered signing the statement _ about 1,200
rabbis were approached _ ultimately backed off because they
couldn't envision a practical way of sharing the city, among other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Others opposed the idea of Americans interfering in the
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over a city both
sides view as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   The position of most Jewish groups in the United States on the
issue of Jerusalem hues closely to the official position of all
Israeli governments, which is that it is their indivisible capital.
The degree to which any group is willing to debate that ranges from
the unwavering stance of the more hawkish groups to some elasticity
among the more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, have
committed to Feb. 13, 2000, as a deadline to develop a framework
for negotiating outstanding differences, including Jerusalem. But
those efforts have stalled somewhat and a spokesman for the Israeli
government said no change should be expected on the issue of
Jerusalem.

COMPOSING AN AMERICAN EPIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>

 Phillip Lopate's most recent book is ``Totally Tenderly
Tragically,'' a collection of film essays.  
 By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is the greatest American filmmaker of the last 30 years?
Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, John
Cassavetes, Woody Allen, Robert Altman all have their partisans.
But if the criteria includes the most masterpieces, or the highest
sustained level of accomplishment, maybe we should also be talking
about Frederick Wiseman.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, when ``Titicut Follies,'' his portrait of a state
prison for the criminally insane, made its debut, he has directed a
total of 30 complex, disturbing, illuminating documentaries, on the
average of one a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why has this towering achievement been so under-recognized in
the film world? Well, documentaries get little respect; Wiseman's
have mostly been shown on television, rather than in theatrical
release; and his style is demanding, presenting painful realities
in an essentially unmanipulative way that makes the viewer work.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman is, however, about to be honored by the Human Rights
Watch International Film Festival, with the 2000 Irene Diamond Life
Achievement Award. And a complete, monthlong retrospective of his
work will be shown at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Walter
Reade Theater starting Friday with the New York premiere of his
latest film, ``Belfast, Maine'' (which will also be shown Feb. 4 on
Channel 13 in New York).
</P>
<P>
   If Walt Whitman's grandiosely democratic aim was to capture
``the poem of these United States,'' then Frederick Wiseman, in a
more diffident vein, is his one true grandson. ``My goal is to make
as many films as possible about different aspects of American
life,'' Wiseman has said.
</P>
<P>
   He has tackled nearly every area: education, welfare, medicine,
religion, the military, the workplace, leisure, retail, food,
housing, the arts, community. Like Whitman, too, who wrote a single
ever-thickening book, Wiseman regards his collected work as ``all
one long movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wiseman is one of my heroes,'' cheerfully confesses Errol
Morris, himself a superb documentary filmmaker (his `` Death''
recently opened). ``One hallmark of a great filmmaker _ Renoir,
Hitchcock, Bresson, Wiseman _ is to have created a body of work, a
cosmos. Give up that old distinction between documentary and
feature film. Call it what it is: a vision, a simulacrum of the
world. No one has exceeded in scope and intensity the simulacrum
that Wiseman has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass., filmmaker, now in his mid-60s, grew up in
an atmosphere of social concern. His mother was the administrator
of a children's psychiatric ward and his father, a lawyer, served
on hospital boards and charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman himself attended law school at Yale and passed the bar
but did not practice, though he taught academic law and married a
law professor, naming his production company _ Zipporah _ after
her. His first film, ``Titicut Follies,'' financed on credit,
confirmed his hunch that contemporary life could be explored by
focusing on institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It also got him into trouble (the film was censored for 25
years, as the State of Massachusetts did not take kindly to this
exposure of Bridgewater Prison's cruelly inadequate facilities).
Undaunted, he reeled off an unprecedented string of a dozen
brilliant documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Wiseman appropriated the techniques of cinema
verite _ synch-sound, lightweight portable equipment _ plunging the
viewer into the moment without explanatory voiceovers, mood music,
interviews, reenactments, flashbacks, even identifying titles.
</P>
<P>
   These austerities encourage the impression that one is watching
life as it happens, and force the viewer to make sense of scenes
and relationships glimpsed in medias res. Of course, the ``truth''
in cinema verite is still a highly artificial, selective fiction.
What counts is that Wiseman has taken the journalistic technique of
cinema verite and elevated it to a personal expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes Wiseman unique is that he follows location,
not character. He shoots in one place for days, weeks, months,
obeying the philosophy that reality is not in some glamorous
``elsewhere,'' but wherever you happen to be. Wiseman insists that,
Heisenberg's principle aside, his filming does not alter the
subjects' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The minimal crew consists of Wiseman himself, taking sound, and
a cameraman whom the director instructs via ear-mike. A great deal
must still be left to the cinematographer's discretion, and Wiseman
has long had the benefit of two superlative cameramen, William
Brayne and John Davy. Copious footage is shot. A four-hour event
might be edited down to 10 minutes, yet give the impression of
being in real time.
</P>
<P>
   An acknowledged master editor, Wiseman is above all a
storyteller, who can keep his finger on the pulse of a scene while
letting it remain open. As he once said: ``To take a simple
example, you could just cut to the one-liner that's really good.
But I think the one-liner that is really good is much better if it
is submerged in a context, so the viewer has to grope for it a
little bit by participating in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The early films _ like ``Titicut Follies,'' ``High School,''
``Law and Order,'' ``Hospital,'' ``Welfare'' _ were initially
received as muckraking social criticism, in line with '60s protest
culture. But if Wiseman had a reformist axe to grind in the first
two (he now concedes they were ``too didactic''), he soon began to
baffle his anti-Establishment fans by the even-handed treatment of
police in ``Law and Order'' (1969) and by the portrait of the
Army's professionalism in ``Basic Training'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, one understood that his sympathies were not only
for the schoochildren, patients and criminals processed by the
state, but for the harried caregivers and peacekeepers trying to do
their best.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, these films look a little different. We can
appreciate more that they are about the fragility, suffering and
resilience of the human condition. The jailers and jailed in
``Titicut Follies'' are both locked in together.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the life lessons the high school teachers are trying to
instill in their charges actually make sense. The telephone
confrontation in ``Hospital'' between the bald male doctor and the
unseen but infamous Miss Hightower, who refuses to put the doctor's
ailing transvestite patient on welfare, captures the intractable
flavor of our Age of Bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucracy is one of Wiseman's key subjects. His treatment of
it reached an apotheosis in ``Welfare'' (1975), perhaps his
greatest film. The amount of thorny, complex reality it offered,
without rushing to resolution, was unique for television; the
nearly three-hour length (it was the first of Wiseman's films to
move beyond the tight 90-minute structure) gave it an epic
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, the piece had an over-the-top, operatic quality, with
duets and arias, including the amazing soliloquy of the last
client, who is both paranoid and eloquently sane in his rambling
prayer. (Not surprisingly, ``Welfare'' was turned into an opera
years later.)
</P>
<P>
   One saw that underneath the social critic was a metaphysician:
all these people in waiting rooms (who stand for us) are
petitioning a silent God of Justice, as in Kafka's parable ``Before
the Law.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do about welfare? Wiseman refused to offer policy
solutions. ``I am incapable of pronouncing general truths,'' he
insisted, aligning himself instead with ``the complexity and
ambiguity of human behavior.'' Whatever institutional reforms might
ensue, we would still be suffering, craving an explanation and
waiting to die.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that point made clearer than in the six-hour ``Near
Death'' (1989), which takes place in a terminal ward. This
fascinating, if excruciating, film has several long discussions
between the medical staff and a patient's dazed family, who are
told the pessimistic circumstances of their loved one and,
indirectly, encouraged to pull the plug. It's as much a study about
the uses of language as it is about medical technology and the
final moments of life.
</P>
<P>
   The film critic's tendency is to want to divide Wiseman's ``one
long movie'' into triumphs, near-misses and duds. Certainly it is
easy to isolate such masterworks as ``Welfare,'' ``Hospital,''
``Titicut Follies,'' ``Law and Order,'' ``Juvenile Court,'' ``Near
Death'' and ``Public Housing,'' where the drama of suffering is
most tragic or comically appalling, the confrontation between
servers and clients at its starkest _ while taking potshots at his
blander studies of fashion models, Aspen, Central Park, or the
Comedie Francaise.
</P>
<P>
   But even these less intense works inform us of a world, and he
can be acutely observant with less overtly dramatic subject matter.
``Essene'' sustains the tension of a crackling intellectual
argument from first to last, as notions of participatory democracy
and group therapy are shakily introduced to the religious order.
``Meat'' (1976), though the victims (cows and lambs) can't argue
back, is an oddly touching, gruesome western.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most documentaries date, the further they get from their
historic context,'' observes Richard Pena, the Film Society of
Lincoln Center's director. ``With Wiseman it's the opposite: the
issues are still relevant, but now we can see the formal artistry
and the poetic, abstract quality in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In their beautifully composed cutaway shots and two-second
vignettes, Wiseman's documentaries display a surprising affinity
with the work of experimental filmmakers such as Ernie Gehr or Rudy
Burckhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman has always been a passionate devotee of the theater, and
there is a theatrical underside to his work. From the revue staged
in ``Titicut Follies'' to the client at the end of ``Welfare'' who
even cites ``Waiting for Godot,'' there is a focus on performance
(how well or badly the bureaucrat disappears into his role, the
healer into hers).
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman's institutions are not just sociological constructs, but
stage settings inviting a theater of the absurd. Often some grim
humor breaks through the surface. Whether it's the Dostoyevskian
hippie on a bad drug trip, terrified of dying and vomiting for 10
minutes in ``Hospital,'' or the technicians in ``Primate''
masturbating the chimpanzee, or the sour-faced Brother Wilfred
whisking the fly-swatter in disdain at the Abbott's New Age
appeasements in ``Essene,'' or the ghetto-dwellers of ``Public
Housing'' listening in silent disbelief to the black entrepreneur
who tells them they should start an elevator-repair business, there
is a surreal gap between need and response.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Pauline Kael said about his unflinching camera, ``You
look misery in the eye and you realize there's nothing to be afraid
of.'' But not only misery. In ``Canal Zone'' (1977) the Panamanian
patients in a mental health clinic sit stolidly in the waiting room
watching television, an Abbott and Costello film dubbed into
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   With puckish calm, Wiseman gives us more than a minute of this
film clip, minus English titles, followed by a Kentucky Fried
Chicken commercial. Of course we are welcome to interpret the scene
as a commentary on cultural imperialism; but it is also a statement
of our hopelessness before the entropic absurdity of life.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wiseman works, such as ``Canal Zone'' and ``Meat,'' end
with a curious sense of diminuendo. ``He addresses our greatest
fear _ stasis,'' notes Errol Morris, ``everything grinding down
slower and slower to some kind of sad halt.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a meditative, almost pastoral side to Wiseman: the
pleasure of looking at the world around us in all its surreal,
debased contradiction. This contemplative manner is manifest in
``Belfast, Maine.'' It is a summation of everything Wiseman has
done: it captures the rhythms of community, with scenes of
lobstering, factories, moviegoing, emergency clinics, outreach care
for elderly people, hunting, amateur theatricals, high school (a
teacher gives an impassioned defense of ``Moby-Dick''), the
after-effects of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Fastening with Bressonian closeups on everyday implements, the
aging Wiseman, holding on, shows himself to be less an angry
prophet than a grateful mystic of the materialist realm.
</P>
<P>
   So many American movies are about desire, forbidden or
otherwise. Wiseman's films are more about the reality principle:
work, survival, illness, death. Yet underneath his stern drive to
make us experience greater and greater doses of life as it is, lies
a wonderment at reality's surreal forms. The fog-bound final images
of ``Belfast, Maine'' suggest that life is also a dream.

KIDS ARE BACK IN THE HALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when groundbreaking stand-up is seemingly at a
standstill and the absurdist humor of Andy Kaufman is being
re-evaluated at the local cineplex, the Canadian comedy troupe Kids
in the Hall is playing to packed houses across the country in its
first tour in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-city theater trek ``Kids in the Hall 2000: Same Guys ...
New Dresses'' includes new material and familiar sketches from the
quintet whose 1996 feature ``Brain Candy'' was a clever sendup of
Prozak culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the illegitimate offspring of Jerry Lewis and Andy
Kaufman,'' says the Kids' Kevin McDonald. ``The only sad thing is
we're called Kids in the Hall and one day we'll be in our 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kids no longer kids? Grandads in the Hall, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Discovered by ``Saturday Night Live'' creator Lorne Michaels,
the Kids _ Dave Foley, McDonald, Scott Thompson, Bruce McCulloch
and Mark McKinney _ first met the American TV audience when their
``Monty Python''-inspired half-hour sketch-comedy show debuted on
cable's HBO in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   When the Emmy- and ACE-nominated series wrapped in 1995, the
Kids moved on to a variety of individual projects. Thompson was a
regular on HBO's ``Larry Sanders Show'' and Dave Foley starred in
NBC's ``News Radio.'' Recently the group reunited to take its
classic sketches on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is a cloud in the shape of a question mark,''
McDonald, 38, said from his home in West Hollywood. ``And the
question mark somehow always becomes an exclamation point when
something happens that makes us excited to be Kids in the Hall
again. It seems like we're never going to be too long without each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kids appear at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles on Friday
and Saturday for three shows. On Sunday, Comedy Central airs an
eight-hour Kids in the Hall marathon, starting at noon. During the
week, the channel broadcasts the series at 2:30 and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Kids' often dark humor, which takes on consumer culture,
suburbia and all manner of adolescent fixations, includes an
unusual amount of drag. These Kids apparently just wanna have fun _
as girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say Dave (Foley) looks the best in women's
clothes,'' McDonald said. ``But, I don't know, I think we all have
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who has done guest appearances on TV's ``Drew Carey
Show'' and ``Friends,'' can be seen in the current feature ``Galaxy
Quest'' and the forthcoming ``The Ladies Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love for Kids in the Hall to make another movie,''
McDonald said. ``I think `Brain Candy' may have gotten overlooked.
And it could've been a lot funnier. We thought the plot was the
most important thing, so we killed about 40 pages of really funny
stuff because it didn't move the plot forward. That was a mistake,
looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald added that the cult comedy ``wasn't a total failure,
but if it had done boffo at the box office, we'd probably be making
another one by now.''
</P>
<P>
   A film that will eventually see release is a documentary now
being shot on the Kids' reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked touring,'' McDonald said. ``Maybe it's
because my dad was a traveling salesman and he instilled a love of
hotels, of ordering club sandwiches from room service at 10 at
night. It's also fun to see your work affecting people.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he was first inspired to try comedy when he
stumbled across Britain's ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' on TV at
the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``That show really is the bible _ they're the ones that blazed
the path,'' he said. ``I'll never forget the first sketch of theirs
I saw. They were pretending to be mountain-climbers climbing this
city street. I just remember being happy to be part of such a
silly, surreal world.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from the Pythons, Kids in the Hall co-founders
McDonald and Foley aimed for edgy, caustic material with a familiar
outer shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense to do the anarchy of a `Python' sketch but with
a traditional beginning, middle and end,''McDonald explained.
</P>
<P>
   The time was the '80s, when there was no shortage of stand-up
comics like Sam Kinison going for shock value as well as laughs. By
the early '90s, the ahead-of-their-time Kids had caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just doesn't seem to be much really edgy stand-up out
there anymore,'' McDonald offered. ``There are lots of funny
stand-up comedians today, but not many are trying for something we
haven't heard before. Nobody's really taking the chances they used
to.'' &QL; 
______ &QL; 
What: ``Kids in the Hall 2000: Same Guys ... New Dresses.'' &QL; 
Where: Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. &QL;

CANADA WANTS CIGARETTE PACKS TO BEAR PHOTOS OF DISEASE VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Taking its war on smoking to a more graphic level,
Canada's government Wednesday proposed that cigarette packs carry
color photographs of diseased hearts and cancerous lungs and lips.
</P>
<P>
   And to illustrate a link between cigarette smoking and male
impotence, Canadian health authorities chose a photograph of a
symbolically limp cigarette. In an attempt to dispel the perception
that smoking has sex appeal, the warning would read: ``Cigarettes
may cause sexual impotence due to decreased blood flow to the
penis. This can prevent you from having an erection.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Rock, the health minister, made the announcement on what
he called ``Weedless Wednesday,'' Canada's national stop-smoking
day, saying: ``With these hard-hitting health messages and
compelling graphics, we will reach smokers directly and
effectively. Tobacco is the only product on the market that will
result in a premature death for one out of every two users.''
</P>
<P>
   With teen-age smoking rates climbing in Canada during the 1990s,
to about 29 percent today, Rock warned that 90 percent of Canada's
habitual smokers acquire the habit before their 18th birthday.
Wednesday, when reporters showed mock-up packs to high school
students, several described the packs as ``gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's tobacco industry immediately rejected the idea of
devoting half of the front and back panels of their packs to any of
16 photographs showing smoking-related diseases. In addition to
raising ``serious doubts as to the legality of these proposals,''
Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers'
Council, said Wednesday that it would be technically impossible to
print such packages in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a question of obstructionism,'' he said at a news
conference in Ottawa. Printing companies ``have told us it is
impossible to do it in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock said he was confident that by the end of this year his
proposals would pass Canada's Parliament, where his party, the
Liberals, have a legislative majority. The laws would affect all
cigarette makers but would be felt most heavily by Canada's top
three manufacturers, none of which are U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Government research had found that warnings with pictures were
60 times as likely to stop or prevent smoking as were just words.
Although California and Canada have featured photographs of cancer
patients on billboards and television, this would be the first time
that pictures of cancerous tumors would be printed on cigarette
packs, said Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers'
Rights Association, a Canadian health group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two billion packs are sold in Canada a year; 25 to 30 times a
day those packages come out of the shirt pocket or the purse, and
they sit on the dash, on the coffee table,'' said Mahood, who has
designed cigarette warning campaigns here and in other
English-speaking countries. ``Counting each time they come out, the
packs are responsible for 50-60 billion advertising impressions per
year. This could cut out 95 percent of those favorable advertising
impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., are preparing legislation that would require
large, bold warnings like, ``Cigarettes are addictive,'' but would
not go so far as to require photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current cigarette warning labels are an international
embarrassment,'' Lautenberg said Wednesday in a statement issued in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Canada's Supreme Court sided with arguments made by
tobacco industry lawyers and parts of the Tobacco Products Control
Act as unconstitutional. Now, on grounds of free speech, cigarette
makers are challenging parts of a new Tobacco Act passed in 1997,
which permits the government to impose any regulations on health
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, cigarette makers have cultivated powerful
political allies. William Kelly, a member of the Canadian Senate,
is chairman of Rothmans Inc., which owns 60 percent of Rothmans,
Benson &AMP; Hedges, Canada's second largest tobacco manufacturer.
(Unlike the United States, Canada has no conflict-of-interest laws
governing legislators.)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, The National Post, a conservative
newspaper, warned Rock that he ``should reflect on the fact that
more Canadians smoke than voted Liberal in the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Canadian popular opinion increasingly intolerant of
smoking, federal and provincial governments have dealt a series of
blows to the tobacco industry in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Rock hired Jeffrey Wigand as a ``special
adviser'' for Canada's anti-smoking fight. Wigand is the former
executive of Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. whose whistleblowing
was dramatized in the recent Hollywood movie ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   All autumn, Canadian television aired tough,
made-in-Massachusetts anti-smoking messages, including one showing
the image of a girl smoking a cigarette paired with the image of an
elderly woman on a hospital lung machine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Canadian government sued R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc., affiliated companies, and the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers' Council for $1 billion, the largest suit ever filed
by the Canadian government outside of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Provinces representing two-thirds of Canada's population _
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and
Prince Edward Island _ are studying the possibility of joining the
suit, which was filed in federal court in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the companies were part of a conspiracy to
avoid taxes and boost sales in the early 1990s by smuggling
Canadian-made cigarettes into Canada through the St.
Regis/Akwesasne Indian Reserve, which straddles the New
York-Ontario border. Describing ``a scheme to defraud, corrupt,
cheat, steal, and conceal,'' the government alleges that the
smuggling cost Canada millions of dollars in lost tax revenues, in
wasted criminal investigation times, and in greater health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a U.S. criminal investigation, 22 people,
including a top R.J. Reynolds sale executive, pleaded guilty to
smuggling-related charges. Northern Brands International, a company
affiliated with R.J. Reynolds, also pleaded guilty and paid $15
million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The companies took Canadian-manufactured cigarettes that had
been legally exported and sold them to another company that then
ferried them across the border, through the Indian reserve, and
back into Canada. This allowed them to avoid Canadian taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If Canada prevails in its suit, it could win $3 billion because
it was filed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, which allows courts to award triple damages to
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, president of the Manufacturers' Council, today called
the claims ``defamatory and fictional. We will be defending
ourselves vigorously,'' he added. ``There is no truth to these
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with smuggled cigarettes accounting for as much as
one-third of Eastern Canada's cigarette sales, Finance Minister
Paul Martin reduced cigarette taxes by almost $14 a carton.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a carton of 200 cigarettes retails for about $20, about
one-third less than the average prices charged for across the
border, in New York and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from where our cigarettes were among the highest
priced in the world to the point where we have the cheapest
cigarettes in North America,'' said Mahood, the anti-smoking
activist. ``We went from the top to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, an annual survey of
students aged 12 to 18 shows a consumer response to the lowering of
prices: smoking rates increased last year to 28 percent from 24
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, noting that teen-agers are the smokers most sensitive to
high prices, said Wednesday: ``Taxes have to come up. They are
coming up as soon as we can get them up.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: KOHL'S STUBBORN LOYALTY TO OLD WAYS DAMAGES HIS
PARTY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ Maker of German unity. Destroyer of German
Christian Democracy. Could that be Helmut Kohl's improbable
epitaph?
</P>
<P>
   The party that has governed Germany for 33 of the postwar years
and embodied the country's core conservatism is by no means
moribund yet, but there were renewed signs Wednesday that Kohl's
refusal to reveal the source of secret payments to him of over $1
million has crippled the Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls showed support for the Christian Democrats
plunging to 29 percent, an 8 percentage drop from last week. Only
17 percent of those interviewed by the Forsa research group said
they believed Wolfgang Schaeuble _ Kohl's protege and successor as
Christian Democratic leader _ could restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The findings amounted to strong evidence that Kohl's resignation
on Tuesday as honorary chairman of the party was too little, too
late, and that Schaeuble's days as leader of the party may also be
numbered. The Suddeutsche Zeitung declared roundly that Kohl looked
like a ``Kaputtmacher'' _ a man who could render his party kaputt.
</P>
<P>
   That view may be extreme. But the gravity of what occurred under
Kohl grows plainer each day. Angela Merkel, the general secretary
of the party, said Wednesday that a continuing audit had uncovered
an additional $4.5 million in apparently illicit funds.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems clear enough that an entire system put in place
under Kohl secretly channeled large sums into Christian Democratic
coffers in order _ at the very least _ to finance slush funds at
the disposal of various party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl knew he was breaking German law requiring any contribution
of over $10,500 to be declared, and he knows he continues to do so
by refusing to name the donors. The question arises: Why has so
seasoned a politician so stubbornly driven the party he long served
and claims to love into a decline so steep it may take years to
overcome?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one clue lies in a little phrase the 69-year-old former
chancellor used as he quit. He said he had always tried to do his
``duty.'' In this rather old-fashioned word was captured the abyss
separating the worlds, the values, the outlooks and the priorities
of Kohl from many of the Germans now dismayed or outraged by his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Duty, to Kohl, apparently meant, among other things, breaking
the law to reinforce his party and go on winning. ``It's a very
old-fashioned excuse,'' said Joachim Krauze, a political analyst.
``People in this country have done terrible things and justified
them by referring to duty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl received his political education in a postwar world
very different from today's, one where Christian Democracy, in
Germany as in Italy, was an American-supported bulwark against
Communism, against the left, against disorder. Duty also meant
winning that battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming clear that Kohl saw the others, Social Democrats
included, as enemies,'' said Ortwin Runde, the mayor of Hamburg and
a leading Social Democrat. ``It was a Cold War mentality and any
means was justified in beating us. This whole system, with its
tight links between Christian Democracy and business, is the one
that is now being painfully dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a distinct air of a system dying in Germany
today, as if the Bonn Republic ended not with the government's move
to Berlin last year and the foundation of the so-called ``Berlin
Republic,'' but with this scandal, which unmasked an old and
shadowy way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was in Hamburg Wednesday, attending a meeting at the
Chamber of Commerce. It was his first public appearance since he
resigned, and he used defiant language again suggesting that he
believes his values are right and will prevail. ``In my whole life,
I have never given up my honor and I will not do this today
either,'' he said. ``I am fighting for my honor and part of this
battle is that I will stick to the word I have given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor,'' ``duty'' _ the same Kohlian universe, and one
profoundly at odds with the now prevailing European political
values of transparency, accountability, openness. The ``word'' that
Kohl gave was his promise to his secret financiers that he would
never reveal their identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these years,'' Kohl went on to say, ``I have never been
susceptible to bribes and everyone who knows me knows this.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the money received was not a bribe but merely an
illicit contribution to the reinforcement of the Christian
Democratic party. For Kohl, taking it therefore constituted a
``mistake'' _ a word that he has now used several times _ rather
than a crime.
</P>
<P>
   His position is clear enough, and seems unlikely to change
quickly. But in adopting it, he appears insensitive to the damage
already inflicted on his party, and the further damage that could
soon ensue.
</P>
<P>
   For the center-right is in crisis in much of Europe. Its old
enemy, Communism, is gone. Its old values _ nation, family _ often
seem anachronistic. Its 1980s mantra, market reform, has lost its
momentum as the left has occupied middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Its very raison d'etre often seems murky, as the plight and
divisions of Italian Christian Democracy, the British Conservative
Party and French Gaullism make abundantly clear. Now, German
Christian Democracy must be added to that list.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is toying with his party's implosion by remaining silent, a
posture that stokes suspicions that there is something truly
abhorrent about what he did. For all Kohl's denials, Germans are
inevitably asking themselves: Did he take bribes? Did he grant
favors? Their answer, in the absence of clarification, tends to be
that the party is rotten to the core and should not receive their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is a stubborn man, and he said Wednesday that he would
``face the challenge militantly.'' But publication of the report on
party finances _ expected early next week _ or revelations about
the identities of donors could make his obstinacy untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Christian Democracy is at risk. ``Mr. Schaeuble is
too wounded to survive,'' said Krauze, the political analyst. ``The
quicker a new generation is installed, the more hope there will be
of a recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl knows much about such generational shifts. Age 9 when
Hitler's war began, he once spoke famously of ``the blessing of
late birth.'' The phrase _ like many of Kohl's extraordinary
achievements _ will endure. But the German blessings of the former
chancellor have now run out in a crisis that has revealed him as
yesterday's man.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to open the radio airwaves to hundreds of
small broadcasters, the federal government is planning to approve
rules to allow educational, religious and community groups to run
inexpensive low-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of the nation's largest broadcasters, the
Federal Communications Commission is expected on Thursday to adopt
licensing rules that will permit the addition of noncommercial
stations with broadcasting ranges of as much as seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the rules, proposed a year ago, hold
great promise to transform the airwaves at a time when the rise of
broadcasting conglomerates has sharply reduced the diversity of
voices. Such low-power station licenses have not been issued for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will bring many new voices to the airwaves that have not
had an outlet for expression, and it happens at a time when the
radio business has consolidated in very dramatic fashion,'' said
William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struck by the outpouring of interest on this issue
as I've talked to people around the country,'' he added. ``From
cops and clergy and community groups of all kinds. Local
governments, Indian tribes and a whole range of subcultures, such
as the Creole community in Florida, zydeco fans in New Orleans, and
others who would love to have an outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest broadcasters have fought to block the rules
through intensive lobbying and legislation, asserting that the
so-called micro-radio stations could create interference for
established stations in the form of static or distorted signals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the National Association of Broadcasters, the
industry's trade group, failed to delay the commission's vote, it
issued a statement vowing to ``aggressively seek ways to undo the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the association said on Wednesday that they were
considering seeking a court order to strike down the new rules.
``In our view this comes down to one issue: interference,'' Dennis
Wharton, a spokesman, said. ``If tens of thousands of people cannot
hear their hometown radio station, it's hard to understand how this
benefits the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has come up with a way to confound the law of
physics,'' he added. ``We've documented in an unassailable case
that this will result in additional interference on already crowded
airways.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC studies have concluded that the airwaves in the nation's
three biggest markets _ New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ are so
crowded that the commission cannot issue any licenses for 100-watt
stations, which could cover a broadcast area seven miles in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the FCC are studying whether smaller 10-watt
stations, with a range of two to four miles, could be licensed in
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said FCC studies had convinced him that the new rules
would not lead to any significant new interference. He said that
some broadcasters had told the commission that they were as
concerned about losing their own listeners as about interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't see this as a threat,'' he said of the
broadcasters. ``As I envision this, the broadcasters will have a
whole new pool of talent they can incubate, and since these will
all be noncommercial stations, there will be no threat that they
will be going after the same advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   While normally a formidable lobbying force, the National
Association of Broadcasters, which represents the nation's largest
broadcast networks and station groups, was beaten at the commission
by a grass-roots coalition of churches, schools, musicians,
municipalities and ``pirate'' radio stations that billed itself as
a kind of civil rights movement intending to democratize the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the FCC's move, who produced their own
engineering studies showing no significant interference would
result, included musicians like Bonnie Raitt and the Indigo Girls,
the U.S. Catholic Conference and the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 colleges and universities have licenses to operate
10-watt stations under rules that were repealed more than 20 years
ago but permitted these stations to continue broadcasting. About
140 colleges have stations that are unable to broadcast on FM
frequencies because of current restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the spectrum available for low-power
stations would not be parceled out through auctions, as frequencies
for the larger stations are. Instead, FCC officials will award
licenses based on a group's ties to the local community the station
would serve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rules do not go as far as many supporters of
low-power radio had sought, supporters expressed excitement. ``This
clearly will be the most significant opportunity in decades for
community groups, educational institutions, religious organizations
and local governments,'' said Michael Bracy, executive director of
the Low-Power Radio Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said it was impossible to know how many
station applications would be submitted, though they and industry
experts predicted at least many hundreds, and possibly a thousand
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has received tens of thousands of letters seeking
low-power radio rules, including ones from the New School in New
York, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of the Abyssinian Church of
Harlem, students from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and
Kevin McGaughey, the principal of Brookland High School in
Brookland, Ark., a town of 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any stations serving our community alone,''
McGaughey said today from Brookland. ``I'm just looking for an
opportunity to bring the school and the community closer
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since an antenna tower _ the most costly item for a high-power
radio station _ is not required for broadcasting at 10 or 100
watts, the new stations can be established for as little as $1,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to defuse the issue of radio interference and avoid
court challenges, the commission scaled back its original proposal
to license stations broadcasting with a maximum of 1,000 watts,
which could broadcast over 18 miles. Though the government had also
initially contemplated commercial and noncommercial stations, the
final rules will permit only noncommercial stations. And they will
require at least three frequency intervals on the radio dial
between a low-power station and another station, rather than the
two intervals initially suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has decided to take a very conservative technical
approach,'' said Cheryl A. Leanza, deputy director of the Media
Access Project, a Washington group that promotes diversity of the
airwaves. ``This proposal cannot be criticized for harming the
broadcasters.''

 &HT;    Gingrich apologizes to supporters
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After one of many brushes with political oblivion,
Newt Gingrich says he has learned that picking himself up was more
important than getting knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   A year after leaving office and at the end of an unseemly public
squabble in his personal life, Gingrich is picking himself up one
more time with a series of speeches and a plea for money that are
intended to show that he remains the Republican Party's man of
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The former speaker of the House and Georgia congressman recently
sent a six-page letter to past contributors that began with an
apology and ended with a request for another donation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's divorce from his wife Marianne is all but final after
they reached an agreement last month. The divorce has yet to be
filed with the Cobb County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich, 56, told his supporters he was sorry if they were
offended by the details of the breakup of his marriage and his
six-year affair with 33-year-old Republican congressional aide
Callista Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the case, I hope you can find it in your heart to
forgive me, a human being with shortcomings who has made, and will
continue to make, his share of mistakes,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded the letter by inviting its recipients to join his
Committee for New American Leadership, a nonprofit organization
that ``will help Americans apply new technologies and ideas to
government and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That theme was at the core of Gingrich's speech Tuesday night at
Washington's American Enterprise Institute, where Gingrich is a
fellow. Bisek and several former Gingrich congressional aides were
in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   He had no comment for reporters who asked whether the divorce
had damaged his standing in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich talked about many of the same ideas he has tested
during the past few years. They include reforming Social Security
and retirement, limiting taxes and rethinking health care.
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted plodding government bureaucracies with the ease
and speed of using plastic bank cards to get cash from ATM
machines. And he called government increasingly irrelevant in an
age of instantaneous information.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year veteran of Congress and partisan political tussles,
Gingrich talked little about the 2000 campaign or Republicans'
struggle to retain control of the House of Representatives (he did,
however, note that he oversaw three straight Republican majorities,
the first such string since the 1920s).
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had a backhanded compliment for President Clinton and a
pointed piece of advice to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
likely to run against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the
U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, conceding that Clinton bested him in the area of
public relations, said that the president ``is very good at
demolishing his opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``If I had one hint for Giuliani, it would be,
think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-speaker will take on a more political topic Saturday when
he closes the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in
Arlington, Va., with a talk about the future of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also is a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution. He does radio and television commentary and is
involved in several private consulting businesses, including the
Georgia-based Gingrich Group.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains a political action committee, the Friends of
Newt Gingrich PAC.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've visited San Francisco's North Beach in the last year
or two, you may have run into Rose Pistola, a restaurant that has
been packing in diners since chef and restaurateur Reed Hearon
opened it in 1996. Featuring North Beach-style Italian food, the
cooking and menu are influenced by California and Liguria (on the
Northwestern coast of Italy).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's evolved here is a cuisine that's simple, pristine and
at the same time very sophisticated. The nature of the food we do
is homestyle cooking,'' says the Texas native who came to San
Francisco more than a decade ago after honing his skills in
kitchens in Austin, Denver and Sante Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was named after Rose Pistola (who passed away in
1998 at the age of 90), a colorful and feisty women who owned a bar
and was renowned in North Beach for her Italian cooking. Her
Silician father was a fisherman, and her mother was a fantastic
cook. Hearon said he loved Rose's name, her attitude, her spirit
and her joyfulness. ``She personified what I love about the
neighborhood: its bawdy sense of history and its wry acknowledgment
that it's futile to take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's possible to sample some of Hearon's restaurant fare
with a copy of his recently released ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook,''
co-written with Peggy Knickerbocker (Broadway Books; $35). It's
filled with 140 recipes _ mostly of dishes served at the restaurant
_ that evoke the spirit of North Beach and its Italian immigrant
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are signature dishes, including a colorful array of
antipasti. You'll see many of them displayed on oval platters at
the end of the open kitchen's counter when you enter the
restaurant. Featured are Marinated Olives, Shaved Artichoke With
Fava Beans and Parmesan, Shaved Raw Mushrooms, Endive and Parmesan
and Asparagus Carpaccio along with Skillet-Roasted Mussels,
Cioppino, Roasted Fish in a Salt Crust, Stuffed Focaccia, and Goat
Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon has tried to keep the recipes simple. ``We geared them to
the home cook and regular folks _ and they are indicative of the
food we serve _ which is home food, not restaurant-style food. The
cooking techniques in the book are based on home-cooking traditions
_ nothing fancy, nothing complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes rely on readily available ingredients _ and when
testing the recipes, the authors shopped for ingredients in local
stores rather than using items from the restaurant's kitchen. There
are some exceptions _ and in this instance mail-order sources are
included for things like beans, specialty flours, organic polenta,
hand-crafted cheeses and Ligurian olive oils _ if you feel inclined
to go to these lengths. Otherwise, Hearon gives substitutes _ or
you might search out local Italian specialty stores for products he
mentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out of the way to test each recipe three times in a
home kitchen,'' Hearon said during a recent stopover in Los
Angeles. To test the recipes, ``Peggy (Knickerbocker) and I had
dinner once a week with friends at my house.'' Hearon ad-libbed or
cooked at home from written recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon believes in using the freshest seasonal ingredients in
his creations and recommends that home cooks shop before making a
dish. They should buy what's fresh, in season, local and what
catches their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the recipes as guides, improvising based on what you
bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the warm, savory dishes in the book begin by infusing
cold oil and cold aromatics such as onions and garlic in a cold pan
over medium-high heat, allowing the ingredients to warm up in the
oil. This way, garlic and onions won't burn. Once you have the
aromatic oil base, the main ingredient of the dish is added.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon recommends using a Ligurian oil _ one that is fruity,
ripe and both delicate and full of flavor _ as often as possible in
the book's recipes. Among his favorites are Roi Mosto, Raineri and
Isnardi. He also advises saving water from cooking pasta, beans,
potatoes and vegetables and refrigerating or freezing for future
use in sauces and other dishes to integrate and bring the dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another frugal trick is to save rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese. Wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator to
throw into a pot of bean soup without fish _ or to enhance other
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers cooking with sea salt because it has a broader,
more complex range of flavors than table salt. However you can
substitute kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   Tempt diners with this sampling of dishes from ``The Rose
Pistola Cookbook.'' You're in for some delicious eating. &QL;

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

 &HT;    Forbes' work in Iowa finally reflected in polls
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Unless the principles of the work ethic don't
apply to politics at all, Steve Forbes' Iowa bounce was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Republican publisher has tirelessly
crisscrossed the early caucus state and invested in an impressive
ground-level political operation, but only recently has that effort
registered much more than single digits in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   An independent poll conducted Jan. 9-10 for a health association
by Atlanta pollsters Ayres, McHenry and Associates had George W.
Bush at 46 percent and Forbes at 24 percent. That survey, which
resembles several others taken recently, shows upward movement,
after all the spadework, for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bush's polling number still sitting above the highest
total any Republican candidate has ever received in the history of
the caucus _ 37 percent _ does it mean anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a good sendoff here, we're going to go a long
distance,'' said Forbes as his campaign bus rolled across western
Iowa on Sunday afternoon toward a chili-and-politics social in the
town of Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It's still hard to see how he might overtake Bush, but Forbes
does make a convincing argument that he's positioned to battle on
longer than rival John McCain, the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   If Iowa gives Forbes a boost in New Hampshire, where he has the
Manchester Union Leader's endorsement, Forbes can look forward to
Delaware, which he won in 1996, a week later. McCain has staked a
lot on the next Republican primary state, South Carolina, but
Forbes said what happens there ``won't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after that you've got Arizona, which I won in '96, and
Michigan, where we've got a fantastic organization,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things that moderate Forbes' optimism. Arizona is
McCain's home state and Michigan's Gov. John Engler is one of
Bush's most aggressive supporters, but the logic for a battle that
extends at least into the big March 7 primary _ when Georgia gets
to vote _ is plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Forbes also is getting a bump in media attention.
Now that he has the opportunity, the message he'd most like to get
across, he said, is that he's the candidate for voters who want
``bold things to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He characterizes the Bush and McCain tax plans as ``timid''
attempts to answer his flat-tax plan, and says his positions on
Social Security, health care and education are more daring
conservative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last debate before the caucuses, he challenged Bush's
education record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you really have to underscore that on most positions
they're tweedledum and tweedledee,'' Forbes said of his current
line of attack on Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes stump speech hasn't changed much, but as caucus night
nears, his campaign's emphasis has shifted somewhat away from
laissez faire economic proposals toward the issues, such as
abortion, that will bring out social and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes barnstormed with Eagle Forum President Phyllis Schlafly
this week, while an ad about the candidate's anti-abortion platform
aired on television. Another Forbes ad features the head of a Texas
tax-fighting group who claims Bush broke his pledge to them.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, an Iowa native, will be campaigning for
him this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look down the list of pro-family leaders, we've got
the worker bees,'' claimed former Georgia Christian Coalition
Chairman Jerry Keen, who now is on Forbes' staff.
</P>
<P>
   In line with the emphasis on social and religious conservatives,
Forbes has been spending considerable time hitting the smaller
cities and towns outside Des Moines. His campaign bus followed a
similar path in California a few months ago, hitting farm towns
like Modesto and Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves the broad suburban heartland to Bush, but
Forbes at least has spent the money to develop organizations in big
states.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his campaign's hard work, Forbes hopes the benefits
of his investment in Internet campaigning haven't gone undetected
in the polls. He has signed on some 35,000 volunteers through his
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to say I think only about a hundred are spies for
the other side. The rest are real,'' Forbes said. ``It makes a
wonderful tie between high-tech and grass-roots politicking,
particularly in big states such as California.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, it would have seemed a stretch to speak of
spies for the other side, but the indefatigable Forbes is enjoying
his bump.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Continuing a surge in Internet philanthropy, James
Barksdale, the former president of Netscape Communications Corp.,
and his wife, Sally, plan to give $100 million to promote the
teaching of reading in their home state, Mississippi, which suffers
from the nation's lowest literacy rates.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, which the Barksdales will announce Thursday, is
thought by authorities on philanthropy to be by far the largest
ever made in the field of literacy. Because the donation will
establish an institute at the University of Mississippi, it is also
one of the five largest donations by a private individual or
foundation to a public university, according to rankings maintained
by The Chronicle of Higher Education. The Barksdales are graduates
of the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Barksdales' gift will transfer some of the immense wealth
being generated in Silicon Valley to a region that has largely been
left behind by the vibrant new economy of the information age. And
it will seek to redress the persistent failure of government to
overcome the poverty and racial inequity that have led to
generations of social and economic stagnation in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The gift places Barksdale, who is 56, in the company of a
growing number of technology entrepreneurs and financiers who are
embracing philanthropy at relatively young ages. The group is led
by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, 44, the world's richest man and
the benefactor of a $17 billion charitable foundation. But it also
includes men like Jim Clark, 55, the founder of Netscape; Steve
Kirsch, 43, the founder of Infoseek, and Jeff Skoll, 34, the
founder of eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The Barksdales' money will create an endowment that will finance
a variety of reading programs for Mississippi children in
kindergarten through third grade. It will provide intensive
training in reading education to current and aspiring elementary
schoolteachers at universities around the state. It will also be
used to provide special help to underachieving students in the
state's most needy schools, often by holding classes after school,
by offering summer classes and by training parents in reading
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, proceeds from the endowment will enable elementary
schools to buy books, software and instructional materials for a
number of proven reading programs. Within five years, 200 of the
state's 521 elementary schools are expected to benefit from the
money, said Richard Thompson, state superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is an incredible shot of adrenaline for our
state,'' said Thompson, who noted that the state did not have
compulsory school attendance or publicly financed kindergarten
until 1985. ``This is going to give us hope for that jump start
where we can make an incredible amount of improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said in a telephone interview that he hoped his gift
would inspire philanthropic efforts to create similar programs in
other states. ``An enormous amount of wealth has been created in
recent years and people don't know what to do with it that's
productive,'' he said. ``This is something they can do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, a native of Jackson, Miss., who characterized his net
worth as ``north of $700 million,'' said that he and his wife
planned to donate all their wealth. ``When we die, if there's a
dollar left it's because I've miscalculated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Barksdales have been generous contributors to the University
of Mississippi in recent years. In 1996, they gave $5.4 million to
start an undergraduate honors college at the main Oxford campus.
Last year, they gave $2 million to provide scholarships to black
students attending the university's medical school in Jackson. The
literacy gift, however, will be the largest ever given by the
Barksdales, and the largest ever received by the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me tear up,'' said Robert Khayat, the university's
chancellor, ``is that this really does address one of the major
challenges we face as a society, and that's what higher education
should be doing and what private wealth should be doing. My sense
is that the measure of wealth is moving from how much is a person
worth to how much does a person give.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale made most of his money last year when Netscape, the
maker of the popular Internet browser, was sold to America Online.
But he also previously held top jobs at Federal Express and at
McCaw Cellular Communications.
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying remarkable growth in the mid-1990s, Netscape
faltered in its competition with the Microsoft Corp., making it an
appealing target for acquisition. It was Barksdale's Netscape that
first petitioned the Justice Department in 1996 to investigate
whether Microsoft had created an illegal monopoly by packaging its
own browser for free with its Windows software. Last year, a
federal judge issued a preliminary ruling against Microsoft after a
lengthy trial in which Barksdale was the government's lead witness.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale now works from his home in Aspen, Colo., helping to
manage a new California venture capital firm, the Barksdale Group,
that invests in Internet projects. The Barksdales are building a
house in Jackson, Miss., where many of their relatives live.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his counterparts in the technology sector,
Barksdale became deeply concerned about the country's schools after
struggling to find qualified workers for his companies. ``We have
300,000 to 400,000 jobs we can't fill in the industry,'' he said.
``And our core problem with our children learning is that they
don't know how to read. That's true all over the country.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The literacy problem in Mississippi is stunning even to state
officials. A 1998 study conducted for the National Institute for
Literacy concluded that 30 percent of the state's population age 16
and above would have significant difficulty locating an
intersection on a street map, filling out a Social Security card
application or finding two pieces of information in a sports
article.
</P>
<P>
   That rate was the highest for any state of what the study
classified as Level 1 literacy, the lowest of five possible levels.
Another 34 percent were classified as Level 2, with just marginally
higher skills.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is self-perpetuating. ``When you have this large
adult illiterate population it means you have thousands and
thousands of children who come to school at age 5 who haven't had
books read to them, haven't had books in the home,'' Dr. Thompson
said. In 1998, only 18 percent of the state's fourth-graders read
at or above a proficient level as measured by the National
Assessment of Educational Progress test. Only Hawaii scored worse.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale and many experts are less than bullish on the
prospects for attacking adult illiteracy. But positive results in
pilot reading programs in Mississippi and elsewhere convinced him
that children could be helped, even in the state's most
impoverished regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this program says is that we can't solve the adult
literacy problem but we can work with the children,'' Barksdale
said. ``Poverty and illiteracy go hand in hand, but one doesn't
cause the other.''

FREE SPEECH OR INTERFERENCE? ABORTION CASE IS ARGUED BEFORE HIGH
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (Eds.: Budgeted earlier as SCOTUS-RDP) 
(bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday wrestled with
whether a Colorado law intended to protect patients and staff
members at abortion clinics from intimidation and verbal harassment
goes too far in limiting demonstrators' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the 1993 law in a challenge
brought by three ``sidewalk counselors'' who travel around Colorado
to abortion clinics and seek to dissuade women entering the clinics
from going ahead with their scheduled abortions. The three abortion
opponents display signs and a model of a fetus, hand out literature
and try to converse with the patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law, the only one of its kind, established a
100-foot zone around the entrance to any ``health care facility.''
Within this zone, people may not, without consent, ``knowingly
approach another person within eight feet,'' for the purpose of
passing out literature or engaging in ``oral protest, education, or
counseling'' on a public sidewalk. A violation is a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of up to $750 or six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``converts protected speech into a crime,'' Jay Sekulow,
representing the three demonstrators, told the justices. The
plaintiffs did not challenge a portion of the law that prohibits
blocking a clinic's entrance or hindering someone from going in or
out. Consequently, Sekulow said, the case concerned only speech in
a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers representing Colorado and the Clinton
administration, supporting the state, argued that the law did not
curb any speech, because one person can speak to another from a
distance of eight feet in a conversational tone and still be heard.
``What this statute prohibits is moving in on somebody,'' Barbara
Underwood, a deputy solicitor general, told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McLachlan, Colorado's solicitor general, said the law
did nothing to curb ``uninhibited debate on all topics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer seemed to agree. Addressing Sekulow,
the plaintiffs' lawyer, he pointed out that that eight feet was
merely the distance between his own seat on the bench and that of
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, two chairs away. ``What is it that
someone can't say'' from that distance, Breyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the precise distance made no difference from the
point of view of the First Amendment. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist objected. ``But the distance must make some difference,''
he said, adding: ``Say you get down to three feet. I don't think
there's any message you can't communicate at three feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia picked up the questioning. Two inches? An
eighth of an inch? Nose to nose?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is speech in a public forum,'' Sekulow repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Speech in a public forum typically refers to ``a soapbox where
people gather around,'' not to face-to-face conversation from a
distance of an eighth of an inch, Rehnquist observed.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before in the last six years, the justices have dealt with
restrictions on protests outside abortion clinics, upholding some
restrictions and invalidating others. But the earlier two cases
concerned court injunctions obtained by clinics to prevent repeated
incidents of violence and disruption.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, this case involves a generally applicable statute.
Some justices expressed the concern that the law was general enough
to apply to such activities as union picketing outside hospitals.
Others wondered how it would apply to a high-rise building with a
doctor's office on a single floor. McLachlan, the Colorado
solicitor general, said he believed that the law would place a
100-foot protected zone around the entrance to such a building,
although he said the Colorado Supreme Court had not interpreted the
law in that context.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's earlier rulings suggested that injunctions
should be subject to closer judicial scrutiny than a law, that is a
disputed proposition that is one of the underlying issues in this
case, Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. For example, the American
Civil Liberties Union, in a brief filed on the plaintiffs' behalf,
said that while courts could tailor injunctions to cover specific
people who have engaged in unlawful conduct in the past, statutes
applied generally without any requirement of past misconduct, and
so should be subject to more searching review.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law does not mention abortion, and the state
defends it as a neutral statute that operates without respect to a
particular message. Scalia appeared to doubt this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we know what it's aimed at, which is abortion
protest,'' Scalia said, adding: ``I just wonder whether there's any
justification for singling them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asked whether the state could create similar zones
around auto dealerships or lawyers' offices. Ms. Underwood, the
deputy solicitor general, said that if the state compiled a record
showing disruption and harassment of people trying to enter those
establishments, such a law would be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen other states, including New York, have laws that protect
abortion clinics specifically or medical offices generally against
physical disruption. New York, Connecticut and 16 other states
filed a brief asking the court to uphold the Colorado law as giving
states the flexibility ``to deal with serious public safety issues
by appropriate means.''

 &HT;    The hand or the heart? Love stays alive in war-torn Africa
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ As his wife and four children watched,
Alpha Kanu extended his arm so that a rebel soldier could chop off
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   He did it to save his family from being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ordered by a man with a gun to lay my arm on a tree
stump,'' Kanu said. ``I followed the command.''
</P>
<P>
   A rebel soldier, no more than a teen-ager, raised his machete.
Kanu's wife started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' she shouted, and the rebels knocked her down and kicked
her in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The blade flashed down and caught Kanu in the middle of the
forearm, but his hand did not come off. The rebel chopped down
again, but the hand stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   And still Kanu held his arm extended.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel whacked again with the blade, and at last, mercifully,
Kanu's hand flew off. He got up and staggered off into the bush.
</P>
<P>
   He lives now with his family in an amputee camp in Freetown, the
capital of Sierra Leone, run by Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors
Without Borders), a Nobel Prize-winning group of volunteer doctors.
Nearly 200 other amputees live here, many missing their hands, some
missing their legs and a few missing two limbs or more.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people had their limbs amputated during a
campaign of terror waged by rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war.
Estimates run as high as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began as a way to punish those who elected
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1996. The rebels, who were fighting
to overthrow Kabbah, began to cut off the right hands of civilians
_ the hands that had cast the votes for Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Then the practice devolved into random terrorism, often
performed by children who had themselves been kidnapped and forced
to fight alongside the rebels. Some child soldiers dragged behind
them bags filled with human hands.
</P>
<P>
   The men in this amputee camp of tin-roofed, one-room homes
sometimes sit and brood, reliving their torture. The war has ended,
but they see no way to make a livelihood or return to farming or
make themselves whole again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much suffering,'' said Sahr Momodu Tarawally, the
camp's elected secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Tarawally lost a leg when he was shot in an ambush and could not
get medical treatment for weeks. By the time he was able to make
his way to a hospital, his leg had begun to rot.
</P>
<P>
   When his 10-year-old daughter found him in the hospital with his
leg amputated, she wept inconsolably for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry about it,'' Tarawally said. ``I'm bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more than bitterness here. In workshops,
international volunteers build prostheses as fast as they can, to
try to rehabilitate the maimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want these people to be able to do work on their own
again,'' said Abdul Kamara of Handicap International. Vietnam
veterans are turning their own pain to good use, helping with the
design of artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the camp, life goes on. Laundry hangs from the line.
Women cook, babies play, and children laugh.
</P>
<P>
   This amputee camp offers awful evidence of man's infinite
capacity for brutality. But it offers testament, too, to man's
infinite capacity for love.
</P>
<P>
   When a man wants so much to save his wife and children that he
stretches his out his arm and waits without flinching through three
whacks of a machete, here is valor beyond compare.
</P>
<P>
   And when you find such courage as this in Sierra Leone, you know
that even here, in such a cauldron of cruelty, there will always be
hope.

MANNESMANN IN TALKS WITH VIVENDI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS With ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Trying to ward off a hostile takeover by
Vodafone AirTouch PLC, Mannesmann AG is in talks with Vivendi of
France over a complex merger that would effectively give the German
company control over Vivendi's valuable telecommunications assets,
people close to the discussions said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's chief executive, Klaus Esser, has repeatedly said
that he would like to reach some sort of deal with Vivendi, a
conglomerate with businesses ranging from water systems to wireless
telephones. And talk of some sort of agreement have intensified in
the last week. Analysts have said that Mannesmann is most
interested in Vivendi's prize 44 percent stake in Cegetel, a
holding company that owns the French mobile phone company SFR and
Cegetel 7, a struggling competitor to France Telecom in fixed-line
communications.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal for Cegetel could run into obstacles from Cegetel's
other shareholders. British Telecommunications has a 26 percent
stake, while SBC Communications of San Antonio has a 15 percent
stake. British Telecommunications has clear reasons to object to
giving Mannesmann control, because Mannesmann recently acquired the
rival British mobile telephone company Orange PLC.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser, and Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman of
Vivendi, are discussing a complicated transaction that would allow
Mannesmann to take control of Cegetel without setting off
provisions that would allow the other Cegetel shareholders to block
it. A deal may be structured as a merger with Vivendi that would
not technically represent a change of ownership over the Cegetel
stake but would still allow Mannesmann to exercise effective
control over Cegitel. Mannesmann would then dispose of Vivendi's
businesses outside telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal for Vivendi, which has a current market value of
about $54 billion, would be complex, and it is unclear exactly what
terms are under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the obstacles to a merger are formidable and possibly
insurmountable. But if it were reached, the deal would allow Esser
to control a wireless network in France _ the one major gap in
Mannesmann's ambitions of a pan-European network. And a Vivendi
deal, or even an agreement to negotiate, would give Esser a
powerful new argument to persuade shareholders to reject Vodafone's
$140 billion takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mannesmann already owns wireless networks in three of
Europe's biggest markets _ Germany, Italy and Britain _ control of
Cegetel in France would give it an unrivaled position in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A deal would also strengthen Mannesmann's position in the
fixed-line telecommunications networks. Mannesmann competes against
Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Telecom Italia in Italy, and it is
building long-distance fiber optic networks across much of Europe.
Cegetel competes against France Telecom in fixed-line and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the talks cautioned that Mannesmann would
probably not be able to present any formal plan before Vodafone's
buyout offer expires on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Esser reiterated Wednesday that he was not planning a takeover
of Vivendi and that talks with Vivendi were not part of a ``white
knight'' defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that talks with Vivendi have ``nothing to do'' with
defending against Vodafone's hostile bid. But he made it clear he
is hoping for a deal of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it, rest assured, it will be in the best interests of
shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Messier of Vivendi, meanwhile, is clearly interested in a deal,
in part because Vivendi does not control any wireless networks in
any of Europe's other big markets, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi, formerly Compagnie Generale des Eaux, is an extremely
complicated conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   It owns water utilities and water-treatment companies around
Europe and in the United States, as well as a few electric
companies. It also owns stakes in scores of media companies,
including 49 percent of Canal Plus SA, Europe's biggest
pay-television company; 25 percent in B Sky B, the British
satellite pay-television company, and all of Havas SA, the French
advertising and publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal with Mannesmann would require separating out all the
water businesses and many of the media companies, which do not fit
with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very unlikely,'' said Jo Oliver, a
telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``Mannesmann would
love to do a deal with Vivendi, but I think it is highly unlikely
that Mannesmann would be able to do a deal in a form that satisfies
both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And it can be expected that the other shareholders of Cegetel
will try to have some say in any deal. Mannesmann has not yet
broached the issue with British Telecommunications, people close to
the talks said. But Mannesmann is counting on being able to
persuade British Telecom that aligning with Mannesmann in France
would be the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Vodafone is British Telecom's biggest competitor
in the British wireless market and would become immeasurably
stronger if it manages to acquire Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, shares of Mannesmann rose 3.8 percent, to 268
euros. Vodafone shares rose 2 percent in London, to 345.25 pence.
Vivendi shares were little changed in Paris.

THE BATTLE IN IOWA: WHEN IS A WIN NOT A WIN? JUST WAIT. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The presidential campaigns are running on two
tracks here: getting as many supporters as possible to Monday's
caucuses and convincing reporters that the result is better than
anyone should have expected.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas will have the most supporters at the respective
Democratic and Republican caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   By most dictionaries, that would be defined as ``winning.''
Indeed, Steve Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa campaign director, said he
would call it a ``win,'' with ``one more vote than the other guy.''
That definition was repeated, verbatim, by Eric Woolson, spokesman
for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iowa, the dictionary has not been a major factor in
defining winning. Second-place finishers like Gary Hart, with 17
percent of the Democratic vote in 1984, or Pat Robertson with 25
percent of the Republican vote in 1988 won accolades because they
exceeded expectations, while the winners, Walter Mondale (49
percent) and Bob Dole (37 percent) only met expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Where do these expectations come from? There is no single
``great expecter'' who sets the targets, although the polling by
The Des Moines Register comes close. Consider the Republicans. In
the Register's last poll, published Jan. 8, Bush led with 45
percent, Steve Forbes had 18 percent, Alan Keyes had 9 percent,
John McCain 8 percent, Gary Bauer 7 percent and Orrin Hatch 2
percent, with 11 percent unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Bush should be considered a failure if he gets 44
percent or less? No, say Woolner or Luke Roth, the campaign's
executive director. ``We took 31 percent up in Ames'' at the August
straw poll, Roth said. ``I hope we do a little better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said a reasonable target was the 37 percent that Dole
got in a six-candidate field in 1988. Woolner said he had heard
that some reporters, who consider only McCain a serious Bush rival,
were saying Bush ought to get 50 percent because McCain was not
competing. That is called trying to set expectations about
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The substantial Bush lead in this tame campaign has also made
the Bush campaign worry that some supporters may consider it
unnecessary to go out on Monday night, especially if the weather is
bad. So the campaign is broadcasting a radio advertisement in which
the state's popular Republican senator, Charles Grassley, asserts
that rivals are smearing Bush, and urges people to go out and vote
``if you're tired of mudslinging and name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that might produce a ``better than expected''
comes from the history of the Register's Republican polls. They
have forecast the winner's numbers pretty well, but they usually
understate one social conservative, like Robertson in 1988 or
Patrick Buchanan, who finished second with 23 percent to Dole's 26
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year there is no single most-conservative candidate,
although Forbes, Keyes and Bauer have all volunteered for the role.
The closest any of their campaigns has come to offering a forecast
is the comment by Steve Grubbs, Forbes' Iowa manager, who said,
``South of 20 percent, he goes wounded. We need to be north of 20
percent, there's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Grubbs is that rarest of modern politicians, an operative
without spin, that means he expects Forbes to get more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, that Register poll gave Gore a 54 percent
to 33 percent lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley, with 13 percent
uncommitted or undecided. The only real target that either side
offers comes from the Bradley campaign, which argues that it would
like to match the best that an insurgent candidate has ever done:
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's 31 percent against President Jimmy Carter
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman, Professor Cornel West of Harvard, said
Wednesday that such a result would be ``a victory of sorts.'' But
the 1980 outcome, even though it came against the background of the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and American hostages in Iran, was
deemed a devastating loss for Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is even less reasonable to view a humiliating defeat as a
victory than to buy into the Gore line that ``a win is a win.'' The
Gore people expect a lot more than a narrow victory. Even the
cautious Hildebrand allowed that 51 percent ``would be nice,'' and
to some backers, 60 percent seems within reach. Rob Tully, state
Democratic chairman and the rare outside voice to offer a guess,
said ``I just don't believe we'll see Al Gore under 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the margin, though, the Gore camp will try to make the
most of it. They are telling reporters that Bradley outspent them
here by half a million dollars because he thought he could pull off
an upset. If true, that would make any kind of loss ``worse than
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And both sides have built in a bad-weather excuse. Jim Farrell,
speaking for the Bradley campaign, said bad weather would
discourage the new voters whom they have enlisted who are
uncomfortable with the caucus process. Hildebrand said bad weather
would discourage elderly voters among whom Gore was strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Register plans to publish another poll this weekend.

 &HT;    CARE's task grows in Guinea
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUECKEDOU, Guinea _ Land cruisers bearing the familiar green
stenciled logo of CARE, the Atlanta-based relief organization,
rumble through the streets of this West African city of mosques and
markets.
</P>
<P>
   They travel between CARE's hillside offices in Gueckedou and the
refugee camps that dot the remote, wooded landscape near the border
separating Guinea and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   CARE arrived over two years ago, having agreed to
``temporarily'' help distribute food to hundreds of thousands of
refugees from Sierra Leone who crossed into Guinea seeking refuge
from their homeland's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's commitment was for six months and for service to only a
portion of the refugees. Then six months turned into a year, and
CARE assumed responsibility for more of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   This month the organization announced that this year it will be
the lead organization distributing food to the more than 250,000
refugees in 55 camps in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two senior CARE officials _ Jack Soldate, director of
CARE's West Africa programs, and Marge Tsitouris, director of
CARE's Emergency Group _ traveled from Atlanta to Gueckedou to
discuss the feeding operations. CARE is increasing its Guinean
staff by 60 people, to 163, and its international staff from five
to eight, said Allen Clinton, a CARE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   CARE officials had argued in negotiations with the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that if the United Nations
wanted a longer commitment, CARE would need more money. Not only
did staff need to be increased, but those who would stay a year or
more needed better housing than if they were staying only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   CARE has much experience in food distribution. The United
Nations decided the money was worth it. The budget for 2000 is $1.5
million, nearly double last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The system for helping refugees in Guinea offers an example of
how the international community cares for long-term refugees.
Sierra Leone's civil war, now theoretically at an end, began in
1991. Many refugees have been in Guinea for years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mad rush of international workers trying to help a
new flood of refugees in any way possible. Instead, the aid is
handled through interlocking contracts, with various organizations
responsible for different tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing it all is UNHCR, which manages the camps and
maintains the list of refugees eligible for aid. Much of the food
is delivered by the U.S. Food for Peace program to the port of
Conakry, Guinea's capital. The World Food Program, a U.N. agency,
trucks the food from Conakry to Gueckedou, a 12-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   A German developmental organization named GTZ trucks it from
Gueckedou to warehouses at the camps. Yet another organization is
responsible for distributing the correct amount to each eligible
family. That task had until recently been handled by a local
nongovernmental organization named Secados. But, U.N. and CARE
officials said, there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they didn't have experience in commodities
distributing,'' said Govindaraj Prabhu, CARE's operations manager
in Gueckedou. ``They are not transparent in their distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency'' is an international buzzword meaning that an
organization is not only fair, but that its operations are
observable so everyone can see they are fair.
</P>
<P>
   Zola Ngangu, a logistics officer for UNHCR in Gueckedou, said
Secados, being local, was vulnerable to pressure from local
officials to divert food. ``Some of the food disappeared, and the
food did not get to the beneficiaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under CARE, each eligible family is issued a card. Their name
also appears on a list. When they receive food _ often bulgur, peas
and oil _ both CARE's list and the family's card are marked. The
refugees' food is measured as they watch.
</P>
<P>
   Ngangu said that having CARE take over has made a world of
difference. The refugees are less suspicious and CARE is more
efficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the previous group took two or three weeks to do, CARE
does in five days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Archa Kamara, a Guinean CARE staffer distributing food at the
Koundou Lengo Bengo refugee camp, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees love this system because they get their food
faster and they are sure they are getting the correct amount,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for an outsider to determine how satisfied the
refugees are. Many, seeing a Westerner, say they have received no
food at all _ even as they sit on full bags of grain.
</P>
<P>
   But talking to them indicates that CARE may be here awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees are settled in. They say they miss their homeland,
but many have seen relatives killed before their eyes. Even though
a peace agreement between Sierra Leone's warring factions was
signed in July, refugees fear war may erupt again.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Mariama Umoroumusa, 44, whose husband is
dead and who fled to Guinea with five children after three others
were kidnapped by Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the food distribution, she said, she would not know
what to do or how to feed her children.

ETHEL KENNEDY'S NEPHEW CHARGED IN 25-YEAR-OLD SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Nearly 25 years after 15-year-old Martha
Moxley was bludgeoned to death on the lawn of her family home here,
police Wednesday charged Michael Skakel, her former friend,
neighbor and a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But in a legal twist that is sure to lead to further
complications in the long and highly publicized case, Skakel, 39,
was charged as a minor because he was only 15 at the time of the
October 1975 killing, in a gated section of this affluent
community.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were tight-lipped about their plans, but legal
experts said they would almost certainly file a motion to have
Skakel tried as an adult, a prospect that the law at the time of
the killing did not address. For now, Skakel's legal fate is up to
a Juvenile Court judge in Stamford who will decide whether the case
should be heard there or in Connecticut Superior Court, where the
maximum penalty for murder is 60 years in prison. If Skakel is
convicted as a juvenile, it is not even clear what penalty he would
face; the old law required that juvenile offenders be released at
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   After turning himself in Wednesday to Greenwich police, who
formally charged him with murder, Skakel posted a $500,000 bond and
exited the station smiling, released on his own recognizance. His
lawyer, Mickey Sherman, said Skakel was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrest was a major break in a murder case that has
long confounded local and state authorities and produced several
books written by journalists and detectives lured here in hope of
unearthing the clues that would crack the case. None did, although
a 1998 book written by Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police
detective, named Skakel as the likely killer.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of investigating, first by the Greenwich police
and later by the state's attorney in Bridgeport, Skakel and his
older brother Thomas emerged at the top of prosecutors' list of
suspects. Both have consistently denied any role in the crime, in
which Miss Moxley was beaten and stabbed with a golf club wielded
so powerfully against her that it shattered during the attack.
Police later traced the club, a six iron, back to a set owned by
Ann Reynolds Skakel, the boys' mother. Mrs. Skakel, the
sister-in-law of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, had
died two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel lives in an affluent gated complex in Hobe Sound,
Fla., with his wife, young son and father, Rushton Skakel. Michael
Skakel arrived in Greenwich by train Wednesday afternoon after
learning Tuesday night that prosecutors were planning to issue a
warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not guilty,'' Mr. Sherman said, adding that Skakel's
spirits were good, all things considered. ``Everyone's been telling
him this was going to happen for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Skakel will begin in earnest later this month
or early February, when he will become perhaps the first
39-year-old defendant to appear in Stamford Juvenile Court. There,
Judge Maureen Dennis will decide whether or not Skakel should be
charged as an adult in Superior Court, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   What may keep Skakel's case in Juvenile Court, though, is a 1975
Connecticut law that required judges to find ``probable cause''
before moving any case involving a defendant between the ages of 14
and 16 to an adult court. But legal experts say that under the
judicial philosophy governing state court decisions at that time,
juveniles were not typically tried for murder, but sent for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the law has since been revised to make the transfer of
juvenile murder defendants automatic, a legal battle is sure to
erupt about which version of the law will apply to Skakel.

8 YEARS LATER, NAVY RESTORES TIES TO TAILHOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy restored its ties with the Tailhook
Association on Wednesday, more than eight years after sexual
assaults and drunken debauchery at the group's annual convention
led to resignations and fines and tarnished the reputation of naval
aviators.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, the secretary of the Navy, Richard
Danzig, said the association's officers had assured him that the
group had changed and that there would never again be a repeat of
the behavior that came to symbolize sexual harassment of women in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association, named for the steel hook on jets that
enables them to land on aircraft carriers, is a private group based
in San Diego that acts as a sort of booster club for naval
aviation. Its members and activities have long been associated with
the Navy and its officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy withdrew its recognition in the wake of public furor
over the group's 35th annual convention in 1991, where 83 women,
some of them in the Navy, reported being assaulted or harassed in a
Las Vegas, Nev., hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook scandal roiled the Navy and the Marine Corps. More
than 100 officers were implicated, about half of whom were fined or
disciplined. The uproar led to the resignation of the secretary of
the Navy, Lawrence H. Garrett III, and the early retirement of the
chief on Naval operations, Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, both of whom had
attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tailhook officials, who have lobbied for years to win back
official recognition, welcomed the decision. ``We're glad to have
reconciled our differences with the Navy,'' said J.R. Davis, the
association's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact of the recognition by the Navy may be
in the group's membership roll. In the wake of the scandal, its
members steadily dropped, from 16,500 in 1990 to only 10,250 today,
as many active-duty officers avoided it. Although the Navy never
prohibited membership, it refused to send senior officers to
seminars and other events sponsored by the group.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of ties came four months after the Navy sent a
trio of officials to last year's convention in Sparks, Nev., near
Reno. Far from the raucous behavior of the past, that convention
appeared by all accounts to be a staid affair, with symposiums and
banquets overseen by a generally older crowd of men _ all that
remain since younger pilots have avoided the group.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with association officials, Danzig, pressed the
group to do more to increase the membership of women, but accepted
its argument that it was only recently that women were allowed to
pilot jets off aircraft carriers, an official said. Women today
make up nearly 14 percent of the Navy's 360,000 sailors and
officers, but less than 4 percent of its 6,800 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Though memories of the scandal have faded, some members of
Congress remain wary, saying that the Navy needs to be sure that
the association does not again become a vehicle for swaggering
machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important that we make sure _ that the Navy
makes sure _ that Tailhook is a comfortable place for women to
attend,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.

   They missed lunchtime congestion, and all but a small group was
safely ensconced in the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead by 11:30 a.m. No
being stopped by off-duty police directing traffic in front of fast
food places. It was a sanitized visit right down to the charter
aircraft in and out of Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 of the visitors had lunch with Gov. Roy Barnes at the
Governor's Mansion before joining the others at a meeting with
business leaders at the Ritz. Earlier, the group had toured the
Atlantic Steel site, which is being developed as a business and
housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes won acclaim for some of his plans last year when he spoke
to a group of governors about easing traffic woes and creating
green space through programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green space is something that people are certainly concerned
about,'' Hunt said of Barnes' plan to require counties, cities and
developers to set aside 20 percent of their land. ``They want to
have green space around them. Georgia wants to link those up so you
can follow them all around.''
</P>
<P>
   A developer liked what he saw. ``You hear so much about the
negatives of Atlanta,'' said Art Fields, president of Crescent
Resources, a Charlotte, N.C.-based development firm. ``But the city
seems to be doing things to correct that.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lou Ward, chairwoman of the Wake County, N.C., Commission,
said part of the group's goal was to make certain that places such
as Charlotte and Raleigh _ Wake's county seat and the state capital
_ don't ``get where Atlanta is.''
</P>
<P>
   In both North Carolina and Georgia, rural areas are being eaten
up by subdivisions and strip malls. Urban areas are stuffed with
cars and smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are dealing with now, you have it on a much larger
scale,'' said Harry Baultch, senior project manager for DJB
Construction in Charlotte. ``There's no silver bullet here. The
question is how do you make it work?''
</P>
<P>
   While North Carolina looks south to Georgia for guidance on
sprawl and other traffic-related problems, it has an enviable
record on a number of education and economic development
initiatives. School officials flock to North Carolina to study its
``Smart Start'' early childhood education program, a key Hunt
initiative.

CLINTON PROPOSES $110 BILLION HEALTH CARE PLAN

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed Wednesday to spend $110 billion over
the next decade on initiatives to help at least 5 million people
get health insurance. In so doing, he basically endorsed the
approach favored by Vice President Al Gore in the Democratic debate
over how best to cover the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his proposals _ a package of incremental
steps to cover discrete groups _ would be the biggest public
investment in health insurance since the creation of Medicare in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his proposals at the White House, Clinton returned
to a pivotal theme of his career, an issue on which he won the
presidency in 1992 and then ran aground two years later. Sobered by
that experience, Clinton is now proposing a policy that might be
described as incrementalism writ large, a grab bag of proposals
intended to provide insurance for parents in poverty and for other
specific groups.
</P>
<P>
   The president, like Gore, would expand existing programs like
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program, while
Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, would dismantle and replace much
of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income
people. Under Bradley's plan, the federal government would
subsidize the premiums of low-income people so they could buy
insurance through the program that now provides coverage for
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new element of Clinton's package, which faces an
uncertain future in Congress, is a proposal to let parents enroll
in these programs with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the parents of the children covered in our Children's
Health Insurance Program are themselves uninsured,'' Clinton said.
``That's why, as the vice president has urged, I propose to allow
parents to enroll in the same health insurance program that now
covers their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the president's proposals become law, they
will influence the debate over health care in this year's
presidential campaign. Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health
Insurance Association of America, said Republican candidates for
president had ``basically ignored'' the issue of the uninsured but
would have to address it because it was a critical issue for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that a Congress controlled by Republicans
would make a political gift to Gore by approving his proposals or
adopting the president's package intact. But Republicans said they
would address the problem of the uninsured. The ``patient's bill of
rights'' passed by the House in October includes major tax breaks
to encourage the purchase of private health insurance, so the issue
will be discussed when House and Senate negotiators meet soon to
try to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is, at the same time, juggling other major health care
proposals, and he has not publicly defined his priorities. He has
proposed a $28 billion package of subsidies for long-term care and
an expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs, at a cost
exceeding $118 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While adopting some of Gore's proposals, the president did not
criticize Bradley. Indeed, Clinton said, ``I am elated that health
care is an issue in the campaign.'' And he said the dynamics of an
election year would put pressure on Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public cares a lot about health care and they're talking a
lot about it,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the health care proposals would
figure prominently in Clinton's State of the Union address on Jan.
27. The speech will include other proposals floated by the White
House in recent weeks. The disclosures are part of a seasonal
ritual in which the president tries to build interest in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   At least 44 million Americans are uninsured. The number has
risen by more than 4.5 million since 1993, when Clinton took office
promising health insurance for all.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and advocates, from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Families USA on the left to the Health Insurance
Association of America on the right, are now clamoring for
incremental steps to halt the increase in the number of uninsured.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped to collaborate with ``Harry and Louise,''
the television voice of the insurance industry, on a campaign to
expand coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, the president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, said, ``We can find a lot of common ground on proposals to
cover the uninsured, particularly the neediest.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress provided nearly $40 billion for the Children's
Health Insurance Program over 10 years. The program got off to a
slow start, with states spending less than $1.5 billion in the
first two years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton asked Congress to provide $50 billion more to
subsidize coverage for parents whose children are already eligible
for Medicaid or the children's program. To gain access to this
money, states would first have to cover children in families with
incomes up to twice the official poverty level, as 30 states have
done.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after five years, states would have to cover
parents in families with incomes up to the poverty level ($16,700 a
year for a family of four).
</P>
<P>
   Matt D. Salo, director of health legislation at the National
Governors' Association, said many governors wanted to enroll
parents and children in the same health insurance program. But, he
said, governors have never liked federal mandates and requirements.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of the $110 billion sought by Clinton would be spent
on tax credits and new insurance options for people who have had
particular difficulty getting coverage. These include people 55 to
64 years of age, workers between jobs, employees of small
businesses and former welfare recipients now working at low-paying
jobs.

 &HT;    Astronomers, meteorologists forecast howling good total lunar
eclipse
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Wolf Moon falls prey to Earth's shadow tonight.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather cooperates, anyone who ventures outdoors will be
treated to the splendid sight _ a total lunar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Earth's shadow will slowly begin to cover the moon at 10:01 p.m.
EST. The eclipse becomes total at 11:05 p.m., when the moon's disk
may take on a variety of red and orange hues. The bright moon will
begin emerging from the shadow at 12:22 a.m. By 1:25 a.m., the
eclipse will be complete.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for metro Atlanta calls for mostly clear
and colder skies tonight, with lows in the mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a good eclipse for Atlanta, very visible for us
here,'' Fernbank Science Center astronomer April Whitt said. ``The
full moon in winter is higher in the sky, and so the eclipse won't
be obscured by tall trees and buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first total lunar eclipse visible in Atlanta
since 1996, when Earth's shadow temporarily hid the Harvest Moon of
September. January's full moon is known as the Wolf Moon, because
it occurs during the month when howling wolves once roamed the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is full and passes through
some portion of Earth's shadow. When it passes through part of the
shadow, called the umbra, it becomes a partial eclipse; when it is
darkened entirely by Earth's shadow, the eclipse becomes total.
</P>
<P>
   Even in full shadow, the moon's face is dimly lit by stray
sunlight that is heavily filtered and bent by Earth's atmosphere.
At this time, the moon can take on a range of colors _ from dark
brown and brown and blood red to bright orange and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Lunar eclipses have long been the stuff of myth and legend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands of years ago, the Egyptians believed that a huge sow
swallowed the moon entirely and then disgorged it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even today in the Balinese town of Gianyar, statues of gods
and demons tell the tale of the evil Kala Rau, a disembodied head
who periodically swallows Dewi Ratih, the beautiful moon spirit.
Because Kala Rau has no body and thus no digestive system, it must
quickly regurgitate the moon and allow it to shine again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ancient people also learned from eclipses. Pythagoras, the
Greek astronomer and mathematician who lived more than 2,500 years
ago, learned for the first time that the Earth is round as he
watched the curved shape of our planet move across the moon during
eclipses.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a lunar eclipse may have saved Christopher Columbus and
his crew during his fourth voyage to America. When he and his men
were stranded on Jamaica in Feb. 29, 1504, the island's people
refused to provide food. But Columbus, using his tables for the
times of lunar eclipses, warned that his god was angry with the
people and would cause the moon to disappear. When the eclipse
occurred, the terrified islanders promised to provision the ship.
Satisfied with enough food to get his crew and ship back to Europe,
Columbus said his god was no longer mad and would let the moon
shine again.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, the phases of the moon and how much light it
reflected had a huge influence on people.
</P>
<P>
   Most early calendars, for instance, were based on lunar cycles
that governed planting and harvesting of crops.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder then, says Whitt, that most people are quite
intrigued and anxious by anything that involves the moon. ``Now we
have a total lunar eclipse,'' Whitt said. ``And this may be the
best show of all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Jordan didn't say, ``I'm back'' to herald
his latest return to basketball Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't tease anyone by practicing with his old team.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Jordan is returning as a part-owner and top
basketball executive of the underachieving Washington Wizards, who
perennially disappoint their patriarch, Abe Pollin, who built them
a downtown arena fans rarely pack.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jordan must be a turnaround artist in a pinstriped suit, a
motivator, a talent evaluator, a free agent signer and a master of
the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new to me, being in a city to give my support to
another team,'' Jordan said at a news conference held on the team's
practice court in the basement of the MCI Center. ``Normally, I'm
in support of the Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls are the moribund 6-29 team that Jordan led, in a
better incarnation, to six NBA championships. Although he is now
the president of basketball operations of the Wizards, Jordan will
not leave Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He will commute from his adopted hometown. It is a variation on
Red Auerbach running the Boston Celtics from his Washington
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here as much as it takes to turn this team around,''
he said, looking out on several hundred reporters and employees of
the Wizards, the Washington Capitals hockey team and the arena, who
jammed the ramps leading to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The anointing of Jordan as the executive savior also brought out
the District Mayor Anthony Williams. ``He will show our children
what it takes to be an executive,'' Williams said. ``He will
electrify the city.''
</P>
<P>
   And he won't even be in uniform. Jordan's mere appearance is
enough to haul out a collection of superlatives. Pollin and Ted
Leonsis, whose group sold an unspecified part of its 44 percent
stake in the team to Jordan, are persuaded that Jordan's obsession
with winning translates into a deft front office touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, God, someday, maybe he would be part of what I
do,'' Pollin said. ``The guy is the best of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Leonsis: ``The guy is the absolute class, winning executive
in the world. You're crazy not to go after him if he's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Their belief is a leap of faith, considering how few superstars
have made great executives. Jerry West of the Los Angeles Lakers is
one of the few to make the transition. But West, who has remade the
Lakers several times, never had to resuscitate a team as
downtrodden as the Wizards (12-27), whose top players, Juwan Howard
and Rod Strickland, have performed below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is underachieving,'' Jordan said. He was kind. He
never said who was not performing up to their abilities. He has
watched them by satellite, but insists that his assessments will
not be based on his home viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be changes, it can be motivation,'' he said, adding:
``We have a good team. Do we have a championship quality team? That
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards last won their only NBA title in 1978, when they
were the Baltimore Bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan offered glimpses into his boardroom style. It sounded
like the tough-talking cajolery he employed to push _ and outrage _
some of his Bulls' teammates. ``My job is to evaluate everything
involved, and if that means everyone worries that their heads will
be chopped off, then they'll go out and do their jobs,'' he said,
responding to how long he will employ Gar Heard, who is midway
through a rocky first season as head coach of the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' he said, a little ominously, ``will be
dispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he will not play for the team _ no matter how
desperate the straits become _ but he will practice. Oh, he will
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best evaluation I can make of a player is to look in his
eyes and see how scared they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know if Heard would cotton to the 10-time league
scoring champion spending time on the practice court. And it
doesn't sound like he cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm his boss, so I can do it,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Heard could only agree with Jordan's tao of hoops management.
``By him getting on the practice court,'' he said, ``it'll make the
players go that much harder. Hopefully, the players will be much
more fired up with Michael here.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new life as a part-owner and executive of the Wizards
is an ironic twist to labor-management relations. In November,
1998, during the owners' lockout of players, Jordan and Pollin
argued.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Pollin, the senior owner in the NBA, said, ``I'm
not going to let Michael Jordan or anybody else tell me to sell my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in fact, Pollin sold. Last May, he sold 100 percent
of the Capitals and a minority stake in the Wizards, the WNBA's
Mystics, MCI Center and US Airways Arena to Lincoln Holdings, which
Leonsis created with his partners Jon Ledecky and Dick Patrick for
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Jordan's negotiations to own a piece of the
Charlotte Hornets and run their basketball operations collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last September, Leonsis contacted Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about how Michael's an AOL user; he likes new media,''
said Leonsis, president of AOL Interactive Properties Group. ``So
we met, we started talking and I said, `Tell me what you're
interested in. He said, `I want to win more championships. I want
equity. I want to run the basketball operations.'''
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of negotiations, including one all-day session
before Christmas at Pollin's home, they came to the framework of a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   And Leonsis sounded Wednesday as if selling a piece of Lincoln
Holdings to Jordan brought him a bigger return on his money than
AOL stock. No one would describe Jordan's stake or how much he paid
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's magnetic presence, track record as a player and
reputation for being a de facto coach appeared to be plenty
investment for Leonsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is the most valuable sports franchise in the world,''
he said. ``You talk to him and he makes me feel I can slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating twist to Jordan's ascension to ownership and
management is how he will deal with his agent, David Falk, the
chairman of the fast-growing SFX Sports Group. Two Wizards, Howard
and Strickland, are Falk clients.
</P>
<P>
   Can, or should, Jordan negotiate new contracts across a table
from Falk?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue I've brought up,'' Jordan said, ``and we'll
confer with the league to see what's allowable and what's not
allowable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is mindful of the impression that Falk has been his
puppetmaster for 15 years. ``I'm sure people will think David Falk
and his whole agency will run the team, but he works for me, I
don't work for him,'' he said. ``He can certainly be a pain, but
he's a great pain to have on your side. I look forward to his
advice.'' Falk, who attended the news conference, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McIntyre, an NBA spokesman, said the new relationship
between Falk and Jordan is not one the league has rules about.
``It's unchartered waters,'' he said. ``We'll have to figure how to
deal with it.''

 &HT;    S.C. governor says move flag off Statehouse
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Saying the Confederate flag fight is sapping
South Carolinians of ``too much of our time and energy,'' Gov. Jim
Hodges urged legislators Wednesday to remove the controversial
banner from atop the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``A divisive debate over the Confederate flag can't build one
school or buy one textbook,'' the first-term Democrat told South
Carolina's House and Senate, assembled for the governor's State of
the State address.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges suggested the Confederate flag, the last in the nation to
fly atop a state Capitol, be moved to ``a place of historical
significance on the Statehouse grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be ``an honorable solution (that) will teach our
children a valuable lesson about resolving our differences in an
atmosphere of mutual respect,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute speech that called for the Legislature to declare
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as an official state
holiday, Hodges concluded by saying he envisions ``a South Carolina
no longer troubled by long-running conflicts over the Confederate
flag.'' An estimated 46,000 flag opponents rallied at the
Statehouse on Monday, vowing to honor an NAACP tourism boycott of
South Carolina until the Legislature votes to furl the banner.
Nearly two weeks ago, 6,000 flag supporters called for the
Legislature to leave the banner alone. A leading flag supporter,
state Sen. Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston) said Hodge's speech would
do little to resolve the dispute. Wednesday, organizers of Monday's
King Day rally against the flag reiterated that they would oppose
relocating the flag to the Confederate soldiers' monument,
prominently located on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not saying they can't find a nice museum to put this
flag in,'' said David Swinton, president of Benedict College, a
historically black college in Columbia which helped organize
Monday's rally.

JUDGE NOT OBLIGED TO CLEAR UP INSTRUCTION CONFUSION, TOP COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS, SCOTUS-ABORTION) 
(lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a judge
presiding over a death penalty case was not obliged to clear up the
jury's confusion over a crucial sentencing instruction. The 5-4
decision upheld the death sentence of a Virginia man convicted in
1993 of killing a state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors considering whether to sentence Lonnie Weeks Jr. to
death or to life in prison had asked the judge to clarify whether a
death sentence would be mandatory if they found that the state had
proven either of two ``aggravating circumstances.'' In response,
the judge simply told them to reread the instruction he had already
given on that point. Two hours later, the jury returned with a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday dealt with a jury instruction that the
Supreme Court had already found to be valid in another case from
Virginia that was decided two years ago. But Wednesday's ruling
could have more general significance beyond Virginia for how
attentively trial judges and appellate courts should respond to
indications that jurors do not understand aspects of their task.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Weeks told the justices that ``studies show that
juror misunderstanding of instructions is alarmingly common,'' and
that the case presented ``a problem of special and recurring
importance to the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   A study to be published this spring in the Cornell Law Review on
the instruction at issue in this case showed that when mock jurors
were given the instruction without the clarification the real
jurors had sought, 41 percent said, incorrectly, that they were
required to impose a death sentence if they found an aggravating
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion Wednesday, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said there was at worst a ``slight possibility'' that the
jury mistakenly believed a death sentence to be mandatory once the
state proved the existence of an aggravating factor.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions that the jury was told to reread said that
``you may fix the punishment of the defendant at death'' if the
state proved beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of two
aggravating circumstances: that the defendant would continue to be
a serious threat to society, or that the crime was ``outrageously
or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.'' The instructions said
further that ``if you believe from all the evidence that the death
penalty is not justified,'' the jurors should impose life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors' question asked the judge: ``If we believe that
Lonnie Weeks Jr. is guilty of at least one of the alternatives,
then is it our duty as a jury to issue the death penalty?'' The
judge replied, in writing, ``See second paragraph of Instruction
No. 2.'' He refused a defense lawyer's request to amplify his
response.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Wednesday, Rehnquist said that ``a jury is
presumed to understand a judge's answer to its question.'' He
added, ``To presume otherwise would require reversal every time a
jury inquires about a matter of constitutional significance,
regardless of the judge's answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice said the fact that the jurors then spent two
hours in further deliberation showed that they were weighing the
mitigating and aggravating evidence and were not simply imposing a
death sentence automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy
and Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion, Weeks vs.
Angelone, No. 99-5746.
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens,
disagreed vigorously with the majority's factual analysis of the
case as well as with its legal conclusion. Stevens said there was a
``virtual certainty'' that the jury was confused, and there was
``no reason to believe'' the judge's answer had resolved the
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said it was just as likely that the jurors spent the
next two hours continuing to debate the meaning of the instruction
that had confused them. He noted that the transcript reported that
as members of the jury were polled, most of them were ``in tears,''
a notation Stevens said he had never seen before in reviewing a
transcript of a sentencing proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affirmed a ruling last year by the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., which had rejected the inmate's
petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Virginia Supreme Court
had upheld the conviction and sentence in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks came within two hours of execution on Sept. 1, when the
justices granted a last-minute stay of execution and accepted his
appeal for argument.

 GREENWICH, Conn.: to Skakel.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the case is kept in Juvenile Court, the court will probably
have little if any power to punish him, said David Rosen, a
lecturer at Yale and a senior research associate at the Yale Law
School's Child Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to punish him would be through a transfer to the
Superior Court, but a transfer may not be a maneuver available to
the prosecutor,'' depending on how the judge interprets the law,
Rosen said Wednesday. Under the law as it stood in 1975, he added,
``the only thing this guy can be prosecuted for is being a juvenile
delinquent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, Rosen added, ``may be walking into a thicket that
there is no way out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Keefe, a criminal defense lawyer in New Haven, said
prosecutors most likely would not have hunted down Skakel if they
did not expect his case eventually to be heard in Superior Court,
which could mete out a prison sentence if he is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's going to be on the judge to transfer him out of
Juvenile Court and have him tried as an adult,'' he said.
``Mickey's job,'' he said, referring to Skakel's lawyer, ``is going
to be to get the law that applied 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As Skakel was turning himself in to the police in Greenwich
Wednesday, Dorthy Moxley, the mother of the slain girl, sat beaming
next to a painting of Martha in the dining room of her New Jersey
home.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding her confusion over the legal complexities involved in
trying Skakel, Mrs. Moxley said she was hoping for a trial, any
trial. ``Wild horses couldn't keep me away,'' she said. Since
Tuesday, when she first heard there was a new development in the
case, Mrs. Moxley said she had been a bundle of nerves. ``When my
husband died 12 years ago,'' she said, ``we thought there was no
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, John Moxley, Martha's older brother and now a
commercial real estate specialist with Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, said,
``This will never be behind us and it will always be part of the
fabric of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder charge Wednesday is the result of a grand jury
investigation into Martha Moxley's killing that began in June 1998.
The sole grand jurist, Bridgeport Superior Court Judge George Thim,
found probable cause to issue Wednesday's arrest warrant for
Skakel, said Jonathan Benedict, the state's attorney in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   But in another strange aside to Skakel's arrest Wednesday,
prosecutors refused to identify him as the object of their arrest
warrant, even though Sherman, Skakel's lawyer, had already said his
client was en route to Greenwich to be arrested. Because Skakel was
a juvenile at the time of the 1975 murder, prosecutors are still
barred from officially revealing his identity or commenting on any
aspect of the case, said Jonathan Benedict, the Connecticut state's
attorney in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until those rights are either waived or a court tells us
otherwise, it is the obligation of my office to honor those
rules,'' he said in a curt statement to a packed room of reporters
and photographers at the Holiday Inn in Bridgeport on Wednesday
morning. Then Benedict stalked out of the room, followed by a pack
of reporters seeking the slightest explanation of the next steps in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lubin, a lawyer for Rushton Skakel, Michael Skakel's
father, said father and son, along with Michael Skakel's wife and
their young son, had been living together in Florida for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel had recently been working for a charitable
organization, Lubin said, but he declined to say which one. The
elder Skakel, 74 and in declining health, remains convinced that
his son is innocent, Lubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ the prosecutors, reporters, book writers and private
investigators who have wrestled with the detail of the crime _ will
no doubt be anxiously awaiting the decision about which court will
eventually hear Skakel's case.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Dumas, author of the 1998 book, `A Wealth of Evil: The
True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America's Richest
Community,'' came to Benedict's news conference Wednesday. ``Even
though everyone said this would come to pass,'' he said to a bank
of reporters, ``I'm still a little stunned by it because it's been
24 years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the Republican presidential campaign's battle over
tax-cutting escalating daily, Sen. John McCain demanded Wednesday
that Gov. George W. Bush stop running a commercial attacking his
tax cut plan, while Bush advisers visited McCain headquarters to
scrutinize his tax calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the highlights of a campaign day that veered from the
serious to the surreal to the silly.
</P>
<P>
   The ad at the center of the controversy repeats the line of
attack against McCain that Bush began at the Des Moines debate
Saturday when he charged that one small aspect of McCain's tax cut
proposal, which would repeal tax exemptions for certain
employer-provided fringe benefits, would in effect raise taxes by
$40 billion and hurt working people.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who hopscotched from campaign events in New York to
Hartford to Boston across the day, insisted that this was not true
and called on Bush to stop running the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a sign of some desperation because they are looking
at the same polls we are,'' he said of the Bush campaign. ``They
know it's inaccurate and we know its inaccurate so it should be
taken down.'' He also released a letter from outside fiscal experts
to back his contention that his proposal would cost less than $4
billion and would affect employers, not employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, campaigning in New Hampshire, did not back down. ``All
I'm doing is talking about what he put down on paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at a high school in Plaistow, N.H., Bush
also sought to raise doubts about McCain's grasp of domestic
policy, saying, ``If in fact he's changed his plan, I look forward
to seeing what the change is _ for the third or fourth time. I
believe it's important when someone runs for president to lay out a
plan that is consistent, that will stand the test of political
scrutiny.'' He added, ``That's what I've done. That's what a leader
does.''
</P>
<P>
   The events capped a day that brought a sharp new tone of
acrimony to the struggle for the Republican presidential nomination
just before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. It
narrowed the race to one issue: taxes and how best to cut them. In
fact, there are large ideological differences behind the competing
tax-cut policies of the two rivals who have emerged as the leading
candidates in the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Like his party's most avid tax-cutters, Bush has proposed a
sweeping five-year, $485 billion tax cut that reduces tax rates
across the board. McCain, betting that even Republican primary
voters no longer favor tax cutting during prosperous times, has
called for a tax cut of just under $240 billion to allow billions
of dollars of the federal surplus to be devoted to Social Security,
Medicare and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the big ideas were not at the center of the debate. Instead,
the Bush campaign has shifted the focus to a more arcane dispute.
McCain included in his plan measures to close or eliminate
corporate tax benefits worth more than $151 billion over five
years. And Bush picked one of these to fight over, the tax
treatment of some fringe benefits _ how much money it would raise
and who it would affect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is a sign of is an attempt to divert the debate from
what it is really about,'' McCain said in New York City, ``what do
you do with the surplus.'' Later in the day, he said that Bush had
reneged on their handshake agreement not to run negative ads. ``I
think it's a negative ad,'' McCain said carefully, ``but I don't
think it's an attack ad. That's parsing, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator got some unlikely support from the Democratic
National Committee, which said that Bush had ``repeatedly whined''
about attacks from Steve Forbes and was now using ``the exact same
type of attack on McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain left himself open to criticism that his numbers did not
add up by originally providing little detail in his proposals.
Bush's aides said that if McCain's fringe benefit proposal did not
raise $40 billion then his plan would not really work.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said education and health benefits were exempted and the
change would stop employers from deducting the costs of such things
as golf clubs, spa memberships and parking.
</P>
<P>
   But not only did Bush repeat his charges, he pointedly used
people from McCain's home state to amplify them. The campaign
released attacks on McCain's proposal by five Arizona state
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if Senator McCain spent a little more time at home he
would understand that we are not talking about country club
memberships _ the government already taxes those _ but rather an
education for a single mom or a life insurance policy for a
hard-working father,'' said State Senator Rusty Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest political theater of the day came about after
Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, told Karl Rove, the chief
strategist for the Bush campaign, on ``Good Morning, America,''
that the McCain campaign would be glad to answer any lingering
questions the Bush camp had about his tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in two of Bush's tax advisers, Lawrence Lindsey
and Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, traveling to McCain's national
campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign spokesman, welcomed Lindsey and
Portman with a tray of doughnuts and a sheaf of economic proposals,
and he gave each of them a copy of McCain's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey and Portman then argued in front of television cameras
with Schnur and John Raidt, another McCain aide.

 &HT;    Jordan signs on to lead Wizards
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The startling business partnership of old-time
Washington owner Abe Pollin, basketball great Michael Jordan and
super-agent David Falk would have been unthinkable, even a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a celebrated meeting last winter during the NBA lockout,
Jordan lectured Pollin, telling him to sell if he could not compete
for talent and make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Jordan was ``Mr. Union,'' Hawks president Stan
Kasten said, ``I expect his views will be altered. Of course, Isiah
Thomas and Magic Johnson underwent similar evolutions,'' with
Toronto and the Lakers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very curious about that myself,'' said Dikembe Mutombo,
union vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, the agent for many of the league's best players, including
current Wizards starters Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland, has been
Pollin's harshest critic over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Pollin sold his entire hockey interests and 44
percent of the Wizards to Ted Leonsis, who brought Jordan into the
organization as director of basketball operations. Just months
earlier, the retired Bulls star failed to gain control over the
Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will not own a piece of the Wizards, but he will have an
option to buy a piece of the team upon the death of Pollin or in
the event Pollin sells his remaining interest. Leonsis has right of
first refusal to become the majority owner. It is believed that
Pollin wants to retain his majority stake until after the 2001 NBA
All-Star Game in Washington's MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will report to Pollin only. Everyone else in the
organization will report to Jordan. Falk's official role, if any,
has not been spelled out. The changes are not expected to result in
any firings in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The club's financial obligation to Howard and Strickland will
take up a sizable chunk of Washington's $52 million payroll for
next season. Howard, who's averaging 14 points per game, will go to
$18.75 million. The next season, he goes to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards have been among the league's worst teams for more
than a decade; they failed to win a playoff game in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jordan's boosters is Hawks assistant Stan Albeck, who
coached him in Chicago in 1985-86. ``When he was young, he would
take his beating in any kind of game, in backgammon, whatever,''
Albeck said. ``But once he learned that game, he would kill you. If
you challenged him, he'd kill you. I'm not so sure if he ran for
president he couldn't be elected. That's how he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to go at this with all of his energies, just like
he played,'' Albeck said. ``He'll find some disappointments along
the way, battling the salary cap, but he's got a resolve unlike any
I've seen. If there's a way, he'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo said he is most concerned that Jordan will abandon the
cause of the players and throw himself into the owners' camp with
the same zeal that made him a great player.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan indicated a change of sympathies in his news conference,
saying he wanted the Wizards players to ``accept responsibility for
the salaries they're being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will go totally against us,'' Mutombo said,
``but I am very interested to see if he ever pays a player the same
salary ($30 million) he received in his last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who won six titles with Jordan and
the Bulls, said: ``He'll make mistakes like any other businessman.
He's been associated with so many people that have been successful,
it's hard to believe he's not going to latch onto something
successful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce wondered how Jordan would
deal with adversity. ``I can't tell Michael Jordan to have
patience. I have none. If I'm nuts because I can't control a game,
how's he going to be? I don't drive home after games so I don't
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston coach and president Rick Pitino said Jordan faces an
enormous task. ``My advice to him would be to stay on the golf
course,'' Pitino said. ``If his motive is to be a businessman and
to make money, I would stay with commercials. If his motive is to
be a part of professional basketball, then he would add to the game
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls general manager Jerry Krause was openly contemptuous:
``Maybe Michael thinks he can inspire the Wizards to win big
without making any moves.''

PLAYERS EXPECTING JORDAN'S AURA TO FOLLOW HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-JORDAN-WIZARDS) 
(rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year, Scott Burrell was an up-close-and-personal witness
to the incredible competitiveness, mental toughness and work ethic
that made Michael Jordan the most celebrated athlete of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The experience gave Burrell a championship ring and a world's
worth of respect for the man known as the greatest player in
history. It also convinced him that nothing, not even a seemingly
insurmountable salary-cap situation, will keep Jordan from turning
the Washington Wizards into winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how soon he'll do it, but he's going to make them
competitive,'' said Burrell, a New Jersey Nets forward who played
the 1997-98 season with Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. ``And when
they're up on top, it's going to be because of him, because he'll
bring that enthusiasm, that hard-working mentality in there, and he
won't accept them losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Knicks-Nets game at Madison Square Garden Wednesday
night, players, coaches and members of management generally agreed
that Jordan's success on the court would follow him into the front
office as head of basketball operations and part owner of the
Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Layden, the general manager of the Knicks, compared Jordan
to Jerry West, the star guard who has had great success in the
front office for the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very intelligent guy,'' Layden said of Jordan. ``He
has unbelievable competitive instincts. He reminds me a lot of
Jerry West. It wouldn't surprise me to look back 10 or 20 years
from now and see Michael having similar success. I'm just happy he
didn't wake up and say he wanted to be the Knicks' GM.''
</P>
<P>
   While Layden's humor is evident, there is nothing funny for the
Knicks once again finding themselves in competition with Jordan,
who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jordan, his Wizards (12-27) currently at the bottom of the
Atlantic Division standings, is back in the Eastern Conference,
competing with both the Knicks and the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one Knick was not too worried about Jordan's
presence. Latrell Sprewell said Jordan will have a tougher time
fixing the Wizards than he had foiling opponents during his playing
days.
</P>
<P>
   With aging or underachieving players such as Juwan Howard, Mitch
Richmond and Rod Strickland sporting long and lucrative contracts,
the Wizards are about $20 million above the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult in a situation like that, where there is
a lot of pressure to turn things around,'' Sprewell said. ``I don't
think it's going to be an easy task for Mike. But he's found a way
to be successful at most everything he has put his hands on, so
maybe he has the golden touch there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lynam, the Nets' assistant coach who served as Washington's
head coach from 1994 to 1996, laughed heartily upon hearing that
Jordan would practice with the Wizards. He has no doubt that it
will make an immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Lynam said of Jordan's announcement that he
will scrimmage against his players. ``He may be the only one of the
ex-players that these guys would hold in awe for many reasons: yes,
the greatest player that ever played; yes, he has six championship
rings and maybe would have eight if he didn't decide to go play
another sport. And on top of that, he's the marketing king of the
world. His influence will be tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Detroit Pistons, who play the Nets at the
Meadowlands Thursday night, said that free agents will look
favorably on signing with Washington solely because of Jordan's
presence.
</P>

   ``If the greatest player and competitor in the world wants you,
it's something you've got to consider,'' said Pistons forward
Jerome Williams, who can exercise an option to become a free agent
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jud Buechler, who rode Jordan's coattails to a couple of
championship rings as a member of the Bulls, said: ``If you're a
free agent and Michael Jordan calls you up at home that means more
than most of these GMs wanting you. It'd be hard to say no to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirsad Turkcan, the Knicks forward who was playing in Turkey
while Jordan was winning the last of his championships, nicely
summed up the views of the players, saying, ``Michael is the
king.''

 &HT;    Africa ready to show it deserves World Cup
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past 25 years, African players have made their
way into the upper echelons of European club play, and a few
national sides have dazzled in the World Cup. But it's only every
two years that the best players and teams get to play close to
home, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The 22nd African Nations Cup begins Saturday in Nigeria and
Ghana with more than continental pride on the line. Some people see
a successful staging of the 16-nation event, which concludes in
Lagos on Feb. 13, as critical for Africa's hopes of landing the
2006 World Cup. But the former could be a major piece of work,
after the decision by the African Football Confederation last fall
to move the tournament out of poorly funded and disorganized
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Morocco urged its fellow African FIFA
delegates to choose between it or South Africa, which also is one
of five finalists, to present a unified front before voting this
summer. While FIFA boss Sepp Blatter publicly has favored having
the World Cup in Africa for the first time, there are fears that
splintered bids could undermine that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous value of top African players is unprecedented, and
it's led to some familiar club-vs.-country riffs. The biggest
battle has been between the Nigerian federation and Arsenal over
1999 African player of the year Nwankwo Kanu, a star on the Super
Eagles' gold medal showing in the Atlanta Olympics. The English
club wanted to use Kanu during an F.A. Cup replay against Leicester
City this week but has been ordered to release him. South Africa's
young star forward Benni McCarthy supposedly has ``retired'' from
international play, probably under pressure from his club team,
Spain's Celta Vigo, but he is being asked to remain available just
in case.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, which was eliminated early in France two years ago,
still has a wealth of talent, enough to win just its second African
Nations Cup crown. Also on hand are midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha of
Paris-St Germain and strikers Victor Ikpeba of Borussia Dortmund
and Jonathan Akpoborie of Wolfsburg, along with new AC Milan
defender Taribo West. But the Super Eagles are drawn into a tough
Group D that includes Morocco, with Deportivo La Coruna standout
Nourredine Naybet and ex-teammates Moustapha Hadji and Youssef
Chippo, now excelling at Coventry City.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana boasts defender Sami Kuffour of Bayern Munich and
Olympiakos striker Peter Ofori-Quaye, but in Group A they must deal
with Cameroon, which features Liverpool defender Rigobert Song and
West Ham forward Marc-Vivien Foe.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Egypt is favored in Group C, but Zambia and
Burkina Faso are respectable. South Africa is tipped to advance out
of Group B. Arriving in top form from England are Leeds defender
Lucas Radebe and newly signed Manchester United defender Quinton
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE FOR CORINTHIANS
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's road back from the painful 1998 World Cup finals loss
to France no doubt will be bolstered by the addition of goalkeeper
Dida to the first team. On Saturday, the Corinthians standout saved
a penalty kick and also prevented a regular-time goal as the Sao
Paulo club edged home side Vasco da Gama 4-3 on penalties to win
the first FIFA World Club Championships in Rio de Janeiro. Dida,
who last year replaced Claudio Taffarel, who has retired from
international play, saved Vasco's third spot-kick after the two
teams had played 120 scoreless minutes. The all-Brazilian clash
ended when Edmundo missed Vasco's final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: RIVALDO ON THE BLOCK?
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona president Josep Lluis Nunez, who has resisted the
thought of selling newly crowned world player of the year Rivaldo,
this week suggested that any club wanting his services will have to
shell out at least $60 million, by far a world record. The
Brazilian midfielder has been at odds with manager Louis van Gaal
all season.... Deportivo La Coruna's hold at the top of the Primera
is even more perilous after a 2-1 loss Sunday to lowly Alaves,
which got the winner in the 88th minute. Deportivo is now winless
in its past four league matches and leads Zaragoza and Barcelona,
which played to a 0-0 draw, by only two points.
</P>
<P>
   PERSUADING PARLIAMENT
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late for Sheffield Wednesday to avoid relegation
from the Premier League, but the cellar-dwellers earned applause
for their 2-0 win over Bradford City on Saturday because it
embarrassed four local members of Parliament who had called for the
sacking of manager Danny Wilson. After the game, Wednesday's
president reiterated his support for Wilson, and the club qualified
for the F.A. Cup quarterfinals on Monday by beating Wolverhampton.
And at least one member of Parliament sent out a public letter
trying to disassociate himself from previous statements. ... Leeds
starters Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate spent part of their
weekend in jail after being questioned in connection with the
beating of an Asian man outside a Leeds nightclub.... Arsenal
emboldened its title hopes with a 4-1 thrashing of Sunderland on
Saturday, as Thierry Henry and Davor Suker each scored twice.

   FRANCE: LEGAL OVERHAUL SHELVED
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious plan to overhaul the justice system, aiming to make
it more independent from politicians, has been shelved. President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin had put their
weight behind the constitutional amendment, due to be voted on next
week. But facing a rebellion in his party, Chirac was obliged to
call the vote off, the first time a constitutional change has been
abandoned in the 42 years of the Fifth Republic. The events
reinforced a growing perception that Chirac has grown out of touch
with his party.

FCC TO APPROVE OPERATION OF LOW-POWER RADIO STATIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to open the radio airwaves to hundreds of
small broadcasters, the federal government is planning to approve
rules to allow educational, religious and community groups to run
inexpensive low-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of the nation's largest broadcasters, the
Federal Communications Commission is expected on Thursday to adopt
licensing rules that will permit the addition of noncommercial
stations with broadcasting ranges of as much as seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the rules, proposed a year ago, hold
great promise to transform the airwaves at a time when the rise of
broadcasting conglomerates has sharply reduced the diversity of
voices. Such low-power station licenses have not been issued for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will bring many new voices to the airwaves that have not
had an outlet for expression, and it happens at a time when the
radio business has consolidated in very dramatic fashion,'' said
William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struck by the outpouring of interest on this issue
as I've talked to people around the country,'' he added. ``From
cops and clergy and community groups of all kinds. Local
governments, Indian tribes and a whole range of subcultures, such
as the Creole community in Florida, zydeco fans in New Orleans, and
others who would love to have an outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest broadcasters have fought to block the rules
through intensive lobbying and legislation, asserting that the
so-called micro-radio stations could create interference for
established stations in the form of static or distorted signals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the National Association of Broadcasters, the
industry's trade group, failed to delay the commission's vote, it
issued a statement vowing to ``aggressively seek ways to undo the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the association said on Wednesday that they were
considering seeking a court order to strike down the new rules.
``In our view this comes down to one issue: interference,'' Dennis
Wharton, a spokesman, said. ``If tens of thousands of people cannot
hear their hometown radio station, it's hard to understand how this
benefits the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has come up with a way to confound the law of
physics,'' he added. ``We've documented in an unassailable case
that this will result in additional interference on already crowded
airways.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC studies have concluded that the airwaves in the nation's
three biggest markets _ New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ are so
crowded that the commission cannot issue any licenses for 100-watt
stations, which could cover a broadcast area seven miles in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the FCC are studying whether smaller 10-watt
stations, with a range of two to four miles, could be licensed in
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said FCC studies had convinced him that the new rules
would not lead to any significant new interference. He said that
some broadcasters had told the commission that they were as
concerned about losing their own listeners as about interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't see this as a threat,'' he said of the
broadcasters. ``As I envision this, the broadcasters will have a
whole new pool of talent they can incubate, and since these will
all be noncommercial stations, there will be no threat that they
will be going after the same advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   While normally a formidable lobbying force, the National
Association of Broadcasters, which represents the nation's largest
broadcast networks and station groups, was beaten at the commission
by a grass-roots coalition of churches, schools, musicians,
municipalities and ``pirate'' radio stations that billed itself as
a kind of civil rights movement intending to democratize the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the FCC's move, who produced their own
engineering studies showing no significant interference would
result, included musicians like Bonnie Raitt and the Indigo Girls,
the U.S. Catholic Conference and the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 colleges and universities have licenses to operate
10-watt stations under rules that were repealed more than 20 years
ago but permitted these stations to continue broadcasting. About
140 colleges have stations that are unable to broadcast on FM
frequencies because of current restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the spectrum available for low-power
stations would not be parceled out through auctions, as frequencies
for the larger stations are. Instead, FCC officials will award
licenses based on a group's ties to the local community the station
would serve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rules do not go as far as many supporters of
low-power radio had sought, supporters expressed excitement. ``This
clearly will be the most significant opportunity in decades for
community groups, educational institutions, religious organizations
and local governments,'' said Michael Bracy, executive director of
the Low-Power Radio Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said it was impossible to know how many
station applications would be submitted, though they and industry
experts predicted at least many hundreds, and possibly a thousand
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has received tens of thousands of letters seeking
low-power radio rules, including ones from the New School in New
York, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of the Abyssinian Church of
Harlem, students from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and
Kevin McGaughey, the principal of Brookland High School in
Brookland, Ark., a town of 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any stations serving our community alone,''
McGaughey said today from Brookland. ``I'm just looking for an
opportunity to bring the school and the community closer
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since an antenna tower _ the most costly item for a high-power
radio station _ is not required for broadcasting at 10 or 100
watts, the new stations can be established for as little as $1,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to defuse the issue of radio interference and avoid
court challenges, the commission scaled back its original proposal
to license stations broadcasting with a maximum of 1,000 watts,
which could broadcast over 18 miles. Though the government had also
initially contemplated commercial and noncommercial stations, the
final rules will permit only noncommercial stations. And they will
require at least three frequency intervals on the radio dial
between a low-power station and another station, rather than the
two intervals initially suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has decided to take a very conservative technical
approach,'' said Cheryl A. Leanza, deputy director of the Media
Access Project, a Washington group that promotes diversity of the
airwaves. ``This proposal cannot be criticized for harming the
broadcasters.''

 &HT;    It's all about George
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ As defensive game plans go, this one did
not require late-night sessions with strewn coffee cups and jammed
ashtrays. It's basic enough for even reporters to understand.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jacksonville Jaguars do not stop Tennessee running back
Eddie George, or at least minimize his damage, in Sunday's AFC
Championship Game, they probably can forget the scramble for
Atlanta restaurant reservations next week.
</P>
<P>
   George rushed for 102 yards against the Jaguars in Week 15 of
the regular season, and the Titans won 41-14. In Week 3, when the
Titans barely won, 20-19, at Jacksonville, the Jaguars held George
to 57 yards.
</P>
<P>
   If George is allowed open spaces at Alltel Stadium, bad things
will happen for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve McNair will be moving out of the pocket and
rumbling through the secondary. With the Jacksonville defense
bending, quarterback Steve Brunell will be pressing to make
something happen on offense.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when turnovers, which helped destroy them the last
time, become a danger.
</P>
<P>
   If Jacksonville can get enough gold hats on George, however, the
Jaguars might win Round 3 of their season series with the Titans
and slip into Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way, man,'' Jaguars linebacker Lonnie Marts
said. ``You got to play Eddie George the whole game long. He gets
stronger as the game goes on. You have to shut him down the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the guy's got 100-some yards in the game,''
Marts said, ``and you say to yourself, `Where did he get it from?'
When the clock says zero, zero, zero, you want to look up and say,
`Eddie George did not get a 100 yards on us, and McNair had to find
a way to throw the ball downfield.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie George is the key,'' Jaguars cornerback Aaron Beasley
said. ``If you can run the ball and stop the run in the playoffs,
you can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   If George gets free, McNair is certain to follow. He blew away
the Indianapolis Colts last week with a 29-yard draw play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (McNair) gets going, now,'' Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin
said, ``that's a 230-pound running back. ... You're not going to
arm-tackle him. If you hit him in the chest, he can still throw the
ball 30 yards downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair considers the highlight film of Week 15 one of his prized
possessions; the Jags want to burn every copy. McNair threw for
five touchdown passes and 291 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep McNair in the pocket, we'll be OK,''
Jacksonville safety Donovin Darius said. ``If he breaks
containment, then he's like a big running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin does not allow his assistant coaches to do interviews,
so the defensive players will have to speak for coordinator Dom
Capers. In a week like this, they trust Capers as if he were a 12th
man on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a solid competitor,'' Darius said. ``He designed
this defense. It's almost like he can go out on the field and play
with you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an antimissile failure in a critical test
Tuesday night, supporters joined opponents Wednesday in asking the
Clinton administration to postpone a decision on whether to field a
complicated national missile defense system until after the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to make this decision in late
summer. But the military has only one remaining test in which it
now must hit a mock warhead with a missile to provide Clinton with
the required evidence that it is feasible to build the system,
which is meant to protect the country against a limited ballistic
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should put this decision off until next year,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee,
on Wednesday. ``I think a new president and his team should be in
place to make the call on this with a new Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel favors a national missile defense but believes the next
administration should decide such a far-reaching foreign policy
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Wednesday that the test was not a complete
failure. According to an initial assessment, the interceptor, or
kill vehicle, that was shot from the Marshall Islands in the
Pacific almost hit its target, a mock warhead launched on a
modified Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile from an Air
Force base in California, said a senior Pentagon official who spoke
to reporters on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final six seconds of the nearly eight-minute flight,
the interceptor was on target, the Pentagon official said. But then
two infrared sensors, which sense temperature differences to guide
the interceptor to its target, apparently failed. Most of the rest
of the test sequence performed as planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's setback, a growing number of members of
Congress, from both parties, had joined with European allies in
asking why a decision had to be made this summer on a weapons
system that could undermine the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty,
which is viewed by its advocates as a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's self-imposed deadline is now snarled in the
presidential campaign here and in a debate overseas, where
countries in Asia and Europe are afraid that the United States will
pull out of the ABM treaty, signed with Moscow, which prohibits
either country from deploying a missile system to defend its entire
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must avoid any questioning of the ABM treaty that could
lead to a disruption of strategic equilibrium and a new nuclear
arms race,'' President Jacques Chirac of France said in a recent
speech in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have expressed confidence to their
European colleagues that Russia will agree to enough alterations to
avoid such a showdown. But even such negotiations with Russia hinge
on the March vote to select a president there.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Wednesday that Clinton would stick
to his timetable. In late spring, the military will conduct another
missile test. In June the Pentagon will present to the president
its determination on whether it is feasible to deploy the system.
The president would make his decision in the summer, about the time
that both political parties hold their national conventions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a timetable and the president will make a decision
this summer,'' the administration official said. ``We're not going
to jump to conclusions. If the test succeeds in April or May, then
we're back on course.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said his decision will be based on the severity of
the ballistic missile threat to national security, on the
effectiveness of the technology, on the effect it will have on the
ABM treaty and on the cost. Since 1983, the United States has spent
$67.7 billion for missile defense research, and the current system
is predicted to cost $12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the decision could carry political consequences for
Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Democratic strategists fear that a
Republican nominee could use a delay to attack Gore as unwilling to
support a strong defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's deployment decision will have more to do with
defending Al Gore against George Bush than the American people
against North Korea,'' said John Pike, of the Federation of
American Scientists. ``They will need a lot more tests to decide
whether this will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who is also on the Foreign Relations
Committee, said Wednesday that the failed test demonstrated that
the United States should be careful negotiating any lasting changes
in the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should defer to another administration, Republican or
Democrat,'' said Senator Smith, a missile system proponent who only
wants to slow the deployment decision. ``We ought not to be giving
up more than we should.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior Republican leaders urged a quick decision to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go forward with a national missile defense,''
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, told
reporters Wednesday. ``It's the right thing to do. It's
irresponsible not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a speedy deployment of a national missile defense
have urged the White House to wait until Tuesday night's test can
be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the president will wait until the facts are in before
judging this test,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a strong
supporter of missile defenses. ``I expect that we will learn that
this was not an unsuccessful test, even though the interceptor did
not hit the target. Let the program be fully tested, and then judge
the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also said that a decision should be postponed so that
a schedule could be geared to scientific rather than political
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the milestones for these programs are
being driven by politics and not by science,'' said Stephen
Schwartz, publisher of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ``The
scientists are working very hard to do very difficult things in an
extreme schedule and people are expecting them to work miracles.''

 &HT;    Rookie Martin playing to win
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A defending champion who shot 59 last year in the
final round is not the biggest story this week at the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour debut of Casey Martin, who won a court ruling in
1998 to ride a golf cart because of a deteriorating circulatory
disease in his right leg, has drawn more reporters to the
tournament than has David Duval, the world's No. 2 player and 1999
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martin, who made it to the big tour through a top-15 finish
on the Nike Tour, will try to develop a reputation as a PGA Tour
player rather than an oddity. His only experience with the game's
big boys was a tie for 23rd in the 1998 U.S. Open at the Olympic
Club, near San Francisco, a tie for 66th in the Quad City Classic
and a missed cut in the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get better,'' Martin said. ``I don't want to be
cocky or say I have it made and I'm going to win a bunch. But I've
seen people that won who I can play with. If they can win, I can
win, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``I'm trying not to put too much pressure on
myself. I'd like to get off to a good start, but I don't know if
that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the players agree or not with the cart issue, they
respect Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see him being something different,'' Duval said. ``He
earned his way out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's most famous former Stanford teammate is Tiger Woods,
but another one, Notah Begay III, also won twice last year on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's time could be limited. The leg has worsened to the
point that he concedes, ``I'm at a high risk for a fracture. . .
I'm grateful I have a buggy to ride in.''

   OLLIE IN BELLSOUTH FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Masters defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain has
requested and received a sponsor's exemption to play in the
BellSouth Classic, March 30-April 2, at the TPC at Sugarloaf. . . .
Georgia State golfer Dave Womack tied the Eagle's Landing Country

DRUG OFFICE WILL END ITS ADVANCE SCRUTINY OF TV SCRIPTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has announced that it will stop
scrutinizing scripts of television shows under a widely criticized
financial agreement with the networks that had encouraged them to
include anti-drug messages in the plots of programs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the two-year-old arrangement, White House drug policy
officials reviewed more than 100 episodes of shows like ``E.R.''
and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' before they appeared.
</P>
<P>
   White House drug policy officials announced that they would
continue to reward networks for showing programs with strong
anti-drug themes, but they said they would not review the programs'
content until they had been shown.
</P>
<P>
   The office changed its guidelines after the practice was
described last week in a report in Salon, an Internet magazine.
Some critics said the practice by the networks amounted to
self-censorship in exchange for a fee. Andrew Jay Schwartzman,
president of the Media Access Project, a public interest law firm,
called the arrangement ``an outrageous abandonment of the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy had decided to adopt
``new guidelines'' that eliminated the practice of advance
screening because it would place ``the program on a track where it
will get universal support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've revised their policy to no longer look at scripts or
do changes in programming for credit before a program is
finished,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the drug policy office, said
the changes were made ``to eliminate any misunderstandings and
prevent any inference of federal intrusion in the creative
process,'' The Associated Press reported Wednesday. ``We have
forged a strong partnership with the entertainment and media
community and look forward to continuing to strengthen those
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the arrangement, which involved all the major networks,
was not widely known, it was revealed by McCaffrey at a
congressional hearing last October.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement began in 1997 shortly after Congress approved an
ambitious anti-drug advertising campaign that required media
outlets to match any advertising time bought by the federal
government with public service time. Essentially, it had given the
drug office and other government agencies the ability to buy
television commercials at half price.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1997, the demand for television advertising time has
increased dramatically. With the networks seeking ways to sell more
time at full price, they struck a compromise with the government to
reduce the amount of advertising time they were required to provide
by broadcasting anti-drug shows. That allowed the networks to sell
the air time that would have gone to the government for half price
to regular advertisers for full price.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have strongly defended their role in the practice,
saying they never relinquished creative control of any programs to
the government. But several network and television studio
executives had conceded that they did search for episodes with
story lines that they assumed might satisfy officials in the White
House drug policy office.
</P>
<P>
   A new and smaller network, WB, had said that it had submitted
scripts in progress from ``Smart Guy'' and ``The Wayans Brothers.''
Both shows had episodes with the theme of drug use, and producers
for both shows altered their scripts at the suggestion of
government reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   When first confronted with the publicity last week, drug policy
officials defended the arrangement, saying it was an effective way
to spread anti-drug messages to young people without infringing on
the creativity of producers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is chairman of the House Commerce
Committee's telecommunications subcommittee, announced that he
would hold hearings on the matter, and he is still planning to do
so this spring despite the White House's change of guidelines.

   MIAMI _ Lawyers for Florida relatives of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez asked a federal district court Wednesday to prevent the

 President Replaces CEO at Robertson Stephens  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens said yesterday
that President Bob Emery has taken over as chief executive,
replacing Mike McCaffery, who will become chairman and senior
strategic adviser.
<P>
   ``My focus will be on the areas of the business I really love,''
namely marketing, strategy and working with clients, McCaffery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emery said he will be involved in ``leadership kinds of things,
marketing, maintaining relationships in banking and brokerage,
setting standards and lots of recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery said the company, which had $1 billion in revenues and
1,142 employees last year, will add 300 to 400 people this year. It
will ``expand aggressively in Europe'' and make ``selective
additions in research and banking. About half of the new people
will help the company ``implement technological innovations to our
brokerage business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in 1969 and grew into one of the
nation's leading underwriters of high-tech and health care
companies. It participated in more than 230 public offerings and 40
private deals that raised more than $40 billion for clients in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, it has had three changes of ownership.
Bank of America acquired it in 1997 and sold it a year later to
BankBoston. In March, Fleet Financial Group acquired BankBoston
and, along with it, Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upheaval, ``We've been able to retain all our key
people,'' McCaffery said. ``We've had excellent partners in the
banks that have owned us. None have tried to change our business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said revenues grew 40 percent from 1997 to 1998 and more than
160 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery, 46, joined Robertson Stephens in 1988 and became CEO
in 1993. The chairman post had been vacant since firm founder Sandy
Robertson retired in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Emery, 38, joined Robertson Stephens in 1985 to establish the
firm's technology and health care merger and acquisition practice.
He was later promoted to co-head of Robertson Stephens' investment
banking group, then chief operating officer and then president.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Emery was an adviser on some of the highest profile
mergers including AtHome's acquisition of Excite, E-Trade's
purchase of Telebank and the CMGI/AltaVista combination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was a bit envious about the California Public
Employees Retirement System's $100 million investment in rival
Thomas Weisel Partners, McCaffery said, ``Weisel is a relatively
small business, he's a fraction of our size. We have the capital of
the seventh-largest bank in the United States. We have no need for
anybody to invest money in this.''

 Transmeta Develops Chips for Handhelds  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Transmeta, a secretive Silicon Valley startup with a star-studded
engineering team and financial backing from a stable of megamoguls,
finally laid its cards on the table yesterday, unveiling a pair of
chips designed specifically for handheld Internet-access devices.
<P>
   Called Crusoe, the new microprocessors run software written for
the Intel chips used in most PCs and do so almost as fast as
Intel's latest designs. Yet they require only a fraction of the
power needed for chips like the Intel Celeron and Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Transmeta, will make them capable of
``all-day computing'' _ something that's already possible with some
handheld devices, but not with Intel-compatible machines.
</P>
<P>
   From its founding four years ago until yesterday's
announcements, Transmeta had kept its plans a tightly guarded
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by intention or not, the element of mystery produced a
huge buzz around the company. Yesterday's briefing, held at the
Villa Montalvo in Saratoga _ an elegant Mediterranean-style villa &LR; 
 &LR; lodge built at the turn of the century _ drew hundreds of
reporters and camera crews from all over the world. When CEO Dave
Ditzel entered the auditorium, he was mobbed by photographers
snapping flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attention is due to the company's investors, who
include Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and George Soros, the
Hungarian-born Wall Street wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Further fueling the fire is the presence on Transmeta's payroll
of Linus Torvalds, the Finnish programmer who created Linux, the
open-source operating system that's recently taken the corporate
world by storm and is considered by some to be a significant threat
to Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, one of the Crusoe chips, the TM3120, will
run Mobile Linux, a new version Torvalds helped to create for use
on devices with less memory and power than desktop or even notebook
PCs. Transmeta showed it running on prototype tablet-size ``Web
pads'' with wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was a mock-up of a videocassette-size unit that
accommodated add-on modules, which turn it into a game console, an
MP3 digital music player or a wireless Web terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The TM3120 is available immediately, according to Transmeta, in
333- and 400-megahertz versions. No specific products or even
companies planning to adopt it were announced, but Transmeta
officials said some of its chip customers are planning to announce
Web pads in the next few months, at prices between $500 and $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other Crusoe, the TM5400, is intended for Windows notebooks
that weigh 4 pounds or less and cost between $1,200 and $2,500. It
will be available at 500- and 700-megahertz speeds. Transmeta
claimed prerelease versions running at 667 megahertz work about as
fast as 500-megahertz mobile Pentium IIIs, but the company is still
tuning its hardware and software to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   Notebooks incorporating the TM5400 will reach the market around
midyear, according to Transmeta. Again, it declined to identify
companies that plan to use the chip, but one of the prototype
notebooks on display was made by Acer.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions use advanced technologies and streamlined internal
designs to deliver high performance with very low power. To avoid
the complexity of Intel processors, Transmeta developed a patented
technique it calls ``code-morphing software'' to translate code
intended for Intel's ``x86'' architecture into instructions
appropriate to Crusoe. The underlying processing engine uses a
technique called VLIW _ very long word instructions _ which Intel
also uses in the Itanium, a new high-end chip it plans to ship
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the ``morphing'' technology could be adapted to
support code intended for other microprocessors, such the PowerPC
chips in Apple's Macintosh or the Motorola Dragonball processor
that runs Palm and compatible handheld devices. But Transmeta said
that at least for now its focus is strictly on ``x86''
compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   To cut power requirements, another new technology Transmeta
calls LongRun automatically adjusts both the frequency and the
voltage of the Crusoe processors to the lowest level needed for the
current workload. That enables the chips to run on only 1 watt of
power; Intel chips in current Windows notebooks typically use more
than ten times as much power.

 Japanese Just Can't Get Enough of Yahoo  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Think Internet stocks are overpriced in this country? The Japanese
are playing on a whole other level.
<P>
   Yahoo Japan climbed as high as $960,955 in Tokyo yesterday
before closing at $939,158, with investors falling over themselves
to get a piece of the country's leading Internet outfit prior to a
recently announced stock split.
</P>
<P>
   ``That scares the hell out of me,'' said George Koo, associate
director of Burnham Securities in New York. ``The Japanese have
just blown more hot air into the Internet bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Yahoo Japan's Godzilla-size share price is mostly a
reflection of the scarcity of shares in circulation _ only about
29,000, compared with approximately 330 million for the company's
U.S. counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Japan boasts a price-to-earnings ratio of 14,644, making
the American version's 1,706 ratio look downright reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is relatively late to the Internet party, and investors
there are only now coming to realize that Net stocks can
turbo-charge a lackluster portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Investors on this side of the Pacific are also watching with
more than a little anticipation as Yahoo Japan draws closer to
becoming the world's first million-dollar stock.
</P>
<P>
   Not least among them, Santa Clara's Yahoo _ the original _ owns
approximately 9,900 shares in its Japanese cousin, a 34 percent
stake now worth nearly $9.5 billion. Yahoo Japan is a joint venture
with Softbank Corp., which holds stakes in numerous Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased with the success of Yahoo Japan,''
said Yahoo's chief financial officer, Gary Valenzuela, with
considerable understatement.
</P>
<P>
   America's most expensive stock remains Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway, which rose $800 yesterday to close at a hefty
$52,800.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham's Koo estimated that Microsoft or America Online might
cost about the same were it not for stock splits over the years.
But this still doesn't justify a stock going for almost a million
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese look across the Pacific and see the prices for
Internet stocks and think that we here in the United States know
what we're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, we don't, and numerous analysts are predicting
that America's Internet bubble could pop at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Japan's bubble goes,'' Koo said, ``look out.''

 Apple Far Exceeds Estimates  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Apple Computer blew away analysts' expectations with its
first-quarter earnings, and chief executive Steve Jobs is getting
more than a pat on the back from the company he has turned around
over the past 21/2 years _ he's getting a Gulfstream V jet and $10
million in stock options.
<P>
   The Cupertino maker of Macintosh computers posted a net profit
of $183 million ($1.03 per diluted share), exceeding Wall Street's
expectation of 90 cents and the unofficial ``whisper'' number of 97
cents. The same quarter last year saw a net profit of $152 million
(95 cents).
</P>
<P>
   The results followed a stumble in the fourth quarter, when
profits declined compared with the year before for the first time
since Jobs returned to the company he co-founded. That decline was
blamed on a shortage of chips from Motorola for the company's
high-end PowerPC G4. Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said
Apple's component shortages have cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're behind us, as evidenced by our shipping
350,000 G4 Power Macs this quarter,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The $183 million included an after-tax gain of $101 million from
sales of 5 million shares in ARM Holdings, a British chip-design
company. That gain was partly canceled out by Jobs' hefty bonus _
the jet and the taxes on it cost $90 million _ and a $6 million
restructuring charge. Without these nonrecurring items, net profit
would have come to $178 million, or $1 per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while the profits were on the high end of
everyone's expectations, they were not entirely surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve Jobs announced at Macworld (conference in San
Francisco) that he was eliminating the `interim' in front of his
title, that was a sign that things were going pretty well,'' said
Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' bonus puts him in league with heavily compensated Bay Area
CEOs like eBay's Meg Whitman, who was granted $70 million in
options in 1998. This is a big change for a man who has declined
almost any compensation since returning to Apple's helm in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple has increased its market cap ... (by) $15 billion under
Steve Jobs' leadership, and he's been earning $1 a year,'' Anderson
said. ``It was the board's judgment that he was deserving of some
special recognition for what he's done for Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter, which ended January 1, were up 37
percent from last year, to $2.34 billion, and unit sales grew 46
percent to 1.38 million. Desktop iMacs sold 700,000 units, while
the portable iBook sold 235,000. Anderson declined to give sales
figures for the three individual iMac models, the original
Blueberry model, the iMac DV and the iMac DV Special Edition, but
said, ``The high-end DV Special (Edition), at $1,499, exceeded our
expectations in terms of its percentage of the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple also sold 350,000 of its most powerful computer, the G4,
and 80,000 PowerBook laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Gross margins declined to 25.9 percent from 28.2 percent in the
same quarter last year. Anderson attributed the lower margins to
three factors: higher prices of some components, increased freight
costs and fewer MacOS 9 upgrades than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Anderson pointed to the Internet as a source of
revenue in coming quarters. Earlier this month at Macworld, Jobs
announced a partnership with Internet service provider EarthLink
under which Apple preloads EarthLink connection software on Apple
computers, in exchange for a share of EarthLink's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EarthLink relationship could add $25 million to $35
million in gross profit'' in the next quarter, Anderson said in a
conference call with analysts yesterday. The results were announced
after the markets closed. In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Apple's
shares closed up $2.63, to $106.56. In after-hours trading, the
stock rose further to $113.

 E-Trade Loses $5.2 Billion Despite Late Business Surge  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
E-Trade Group, the nation's No.2 online broker, reported yesterday
that its business surged during the past quarter, buoyed by a
roaring stock market.
<P>
   Still, despite dizzying growth in trading, revenue, accounts and
client assets, the Menlo Park company lost $5.2 million (2 cents
per diluted share) during the period as it spent heavily to attract
new customers.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's reported profit included gains from investment and
other special items. Its operating loss for the period, its first
quarter of fiscal 2000, was $38.1 million (15 cents per share). The
company posted a net loss of $11.6 million in the comparable period
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were impressed by E-Trade's ability to build
its business at a breakneck pace, faster than Wall Street's
expectations. But investors focused on E-Trade's continuing red ink
and yesterday drove its shares down $1.75, to $26.19.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the potential profit and they're making a lot of
the right decisions,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Greg Smith. ``But
shareholders may be getting tired of waiting.``
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, the firm added 330,000 net new accounts,
reaching a total of 1.9 million, while client assets rocketed up 55
percent to $44 billion. Customers deposited an average of $83
million with E-Trade every day.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains were more than offset by $119.5 million in marketing
outlays, more than twice what the firm spent a year ago, as E-Trade
spent heavily to build on its position as one of the Internet's
leading financial services providers.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade Chief Executive Officer Christos Cotsakos said he
expects the firm to make money beginning in the middle of 2001 but
must continue its advertising blitz. ``We could be profitable
tomorrow, but we choose to invest to build the brand,'' Cotsakos
said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's CEO said the firm will take additional steps to
diversify its business and may eventually buy companies that sell
products such as mortgages over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade just completed its takeover of Telebanc Financial Corp.,
an online thrift that offers federally insured deposits. It sells
products such as mortgages and credit cards issued by other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, E-Trade said it has had  &LR; hired financial services
consultant Amy Errett to fill the newly created post of chief asset
gathering officer, who will be responsible for strategic
relationships and development of new products.  &QL;

   SEATTLE _ On a drizzly night late last week, more than a dozen
volunteers for Al Gore, nibbling on chicken wings, olives and
pizza, gathered at their headquarters at the Seattle Labor Temple
for a routine they have followed for weeks: telephoning faithful
Democrats to encourage them to vote for the vice president in the
Washington state caucus on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh hello _ is this the Eatons?'' asked Sara Kaplan, 76, who
has helped out in campaigns since 1946. ``I'm just calling to push
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted only a
couple of weeks to making telephone calls to identify its
supporters. His fledgling operation does not even have an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I alternate between jubilation and despair as I try to put
this thing together,'' said Matt Berman, the volunteer who runs the
Bradley campaign in Washington state. ``I wish I had another six
months _ and I wish I didn't have a family to support so I could do
this full time.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences in the Gore and Bradley operations here
underscore the degree to which the candidates are prepared to march
to the nomination should they triumph in the first showdowns in
Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New Hampshire a week later.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic strategists say they have never seen a
challenger with as much organizational and financial muscle as
Bradley, they argue that Gore is still better primed to go the
distance. Because he has traveled the country for more than seven
years as vice president, Gore has enjoyed a head-start building an
organization with help from scores of elected officials and the
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are stacked with the vice president in the long
haul,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, who ran for the
Democratic nomination in 1988 and is not backing anyone this year.
``But I think you'll find Bradley will be more organized than
people will think.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's edge, Bradley is in a far better position than
his Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is
nowhere close to matching the resources of his chief opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. And unlike Bradley, who has succeeded in
the often cumbersome and costly challenge of getting his name on
ballots in key primary states, McCain has had far less success. And
he is now fighting New York state Republican leaders over whether
he'll be on the ballot in many districts in the state's March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete with Bush around the nation, McCain is
concentrating on New Hampshire and South Carolina, which holds its
contest on Feb. 19, in the longshot hope that he will catch fire
and win the nomination on sheer momentum and free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with Bradley's preparations, if he and McCain
triumph in New Hampshire they would face enormous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, literally, has all his eggs in the New Hampshire
basket,'' Biden said. The senator said he would be more worried for
Gore if Bradley, beyond matching him in organization, had McCain's
charisma. Conversely, he said, if McCain had Bradley's resources,
``This is a guy who could just catch fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, who won a surprise upset in New Hampshire against
Walter F. Mondale in 1984 but lost the nomination, said in an
interview that Bradley had surmounted many of the hurdles that had
doomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would have envied is the clean shot, the two-man
race,'' said Hart, who emerged from as the alternative to Mondale
only after New Hampshire. ``I just didn't have the money, or the
ability to organize in more than two or three states. Bradley
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he questioned whether Bradley could win the nomination.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that Gore appears to have the
support of a majority of the so-called superdelegates, members of
Congress, party officials and others who will automatically be sent
to the Democratic convention _ and who account for about 20 percent
of all delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Bradley wins New Hampshire and comes on strong, those
superdelegates could defect to him,'' said Hart, who has not
endorsed either candidate. ``But history shows that is not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. DeGraff, who runs the delegate drive for the Bradley
campaign, insisted that Gore's advantages can be overcome. ``This
is the most prepared insurgent campaign in the history of the
Democratic Party,'' he said. ``You cannot wait until victory in New
Hampshire and then get delegate slates together in New York or Ohio
or Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a delegate expert on the Gore campaign, conceded
that Bradley ``has parity in terms of resources and that has
positioned him better than other insurgencies in the past.'' But,
he said, ``He doesn't have an advantage because we have a lot more
people helping us than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush benefits from the overwhelming support of
elected officials in his party who have put their supporters to
work for him. Another advantage for the governor is that the
Republican establishment does not particularly like McCain, who has
made his independence a signature theme.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davenport, who ran the delegate operation for Bob Dole's
campaign in 1996, said even if McCain won New Hampshire, ``it would
be a near miracle'' if he could translate that into winning the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John blows him out in New Hampshire, it would be a great
shot in the arm,'' said Davenport, who is not backing either
candidate. ``But it still comes down to if you don't have the
organization to get your vote out and the money to get your message
out, it's very difficult to buck the momentum of a front-runner.''

 Gemstar Grabs 2 Bay Area E-Book Firms  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Gemstar International Group Ltd., the firm that created an easier
way for people to program a VCR, has bought two Bay Area electronic
book companies in a deal designed to make e-books a popular
handheld electronic device for consumers.
<P>
   Best known for its VCR Plus and interactive TV program guides,
Gemstar said yesterday that it purchased both  &LR; Mountain View's
NuvoMedia Inc. and its competitor, SoftBook Press Inc. of Menlo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar, which recently announced plans to buy the popular TV
Guide magazine in a deal worth $9.2 billion in stock, said it
bought Nuvo Media and SoftBook last week in exchange for ``less
than 3 percent'' of Gemstar's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Gemstar's stock price at the close of trading last
week, the the deal was worth between $300 million and $400 million,
said analyst Joseph Arsenio of Chase H&AMP;Q. Gemstar shares fell
$1.75, to $82.625, on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Both e-book companies turn words printed in a paper book,
magazine or newspaper into digital form to be read by handheld
devices with screens. The devices simulate the look and feel of a
standard book, but have the capability of storing the equivalent of
several books.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar Chairman and CEO Henry Yuen plans to license and market
technology developed by the two local companies to major
manufacturers such as Sony and Sanyo to turn e-books into the next
consumer electronics rage.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Yuen plans to start by converting TV Guide's content
into e-book form and getting as many of its current 11 million
subscribers as possible to buy an e-book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will be the magazine of the future,'' Yuen said said
in a telephone interview from his office in Pasadena. ``I like the
fact that reading, even though it is on a slight decline, is still
the second-most-favorite pastime passtime  &LR; in the U.S., behind
watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   SoftBook Press, founded in 1996, introduced its SoftBook Reader
in 1998. The company sold models costing up to $700 to businesses
and a $300 model for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   NuvoMedia, founded in 1997, offered a $200 e-book aimed at
consumers. Analysts say the two were the only e-book companies with
products on the market, although Microsoft is developing an e-book
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Neither local company, however, has been able to market and
distribute its e-books widely until the deal with Gemstar.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar plans to use the same technique it used to sell its VCR
Plus, which was born out of Yuen's own frustrations when he
couldn't record a Boston Red Sox baseball telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Through licensing deals, Gemstar's VCR Plus, which consumers can
use to program a VCR by punching in a simple code, is now found in
TV and VCRs made by major electronics companies like Hitachi, Sony,
Philips, Sanyo and Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the masters of technology licensing,'' said SoftBook
spokesman Tom Morrow. ``That is how this e-book technology is going
to proliferate to be a mass consumer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's Arsenio agreed. ``We believe the potential
long-term growth in the e-book market could be very lucrative,'' he
said in a report on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yuen said he also plans to include wireless paging with e-books
by 2001 to open the way for instant downloads of new book, magazine
or newspaper content without a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wake up, you could have the morning version of the
Chronicle,'' Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated action, Gemstar's StarSight Telecast unit filed
a patent-infringment suit against TiVo Inc. of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   StarSight, based in Fremont, alleges TiVo's new technology that
lets TV viewers pause, rewind and play live TV broadcasts also
includes an interactive program guide that infringes on Gemstar's
own TV listing services.
</P>
<P>
   A TiVo spokeswoman declined comment until the firm evaluates the
suit, which was filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in San Jose.

 SEATTLE: a front-runner.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here in Washington state, organizations for Gore and Bradley are
taking shape, although the Gore operation _ buoyed by support from
most of the state's elected leaders and labor _ clearly has more of
a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 39 counties, we have organizers in 36,'' said Sandeep
Baweja, a 29-year-old lawyer who runs the Gore campaign in the
state. ``Let's say things don't go according to plan in New
Hampshire or Iowa. We have to do our share as part of the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Seattle Labor Temple in Seattle is repeated
night after night: The Gore campaign's goal is to compile a tally
of supporters and do whatever they can to prod them to caucus on
March 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following a script written by the campaign, the volunteers asked
respondents who identified themselves as Gore supporters or
undecided for their e-mail addresses so they could get on the
campaign mailing list. But if they said they favored Bill Bradley,
the scripted response was terse: ``Thank you for your time.'' The
volunteers were also instructed in the script to ``avoid mentioning
caucus date'' to Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of one evening last week, the campaign had compiled a
fresh list of the number of Gore backers, Bradley backers and
undecided. But the campaign may not have done especially well that
night. Baweja said he was instructed by headquarters in Nashville
not to release the tally ``for strategic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Baweja, the only paid Gore official in the state, draws a salary
of $30,000. The Bradley campaign's only paid staff member here is a
22-year-old, fresh out of college, who gets $500 a month to help
with administrative chores.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters here insist they are not daunted and view
Washington state as a critical western beachhead. Bradley has
courted the high- tech community and independent voters here, and
his advisers noted that this state has a history of rewarding
mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen them turn around volunteers the way we have,''
Berman said of the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, Bradley supporters could point to more
organizational strength. On the same night that Gore volunteers
were working the phone banks in Seattle, 70 Bradley volunteers
gathered nearly 3,000 miles away at the Engineer's Club in
Baltimore to assign tasks such as outreach to college students and
women in the run-up to the Maryland primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Curran, a City Council member who worked on the Hart
campaign in 1984, said Bradley was far more prepared. ``Hart seemed
a bit more helter skelter,'' he said. ``This is more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appeared that Bradley was still behind in organizing
in this state. Unlike Gore, he does not have the endorsements of
Maryland's top elected Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the meeting, someone asked Jamie Kendrick,
co-campaign coordinator in Baltimore, for the location of the
Bradley headquarters in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign headquarters is here,'' he declared, hoisting his
cell phone in the air. ``The campaign headquarters are all of you.
There is no headquarters. We are the volunteer army.''

 CalPERS to Buy 10% Stake in Weisel Partners  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The California Public Employees Retirement System is expected to
announce today that it is buying 10 percent of San Francisco
investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners for $100 million, an
extraordinary vote of confidence in a firm that opened shop just
one year ago.
<P>
   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, will also
invest up to $1 billion in a series of funds managed by Weisel
Partners that will make venture capital and other private equity
investments in fast-growing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides said they hoped to build a broad relationship that
would, among other things, increase the flow of capital to
California businesses. Weisel Partners, one of the only independent
investment banks based in San Francisco, raises capital and
provides merger advice to companies in expanding industries such as
the Internet and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategic, long-term partnership that will take
multiple forms,'' said Thomas Weisel, the firm's chief executive
and founder.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS' stake values the closely held Weisel firm at $1
billion. That's twice its initial worth and close to the $1.3
billion NationsBank paid Weisel in 1997 for his previous venture,
Montgomery Securities, which had a three-decade history.
</P>
<P>
   Large private investments by pension funds are not
unprecedented. While CalPERS puts most of its $165 billion of
assets into conventional stocks and bonds, it also has formed joint
ventures with such companies as cable operator Comcast Corp. and
energy provider Enron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about CalPERS' relationship with Weisel is its
size and scope. The pension fund is taking a large equity stake in
the firm and putting $500 million to $1 billion into five
yet-to-be-created private equity funds that will channel capital to
promising young companies in the United States and Europe. Private
equity funds buy stock in companies, but the stock can be difficult
to sell since it doesn't trade in public markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a jump start,'' commented Dean Eberling, an analyst with
the brokerage firm Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton. ``It
puts permanent capital in the firm and helps it to grow regardless
of market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS officials said they originally approached Weisel
Partners about putting money into one of the firm's existing
private equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting last summer, the CalPERS contingent was so
impressed by Thomas Weisel they decided to ask for an equity stake
as well. ``I was just blown away by the quality of the organization
he had built,'' said Barry Gonder, CalPERS senior officer for
alternative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CalPERS is hedging its bets. It has an option to sell its
stake back to Weisel under some circumstances if the firm stumbles.
And the second $500 million round of investments in Weisel's funds
hinges on the firm's ability to meet performance goals.

 Alcatel to Set Up $150 Million VC Fund  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Alcatel, the French telecommunications-equipment giant, is quietly
putting together a California-based $150 million venture capital
fund to gain a foothold in emerging technologies.
<P>
   The move marks a growing trend among tech companies to set up
venture capital arms to spot promising startups before they go
public or rivals gobble them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of companies doing this,'' said George
Geis, a University of California at Los Angeles professor who
tracks corporate investments. ``It's become the rule rather than
the exception'' among big tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Venture One, a San Francisco research firm that monitors
investments, says at least 25 companies have set up VC funds with
at least $20 million each. For instance, Lucent Technologies, an
Alcatel competitor, started a VC fund two years ago with $100
million and has invested in nearly two dozen companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are putting money in outside venture capital funds.
Nortel Networks, another Alcatel rival, has invested close to $150
million in 150 startups though seven VC firms, such as Matrix
Partners and Accel Partners. By going through a variety of VC
firms, Nortel can invest in far more companies than it could if it
set up its own fund and invested directly, said George Cooney,
Nortel's vice president of business development.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (VC) firms see 85 percent of the relevant deal flow,''
Cooney said. When Nortel spots a particularly attractive company,
it can also invest directly in the firm, as it has done with
Interwave Communications in Redwood City and Jetstream
Communications in Los Gatos.
</P>
<P>
   Geis, the UCLA professor, said firms often have different
motivations for the investments.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, he noted, often makes minority investments as a
first step toward buying the firm outright.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the ``granddaddy'' of corporate VC investing, tries
to nurture technologies that could spur demand for Intel chips
while it earns a huge return on its investment. Geis estimates
Intel reaps $1 billion a year in capital gains on its VC
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel said it simply wants earlier access to new technologies.
Alcatel will put up most of the $150 million for the Alcatel
Venture Fund, but has lined up more than 50 outside investors,
including entrepreneurs and financial and legal firms.
</P>
<P>
   It will be run by Steve Kim, former chief executive of Xylan, a
Calabasas (Los Angeles County) switching company Alcatel bought
last March. It will be based in Los Angeles with an office in Menlo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't plan to announce the fund for another two
weeks, but it has already invested in nine firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us gain access earlier to potential projects,''
said Patrick Liot, president of Alcatel's Internetworking unit.
``We need to be closer to the (investing) activity.``

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Salon.com scored a big scoop last week, landing the San
Francisco Internet site on front pages everywhere, but it almost
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Salon broke the story that the major television networks were
letting censors from the White House drug czar's office fiddle with
their prime-time scripts. If a show helped promote an anti-drug
message, the network would be relieved of having to air some public
service announcements _ freeing up that airtime for advertising.
The revelations have caused a national furor.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Salon lucked into the story. It was mid-December,
Salon had just moved into its spacious new offices at Fourth and
Market streets, boxes were piled everywhere and editors were
overloaded trying to keep up with news. Features editor Bill Wyman
was told that someone on the phone wanted to pitch him a story, and
Wyman said, ``Tell him to e-mail it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer called back two more times, and finally Wyman
thought, ``Maybe I should talk to the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dan Forbes, a free-lance writer in New York. He didn't
have e-mail. But he did have an amazing story.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, 43, had spent most of his career writing for trade
journals, which is where the story ``Prime Time Propaganda'' has
its roots. According to Forbes, he first wrote a story in April
1998 for Brandweek magazine about how anti-drug ads are not proven
effective. During the reporting on that piece, a man named Alan
Levitt in the drug czar's office mentioned they were considering
using TV shows as a vehicle for anti-drug messages instead of PSAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge lightbulb went off in my head,'' Forbes said. ``I
waited a year for things to unfold,'' and in April 1999, he started
digging again.
</P>
<P>
   When he hit pay dirt, he contacted Mediaweek, a sister
publication to Brandweek. He worked on it for several months.
``They were willing to publish it, but I withdrew it over that
delightful catch phrase, `editorial differences,''' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   He thought of magazines like Harper's or the Atlantic Monthly,
but feared getting scooped because of their long lead times. So he
thought of an Internet equivalent: Salon.com. ``They had the
scrappy psychic wherewithal to recognize the importance of the
story and not to eviscerate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes turned in a manuscript of 12,000 words _ cut from a rough
draft of 80,000 words. Wyman worked on it over Christmas vacation,
paring it to fewer than 6,000 words, and putting it through a
rigorous fact-checking mill. Even though the editing had some tense
moments, Wyman and Forbes have high praise for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Salon finally posted the story on January 13, alerted the
national media and has been flying high ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now Forbes has Post-it notes plastered to his bathroom door,
reminding him of key facts so he can be coherent when reporters
call for interviews. He figures he's talked to about 20 so far,
including an appearance on ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's been good for Forbes' career, the story is also good for
Salon. ``Stories like this create a buzz around the publication and
increase our circulation,'' said David Talbot, Salon's founder and
editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Before this story, Salon's most famous scoop was that U.S. Rep.
Henry Hyde had once cheated on his wife, which Salon published just
as the Illinois Republican was about to lead the impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton. Talbot finds Forbes' scoop sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Henry Hyde got us a lot of play, it was very
controversial within media circles'' because it involved digging
into a public figure's private life, he said. On the issue of the
networks giving script approval to the government, though,
mainstream newspapers ``are unanimous in their endorsement'' of
Salon's reporting, Talbot said. ``The media recognizes how
dangerous a precedent this can be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SALON AND THE STANDARD: &QL; 
On another front, Salon.com is in talks with the Industry Standard,
one of several hot ``new economy'' magazines, about ways the two
could work together.
</P>
<P>
   Although Standard president John Battelle declined to discuss
it, Salon's editor in chief Talbot said they have ``a variety of
things under discussion. ... It's really premature. There is
nothing definitive or determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have many deals with other media firms; Salon.com
links to TheStreet.com and MarketWatch.com for financial news, and
the Standard runs a column from TheStreet.com in its magazine and
also has a deal with Salon's rival, Slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it a potentially interesting collaboration is that
we're both invested heavily in editorial quality,'' Talbot said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STEVE CASE'S CONFESSOR:
</P>
<P>
   Kara Swisher, who toils in the San Francisco bureau of the Wall
Street Journal, found herself in demand last week, when America
Online announced it was buying Time Warner. Not only did the
Journal want Swisher, the author of the book ``AOL.com: How Steve
Case Beat Bill Gates, Nailed the Netheads, and Made Millions in the
War for the Web,'' to write a story on the deal, but it seemed
every other reporter in America wanted Swisher's comments for their
own stories.
</P>
<P>
   She was interviewed on CNN (where reporters asked her if AOL is
a good company to work for _ since CNN is owned by Time Warner),
NBC, ``Nightline,'' National Public Radio, the BBC, Salon.com and
dozens of radio stations and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The question on everyone's lips: ``What is Steve Case really
like?''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing answer, Swisher said, is that Case is hard to
know. Working on the book, she spent three hours a week with him
for nearly a year. ``I was like his therapist,'' she said. Her
findings: He was bland and tight lipped, reluctant to reveal any
emotion. ``The hero of my book is not very interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Case is definitely interesting, landing on front
pages everywhere. Swisher was probably the only reporter in America
who wasn't excited to talk to him. ``Even when he called,`` she
said, ``I was like, `Oh, God, you're back.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GRAZIE, AMICI: &QL; 
On a personal note, I'd like to thank my journalistic colleagues at
The Chronicle and elsewhere for a tremendous show of support. This
week, I was held in contempt of court and fined $1,000 a day by a
Marin County Superior Court judge presiding over a murder trial. As
a reporter at the Marin Independent Journal in January 1997, I
covered the murder and interviewed witnesses. On Tuesday, I was
ordered by the judge to testify about information I had gathered
but never published, and I refused, citing California's strong
shield law that protects reporters from revealing unpublished
information. It was difficult to disobey the court's order, but my
stand was affirmed by many supportive phone calls and e-mails from
journalists of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media Bytes appears every Thursday in The Chronicle. Send buzz,
dirt, tips and comments to fostd &LR; sfgate.com, call (415) 777-6004 or
fax (415) 543-2482.

 Web Sites Take Care of Event Invitations so You Don't Have To  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As he planned a publicity event for his Atlanta Web guide company,
eTour.com, Jim Lanzone had one worry.
<P>
   What if he brought Mahir Cagri, Internet superstar, from Turkey
to San Francisco and nobody came?
</P>
<P>
   Mahir rocketed to fame when Internet hipsters forwarded the
address to his clumsily constructed Web page around the world.
Naturally, Lanzone, eTour.com's vice president of marketing, turned
to the Web to promote the event.
</P>
<P>
   He used Evite.com, an online invitation site that allowed him to
fill in a emplate describing the event, paste in the e-mail
addresses of about 300 people in San Francisco's Internet
community, and send it off.
</P>
<P>
   When the recipients got the e-mail containing their Evites, they
saw who else was on the guest list and used that information to
help them decide whether to R.S.V.P. The guests also had the option
of forwarding the Evite to more people. Lots of them exercised that
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had space for 500 people, and two days before the event
over 3,000 had R.S.V.P.d,'' Lanzone said. The Evite went out six
days before the party. ``It certainly took on a life of its own,''
Lanzone said.
</P>
<P>
   Evite.com, based in San Francisco, is the most established
player in the online invitation market, but it's a field that's
getting more crowded as portals jump into the competition and
smaller companies rack up venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   An online invitation goes a step beyond e-mail because it
provides a temporary bulletin board where the host and guests can
interact. As people R.S.V.P., that status shows up on the site,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Invites, with functions similar to Evite.com's, debuted
last week. Yesterday, Redwood City's TimeDance, another
event-planning site, announced that its invitations will be
incorporated into the calendar function of Snap, NBC Internet's
portal. Another company, Event411.com, handles invitations and also
offers features such as online gift registry and budget tracking.
</P>
<P>
   For most, the business model is not advertising based. Instead,
the idea is to attract someone who is planning an event and then
sell her a pi &LR; n &LR; ata, movie tickets or some other piece of
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park's Mambo.com yesterday started tapping into another
source of revenue: It added credit card functionality so a host can
collect money from the guests for tickets, fees or any other cost
associated with an event.
</P>
<P>
   The guests pay by any major credit card, Mambo.com collects the
money and, after the event, cuts a single check to the organizer.
Mambo.com's cut: $1 per guest plus 4.75 percent of the total funds
collected. The host can pay the fee himself or pass it on to the
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts who had tried the online invitation services said they
ease party planning, especially juggling the number of guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked going back to see who hadn't decided ye, and then
sending (the Mambo invitation) off to more people,'' said Dani
Atencio, who used Mambo.com to organize a January 2 brunch at her
San Francisco home.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand people showed up to meet Mahir at the
Hamm's Building December 15, but the crowd was spread out between 7
p.m. and 12:30 a.m., so no one was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   People are also using online invites to plan book-club meetings,
birthdays and even weddings. Imagine the awkwardness if 400 guests
showed up to share a birthday cake made for 20.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees all this functionality as an improvement on
the simple, traditional invitation card. Some might feel
uncomfortable showing the world who made the A list, and some
guests may not like their e-mail address being posted on the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   An enterprising burglar might see an R.S.V.P. list as a handy
checklist of people who will be away from home on the night of the
event. But most functions can be limited or turned off: The host
can limit the maximum number of R.S.V.P.s, or turn off the ability
to forward the invitation. The guests can take their names off the
R.S.V.P. list, or the host can keep the list confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these options, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy
Information Center pointed out that Internet users should always be
wary about disclosing personal information, especially when the
information you are dealing with is about your guests, not
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am an Evite client, I'm really distributing personal
information that's not mine,'' said analyst Andrew Shen. ``Evite
should be extraordinarily sensitive to the information that's in
their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Evite.com, and most of the other invitation sites, states in its
privacy policy that it will not disseminate guests' e-mail
addresses or use them to send e-mail besides the invitations.
</P>
<P>
   The online party invitation was invented independently by two
teams on opposite coasts. In October 1998, two Stanford graduates,
Al Lieb and Selena Tobaccowala, launched an online calendar and
scheduling tool that would be streamlined into the current
Evite.com. Last January, two Harvard MBA students, Chris Grandi and
Greg Richards, launched a test site called iRSVP.
</P>
<P>
   Grandi and Richards tried out iRSVP with people they knew. They
recognized that they had something big on their hands when
strangers started using their Web site and e-mailing them feedback.
After a few weeks, they pulled the site down to work on their
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   They hired a CEO, Madeline Schroeder, a friend of Richards' and
a marketing wiz who, while working at Sega in the early 1990s,
helped develop the character of Sonic, the hedgehog that led Sega's
successful charge against rival Nintendo. The three entrepreneurs
set up Mambo.com in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Now the companies are busily signing partnerships to integrate
e-commerce into the event planning process.
</P>
<P>
   Plan an Austin Powers party on Evite.com and you'll see a link
to New Line Cinema's Austin Powers shop. Mambo.com sends party
planners to shop at GreatEntertaining.com, a partner Web site that
sells theme party kits and products such as pi &LR; n &LR; atas.
</P>
<P>
   Read a review of a movie running in San Francisco at
CitySearch.com, a directory site for local events, and you can
click an Evite.com link to invite friends to see the movie at an
area theater. You choose from a list of available showings and add
your friends' e-mail addresses, and Evite.com automatically fills
in the address, time and a brief description of the film. Mambo.com
has a similar arrangement with Zagat.com, a restaurant guide.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, muses Evites.com CEO Josh Silverman, a host will be
able to use Evite.com to arrange every detail of an event,
including finding something to do, buying tickets and making dinner
reservations. Some of these functions will appear on the site
within months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner reservations are a very hard nut to crack,'' Silverman
said. The idea of keeping track of thousands of restaurants'
diverse reservation systems boggles the mind. ``But buying movie
tickets is fairly easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation sites' approach to e-commerce is not all that
different from other sites that introduce customers to merchants,
like online shopping malls, said Matt Stamski, a senior analyst at
Gomez Advisors, an Internet research firm in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can (refer book buyers to) Amazon and get 5 percent of
the total sale, but that's small change,'' Stamski said. He
believes feels  &LR; that whether the invitation sites succeed ``depends
on how good a job they do striking deals with partners.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential pothole in Evite.com's road to success _ at least
internationally _ is its name. In English, ``Evite'' evokes a
pretty clear idea of what the service does, but in French and other
Romance languages, the word ``evite'' means ``avoid'' _ not a term
you want to crop up when planning a party.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, who recently vacationed in Spain, is aware of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Romance-language countries, we will have to think of a
different master brand,'' he said.

STUDY RANKS EXPENSIVE CITIES IN WHICH TO DO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While it ranks as one of the most expensive
cities in Southern California in which to do business, Los Angeles
is a downright bargain compared with New York and Washington, D.C,
concludes a new business survey.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco charges its businesses a higher tax rate,
according to the sixth annual ``Kosmont Cost of Doing Business
Survey compiled by Los Angeles-based real estate firm Kosmont &AMP;
Associates. A copy of the report to be released Monday was obtained
by the Daily News on Wedneday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, expanded this year to include major cities
nationwide, shows Los Angeles to be among the most expensive,
especially in Southern California in which to do business.
</P>
<P>
   And it found the city encircled by a host of low cost
municipalities in the San Fernando Valley region, San Gabriel
Valleys and Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is actually less expensive than a number of the
major cities. Washington and New York are more expensive than
L.A.,'' said Larry Kosmont, president of Kosmont &AMP; Associates, a
consulting firm that helps cities strike deals with businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of doing business in a city can often be the
tiebreaker between a couple of final locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cities in California compare favorably with those across
the nation in terms of business taxes, largely because of the
state's limit on property taxes mandated by Proposition 13, Kosmont
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cities surrounding Los Angeles fall into the lower-cost
categories in the study, achieving rankings of ``low cost'' or
``very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   This can put Los Angeles at a competitive disadvantage, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that Los Angeles is a high-cost island in a sea
of cities that are good deals when it comes to doing business.
</P>
<P>
   To the Northeast are 12 incorporated cities from Glendale to
Lancaster and into Ventura County that ranked as either low cost or
medium cost places to do business.
</P>
<P>
   They include Agoura Hills, Burbank, Calabasas, Camarillo,
Glendale, Lancaster, Oxnard, Palmdale, San Fernando, Santa Clarita,
Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, and Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   On the city's eastern flank are 19 municipalities considered
more friendly to business. Two of these -- Pasadena and Pomona --
received a medium cost rating.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, including Covina, Arcadia, Norwalk, Diamond Bar, West
Covina and Whittier, are considered either low cost of very low
cost for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Delgadillo, Los Angeles deputy mayor for economic
development, said the city is focused on developing a
business-friendly image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have stiff competition from our surrounding
cities,'' Delgadillo said. ``Los Angeles has competitive advantages
even though our tax structure might be more expensive than some of
our surrounding cties. A Los Angeles address is more and more
important to companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also measures the number of business attraction or
retention projects cities undertake during a calandar or fiscal
year. These include the kind of public-private partnerships that
Kosmont's firm helps arrange.
</P>
<P>
   This type of activity varies even among cities that have the
same cost ranking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Palmdale and Santa Clarita are in the low cost
category. But Palmdale made 10 or more incentive deals last year
while Santa Clarita did not do any.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Haviland, economic development manager for the city of
Santa Clarita, said his city doesn't want to give away money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cities feel they compete most effectively giving away
financial assistnce,'' he said. ``When you're giving away
incentives, you're giving away some of your city's tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delgadillo notes that in a larger city such as Los Angeles
these kinds of deals are crucial. And their cost is more than
offset their overall impact on the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public-private partnerships are critical to the future of
economic development in any local municipality. They leverage tax
dollars with private capital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delgadillo said one example of this is the former General Motors
plant in Van Nuys, where the city spent $4 million in federal funds
to build a road into the industrial portion of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We removed what would have been an incredibly blighted site in
the city of Los Angeles,'' Delgadillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the state of California is an average tax burden state,
said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   And business taxes are fairly far down the list of elements that
determine location.
</P>
<P>
   Companies considering a move generally examine the schools, the
labor force, the proximity to their customers and suppliers and the
community's amenities before looking at taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosmont agrees but notes the tax structure can be a deal maker
or breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at the real estate opportunity, the labor pool, the
convenience to clients and suppliers. Then the question is: How
much does it cost to operate there? That's where you can find that
the business friendliness is a factor.''

UNITED WAY IN L.A. REALLOCATING FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD AND BHAVNA MISTRY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- United Way, the largest health and human services
charity in Los Angeles County, announced Wednesday a major strategy
shift that will provide $3.2 million to smaller community-based
charities that normally would go to groups like the American Cancer
Society and American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 Los Angeles-area groups losing funds, the heart
association's local chapter takes the biggest hit, losing $805,727,
or 6.2% of its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, a support group for 2,000 to
3,000 patients with a neuromuscular disease that causes difficulty
breathing and chewing, will lose $36,844, or more than 10 percent
of its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The decision shocked the foundation's executive director, Lois
Pedersen, who said she now has to figure out what to cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no clue this was going to happen,'' Pedersen said.
``Shock mode is where we're at now. We want to understand where
United Way is coming from because we've been a health partner for
26 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the American Heart Association declined
comment, saying more information was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The groups that will gain funding have not been chosen yet, but
they will be smaller and more community-based than the ones losing
money. They will focus on three specific areas: moving the working
poor out of poverty; promoting child education and adult literacy,
and groups that build healthy communities by providing health care
for the uninsured, increasing neighborhood safety and enhancing
intergroup relations.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of Greater Los Angeles' board voted Wednesday morning
for the shift, saying it wanted to focus on groups that help the
urban poor and children of Los Angeles County, rather than giving
money in a scattered fashion to many groups with varying goals.
Three of the groups lost funding because they are outside of Los
Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which takes effect July 1, is unique to Los Angeles
County, not a national policy.
</P>
<P>
   It comes out of a report released in May 1999 called ``A Tale of
Two Cities'' which detailed steep gaps between the wealthiest and
poorest populations in Los Angeles County. The report found that
Los Angeles has a median household income 14 percent higher than
the national average, but also has the most impoverished people, 22
percent of the county's 10 million residents, in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is also the result of a desire to give donors a more
tangible impact for their dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our donor is an entrepreneurial donor, a younger donor,'' said
United Way spokesman Todd Rosin. ``They demand measurable outcome
for their investments. That's what we're going to do with this new
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Way hopes to raise about $63 million this year and
give more than $50 million to various charities. Eventually all of
that money will be distributed following the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups losing funding include: American Cancer Society,
$712,927 (4.8 percent of total budget); Hemophilia Foundation,
$11,514 (2.5 percent of total budget); Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
$257,000 (3.4 percent) of total budget).

NASA MAY DITCH $600 MILLION SATELLITE IN PACIFIC OCEAN 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After nine years in Earth orbit and significant contributions to
astronomy, NASA's $600 million Compton Gamma Ray Observatory could
soon be taking an intentional plunge into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of military space experts and other
consultants, the space agency is weighing the fate of the
35,000-pound observatory, following the failure of a gyroscope in
December. The observatory is equipped with three gyros, which hold
it steady as it circles the Earth at an altitude of 375 miles.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by NASA to ditch the boxy satellite into the Pacific
may be the only way to prevent it from making a random, fiery
re-entry into the atmosphere somewhere in the Earth's populous
equatorial belt if there is a second gyro failure, said Preston
Burch, the deputy program manager for space science operations at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The Greenbelt, Md., facility
supervises Compton operations.
</P>
<P>
   An uncontrolled re-entry would likely fling debris over a swath
of the Earth's surface more than 15 miles wide and nearly 1,000
miles long, producing a 1-in-1,000 chance of a human casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first heard that, we all scratched our heads and said
that seems like a big number,'' Burch said. ``A one in a 1,000
chance of a human casualty is unacceptable. We need to be serious
about making sure we bring it down in a safe manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of more gyro failures is made all the more onerous
by the current ``solar maximum,'' that phase of the 11-year rise
and fall of activity within the sun that is most energetic. With
the rise in the sun's energy output anticipated through next year,
the Earth's atmosphere is blooming temporarily, increasing the
frictional forces that drag orbiting satellites toward the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Without gyroscope control, the Gamma Ray Observatory would soon
begin to tumble in space, making it all the more susceptible to the
increased atmospheric drag. Control teams at Goddard would have
more difficulty predicting a re-entry trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said his experts have agreed to formulate a recommendation
on how NASA should deal with the Gamma Ray Observatory on Feb. 16.
March 14 is the earliest that the spacecraft could be propelled
through the Earth's atmosphere and into the Pacific in response to
commands from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Without the gyro failures, the observatory could function for
another three to 11 years, the space agency believes.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason Burch's team is looking at alternatives to
quickly ditching the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The option with the best odds is finding a strategy to reliably
use other guidance sensors on the spacecraft to enhance control
from the ground until a second gyro fails. Those include
instruments that use the bright light of the sun and the Earth's
magnetic field as pointing references.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative with the longest odds is help from the space
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its better known sister spacecraft, the Hubble Space
Telescope, the Gamma Ray Observatory was not designed to be
repaired by shuttle astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory has a mechanical latch called a ``grapple
fixture'' that can be grabbed by the shuttle's long robot arm.
However, the observatory has a leaky fuel valve and NASA is
reluctant to attempt returning the big spacecraft to Earth aboard a
shuttle, fearing it might leak toxic hydrazine fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Simply boosting the observatory into a higher orbit is
problematic as well. It would consume the fuel reserves needed to
steer the spacecraft into a controlled re-entry. Additionally, the
higher altitude would not make the observatory immune from the
additional atmospheric drag imposed by the solar maximum.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA decides it must ditch the observatory, ground
controllers will select a target in the Pacific and alert maritime
and aviation interests of the re-entry. With a half-dozen
maneuvers, controllers will begin to lower its altitude.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-minute long braking maneuver would initiate the final
plummet through the atmosphere, Burch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamma Ray Observatory was launched aboard the shuttle
Atlantis on April 5, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The second of four orbiting celestial telescopes envisioned by
NASA, it was designed to study high energy gamma radiation that
cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere to reach ground-based
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence has enabled astronomers to study powerful
explosions second in magnitude only to the big-bang that is
theorized to have created the universe more than 12 billion years
ago. Compton's contributions have enabled scientists to determine
that the explosions first detected by spy satellites in the late
1960s are coming from the most distant reaches of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Their source, however, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the drama surrounding the future of the observatory
is hardly new for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-ton U.S. Skylab space station made an uncontrolled
re-entry on July 12, 1979, scattering the debris across western
Australia. There were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned five years earlier, Skylab's demise was also hastened
by the solar maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a 5,000-pound satellite called Solar Max and
developed by NASA to study the sun plunged harmlessly into the
Indian Ocean on Dec. 2, 1989, after nearly a decade in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   More massive by far than all three U.S. spacecraft is Russia's
14-year-old Mir space station. Abandoned last August by the
Russians, Mir may be restaffed in late March.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is hopeful, however, that the Russians will ditch Mir into
the Pacific so that its scarce space budget can be devoted to the
new U.S.-led international space station.

 &HT;    These Rams attack
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ From an aerie high above the Trans World Dome, it
looms below like elongated Arena League ball, or a life-sized
version of an old Tudor Electric Football game played at warp speed
yet in perfect synch. The St. Louis Rams offense is the gateway to
21st-century football, an otherworldly attack that turns Roland
Williams absolutely rhapsodic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs wonderful,'' said Williams, the Rams' starting tight
end. ``There are certain times when we're running a play, it almost
seems like it's magical. Sometimes, I get overwhelmed with emotion
because we're playing so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play every team in the league
back-to-back-to-back, because it seems as though we can't be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Potency? The Rams scored 526 points this season, the
third-highest total in NFL history, and never less than 21 points
in a game. With Kurt Warner, the Iowa Barnstormer-turned-NFL MVP,
passing for 41 touchdowns, the Rams made the biggest offensive
improvement in league history. They exponentially exploded from
27th in total offense last year to first, averaging 400.8 yards per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's not just the Rams' cosmic production that startles, but
how it transpires. Theirs is the kind of diversity even John Rocker
could appreciate. When Warner completed passes to 10 receivers
against the Vikings _ including five touchdowns to five different
players _ that was by design, not accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy who gets open is the one who gets the ball,''
said Marshall Faulk, the singular running back who came from
Indianapolis in a trade and set an NFL record with 2,361 yards from
scrimmage (1,381 yards rushing, 1,048 receiving on 87 catches).
</P>
<P>
   ``With the talent we have,'' said wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim,
``we can score from anywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the Rams may have to score from the 1 Sunday, not
the 50. They may have to move down the field in minutes, not
nanoseconds. Although a two-touchdown favorite over Tampa Bay in
the NFC Championship game, the Rams may have to exercise patience
against the Bucs' staunch, stingy defense to reach Super Bowl XXXIV
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the toughest matchup we've had offensively
because of the style they play. A bend, don't break defense,'' said
Rams head coach Dick Vermeil. ``...It's hard just to take the ball
in chunks against these people.''
</P>
<P>
   You could look it up. But then, Vermeil has already done the
math on Tampa Bay's two-deep-zone,
keep-the-receivers-in-front-of-you defense. That's all by Bucs
coach Tony Dungy's design, but also to protect rookie quarterback
Shaun King in a conservative, run-oriented offense. By the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bucs, the NFC's top-rated defense and third overall, gave
up just eight rushing touchdowns all season. Faulk alone ran for
seven TDs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tampa Bay was the league's No. 2 pass defense, allowing 11
touchdown passes _ one less than the Rams' Isaac Bruce caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, they've forced an offense to snap the ball 51 times
before they score. It took 225 yards to do that,'' said Vermeil,
whose Rams needed one play (Bruce's 77-yard catch-and-run) to score
against Minnesota, four more to score again (Faulk's 41-yard
slither on a screen pass). ``With our offense, it takes (an average
of) 18 snaps to score every 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a real clash of offensive and defensive
styles. They eliminate the big play. They force you to go into a
more patient attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Vermeil will revert. Not that he'll become the
conservative, run-first coach he was in Philadelphia in his first
NFL go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you go conservative,'' he said. ``It's that you
do what you do because of their style of play. You've got to be
very careful. You can't play into their hands. We're not going to
change our offense; we just need to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three years here, Vermeil has built a team based on three
things: speed. ``A team with athletic ability that can run,''
Vermeil said. ``We don't have any fat guys that can't run. It's a
game of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an offense orchestrated by Mike Martz, the first-year
offensive coordinator already anointed as Vermeil's successor when
he retires. It's not just Martz's football knowledge, but his
creativity and unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most aggressive guys I've seen in my life,''
said Williams. ``He wants to score points and knows how to put us
in position to have success. A lot of teams have the same kind of
plays in their offense. It's a matter of knowing when to call them
and what formations and groupings to put them in. That's what Coach
Martz has a great knack for. I think he chooses the right time to
do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it's the time to be careful, as Vermeil says, but not
timid or ultra-conservative. ``If passing the ball works, we are
going to pass it,'' said Faulk. ``If running the ball works, we are
going to run it. That's the way we work around here. The good part
is that there is no one selfish around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The better part? The Rams have the talent to do all of that, and
more.

EFFORT BEGUN FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN SCIENTISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday
that he would seek an additional $10 million to $15 million in next
year's budget as part of an effort to recruit more scientists,
particularly Asian-American ones, for the government's national
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget increase is part of a broader effort by
Richardson to respond to charges of discrimination against
Asian-American scientists at the nuclear weapons laboratories since
the firing last March and subsequent arrest of Wen Ho Lee, a
Taiwanese-born scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico, in connection with the government's investigation of
evidence that China had stolen American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Richardson appointed a new ombudsman, Jeremy S. Wu,
former deputy director for civil rights at the Department of
Agriculture, to investigate accusations of discrimination
throughout the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also ordered that all department offices and
laboratories close for a half-day to conduct anti-discrimination
training sessions, and that clearer policies prohibiting racial
profiling by department contractors and at the national
laboratories be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are suspicions, and an atmosphere of distrust,'' that
Asian-American scientists perceive at the national laboratories,
Richardson said in an interview. ``And so we need to make clear
that there are no potential gaps in our policies opposing racial
profiling and protecting the civil rights of our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he wanted to expand the department's budget to
recruit more Asian-American scientists because of a ``brain drain''
that had begun since the furor over nuclear espionage case started.

INSULATING TO SAVE HEAT AND MONEY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many different types of insulation available for the
home: fiberglass, loose fill, rigid panels and expanding foam.
Fiberglass is the most popular because it is easy to install and
less expensive than the other types. It can, however, be confusing
to buy because it is available in different widths, thicknesses and
densities, and with or without a vapor barrier. Some stores even
offer fiberglass insulation with features like low-irritation
films.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to understand the options available so you can
choose the product that best fits your needs.
</P>
<P>
   First consider your space requirements. Fiberglass batts are
designed to fit between joists, studs or rafters. Most studs,
joists or rafters are spaced 16 inches apart on center. Buy
insulation 15 inches wide to fit these spaces. Get 23-inch wide
batts for framing that is 24 inches apart on center.
</P>
<P>
   Next, consider the thickness of the batts. Batts are available
in 3 1/2-, 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-inch thicknesses. For most home
applications, choose either the 3 1/2- or the 6-inch-thick batts.
These will fit between wall studs framed with 2-by-4s, or between
joists framed with 2-by-6s. You may be tempted to try to increase
the insulation value by buying extra thick batts and compressing
them to fit in shallow spaces. This, however, will only compress
the air pockets between the fibers and reduce their insulation
value.
</P>
<P>
   Fiberglass batts are available in precut lengths or in rolls.
It's more economical to buy the insulation in rolls, then cut them
to length, but take the time to calculate the lengths that you will
need. Otherwise, you could have a lot of leftover pieces after the
installation.
</P>
<P>
   All insulation should have a vapor barrier to keep the moisture
in the warm, interior air from condensing when it hits the cold air
in the insulation. You may elect to install the insulation first,
then cover the area with plastic. Or you can purchase fiberglass
batts with kraft paper glued to one side.
</P>
<P>
   The special paper serves as a vapor barrier, and it has flaps
that you can staple to the framing members to hold the batts in
place. This hold-down feature is not necessary in floor
installations, but it will keep the insulation in place in a
vertical wall space. When installing the insulation, make sure the
vapor barrier faces toward the interior of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The bane of fiberglass has always been that it readily sheds
small fibers that can irritate the skin. For this reason, it is
necessary to wear a long- sleeved shirt and pants, gloves, a dust
mask and goggles when laying down batts.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers offer fiberglass insulation batts with
special perforated plastic wrapping. The wrapping does not
eliminate the need for protective clothing, but it helps to cut
down the amount of loose dust and fiber irritants and makes it
safer to handle the batts. This is a desirable feature for
do-it-yourselfers with allergy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider the R-value of the insulation. The higher the
R-value, the better the insulating qualities of the material. For
most types of insulation, the R-value is determined by the
thickness of the material. Fiberglass insulation 3 1/2 inches thick
might have an R-value of R-11, while the same material 6 inches
thick would have a value of R-13.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to increase the R-value of insulation by piling
on more insulation, thus creating a thicker layer. You can increase
the R-value of the insulation in the attic floor by adding another
layer of fiberglass batts on top of the existing layer.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously you cannot add more insulation on top of the batts in
the wall cavities. Here the space is limited, and you would have to
compress the existing material to fit in the new. There is,
however, another alternative. Some manufacturers offer high-density
fiberglass insulation. The high-density composition increases the
R-values of the batts without adding extra thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Normal low-density batts 3 1/2 inches thick have an R-value of
11. But you can buy medium-density fiberglass batts of the same
thickness with an R-value of 13 or high-density batts with an
R-value of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously you pay more for increased-density insulation _
high-density batts may cost twice as much as normal-density batts _
but often that added cost can be recouped with reduced heating
bills. &QL;

CONGRESS LIKELY TO FOCUS ON NATIONAL DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., N.M., Miss., Ohio, Texas)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress prepares to convene for an
election-year session likely to be distinguished by an even greater
degree of partisanship than usual, the two parties seem headed
toward deadlock on most issues other than dedicating the federal
budget surplus to reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called on his party Wednesday to
develop and enact a plan to pay off the main portion of the debt _
the $3.6 trillion in Treasury bonds owned by the public _ within 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hastert countered a similar initiative set out last
year by President Clinton, illustrating again how both parties have
found debt reduction to have a powerful appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, among Republicans, the goal is as much to keep the growing
federal budget surplus off limits to Democratic spending proposals
as it is to reduce the debt. And among Democrats, dedicating much
of the surplus to debt reduction is popular in part because it
leaves that much less money on the table for Republican tax-cutting
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties are holding out hope that the
budget surplus will be so big _ and that the political imperative
to bring some concrete accomplishments home to voters will overcome
the impulse to block the other side's agenda _ that there will be
room for compromise on a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pushing big proposals to improve access to health
care, add prescription drug coverage to Medicare and expand the tax
credit for the working poor. Republicans plan to put forward a
series of narrowly drawn but politically appealing tax cuts, and to
try to complete work on a number of bills left over from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident this will be a year of legislative
accomplishment,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders are playing down expectations for any
major legislation this year, hoping that they will be able to work
with a Republican president a year from now. Moreover, they said,
Congress will have relatively little time this year because members
will spend extra time at home campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to acknowledge and not apologize for the fact
that it will be a shorter year,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., referring to the truncated election-year schedule.
``There won't be a lot of time for big, new initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   To the degree the two sides thwart each other on other issues,
they are that much more likely to fall back on eliminating the
national debt held by the public as their major goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``By controlling spending and wisely investing our current tax
surplus, it is my personal view that it is possible to reach this
goal by the year 2015,'' Hastert said Wednesday in a speech in
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert directed Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
Budget Committee, to produce a plan for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's goal, Republican aides said, is to make sure as much
money as possible is locked away for debt reduction, while still
leaving enough of the surplus available next year to enact the $483
billion, five-year tax cut proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
if Bush is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made eliminating the debt by 2015 a central part of
his economic policy, and Vice President Al Gore has put it at the
heart of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans create a quandary for themselves in setting a
goal of eliminating the debt by 2015. To do so would almost
certainly require using all or nearly all of the portion of the
projected surplus generated by excess Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   By using that money for the debt, Republicans would be unable to
use it for another cherished goal, creating a system of private
investment accounts within Social Security as a means of shoring up
the retirement system's financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office and the White House's Office of
Management and Budget will publish new projections on the surplus
in the next few weeks. Last year both agencies predicted that
Social Security would generate $2 trillion in excess revenue over
the next decade, while general tax revenues would exceed spending
by $1 trillion.

<P>
   Changes in the Pacific Ocean are making it more likely that
winter weather in much of the United States will exhibit unusual
warmth alternating with sharp cold, scientists at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the pattern, prevalent this winter and
last, might predominate for 20 or 30 years. The finding was based
on calculations of the movement and temperature of ocean surface
waters, and the varying amounts of heat they bear, based on
measurements made by instruments aboard the Topex/Poseidon earth
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The data reflect a natural oscillation in ocean conditions, not
a sign of global climate change. Nor is the development tied
directly to El Nino-La Nina weather patterns, year-to-year
variations in ocean temperatures that set off atmospheric chain
reactions in many parts of the world, including North America.
</P>
<P>
   But if the satellite images do indeed signal the beginning of a
new climatic regime in the Pacific, there will be ``fewer and
weaker El Ninos and more La Ninas,'' said Bill Patzert, a research
oceanographer at the Pasadena laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In the natural weather phenomenon known as La Nina, sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are cooler than
normal. This sets off a train of atmospheric events that affect
weather patterns around the globe, especially in North America in
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is marked by abnormally warm sea-surface temperatures in
the tropical Pacific, which touches off a different set of winter
weather consequences, often including heavy rains across southern
tier of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a larger natural oscillation going on in the
Pacific, this one involving a flip-flop in sea-temperature patterns
on a scale of decades. When the ocean flips from one of these
states to another, Patzert said, ``it resets the stage for the
climate system; it provides a new background on which smaller
events like El Nino and La Nina can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of these alternating states of what is called the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation, sea-surface temperatures are warmer in the
eastern equatorial Pacific but cooler throughout much of the rest
of the Pacific basin. That pattern predominated from the mid-1970s
through most of the 1990s. It was also a period of more frequent
and stronger editions of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the last two years, the opposite pattern has appeared:
cooler water in the eastern tropical Pacific but warmer elsewhere.
That pattern last predominated from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While Patzert and other scientists said they believed that a
flip from one phase of the oscillation to another has occurred,
they also said it was too soon to tell whether it represented a
true shift from one multidecadal regime to the other. ``There
simply has not been enough time'' since the shift took place, said
Wayne Higgins, a senior meteorologist at the government's Climate
Prediction Center at Camp Springs, Md. Another five to 10 years of
data may be required, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is only two years old and whether it will last for a
full 20 or 30 years remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   If a longer-term shift has occurred, and La Nina materializes
more frequently as a result, this winter's highly variable pattern
of weather in the United States would probably become more
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the positions of warm and cold air masses and storm
tracks shift so that the eastern part of the country is often
exposed to warm weather. Then the masses drift and sudden cold hits
the East. Meanwhile, the Northwest becomes stormier. Then the
pattern repeats. The Climate Prediction Center has forecast that La
Nina will persist into the spring, then fade. What will happen
after that is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   There is an additional complication just now: Atmospheric
conditions in the North Atlantic have shifted in recent days to a
new pattern in which the Northeast and Middle Atlantic are exposed
to the likelihood of cold, stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
   How that will play out over the next few weeks is not certain;
but government forecasters predict that February will be warmer
than normal in the southern tier of the country but colder than
normal in the northern tier, with above-normal precipitation in the
Northeast, Ohio Valley, Midwest and Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pacific Decadal Oscillation persists in its new state,
experts say, it might also portend drier weather and more frequent
droughts in the southern tier. Moreover, increased hurricane
activity is associated with this phase of the oscillation, and
there has been such an increase in the last five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scientists believe that large-scale climatic fluctuations like
the Pacific oscillation affect the global temperature. The last
time the oscillation was in its present state, from about 1945 to
about 1976, a global warming trend that had begun early in the
century leveled off. Then it resumed when the oscillation flipped
to its opposite state, rising in the 1990s to the highest level
ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, according to federal scientists, the
average global surface temperature has risen at a rate equal to 3.5
degrees Fahrenheit per century. (The world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer
now than in the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years
ago.) The dominant view among experts is that emissions of
heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide are
responsible for at least part of the last century's global warming
of about one degree.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been unsure what would happen to the global
temperature if the Pacific oscillation entered a new phase. Last
year, with La Nina exerting a global cooling influence, the average
surface temperature of the earth was the fifth highest recorded
since 1880. The previous year, when El Nino dominated the climate,
the average temperature was the highest.

 &HT;    Jordan signs on to lead Wizards
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The startling business partnership of old-time
Washington owner Abe Pollin, basketball great Michael Jordan and
super-agent David Falk would have been unthinkable, even a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a celebrated meeting last winter during the NBA lockout,
Jordan lectured Pollin, telling him to sell if he could not compete
for talent and make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Jordan was ``Mr. Union,'' Hawks president Stan
Kasten said, ``I expect his views will be altered. Of course, Isiah
Thomas and Magic Johnson underwent similar evolutions,'' with
Toronto and the Lakers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very curious about that myself,'' said Dikembe Mutombo,
union vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, the agent for many of the league's best players, including
current Wizards starters Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland, has been
Pollin's harshest critic over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Jordan was brought into the organization as
director of basketball operations, a deal that includes an equity
stake in the team that Jordan bought from minority owner Ted
Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings group, which owns the NHL Washington
Capitals. Just months earlier, the retired Bulls star failed to
gain control of the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's stake could increase to 20 percent when majority owner
Abe Pollin decides to sell. Leonsis, an America Online executive,
has right of first refusal to become the majority owner. It is
believed that Pollin wants to retain his majority stake until after
the 2001 NBA All-Star Game in Washington's MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will report to Pollin only. Everyone else in the
organization will report to Jordan. Falk's official role, if any,
has not been spelled out. The changes are not expected to result in
any firings in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The club's financial obligation to Howard and Strickland will
take up a sizable chunk of Washington's $52 million payroll for
next season. Howard, who's averaging 14 points per game, will go to
$18.75 million. The next season, he goes to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards have been among the league's worst teams for more
than a decade; they failed to win a playoff game in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jordan's boosters is Hawks assistant Stan Albeck, who
coached him in Chicago in 1985-86. ``When he was young, he would
take his beating in any kind of game, in backgammon, whatever,''
Albeck said. ``But once he learned that game, he would kill you. If
you challenged him, he'd kill you. I'm not so sure if he ran for
president he couldn't be elected. That's how he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to go at this with all of his energies, just like
he played,'' Albeck said. ``He'll find some disappointments along
the way, battling the salary cap, but he's got a resolve unlike any
I've seen. If there's a way, he'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo said he is most concerned that Jordan will abandon the
cause of the players and throw himself into the owners' camp with
the same zeal that made him a great player.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan indicated a change of sympathies in his news conference,
saying he wanted the Wizards players to ``accept responsibility for
the salaries they're being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will go totally against us,'' Mutombo said,
``but I am very interested to see if he ever pays a player the same
salary ($30 million) he received in his last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who won six titles with Jordan and
the Bulls, said: ``He'll make mistakes like any other businessman.
He's been associated with so many people that have been successful,
it's hard to believe he's not going to latch onto something
successful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce wondered how Jordan would
deal with adversity. ``I can't tell Michael Jordan to have
patience. I have none. If I'm nuts because I can't control a game,
how's he going to be? I don't drive home after games so I don't
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston coach and president Rick Pitino said Jordan faces an
enormous task. ``My advice to him would be to stay on the golf
course,'' Pitino said. ``If his motive is to be a businessman and
to make money, I would stay with commercials. If his motive is to
be a part of professional basketball, then he would add to the game
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls general manager Jerry Krause was openly contemptuous:
``Maybe Michael thinks he can inspire the Wizards to win big
without making any moves.''

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE LONG DRY SPELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- New satellite images of warming Pacific waters
indicate Southern California may be entering a dry spell that could
last at least 20 years, NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some weather forecasters disagree questioned whether there was
enough information to predict with certainty that the current La
Nina weather pattern will bring a third year -- let alone decades
-- of dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   What's crystal clear, however, is that the region will have
difficulty rebounding from two years without much rain as the
wildfire danger rises daily and water supply is always critical,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographer William Patzert at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's JPL facility in La Canada Flintridge said he
believes satellite data of sea-surface temperatures and heights
indicate a change in the cycle known as the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation. He said it appears we're leaving a period of
wetter-than-normal weather for a drier era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bigger than El Nino or La Nina. These things last
anywhere from 20 to 30 years. It's a very strong pattern,'' said
Patzert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very natural part of the climate system. It's what
Mother Nature does.''
</P>
<P>
   After examining images from NASA's TOPEX/Poseidon satellite
earlier this month, Patzert conferred with colleagues at a meeting
last week of the American Meteorological Society, and decided the
data were conclusive enough to announce the findings.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of a parched future should give pause, Patzert
said, even though the region gets its drinking water from elsewhere
the mountains of the High Sierras, where it has snowed heavily
while the Southland has been bone-dry.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of wildfires and the threat to agriculture in Ventura
County, for example, are reasons enough to be alert for the coming
dry oscillation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are looking at lower-than-normal rainfall, that's
important information,'' he said. ``These shifts in the climate
system are something you have to live with. These are powerful
planning tools. The last Decadal Oscillation ran from about
1976-1998, and brought with it more wet, El Nino winters than usual
althought there was a period of drought conditions. The previous
cycle, from about 1945-1976, had more dry La Nina winters than
usual, and Patzert said it looks like we're such dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has profound implications, considering the population has
doubled around here in the past 50 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe the forecast is premature, however.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cayan, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography, said the current dry weather is a concern, but it may
not be a harbinger of arid winters for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true we've had a fairly unusual year-to-year recurrence''
of La Nina, Cayan said. But there's a fair likelihood the weather
will revert closer to normal next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with predicting Decadal Oscillations is that
extensive data only exists from about 1900, he said. And when
discussing years, that doesn't make for very many cycles to
analyze.
</P>
<P>
   Cayan added that the signs pointing to the advent of a Decadal
Oscillation aren't clear, and could be pointing to something else
researchers just aren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to predict things more than a half-year in
advance,'' Cayan said. And ``it's hard to know you're in one state
or another of a decadal pattern until you've been in it a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Higgins, senior meteorologist with the national Climate
Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md., said the signs are faint
and gradual, so it's hard to identify an oscillation almost until
you're in th ``It's such a slow evolution, you have to have decades
of data before you recognize it as a wiggle in your time series,''
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Patzert said he's not ready to bet his own money that the dry
cycle has begun, but said the indicators are there, and that it is
``Rather than be the tentative scientist and wait until 10 years
into it, this is a heads-up,'' he said. ``It's important to have a
dialogue and talk about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayan agreed that more arid seasons in coming years will
compound the harm caused by the current dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California is going to have a hard time making up the
difference for this winter,'' Cayan said. ``We definitely have
reason for concern this year. And we need to be watchful in the
next winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, Los Angeles has received only .86 inches of rain,
when the average for that span is 6.50 inches, Patzert said.
</P>
<P>
   And the past dry and wet Pacific Decadal Oscillations become
obvious when looking at historical rainfall totals
</P>
<P>
   for example, the numbers collected at Pierce College over the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1949 (the earliest year for which data are available) to
1976, 19 of the years had below-average rainfall while seven years
were above-average. From 1977-1999, only 11 years were below
average while 12 above-average rainfall
</P>
<P>
   and that's despite a long drought in the late 1980s.

STUDY RANKS EXPENSIVE CITIES IN WHICH TO DO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While it ranks as one of the most expensive
cities in Southern California in which to do business, Los Angeles
is a downright bargain compared with New York and Washington, D.C,
concludes a new business survey.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco charges its businesses a higher tax rate,
according to the sixth annual ``Kosmont Cost of Doing Business
Survey compiled by Los Angeles-based real estate firm Kosmont &AMP;
Associates. A copy of the report to be released Monday was obtained
by the Daily News on Wedneday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, expanded this year to include major cities
nationwide, shows Los Angeles to be among the most expensive,
especially in Southern California in which to do business.
</P>
<P>
   And it found the city encircled by a host of low cost
municipalities in the San Fernando Valley region, San Gabriel
Valleys and Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is actually less expensive than a number of the
major cities. Washington and New York are more expensive than
L.A.,'' said Larry Kosmont, president of Kosmont &AMP; Associates, a
consulting firm that helps cities strike deals with businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of doing business in a city can often be the
tiebreaker between a couple of final locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cities in California compare favorably with those across
the nation in terms of business taxes, largely because of the
state's limit on property taxes mandated by Proposition 13, Kosmont
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cities surrounding Los Angeles fall into the lower-cost
categories in the study, achieving rankings of ``low cost'' or
``very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   This can put Los Angeles at a competitive disadvantage, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that Los Angeles is a high-cost island in a sea
of cities that are good deals when it comes to doing business.
</P>
<P>
   To the Northeast are 12 incorporated cities from Glendale to
Lancaster and into Ventura County that ranked as either low cost or
medium cost places to do business.
</P>
<P>
   They include Agoura Hills, Burbank, Calabasas, Camarillo,
Glendale, Lancaster, Oxnard, Palmdale, San Fernando, Santa Clarita,
Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, and Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   On the city's eastern flank are 19 municipalities considered
more friendly to business. Two of these -- Pasadena and Pomona --
received a medium cost rating.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, including Covina, Arcadia, Norwalk, Diamond Bar, West
Covina and Whittier, are considered either low cost of very low
cost for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Delgadillo, Los Angeles deputy mayor for economic
development, said the city is focused on developing a
business-friendly image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have stiff competition from our surrounding
cities,'' Delgadillo said. ``Los Angeles has competitive advantages
even though our tax structure might be more expensive than some of
our surrounding cties. A Los Angeles address is more and more
important to companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also measures the number of business attraction or
retention projects cities undertake during a calandar or fiscal
year. These include the kind of public-private partnerships that
Kosmont's firm helps arrange.
</P>
<P>
   This type of activity varies even among cities that have the
same cost ranking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Palmdale and Santa Clarita are in the low cost
category. But Palmdale made 10 or more incentive deals last year
while Santa Clarita did not do any.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Haviland, economic development manager for the city of
Santa Clarita, said his city doesn't want to give away money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cities feel they compete most effectively giving away
financial assistnce,'' he said. ``When you're giving away
incentives, you're giving away some of your city's tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delgadillo notes that in a larger city such as Los Angeles
these kinds of deals are crucial. And their cost is more than
offset their overall impact on the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public-private partnerships are critical to the future of
economic development in any local municipality. They leverage tax
dollars with private capital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delgadillo said one example of this is the former General Motors
plant in Van Nuys, where the city spent $4 million in federal funds
to build a road into the industrial portion of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We removed what would have been an incredibly blighted site in
the city of Los Angeles,'' Delgadillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the state of California is an average tax burden state,
said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   And business taxes are fairly far down the list of elements that
determine location.
</P>
<P>
   Companies considering a move generally examine the schools, the
labor force, the proximity to their customers and suppliers and the
community's amenities before looking at taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosmont agrees but notes the tax structure can be a deal maker
or breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at the real estate opportunity, the labor pool, the
convenience to clients and suppliers. Then the question is: How
much does it cost to operate there? That's where you can find that
the business friendliness is a factor.''

BOEING EARINGS TOP ESTIMATES, BUT ANALYSTS WORRY ABOUT R&AMP;D 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. Wednesday posted solid fourth quarter
earnings that easily beat the best estimates of Wall Street, and
executives gave an upbeat assessment for 2000 that includes more
airplane deliveries than had been forecast and higher profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted by sending Boeing's stock up more than $2 a
share to match its 52-week high of $47.63 set last July.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong showing that saw profits of $662 million
companywide, up 42 percent over those of the 4th quarter a year
ago, some analysts expressed concern during a teleconference with
company executives about a steep decline in research and
development in Boeing's commercial airplanes group.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three months of 1999, research and development
was only $89 million, or less than 1 percent of the group's revenue
of $10 billion. In the fourth quarter of 1998, research and
development was $222 million for the commercial group on revenues
of $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at a historic low relative to revenues,'' said aerospace
analyst Peter Jacobs of the Seattle firm of Regan MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said the $89 million
figure helps explain why some of Boeing's engineers have privately
griped that the company seems more bent on making a profit and
pleasing shareholders than on taking financial risks on new
aircraft development programs.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Aboulafia, senior aerospace analyst with the Teal
Group, a market research firm, said he believes some of his fellow
analysts who closely follow Boeing are worried that the company, if
it does not boost its commercial research and development, could
follow the unfortunate path of the Douglas Aircraft Co..
</P>
<P>
   Douglas eventually was unable to mount a challenge to Boeing
because it failed to invest enough in its commercial operations, he
said. Douglas was bought by the McDonnell Aircraft Corp. in 1967,
which was unable to turn the commercial business around. Boeing
bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would seem to be this worry out there about a Boeing
ruled by Wall Street that has been Douglasized,'' Aboulafia said,
``of a post-industrial Boeing that is running its production lines
for cash. ... But I don't really see enough evidence of that to be
concerned''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Boeing spends from 3 percent to 5 percent of revenue
on research and development, depending on where it is in the
manufacturing cycle, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that can be attributed to where they are in terms of
development spending on new planes,'' Jacobs said of the $89
million for the 4th quarter. The company has completed development
of several new derivative planes, such as the 767-400 now in flight
test and the 757-300 which is in service. But it has not yet
started development of the ultra long range 777-200X and 777-300X.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you would expect a natural decline in R&AMP;D spending,''
Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit, during the teleconference with
analysts and the media, downplayed the drop in research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he said, ``will always swing as we come in and out
of development programs.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, commercial research and development spending
was $585 million on revenues of $38.4 billion. In 1998, Boeing's
commercial group had just over $1 billion in research and
development on revenues of $36.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the company's other
two core business groups are Space and Communications, headquarterd
in Seal Beach., Calif., and Military Aircraft and Missiles,
headquartered in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, research and development in the 4th quarter was
$315 million on revenues of $15.2 billion. For the year, research
and development companywide was $1.34 billion on total 1999
revenues of $59.9 billion, compared to $1.9 billion for all of 1998
on revenues of $56.2 billion. In 1990, Boeing's overall research
and development spending was $827 million on revenues of $27.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said
the decline in commercial research and development is no cause for
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be upset if they were spending money without any major
development programs to spend it on,'' he said. But Aboulafia said
is worried that that the drop in commercial research and
development might signal that Boeing has decided to further delay
the launch of its 777X planes. The two Boeing planes will compete
against two Airbus planes _ the A340-500 and the A340-600 that are
already in development. While Boeing waits to launch, Airbus
continues to sign up new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are endless concerns (among analysts) about the 777X
because right now Boeing is conceding market to the A340-500 and
-600,'' Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing has not yet set a launch date for the 777X, it has
selected General Electric to build the most powerful engines ever
for a commercial airplane. Boeing also has set a tentative delivery
date of September 2003 for the first 777X.
</P>
<P>
   Asian carriers want a plane that can fly long routes than the
current versions of the 777 and the Airbus A340. Any 777X launch,
Condit said `` will be driven by customers, not by our timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has also talked about development of a bigger and
longer-range version of its flagship 747-400. But Condit said the
747X Stretch, as the project is called, will not be developed any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a large number of 747 customers around the world who
see a need for a higher capacity, higher capability 747,'' Condit
said. ``It is not a high priority with any of our major customers
at this point, but one that is of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing will continue to talk with customers about the
747X Stretch, but added: ``We don't see any immediacy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit did say that Boeing might even be able to increase
production slightly of its current 747-400 by the end of the year.
The 747 is Boeing' most profitable airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see renewed interest in the 747, which I view as very
positive,'' Condit said. Orders for the 747 fell and production
dropped from 5 to the present two planes per month because of the
economic downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Condit, who was joined in the teleconference by Debby Hopkins,
the company's chief financial officer, was upbeat about Boeing's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we enter 2000,'' he said, ``Boeing is in the right place.
We have a solid financial position. We have a solid strategic
position. We have a great brand. As a result we see absolutely
tremendous opportunity ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Net margins, or profit as a percentage of revenues, rose to 4.4
percent in the quarter from 2.7 percent a year earlier. For 1999,
commercial airplane operating margins rose to 5.2 percent from a
negative 0.7 percent in 1998, when the division lost $266 million
as it struggled through costly production bottlenecks. Commercial
margins in the fourth quarter of 1999 hit 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 620 airplanes last year, but had
previously said it would only deliver 480 planes this year. That
estimate for 2000 has been revised to 490 planes, Condit and
Hopkins said. They said about the same number of commercial jets
will be delivered in 2001.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
A four-game winning streak. Four straight home games in the next
week. Three of their next five games against Denver and Minnesota,
the two teams directly ahead of them in the Western Conference
standings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could it be that the focus during the second half of the
Rockets' season might actually be on battling for a playoff spot
rather than wondering how many pingpong balls they will put into
the lottery hopper?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Rockets are playing their best basketball of the
season as they host Denver tonight at Compaq Center, they remain 6{
games behind Minnesota for the final playoff berth in the West.
They trail No. 9 Denver by four games, but the Nuggets have lost
four straight games and are 2-7 since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for four games, but it's only four games,''
said Rockets point guard Steve Francis, who is averaging 25.8
points, 11 assists and 5.5 rebounds during the streak. ``It's not
like we're winning the championship. It's been a big confidence
boost for us, but we have to come out and play the next game just
like the last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis is nearing the halfway point of his rookie season, but
he has taken over as the leader of the Rockets. He has had
conversations with some of the veterans on the team about what it
will take to become a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing they say is that in order to be a playoff team
you have to play together late in the season,'' said Francis. ``To
get to the playoffs, we won't sneak up on anybody. We're trying to
come from the bottom. It's going to be a long journey.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking repeated classes in the school of hard knocks
during the first portion of the season, the Rockets seem to have
learned what it takes to close out a win. In 10 of their first 12
losses this season, they had a lead during the fourth quarter and
let it slip away.
</P>
<P>
   During the winning streak, the Rockets are delivering in crunch
time. They beat Chicago 93-90 and Portland 90-89. Both teams had a
chance to overtake the Rockets on their final possession, but the
results were different. Before winning those games, the Rockets
were 1-8 in games decided by five points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just comes with maturity, experience and chemistry,''
said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``You've just got to go
through it. It's good to see that after some of that suffering we
had and those disappointments, there is a payoff. Their nervous
system is getting used to those situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played good defense in the final minute last night
(Tuesday against Portland). In November or December, that might not
have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who was bearing the brunt of criticism during the
late-game collapses earlier in the season, believes the Rockets
have learned what they have to do in the late minutes of a close
game. While he would rather not have gone through it, the losses
might be having a positive effect at this stage of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to lose to learn to win, but it helps you to
have that feeling of how many times you've been ahead in the fourth
quarter and how many games you lost down the stretch,'' said
Francis. ``We pretty much have learned the lesson. We're getting
better at keeping the lead late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose four or five games in two weeks when you're ahead
in the fourth quarter, it teaches you a lesson every time. You
remember those games, and you try to make sure you don't get caught
doing the same things. I think that's starting to show now.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of rookies Francis and forward Kenny Thomas has
been one of the keys to the Rockets' current success. Thomas has
totaled 42 points with 26 rebounds in his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   To Thomas, Tuesday's win over Portland made a statement that the
young Rockets might be coming of age. The first three wins in their
streak were against Golden State, Chicago and Dallas, teams near
the bottom of the NBA pecking order. The win over Portland, a
legitimate championship contender, was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) said before the (Portland)
game, that we don't get too much respect from a lot of people,''
said Thomas. ``He said if we beat Portland, it's going to help us.
That's a real playoff team, a Finals team, I think. We played hard
for every minute of that game, and that's something we know we have
to do every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has played in two games after missing seven weeks
because of a hernia. He is coming along slowly, but his mere
presence seems to have given the Rockets a jolt of confidence. In
turn, Olajuwon is impressed with the closeness of the team despite
its struggles in the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unique feeling to have on a team, where
everyone is happy and enjoys being part of the team,'' said
Olajuwon. ``Every player _ if he's playing or not playing _ still
feels happy just to be a part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The next five games may give a better indication of where the
Rockets are headed _ to playoff contention or pingpong land. They
reach the midway point of the season during this stretch, in which
they play Denver twice, Miami, Minnesota and Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich isn't looking that far ahead. He is focused on
tonight's game against Denver and nothing more. However, he was in
an effusive mood after practice Wednesday morning, something that
hasn't always been the case this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so much fun to see a young team get some success,''
said Tomjanovich. ``It builds so much confidence. One of the things
we've been trying to tell our guys is that it can happen _ we can
beat good teams. It doesn't matter who you are or what your record
is, if you do the right things on the court and if you execute, you
can get the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed the hell out of this last week.''

FATAL TEXAS A&AMP;M BONFIRE FELL `LIKE A SET OF CARDS,' DOCUMENTS
INDICATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M engineers who visited the
scene of the Nov. 18 fatal Bonfire collapse said the tower of logs
did not just topple over but went down like a house of cards,
swallowing at least two of its victims.
</P>
<P>
   At least one questioned whether the lack of written construction
plans for the stack of hardwood that stretched more than 50 feet
into the air might have contributed to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ray W. James, an associate research engineer at the school, was
concerned that the design of the Bonfire might have slowly and
inadvertently been changed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing is the process probably leads to a cumulative
variation,'' James said during a meeting held just five days after
the collapse. ``They learn from the previous leaders, so if the
previous leader decides to do something different, the next year
they do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   James urged investigators to look at whether plans for the
Bonfire, which was built each year since 1909 for pep rallies
preceding the annual Texas A&AMP;M-University of Texas football games,
had changed.
</P>
<P>
   James was one of 10 engineering professors, associates and
consultants who sat down to share their thoughts on the Bonfire
collapse, which killed 12 and injured 27 others. Transcripts of the
Nov. 23 meeting were among the documents released by the university
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Texas A&AMP;M Board of Regents authorized the
university to spend up to $1 million on the investigation into the
cause of the calamity. A special commission, headed by Houston
engineer Leo Linbeck Jr., is conducting the investigation. Linbeck
previously has said the investigation could cost more than
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Keating, an associate professor of civil engineering,
attended the Nov. 23 meeting of engineers. Keating said it appeared
as the Bonfire fell a gap opened between the second and third of
the structure's four tiers and the students working in those areas
plummeted inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found significant was the last two victims that we
pulled out. It appeared that quite possibly the second tier opened
up and they slid down in between the logs,'' Keating said. ``The
whole stack came over them and they got trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Also during the meeting, Keating repeatedly expressed concerns
about the strength of the centerpole, which consisted of two pine
telephone poles spliced together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can discount the centerpole completely. I
think had it been stronger, things would have been different,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alton Rogers, a structural/geotechnical engineering consultant,
said he believes the Bonfire structure was tilting in the direction
it fell. When it started to fall, the ground-level tier probably
began rotating outward in the direction of a slope in the ground,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the bottom tier twisted toward the south, the second tier
appeared to have spliced into it ``like a set of cards'' being
shuffled, he said. The sudden, violent force formed the cavern that
trapped the two students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An eyewitness told Rogers a rope attached to a northwest pole
snapped just as the logs came down, indicating ``significant
tension'' on the ropes on that side.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I believe that the stack was basically out of balance and
just fell downhill, to put it in simple terms,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else at the meeting speculated inexperience played a
role in the disaster. The speaker, whose identity is not clear in
the records but who is identified as an Aggie from the Class of
1974, said 25 years ago only junior and senior supervisors _ known
as ``redpots'' _ were allowed to climb up on the stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of this tragedy is that we had freshmen and
sophomores out there tying those logs who have absolutely no
experience,'' he said.
</P>

WARNER-LAMBERT AND AMERICAN HOME SEEK NEW MERGER SUITORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an outsider trying to end their engagement, Warner-Lambert
and American Home Products are casting about for other possible
suitors, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, executives close to the
companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert executives have been trying to fend off a
takeover offer from Pfizer, but last week tacitly acknowledged the
strength of Pfizer's bid by agreeing to hold merger discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Having in effect put themselves up for sale, Warner-Lambert
officials now have a responsibility to find the best deal for
shareholders and a desire to find the best deal for themselves.
Warner-Lambert and American Home are working together because they
remain legally tethered by their merger agreement reached in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Procter &AMP; Gamble, the giant consumer products company
known for Tide and Pampers, is considered an unlikely partner. It
has only a small drug business and has no big winner in the
category. Neither P&AMP;G nor the other companies would comment
Wednesday on the talks, which were reported Wednesday in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Wednesday that they doubted P&AMP;G's
conservative board would be willing to make such a sudden shift
into the drug business, which requires big bets on risky research
for big payoffs. The cost of a merger with Warner-Lambert alone
would be high. To wrest Warner-Lambert away from Pfizer, P&AMP;G would
have to put up more than $78 billion, the current market value of
Pfizer's stock offer. Any suitor for Warner-Lambert and American
Home must also consider potential liabilities, such as those
American Home faces regarding the diet drug fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday how committed Procter &AMP; Gamble might be
or whether American Home would be part of any deal. At one point,
people close to the companies said P&AMP;G would make an announcement
later in the day that it was in talks with Warner-Lambert. But no
announcement followed.
</P>
<P>
   Several stock analysts said they expected Pfizer to carry the
day with Warner-Lambert but at a slightly higher price than the
current offer.
</P>
<P>
   If Pfizer wins, many Warner-Lambert executives, including
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, its chairman, are expected to be forced out.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was announced by Warner-Lambert and American Home,
company executives said there would be cost-saving synergies. P&AMP;G
could use those savings to pay a premium for the two drug
companies. After the drug operations were consolidated and merged
into P&AMP;G, industry experts say the new company could be split into
at least two divisions, pharmaceuticals and consumer products. De
Vink and his team would then probably run the pharmaceutical unit.
The consumer products unit would include the many P&AMP;G staples;
Warner-Lambert's Schick brand of shaving products and Dentyne gum,
and American Home's Advil pain reliever and Robitussin cough syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.,
compared Warner-Lambert to a fisherman in Alaska using ``a
long-line fishing net, with thousands of hooks, to catch anything
that swims by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for a white knight to save them,'' he said,
``a place where management will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $4.8125, to $94.8125. P&AMP;Gs shares
fell $1.75, to $115.1875. Pfizer's shares rose 50 cents, to $37,
while American Home rose $1.8125, to $46.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert has some attractive properties. Lipitor, its
cholesterol-lowering drug, is expected to become the top-selling
drug in the world in a couple of years. Last year, it brought in
$3.7 billion, and Warner-Lambert expects $5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays for virtually anything you ever dreamed of,'' Sweig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipitor is the main reason Pfizer refuses to walk away. Under an
agreement, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert market Lipitor jointly, with
Pfizer getting roughly half of the profits. Pfizer, whose
aggressive sales force is responsible for much of the drug's
worldwide success, very much wants all of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   If Warner-Lambert's preliminary talks with P&AMP;G prove fruitful,
P&AMP;G would become a giant in the pharmaceutical world. Though P&AMP;G is
not skilled in the processes that drug companies are using to find
new drugs, one of its top skills _ marketing to supermarket
shoppers _ is growing in importance in the pharmaceutical industry.
Drug companies have begun to spend heavily on advertising to
consumers, hoping that patients will tell their doctors about the
product they saw in a magazine ad or on a TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But stock analysts see few other ways in which the companies
would be a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be a good combination,'' said Sergio
Traversa, a pharmaceutical analyst at Mehta Partners, an investment
firm in New York. ``How many synergies can you have with Tide and
Lipitor?''
</P>
<P>
   If Pfizer triumphs, what is to become of American Home? It will
then have been left behind by its selected partner for a third time
in two years (SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Under a breakup provision in its agreement with Warner-Lambert,
American Home will probably walk away with at least $2 billion,
which will help it settle the thousands of lawsuits that have been
filed by people who say they were harmed by its diet drug fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made $2 billion doing absolutely nothing,'' Traversa
said. ``They come out in a good position to do the next deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Warner-Lambert reported a 40 percent
increase in fourth-quarter profits _ a rise largely led by sales of
Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted net income of $487 million, or 55 cents for
each diluted share, in the fourth quarter. That compares with $349
million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company said sales rose 20 percent last year, to $12.9
billion. Lipitor sales rose more than 70 percent, to $3.7 billion.

GIULIANI CAMPAIGN SAYS IT BROUGHT IN $12 MILLION IN '99 DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign disclosed
Wednesday that it collected $12 million last year, reaping numerous
donations from people across the country vexed at the notion of his
opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, mounting a political career.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement bolstered predictions that the New York contest
would easily be among the most expensive congressional races ever.
While the state is perennially a costly place to win elections,
Mrs. Clinton's celebrity has been a catalyst for fund-raising by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign had declined to release its total, but after the
Giuliani campaign made its figures public in the afternoon, Mrs.
Clinton's advisers announced that she had taken in $8 million. It
was emblematic of the pronounced role of money in the race that her
advisers then sought to explain why her total was not higher,
pointing out, for example, that she had been raising money only
since the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tallies for both campaigns break the record for
fund-raising in the year before a Senate election, which was set by
Alfonse D'Amato, who collected more than $6 million in 1997 in his
unsuccessful 1998 bid to win a fourth term. The $20 million
collected by the Giuliani and Clinton campaigns is a remarkable
tally, considering that candidates who are not incumbents
traditionally raise most of their money in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   The figures discussed Wednesday did not include money raised by
the political parties, which are likely to pour several million
dollars more into the New York race, much of it in the unregulated
donations known as soft money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor, a Republican, did hold fund-raising events in New
York, and his aides said Wednesday that the campaign had received
donations from all of the state's 62 counties. But the surprise was
its ability to reach out to contributors outside New York; campaign
officials displayed several cartons of letters at a news conference
Wednesday _ responses to solicitations intended to take advantage
of anger toward the Clintons among Republicans around the nation. A
quick search of one of the boxes found letters from Kansas City,
Mo., Wilmington, Del., and Cincinnati, but not New York.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers would not say what percentage of the money
came from direct mail, but they suggested that they had been
stunned by their success at raising money outside the state. They
also maintained that some of the checks had come from non-New
Yorkers appreciative of the mayor's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an aggressive direct mail operation,'' said Bruce
Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager. ``It's been our
experience that a significant portion of contributions that we
receive through direct mail are generated by the positive feelings
that people have for New York after visiting here, and they credit
the mayor for the turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the campaign had received 90,000 donations, with
an average of $110 each, asserting that those figures were evidence
that Giuliani was conducting a grass-roots fund-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign sought to impart a darker motive for the
donations from outside New York. ``The mayor has clearly tapped
into a national network of well-funded right-wing donors intent on
keeping Hillary Clinton's progressive policies from the Senate,''
her campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   De Blasio also hinted that the mayor was using the resources of
city government to help his campaign, questioning how Giuliani had
been able to raise so much money with a relatively small political
staff. Both sides have complained that their opponents have used
government resources for political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns would not release lists of donors, which they
are required to make public at the end of the month when they
submit mandatory disclosure records to the Federal Election
Commission. But in another important measure of strength, the
Giuliani campaign said it had $7 million to $8 million in the bank,
while the Clinton campaign said it had nearly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The record for a Senate race was the $44 million spent by Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat, who defeated Michael Huffington in 1994 in
California. But much of that money came from Huffington's personal
fortune. The second most expensive race was the New York contest
between D'Amato, a Republican, and Charles Schumer in 1998, which
cost $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   The record for fund-raising by a nonincumbent who did not use
personal money was set by Oliver North, a Republican who collected
$21 million in 1994 in Virginia in his losing race against Sen.
Charles Robb. The direct mail operation of North, an influential
figure among some conservatives, also thrived.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York announcements Wednesday indicate, all these
records are likely to fall in this year's New York Senate race. The
Giuliani campaign's success in amassing a sizable list of small
donors in particular portends well for its fund-raising.
Politicians prize lists of donors who have given less than the
limit because they are considered reliable sources of future
support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Teitelbaum was promoting his large treasury, he was
at the same time engaging in the customary exercise of trying to
lower expectations in an effort to avoid fallout if the coming
months are not so fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   The current numbers are strong, he said, while pointedly adding
that ``We fully expect them to outraise us.''

ROSENTHAL TO BE A DAILY NEWS COLUMNIST
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A.M. Rosenthal, who departed The New York Times in
November at 77, after 55 years as a reporter, foreign
correspondent, editor and columnist, will be writing for a
competitor in Manhattan, The (New York) Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, Rosenthal will write a column for the
newspaper's op-ed page every Friday, The News announced Wednesday.
The column, like others in The News, will be untitled, bearing his
byline and picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind another 20 words instead of the picture,''
Rosenthal commented Wednesday. He was chief editor at The Times for
17 years, until he stepped down in 1986 with the title of executive
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goodwin, editorial page editor of The News, said
Rosenthal would have an office there and be invited to sit in on
editorial board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said that writing his column for The Times, ``On My
Mind,'' for nearly 13 years ``was particularly satisfactory to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to write for The News was ``kind of exhilarating,''
he said, adding, ``I'll write about the full range of subjects I
wrote about for The Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Rosenthal have qualms about writing for a competitor of The
Times? ``No,'' he said. ``I don't think The News and The Times are
going to destroy each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman and co-publisher of The Daily News,
described Rosenthal as ``an incandescent talent in the world of
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the pre-eminent man of the world of newspapers in the
postwar period, and his column will be a tremendous addition to The
News,'' Zuckerman added.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal will be an additional columnist at The News, joining
such regular columnists as Stanley Crouch, John Leo, Lars-Erik
Nelson and Sidney Zion, who was once a legal reporter at The Times.
``I hired Sidney, and now we'll be occupying the same op-ed page,''
Rosenthal said. His new superior, Goodwin, was also a reporter at
The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal declined to reveal his salary, saying, ``I won't tell
you, but I have a smile on my face.'' What will his first column be
about? ``That's all I've been thinking about,'' he said. ``I don't
think I'll decide until the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said The News approached him in December. ``Mort told
me that the editors at The News wanted me to write a column, and
that he did too,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Mort that I will now make both of us rich and famous,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, Rosenthal's new editor, said the column would be 750
words long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, 760 words,'' Rosenthal said.

FAR-RIGHTISTS FROZEN OUT IN AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After three months of wrangling, the two parties that
have long dominated Austrian politics announced Wednesday that they
have once again formed a government.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet has yet to be announced, but the deal means that the
right-wing Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider, which came in second
in October's elections, will be kept out of government.
</P>
<P>
   Haider is notorious for his anti-immigration policies and for
two remarks he made years ago that seemed sympathetic to the Third
Reich; he apologized for the comments in November. His party's
second-place finish alarmed many Europeans, and Israel threatened
to break off relations if he became part of a ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The two coalition parties are the union-backed Social Democrats
and the pro-business Austrian People's Party, known as the reds and
blacks. It is no secret that leaders of both groups dislike each
other, and Haider predicted Wednesday that the coalition would not
last.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties were given new impetus to settle their
differences last week when an opinion poll suggested that voters
were so unhappy with their bickering that they might put Haider's
party in first place if a new election is held.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's October campaign combined attacks on immigration and
enlargement of the European Union with an appeal to voters fed up
with the two parties, whose cronyism dominated post-war Austrian
life. It became impossible to get a teaching post, a bank job or a
public apartment unless one could show the card of one party or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the hiatus since October, the two parties first failed to
meet, then fought over cabinet posts, budget cuts and the pace of
privatization. Last week they were scolded by President Thomas
Klestil, who warned that their failure to agree might force a new
election. He opposed letting Haider's party into government,
fearing it would hurt Austria's image.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the reds won 65 seats in Austria's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The blacks and the Freedom Party (sometimes called the blues)
each won 52, while the Greens won 14.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the race, Wolfgang Schuessel, leader of the black
party, had sworn he would not go back into the old coalition if his
party came in third. Technically it did, losing to the Freedom
Party by a few hundred votes after absentee ballots were counted;
but he was persuaded to break his promise. He ignored a public hint
from Haider that they could form a black-blue coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The new government's program, according to Reuters, which said
it had obtained a copy, plans to trim the budget deficit to 1
percent of GDP by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's partners in the euro had been showing nervousness
about its growing deficit caused by tax cuts and generous welfare
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum retirement age for men is to be raised to 62. The
government also plans to reduce its holdings in the national oil
company, steelmaker, tobacco company, post office, post office
bank, telephone company, and airline to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The program was seen as a compromise between the blacks, who
favor aggressive selling, and the reds, whose union backers want to
keep enough power to fight layoffs and salary cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said Wednesday that he expects union opposition to
paralyze the new government so that in the next elections, ``we
will be No. 1 and no one will be able to ignore the Freedom
Party.''

FIRE KILLS 3 AT SETON HALL; DOZENS INJURED IN SMOKE-FILLED DORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs to expand with updating and additional details; byline is
new; some of the witness quotes remain)  
 (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A smoky fire broke out in a lounge of the freshman dormitory at
Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., early Wednesday
morning, killing three students, injuring dozens more and sending
hundreds of residents into the forbidding cold of a day that would
shake their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the brief fire began at 4:30 in a
third-floor common area in the north wing of Boland Hall, a brick
dormitory with no sprinkler system and renowned on campus for its
frequent false fire alarms. The choking black smoke panicked and
disoriented students who later said they had become inured to the
alarms. A few escaped by following firefighters; one young man
jumped from a third-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire remained under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The screams of students roused Aliza Grautt from her sleep. The
18-year-old freshman from Lyndhurst, N.J., opened her door and,
with a neighbor, began feeling her way through the smoke. As they
approached a stairwell, she said, they saw what appeared to be a
fireball moving toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it got closer, we realized that it was a person on fire,''
Ms. Grautt said. ``He was rolling on the floor, trying to put out
the fire on his back. My friend just froze and started crying, and
we ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours afterward, a stream of ambulances, fire engines and
police cruisers shattered silence on the Roman Catholic college
campus, which was just days into its second semester. The fire was
just hours after its students had celebrated an upset victory by
its men's basketball team. Students huddled together to stem
confusion and seek comfort _ some wrapped in blankets, others
smeared with soot _ while officials talked of the mysteries of God
and tried not to cry.
</P>
<P>
   With morning's daylight came the sobering details. Two male
students had been burned to death, their bodies found in the
lounge. A third man overcome by smoke had been found in a room
nearby; efforts to revive him failed. Two firefighters, 3 police
officers and more than 50 other students were injured, including 6
who had been severely burned.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night officials identified the dead students as three
freshmen, all young men from New Jersey, all 18: Frank Caltabilota,
of West Long Branch; John Giunta, of Vineland; and Aaron Karol, of
Dunellen.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Campolo, the Essex County prosecutor whose office is
leading the inquiry into the fire, said Wednesday night that
investigators were seeking out students who may have been in the
lounge in the moments leading up to the fire. He said that
investigators were also conducting various tests, including one to
determine whether an accelerant played a role.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the fire had spurred a lot of misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into every possible aspect'' of the fire, he
said, shortly before the university held an evening prayer service
for students in the campus' Immaculate Conception chapel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Boland Hall is one of two dormitories at Seton Hall that have no
sprinkler systems; four others, all built in the mid-1980s, have
sprinklers. Campolo explained that Boland Hall was built in stages
between 1952 and 1966, before the enactment of state requirements
that all large residential buildings have sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
   Like most states, New Jersey does not require most owners to
retrofit existing buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During a somber noon news conference at the university, Campolo
played down the importance of the university's recent decision to
remove firehoses from standpipes on each of Boland Hall's six
floors. He said the hoses were intended for the use of firefighters
who tend to prefer their own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Grider, a university spokeswoman, added that the standpipe
hoses had become ``obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall University, sprawled across 58 acres of South Orange,
a relatively affluent community about 15 miles southwest of New
York City, is among the country's more prominent Catholic
universities. Its men's basketball team has had some success over
the years. The university's leaders adhere to a conservative
philosophy. On Monday, for example, classes for its school of
theology are canceled to allow students to attend an annual
anti-abortion march in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall's student body of 10,000 includes many who commute to
campus. But each year, more than 600 young adults get their first
taste of independence by being assigned to live in Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is banned; students are allowed to smoke in their rooms,
but not in common areas. But for all the rules, Boland has its
moments of immaturity, particularly regarding small fires and fire
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   One night in May 1996, for example, two fires broke out in
Boland _ in a love seat in one of the lounges, and in a trash can.
University officials are constantly using offers of rewards and
threats of expulsion to curtail false alarms; in 1995, a senior
facing expulsion withdrew from the university after admitting to
setting off an alarm in Boland.
</P>
<P>
   The problem continued into this school year. Ms. Grider said
that since September, Boland has had 18 false alarms, much less
than in previous years. Still, several students said Wednesday that
a series of false alarms rang through Boland during the week of
final examinations last semester.
</P>
<P>
   The current semester at Seton Hall is about a week old, so young
in fact that students are still choosing their coursework. Many
formally marked their return by cheering the Seton Hall Pirates
basketball team on to victory Tuesday night over the St. John's Red
Storm at the Continental Arena in East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About seven hours later, and while most of the campus slept, a
fire broke out in the third-floor lounge of Boland's northern wing,
a common area with a couple of couches, a corkboard and two
payphones. Campolo said investigators have not determined exactly
how or where the fire started. Although it created billows of smoke
that filled the building, he said the fire itself did not spread
into other rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couches were the primary combustible material,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said the fire automatically triggered the building's
fire alarms, alerting campus security. Security officers
immediately called the South Orange Fire Department, whose
headquarters is a mile away. In addition, he said, a student
provided ``verbal notification.'' Although he provided no further
information, the student may have been Virginia Wannamaker, an
18-year-old communications major from nearby Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wannamaker, who lives a few doors from where the fire broke
out, said that when she awoke to the sound of the alarm, her first
thought was that ``somebody was drunk and pulled the alarm.'' She
opened the door to encounter smoke so thick she could not see the
door of the room across the hall. She grabbed her cell phone,
called 911 and reported the fire.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for rescuers, Ms. Wannamaker said, she tried to
block the smoke from creeping into her room by stripping tape
across the top of the door and stuffing a comforter against the
bottom of the door. She said she and her roommates waited at their
third-floor window until resident assistants came with a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ```Hold on! Hold on!''' she recalled her rescuers yelling.
```We're coming!'''
</P>
<P>
   The fire had victims beyond the perimeters of the Seton Hall
campus: the parents of students.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Smith said that her 18-year-old son, Gabriel Smith, and
his roommate, John Giunta, tried to escape from Boland Hall
together. ``My son got to the exit and put a wet sock on his face
to get out,'' she said. ``When he got downstairs, he looked up and
John, who was right behind him, wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find him and we've checked six hospitals,'' Ms. Smith
said during a conversation earlier in the day. But by nightfall,
her son had learned that Giunta was among the dead.

 &HT;    Sit-in forces Florida Gov. Bush to delay plan to end affirmative
action
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Pandemonium rocked the Florida Capitol on
Wednesday as an act of civil disobedience threw the Legislature
into an all-day tailspin, and ultimately forced Republican Gov. Jeb
Bush to delay his prized program to end affirmative action in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour sit-in, mobilized a day earlier by two black
Democrats, escalated all day.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday, Tallahassee college students were swarming
outside the governor's first-floor office. Area clergymen began
leading marches and singing hymns.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats even scrapped an important meeting to elect new
officers because too many of their members had flocked outside
Bush's office _ where the wide double doors were locked shut with a
``No Access'' sign _ to join the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, holed up inside the personal offices of Lt. Gov.
Frank Brogan, Democratic Sen. Kendrick Meek of Miami and Rep. Tony
Hall of Jacksonville endured their sit-in with little sleep, little
food, little water, and little cooperation _ but stood their ground
as firmly as the governor stood his.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators, black and white, clearly enjoyed the
whole episode as a black eye for a new governor who has largely
been able to steamroll his agenda over pliant Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly overwhelmed with his power,'' said Rep. Lois
Frankel (D-West Palm Beach).
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I've been in the Legislature, I've never had
this much fun,'' said Rep. Lori Edwards (D-Auburndale). ``This is
national news, big time!''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration clouded Bush's carefully orchestrated
unveiling of his proposed budget, forcing him to announce it behind
closed doors, and sparked a rally against the governor at Florida
International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Bush and black lawmakers brokered a deal
that called for a delay until Feb. 17 of Friday's scheduled Board
of Regents vote on the plan, called One Florida, preceded by a
series of public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Regents had been expected to approve One Florida, which would
guarantee admission to the top 20 percent of the state's high
school seniors to some state universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate their anguish over this issue, but it certainly
won't alter my position,'' said regent C.B. Daniel of Gainesville.
``Governor Bush deserves a chance to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   While critics say the plan will make it more difficult for
minorities to get into college, Bush contends it will actually
increase the number of minorities in state universities.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Capitol ruckus finally began to unwind after noon,
when about 20 agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
physically escorted from Brogan's office nine reporters who stayed
with Meek and Hall to cover the sit-in. FDLE said the reporters
were trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   They were then forced to leave the Capitol, and were greeted by
dozens of lawmakers and protesters outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's order surprised several public officials. ``This is a
public building. Wherever any member of the public has a right to
be, the press has a right to be,'' said Sen. Ron Klein (D-Boca
Raton).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a public event?'' Sen. Locke Burt (R-Ormond Beach)
asked rhetorically. ``I'm glad I'm not governor.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING BLANKETS
</P>
<P>
   Meek and Hill said the sit-in was prompted by Bush's disregard
of their weeklong requests to talk about One Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the program _ much of which needs legislative approval
_ would increase minority enrollment in state universities and use
more state money to ensure that minority businesses get more
contracts. But Meek, Hill and several other black leaders argue the
governor's program will hurt gains already made through various
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The pair seized Brogan's offices at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, following
a meeting with Brogan and Bush in which the governor said he
wouldn't meet their demands. Bush then invited them to get some
blankets. They did.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later told reporters he was willing to discuss the One
Florida plan with legislators but said they offered no suggestions
for alternatives or how to improve prospects for minority-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied that reporters had a right to follow the lawmakers
after the sit-in began. ``It's not a public event when two members
of the Legislature take over an office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By morning, the nightlong sit-in provoked another sit-in outside
the locked doors. By 8:30 a.m., several black Democratic
legislators stationed themselves outside the governor's office and
began singing songs and chanting: ``We won't move'' and ``We'll
study war no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Capitol police were posted at every entryway to the Capitol
and bomb-sniffing dogs were sent to sweep the Capitol's first
floor. The door to the lobby of the governor's suite, which is
opened routinely every day to greet the public, remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Ron Greenstein (D-Coconut Creek), the locked door was a
symbol of the governor's inaccessibility. ``Locking his door isn't
showing he wants to work together,'' Greenstein said. ``This, to
me, is to prove who is going to be the meanest boy on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration forced Bush to move his presentation of his
proposed 2000-01 budget _ an event he and his staff have been
building up for the past week and a half _ from the wide open,
hard-to-isolate Cabinet meeting room to a smaller conference room
behind locked and guarded doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things more important to the people of Florida
than the governor's puff conference,'' said Rep. John Cosgrove
(D-Miami), who sat in front of the door.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opened the news conference by apologizing for a remark
caught on videotape Tuesday night, when he ordered his press
secretary to ``kick their asses out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday he made the remark ``out of frustration''
because the legislators and the reporters were trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a statement my mother wouldn't want me to repeat
because I used the A-word.''
</P>
<P>
   AN END TO THE SIT-IN
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, shortly before reporters were removed, Meek said,
``The question, is what is (Bush) going to do? Because, we're not
budging.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic members of the black legislative caucus,
including Sen. Mandy Dawson of Fort Lauderdale, then met for hours,
on and off, in the office of Jacksonville Sen. Betty Holzendorf, to
discuss possible solutions. By speaker phone, they bounced them off
of Meek and Hill before approaching Bush, House Speaker John
Thrasher (R-Orange Park) and Senate President Toni Jennings
(R-Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were not pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Thrasher told House Democratic Leader Les Miller
of Tampa that he hesitated to agree to a meeting in the Capitol on
Wednesday with all 20 members of the black caucus, saying, ``I'm
willing to set (an alternative) site up. It would be safe, be
secure. What I worry about is something getting out of hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise eventually reached _ and endorsed by Meek and
Hill only after Bush agreed to put his word in writing _ did
include a meeting with the whole caucus to discuss Bush's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not from a family of bigots. You couldn't be. It's not
in your genes,'' Meek's mother, U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek
</P>
<P>
   (D-Miami) told Bush. ``But we feel very strongly, we'd like to
sit down and work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. The delay might not affect
implementation of the governor's plan, said regents spokesman Keith
Goldschmidt. High school seniors who graduate in the top 20 percent
of their class this year will still be guaranteed admission, as
long as the plan is approved by the regents in February and by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the Feb. 17 regents meeting, three public
hearings on the program will be held, in Tallahassee, Tampa and
Miami, by a 15-member committee of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus dropped a requirement that Bush ``restore respect and
dignity to Rep. Hill and Sen. Meek.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the sit-in, which ended at 4 p.m., Bush
said: ``The Governor's Office belongs to the citizens of Florida.
As I stated previously, I will never allow it to be used again as a
vehicle for this type of protest, no matter what the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daryl Jones, head of the black caucus, wasn't as sure. If
the compromise doesn't work out, Jones said, ``We'll be back here,
doing this again.''

 &HT;    Small group gave Bush big money for governor's races, report
indicates
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A large part of George W. Bush's path to the
Governor's Mansion _ and possibly the White House _ was paved by a
small group of donors who pitched in with a big share of the $41
million Bush raised for the two gubernatorial races, according to a
report issued today by Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, less than 1 percent of Bush donors
contributed 25 percent of the money he raised for wins in 1994 and
1998, which helped position him as the GOP presidential
front-runner. ``Most of these wealthy Bush donors have sought
corporate welfare, relaxed regulatory rules or other government
favors,'' said Craig McDonald, director of the Austin-based group
that did the study.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, spokesman for the Bush presidential campaign,
said the report is misguided, and Texans know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans know that Governor Bush has received broad-based
support from all walks of life in communities across this state for
his agenda of improving schools and cutting taxes,'' he said. ``And
nearly 70 percent of Texans voted to re-elect him because of his
proven record of doing what is right for all Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Washington, D.C.-based Arca
Foundation and Piper Foundation, which issue grants to nonprofit
organizations that analyze the influence of private money on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that Bush and his donors availed themselves of
the state's no-limits campaign contribution system. A quarter of
the $41 million that flowed to Bush came from 207 donors who
contributed at least $25,000 each. Of the $28 million that could be
classified by economic or ideological interests, 96 percent came
from business interests.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred donors who gave a total of $3 million were
identified in the report as ``profiteers ... many of whom made
fortunes by taking corporate welfare from the government or who
appear to have an interest in taking the regulatory cops off the
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list are Dallas brothers Charles and Sam Wyly,
whose firm, Maverick Capital Fund, received a state contract to
invest University of Texas funds in 1998. The Wyly brothers gave
Bush $210,0273 for the two gubernatorial campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the top 10 was Dallas oilman Ray L. Hunt, who
contributed $105,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Oberwetter, spokesman for Hunt's firm, said the
contributions to Bush had nothing to do with anything Hunt wants
from government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks (Bush) is a good, sound conservative governor.
That's it,'' said Oberwetter.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Texans for Public Justice also says Bush got $4
million from donors related to the so-called tort reform issue who
backed Bush's successful push for an overhaul of the civil justice
system. Lawmakers approved limits on damage awards as part of the
package. Bush says it was an effort to protect businesses from
frivolous lawsuits and unreasonable damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including Texans for Public Justice, say the laws have
stripped consumers of needed protection against businesses that
offer hazardous products.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of Bush donors _ 69,692 out of 104,507, or
about 67 percent _ gave less than $100, the big bucks came from
donors in large chunks. More than $21 million came from the 1,532
donors who gave $5,000 or more. A total of $4.2 million came from
the top 40 donors, topped by Irving businessman Dennis R. Berman
who gave $175,000. Berman's firm, Denitech Corp. provides office
equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a drizzly night late last week, more than a dozen
volunteers for Al Gore, nibbling on chicken wings, olives and
pizza, gathered at their headquarters at the Seattle Labor Temple
for a routine they have followed for weeks: telephoning faithful
Democrats to encourage them to vote for the vice president in the
Washington state caucus on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh hello _ is this the Eatons?'' asked Sara Kaplan, 76, who
has helped out in campaigns since 1946. ``I'm just calling to push
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted only a
couple of weeks to making telephone calls to identify its
supporters. His fledgling operation does not even have an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I alternate between jubilation and despair as I try to put
this thing together,'' said Matt Berman, the volunteer who runs the
Bradley campaign in Washington state. ``I wish I had another six
months _ and I wish I didn't have a family to support so I could do
this full time.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences in the Gore and Bradley operations here
underscore the degree to which the candidates are prepared to march
to the nomination should they triumph in the first showdowns in
Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New Hampshire a week later.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic strategists say they have never seen a
challenger with as much organizational and financial muscle as
Bradley, they argue that Gore is still better primed to go the
distance. Because he has traveled the country for more than seven
years as vice president, Gore has enjoyed a head-start building an
organization with help from scores of elected officials and the
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are stacked with the vice president in the long
haul,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, who ran for the
Democratic nomination in 1988 and is not backing anyone this year.
``But I think you'll find Bradley will be more organized than
people will think.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's edge, Bradley is in a far better position than
his Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is
nowhere close to matching the resources of his chief opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. And unlike Bradley, who has succeeded in
the often cumbersome and costly challenge of getting his name on
ballots in key primary states, McCain has had far less success. And
he is now fighting New York state Republican leaders over whether
he'll be on the ballot in many districts in the state's March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete with Bush around the nation, McCain is
concentrating on New Hampshire and South Carolina, which holds its
contest on Feb. 19, in the longshot hope that he will catch fire
and win the nomination on sheer momentum and free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with Bradley's preparations, if he and McCain
triumph in New Hampshire they would face enormous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, literally, has all his eggs in the New Hampshire
basket,'' Biden said. The senator said he would be more worried for
Gore if Bradley, beyond matching him in organization, had McCain's
charisma. Conversely, he said, if McCain had Bradley's resources,
``This is a guy who could just catch fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, who won a surprise upset in New Hampshire against
Walter F. Mondale in 1984 but lost the nomination, said in an
interview that Bradley had surmounted many of the hurdles that had
doomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would have envied is the clean shot, the two-man
race,'' said Hart, who emerged from as the alternative to Mondale
only after New Hampshire. ``I just didn't have the money, or the
ability to organize in more than two or three states. Bradley
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he questioned whether Bradley could win the nomination.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that Gore appears to have the
support of a majority of the so-called superdelegates, members of
Congress, party officials and others who will automatically be sent
to the Democratic convention _ and who account for about 20 percent
of all delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Bradley wins New Hampshire and comes on strong, those
superdelegates could defect to him,'' said Hart, who has not
endorsed either candidate. ``But history shows that is not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. DeGraff, who runs the delegate drive for the Bradley
campaign, insisted that Gore's advantages can be overcome. ``This
is the most prepared insurgent campaign in the history of the
Democratic Party,'' he said. ``You cannot wait until victory in New
Hampshire and then get delegate slates together in New York or Ohio
or Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a delegate expert on the Gore campaign, conceded
that Bradley ``has parity in terms of resources and that has
positioned him better than other insurgencies in the past.'' But,
he said, ``He doesn't have an advantage because we have a lot more
people helping us than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush benefits from the overwhelming support of
elected officials in his party who have put their supporters to
work for him. Another advantage for the governor is that the
Republican establishment does not particularly like McCain, who has
made his independence a signature theme.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davenport, who ran the delegate operation for Bob Dole's
campaign in 1996, said even if McCain won New Hampshire, ``it would
be a near miracle'' if he could translate that into winning the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John blows him out in New Hampshire, it would be a great
shot in the arm,'' said Davenport, who is not backing either
candidate. ``But it still comes down to if you don't have the
organization to get your vote out and the money to get your message
out, it's very difficult to buck the momentum of a front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Discerning organizational strength can be difficult, because a
candidate can benefit greatly from an energetic volunteer corps
even without significant resources. Still, one obvious sign of
preparedness is where a campaign sets up offices. Besides Iowa and
New Hampshire, said officials of the Bradley campaign, they have
state headquarters only in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore officials said they had offices in those
states and six others, including here in Washington. The Gore aides
would not divulge specifics, saying that would be tantamount to
handing Bradley their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns said they would step up their organizations
significantly after Feb. 1. Advisers to Bradley, a former senator
from New Jersey, said of the states that hold primaries in early
March, they were counting on potent support in the Northeast. Gore
advisers said they had an advantage in their candidate's native
South in states like Texas and Oklahoma, though the Bradley
campaign has been actively organizing in Florida, home to many
transplanted northeasterners.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington state, organizations for Gore and Bradley are
taking shape, although the Gore operation _ buoyed by support from
most of the state's elected leaders and labor _ clearly has more of
a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 39 counties, we have organizers in 36,'' said Sandeep
Baweja, a 29-year-old lawyer who runs the Gore campaign in the
state. ``Let's say things don't go according to plan in New
Hampshire or Iowa. We have to do our share as part of the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Seattle Labor Temple in Seattle is repeated
night after night: The Gore campaign's goal is to compile a tally
of supporters and do whatever they can to prod them to caucus on
March 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following a script written by the campaign, the volunteers asked
respondents who identified themselves as Gore supporters or
undecided for their e-mail addresses so they could get on the
campaign mailing list. But if they said they favored Bill Bradley,
the scripted response was terse: ``Thank you for your time.'' The
volunteers were also instructed in the script to ``avoid mentioning
caucus date'' to Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of one evening last week, the campaign had compiled a
fresh list of the number of Gore backers, Bradley backers and
undecided. But the campaign may not have done especially well that
night. Baweja said he was instructed by headquarters in Nashville
not to release the tally ``for strategic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Baweja, the only paid Gore official in the state, draws a salary
of $30,000. The Bradley campaign's only paid staff member here is a
22-year-old, fresh out of college, who gets $500 a month to help
with administrative chores.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters here insist they are not daunted and view
Washington state as a critical western beachhead. Bradley has
courted the high- tech community and independent voters here, and
his advisers noted that this state has a history of rewarding
mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen them turn around volunteers the way we have,''
Berman said of the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, Bradley supporters could point to more
organizational strength. On the same night that Gore volunteers
were working the phone banks in Seattle, 70 Bradley volunteers
gathered nearly 3,000 miles away at the Engineer's Club in
Baltimore to assign tasks such as outreach to college students and
women in the run-up to the Maryland primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Curran, a City Council member who worked on the Hart
campaign in 1984, said Bradley was far more prepared. ``Hart seemed
a bit more helter skelter,'' he said. ``This is more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appeared that Bradley was still behind in organizing
in this state. Unlike Gore, he does not have the endorsements of
Maryland's top elected Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the meeting, someone asked Jamie Kendrick,
co-campaign coordinator in Baltimore, for the location of the
Bradley headquarters in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign headquarters is here,'' he declared, hoisting his
cell phone in the air. ``The campaign headquarters are all of you.
There is no headquarters. We are the volunteer army.''

INTERVIEWER GETS PERSONAL WITH FIRST LADY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton answered questions
Wednesday about her marriage and personal life for the first time
since she began traveling through New York last summer in pursuit
of a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a series of questions from a radio talk show host
here, the first lady said she had never been unfaithful to
President Clinton and had never had a sexual relationship with
Vincent Foster Jr., a close friend and former deputy White House
counsel who committed suicide. She also said she had never used
marijuana or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had long expected to be asked about her
relationship with Clinton and other personal matters, an aide said,
but she seemed taken aback when Tom Bauerle, the host of the
interview program on WGR-AM, raised them persistently on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to hate me,'' Bauerle said as he asked if Mrs.
Clinton had been ``sexually unfaithful'' to her husband,
specifically with Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know Tom, I do hate you for that,'' Mrs. Clinton
said. ``Because you know those kinds of questions are really out of
bounds, and everybody who knows me knows the answer to those
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the answer no?'' pressed Bauerle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well yes, of course it's no,'' Mrs. Clinton answered before
chiding Bauerle again for asking ``inappropriate'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Bauerle came the morning after Mrs. Clinton
was asked during an interview on WKBW-TV whether she planned to
stay with her husband after they left the White House. ``I
certainly intend to spend the rest of my life with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In answering the questions, Mrs. Clinton took a different
approach from other major candidates for public life, including
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who is her probable opponent,
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is running for the Republican
presidential nomination. Both Giuliani and Bush have refused to
give direct answers to most personal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton first discussed the state of her marriage in an
interview with Talk magazine last summer, and then in Jamestown in
a discussion of the interview, but the subject had not been raised
since, her aides said. Nonetheless, her advisers said Wednesday
that she had decided to respond directly when the inevitable
subject was brought up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, before an audience of elderly New Yorkers,
Mrs. Clinton referred to the questions she had faced earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, in public life, people ask inappropriate,
off-the-wall kinds of questions, don't they?'' she said. ``But I
want you to know that none of that is going to deter me from coming
back time after time to western New York and being a part of
building a better future here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers, if clearly girded for that kind of
question, argued Wednesday that the inquiries were far afield of
the normal inquiries a candidate faced in a race for the Senate.
``She's answered questions that no one has the right to ask,'' said
Howard Wolfson, her press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also said that she planned to formally announce her
candidacy Feb. 6 in Westchester County, where she now lives. In a
variation of the town-meeting theme, more than 500 ``house
parties'' will be held simultaneously at the homes of her
supporters across the state, followed by a driving tour. ``I'm
trying to reach every New Yorker,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I am not
writing anybody off.''

ARREST NO SHOCK TO ARMCHAIR SLEUTHS OF GREENWICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GREENWICH-SLAYING) 
(js) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN with RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ They have read the books. They have developed
their own hunches about who murdered 15-year-old Martha Moxley in
1975. They have followed the latest developments year after year,
rumor after rumor.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, when Greenwich residents learned that Michael
Skakel _ a nephew of Ethel Kennedy who had long been a suspect _
had been charged in the most sensational murder case ever to hit
this tony bastion of affluent suburbia, few expressed surprise or
shock. Instead, despite the fact that Skakel has not been convicted
of anything and maintains his innocence, the main reaction was a
kind of ``I knew it all along'' nod or shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everyone buys into the theory of Skakel being
the guy,'' said Larry Futie, a 39-year-old artist and lifelong
resident.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, there seemed to be a collective sense
of relief, and satisfaction, perhaps, over the prospect that
Greenwich's longest-running murder mystery was about to reach a
denouement. After all, the case still grips the town like a nasty
hangover, and it has raised questions about whether money and fame
can complicate or even derail police investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they weren't related to the Kennedys, it would've been
solved a long time ago,'' said Joe Novakowski, a 15-year-old
Greenwich High School sophomore who, like many people interviewed
Wednesday, had read at least one of the three books (so far) about
the case. ``I hope it's near over.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations are all the more remarkable, perhaps, because
the families involved _ the Moxleys and the Skakels _ have not
lived here for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Moxley's father is deceased, and her mother, Dorthy, now
lives in Chatham, N.J., an upscale suburb about 30 miles west of
New York City. Wednesday, as she welcomed a horde of reporters to
her neat, two-story home, she recalled the morning in October 1975
that her daughter had failed to come home. Mrs. Moxley had gone to
the Skakel residence, across the street in the gated Belle Haven
community, and Michael had answered the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked hungover and was barefoot, and I asked him if he had
seen Martha,'' she said. ``He said he hadn't, and that's my last
and only memory of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel now lives in Hobe Sound, Fla. But before moving to
Florida, he had brushes with the law and a reputation for horseplay
and heavy partying.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, for instance, Skakel crashed his car into a telephone
pole after leading police on a drunken high-speed chase in Windham,
N.Y. He was later sent to the Elan School, a school for teens with
drug abuse problems in Poland Springs, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The books about the case were written by Mark Fuhrman, the
former Los Angeles police detective accused of racism during the
O.J. Simpson murder trial; Timothy Dumas, a Greenwich writer who
explored the scandal-besotted social context of his hometown; and
Dominick Dunne, whose best-selling book ``A Season in Purgatory''
was a roman a clef.
</P>
<P>
   According to several accounts, including Dumas' book, Skakel
drifted in and out of other rehabilitation centers around the
country throughout the 1980s. But by 1994, he seemed to have turned
his life around, joining his cousin Michael Kennedy at a nonprofit
environmental and energy group called Citizens Energy Corp. in
Massachusetts. He also became a top-rated skier, an acquaintance
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Skakel joined his cousins Michael and Robert Kennedy on
a high-profile and controversial trip to Cuba to meet Fidel Castro.
But the following year, Skakel's relationship with Michael Kennedy
was said to have soured after reports that Skakel had cooperated
with prosecutors investigating Kennedy's alleged affair with an
underaged nanny. ( Kennedy was later killed in a skiing accident in
Colorado.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For some people, the current drama surrounding the Skakel family
is just the latest chapter in a sad but tantalizing tale of murder
and fame.
</P>
<P>
   Inez Antinozzi, a resident of Harrison, N.Y., was driving around
Greenwich Wednesday, intending to shop at Talbot's, when the radio
reported that Skakel was about to appear at police headquarters.
She quickly headed toward the police station, elbowed her way into
the throng of cameras and microphones and pulled out her own
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about the story for all these years,'' she said.
``Now I've got a picture of him.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, I DO BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe I'm projecting. Maybe my take on Michael Jordan assuming
an ownership role with Washington is being filtered too thickly
through a prism of contempt for how two Jerrys, Reinsdorf and
Krause, ruined a dynasty in Chicago. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But as Jordan was introduced Wednesday as part-owner of the
Washington Wizards, I distinctly sensed an undertone of a challenge
aimed at his former bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Bulls' run to six National basketball Association
championships, Chicago's two Jerrys implied that the Bulls'
success, while certainly because of the players, was a triumph of
front-office brains, vision and money that obtained the players for
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Just to prove it, the Jerrys blew the team to pieces and vowed
to rebuild it themselves. No Scottie Pippen, no Phil Jackson. No
Jordan. We'll show you, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the ever competitive Jordan appeared to issue a
counter-gambit: No, I'll show  &UR; you, &LR;  Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a while to come in and evaluate what's
going to stay and what's going to leave,'' he said. ``That's part
of the whole challenge, and I look forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did take his shots at the Jerrys. Why hadn't he pursued
this opportunity with Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly I was never offered this situation in
Chicago.'' Had he discussed the Wizards' situation with either of
his former bosses?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had the opportunity to tell Jerry about this; I'm
pretty sure he can read.''
</P>
<P>
   On the current Bulls, he said: ``They feel the best way for them
to rebuild is starting over fresh; that's the direction they've
chosen, my energy now is here.''
</P>
<P>
   As owner, he sits at the table with Reinsdorf; as president of
basketball operations, Jordan will play personnel chess with
Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rebuilds the Wizards in Washington, his family will
remain in Chicago and monitor the two Jerrys as they try to lure
free agents to the Bulls. Question: Will the Jordan-David Falk-axis
block free-agent talent from Chicago, steer talent to Washington or
in any event divert talent from the Bulls? Someone asked Jordan
about a potential conflict of interest. ``It was an issue that I
brought up,'' Jordan said. ``We're willing to address the problem
when the time comes, if it is a problem. It hasn't been made clear
to us that it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not confine his laser comments to the Bulls. He
looked at the Wizards' basketball operation, headed by Wes Unseld
before Wednesday, when Jordan effectively took the power, if not
the position. The Wizards have not won a playoff game since 1988.
Asked about a partnership with Unseld, Jordan said: ``Hopefully we
will be on the same page. In the event that we are not, I have the
right to overrule Wes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is the only NBA owner who can assess his teams talent
firsthand. He said he will conduct an on-court, in-competition
assessment of his players by practicing with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to evaluate talent is to see how scared they
are,'' Jordan said. ``If Gar Heard doesn't like it,'' _ he said
referring to the Wizards' head coach _ ``well, I'm his boss.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Wizards' locker room players, prepared for the game
against Dallas and contemplated Jordan's presence.
</P>
<P>
   My attention went to a name tag over a dressing stall: JORDAN.
This was Reggie Jordan, a fifth-year player who was born in Chicago
and spent time with the Lakers, the Hawks and the Timberwolves.
Jordan was in Los Angeles when Magic Johnson tried his hand as
coach and nearly lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was different,'' Reggie Jordan said. ``We had a real
young team, and Magic was trying to get us to be old school. This
is a little different; Michael calls the shots. I'm looking forward
to it. ``
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Jordan got to see his new team get clobbered,
104-86, in a half-empty arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago to the day, Jordan sat in the United Center
announcing his retirement in what, by any estimation was a
restrained send-off. Wednesday, Jordan was upbeat and eager to put
his arms around a substantial challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a couple All-Star players with this team, we got a
couple players who are young probably don't understand the
opportunities they are being presented with,'' he said. ``We've got
to find a way to make sure they understand the responsibility for
the checks they are being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a good business opportunity: the Wizard's have a new
arena, Washington is a rabid sports town. As Jordan watched his new
team struggle on Wednesday night he realized, perhaps for the first
time that, win lose or draw, he'll have a neck-and-neck race
against the Jerrys.

DESERT PLANTS DON'T MEAN WATER SAVINGS, STUDY HINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desert plants are replacing grass in Phoenix area yards, but new
research shows the trend may not be saving much water.
</P>
<P>
   Quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   In an Arizona State University study, Phoenix areas residents
with desert landscaping used more water than those with lawns and
lush landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Martin, professor of urban horticulture at ASU, has a
couple of theories why:
</P>
<P>
   _People are trying too hard to make their yards green.
</P>
<P>
   _Homeowners don't adjust their irrigation systems properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere planting of climatically adapted plants doesn't
necessarily translate into water savings,'' he said. ``It's more
about how people take care of the plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, along with graduate students Kathleen Peterson and Linda
Stabler, tracked water use in 18 homes in Tempe and Ahwatukee from
August 1998 to December 1999. Half had ``xeriscaping,'' with plants
adapted to dry climates, while half had lawn and leafy trees.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings were presented in a symposium Wednesday at ASU,
highlighting the 2-year-old Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term
Ecological Research. The project, funded by the National Science
Foundation, is looking at the Phoenix area's urban ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   In the water-use study, researchers were startled to find that
homeowners used a third more water on drought-tolerant plants than
on a standard lawn with trees and bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People associate green and growing with health and vitality in
the landscape,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But desert plants drop leaves, shrivel and go dormant in a
natural response to dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   Worried homeowners fight back: They water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to make well-informed decisions, we need
research like this,'' said John Meunier, dean of ASU's College of
Architecture and Environmental Design.
</P>
<P>
   The study rings true to him. In his own yard in Paradise Valley,
he waters the brittlebush so it has broad, pale-green leaves when
it would normally turn into a dry husk.
</P>
<P>
   Desert plants are happy to lap up extra water, Martin said. And
homeowners are happy to see their mesquites, acacia trees and
bird-of-paradise bushes grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, they have to haul out the pruning shears. In a
side note, the ASU study found that those with desert landscaping
did more yardwork, not less.
</P>
<P>
   Martin laments the way rangy desert bushes, like sage, are
whacked back into rounded ``beer kegs.'' Often, that means
sacrificing flowers, because it's the new growth that blooms.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the trimming, Martin said, ``we're depositing so
many tons into the landfill that wouldn't need to go there if we
used less water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Helm of the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association said
the ASU study is significant because past research has focused on
the needs of plants, not the behavior of the humans that tend them.
</P>
<P>
   AMWUA, a non-profit founded by Phoenix area cities, promotes
xeriscape, and Helm wonders whether the ASU results would hold for
a larger sample of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen evidence that people overwater all types of
landscaping,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of homes sampled in the study might seem small,
Martin acknowledged, but ``the landscapes are not aberrations,
they're typical.''
</P>
<P>
   One culprit in overwatering desert plants is the automatic
irrigation system. It's meant to be efficient by doling out water
in timed doses.
</P>
<P>
   But many people don't realize they should adjust the timing as
the season changes. Nor do they know that desert plants need far
less water once established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it a thousand times,'' said Tom Sobek,
superintendent at Horticultural Frontiers, a Phoenix landscaping
firm.
</P>
<P>
   A builder installs landscaping and sets the irrigation system to
water the new plants every day. The homeowner never changes the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Professor Martin said people need to appreciate the cycles
of plants from arid climates.
</P>
<P>
   And he's working on other research projects that suggest people
would be happier by giving in to their craving for green and
growing a small patch of lawn among the desert plants. &QL;

FRESENIUS TO PAY $486 MILLION IN MEDICAL FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By MILT FREUDENHEIM  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresenius Medical Care AG, the nation's largest provider of
kidney dialysis services, said Wednesday that it would pay $486
million to settle federal civil and criminal fraud charges
involving Medicare and other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said both the civil settlement of $385
million and $101 million in criminal fines were the largest in a
five-year anti-fraud campaign involving blood-testing laboratories
and other heath care companies.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has returned more than $2 billion to the Medicare
Trust Fund since 1995, said June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of
the Department of Health and Human Services. The biggest previous
settlements included $379 million from National Medical
Enterprises, a hospital chain; $325 million from a laboratory unit
of SmithKline Beecham, and $255 million from First American Health
Care, a laboratory business based in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Fresenius, based in Bad Homburg, Germany, provides blood
cleansing services for more than 60,000 Americans with kidney
problems. The charges involved disputed payments by government
programs, not the quality of patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Lipps, an American who is chief executive of Fresenius, said
the company was pleased to turn the page on the disputes with the
Justice Department, Medicare and state Medicaid programs and the
inspector general's office. Fresenius is still in discussions about
payments with its commercial insurance companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, the company agreed to plead guilty to
criminal conspiracy charges involving three units: LifeChem Inc.
laboratories, NMC Homecare Inc. and NMC Medical Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The three units were accused of conspiring to defraud government
payers by charging for disputed intravenous feeding of dialysis
patients, charging for blood tests deemed unnecessary and violating
anti-kickback laws by providing payments, discounts, yacht trips
and bear-hunting excursions in Alaska to attract potential
customers for the LifeChem blood-testing business.
</P>
<P>
   The government complaint said the home care unit falsely
attributed patients' weight loss to kidney-related problems. In one
case, it said, weight loss resulting from the amputation of a
patient's leg was misattributed.
</P>
<P>
   Three former Fresenius officials have been indicted in federal
district court in Boston in the investigation. They are K. Glenn
Shaw, former president; Louis Verde, a former manager of the
products unit, and Eileen B. Aird, former president of LifeChem.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret S. Telgheder, a former executive of the medical
products and lab units, pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud charges
last June. David Charles Weber, a former vice president in medical
products, pleaded guilty to kickback charges in December 1998. They
have not been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Fresenius ``inherited'' the investigation, Lipps said, when it
bought National Medical Care from W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. in 1996 for $4.4
billion. Mark W. Pearlstein, first assistant United States Attorney
in Boston, said Fresenius had cooperated with the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had about $3.6 billion in 1999 revenues, has
sold the home care unit. It closed the LifeChem and NMC Medical
Products units under the agreement and transferred their functions
to the company's Spectra laboratories unit and the German parent's
own products lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people who filed whistle-blower lawsuits linked to the
investigation will receive $65.8 million of the civil settlement.
They include a former home care unit employee in Mexico, Mo., and a
pharmacy in Key West, Fla., that competed with National Medical
Care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the False Claims Act, whistle-blowers and their lawyers
can share up to 30 percent of settlements in federal investigations
linked to their charges, said Judy Holz, a spokeswoman for the
Inspector General's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibbs said Fresenius had agreed to install a stringent
corporate integrity program, including special audits and training
over eight years to prevent recurrences. Fresenius hired John
Markus, a former regulations compliance executive at Oxford Health
Plans, to head the new integrity program.
</P>
<P>
   Fresenius took a pretax charge against earnings of $590 million
for the expected settlement. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Taking its war on smoking to a more graphic level,
Canada's government Wednesday proposed that cigarette packs carry
color photographs of diseased hearts and cancerous lungs and lips.
</P>
<P>
   And to illustrate a link between cigarette smoking and male
impotence, Canadian health authorities chose a photograph of a
symbolically limp cigarette. In an attempt to dispel the perception
that smoking has sex appeal, the warning would read: ``Cigarettes
may cause sexual impotence due to decreased blood flow to the
penis. This can prevent you from having an erection.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Rock, the health minister, made the announcement on what
he called ``Weedless Wednesday,'' Canada's national stop-smoking
day, saying: ``With these hard-hitting health messages and
compelling graphics, we will reach smokers directly and
effectively. Tobacco is the only product on the market that will
result in a premature death for one out of every two users.''
</P>
<P>
   With teen-age smoking rates climbing in Canada during the 1990s,
to about 29 percent today, Rock warned that 90 percent of Canada's
habitual smokers acquire the habit before their 18th birthday.
Wednesday, when reporters showed mock-up packs to high school
students, several described the packs as ``gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's tobacco industry immediately rejected the idea of
devoting half of the front and back panels of their packs to any of
16 photographs showing smoking-related diseases. In addition to
raising ``serious doubts as to the legality of these proposals,''
Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers'
Council, said Wednesday that it would be technically impossible to
print such packages in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a question of obstructionism,'' he said at a news
conference in Ottawa. Printing companies ``have told us it is
impossible to do it in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock said he was confident that by the end of this year his
proposals would pass Canada's Parliament, where his party, the
Liberals, have a legislative majority. The laws would affect all
cigarette makers but would be felt most heavily by Canada's top
three manufacturers, none of which are U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Government research had found that warnings with pictures were
60 times as likely to stop or prevent smoking as were just words.
Although California and Canada have featured photographs of cancer
patients on billboards and television, this would be the first time
that pictures of cancerous tumors would be printed on cigarette
packs, said Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers'
Rights Association, a Canadian health group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two billion packs are sold in Canada a year; 25 to 30 times a
day those packages come out of the shirt pocket or the purse, and
they sit on the dash, on the coffee table,'' said Mahood, who has
designed cigarette warning campaigns here and in other
English-speaking countries. ``Counting each time they come out, the
packs are responsible for 50-60 billion advertising impressions per
year. This could cut out 95 percent of those favorable advertising
impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., are preparing legislation that would require
large, bold warnings like, ``Cigarettes are addictive,'' but would
not go so far as to require photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current cigarette warning labels are an international
embarrassment,'' Lautenberg said Wednesday in a statement issued in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Canada's Supreme Court sided with arguments made by
tobacco industry lawyers and parts of the Tobacco Products Control
Act as unconstitutional. Now, on grounds of free speech, cigarette
makers are challenging parts of a new Tobacco Act passed in 1997,
which permits the government to require health warnings. Current
warnings on the labels, which are simply written statements like
those used in the United States, are universal but voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, cigarette makers have cultivated powerful
political allies. William Kelly, a member of the Canadian Senate,
is chairman of Rothmans Inc., which owns 60 percent of Rothmans,
Benson &AMP; Hedges, Canada's second largest tobacco manufacturer.
(Unlike the United States, Canada has no conflict-of-interest laws
governing legislators.)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, The National Post, a conservative
newspaper, warned Rock that he ``should reflect on the fact that
more Canadians smoke than voted Liberal in the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   But with polls indicating growing intolerance of smoking in
Canada, federal and provincial governments have dealt a series of
blows to the tobacco industry in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Rock hired Jeffrey Wigand as a ``special
adviser'' for Canada's anti-smoking fight. Wigand is the former
executive of Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. whose whistleblowing
was dramatized in the recent Hollywood movie ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   All autumn, Canadian television aired tough,
made-in-Massachusetts anti-smoking messages, including one showing
the image of a girl smoking a cigarette paired with the image of an
elderly woman on a hospital lung machine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Canadian government sued R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc., affiliated companies, and the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers' Council for $1 billion, the largest suit ever filed
by the Canadian government outside of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Provinces representing two-thirds of Canada's population _
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and
Prince Edward Island _ are studying the possibility of joining the
suit, which was filed in federal court in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the companies were part of a conspiracy to
avoid taxes and boost sales in the early 1990s by smuggling
exported Canadian-made cigarettes back into Canada through the St.
Regis/Akwesasne Indian Reserve, which straddles the New
York-Ontario border. Describing ``a scheme to defraud, corrupt,
cheat, steal, and conceal,'' the government alleges that the
smuggling cost Canada millions of dollars in lost tax revenues, in
wasted criminal investigation times, and in greater health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a U.S. criminal investigation, 22 people,
including a top R.J. Reynolds sales executive, have pleaded guilty
to smuggling-related charges. Northern Brands International, a
company affiliated with R.J. Reynolds, also pleaded guilty and paid
$15 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The companies took Canadian-manufactured cigarettes that had
been legally exported and sold them to another company that then
ferried them across the border, through the Indian reserve, and
back into Canada. This allowed them to avoid Canadian taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If Canada prevails in its suit, it could win $3 billion because
it was filed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, which allows courts to award triple damages to
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, president of the Manufacturers' Council, today called
the claims ``defamatory and fictional. We will be defending
ourselves vigorously,'' he added. ``There is no truth to these
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with smuggled cigarettes accounting for as much as
one-third of Eastern Canada's cigarette sales, Finance Minister
Paul Martin reduced cigarette taxes by almost $14 a carton.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a carton of 200 cigarettes retails for about $20, about
one-third less than the average prices charged for across the
border, in New York and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from where our cigarettes were among the highest
priced in the world to the point where we have the cheapest
cigarettes in North America,'' said Mahood, the anti-smoking
activist. ``We went from the top to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, an annual survey of
students ages 12 to 18 shows a consumer response to the lowering of
prices: smoking rates increased last year to 28 percent from 24
percent in 1993. By comparison, 18.2 percent of American youths
ages 12 to 17 smoked in 1998, according to a federal study. Rock,
noting that teen-agers are the smokers most sensitive to high
prices, said Wednesday: ``Taxes have to come up. They are coming up
as soon as we can get them up.''

   For writers, the killing of Martha Moxley had everything:
celebrity, wealth, youth and a mystery. It highlighted one of
America's most affluent communities, featured a possibly bungled
police investigation and, of course, there was that connection to
the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all the literary catnip, it was a substantial crime
story about a 15-year-old girl, beaten to death with a 6-iron golf
club, who was bloodied with such ferocity that the police later
expressed surprise to learn that she had blonde hair. And the
unsolved murder prompted several writers to take the case on as a
personal crusade.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial press reports subsided in the 1970s, another
case involving the Kennedy family helped to revive the media's
interest in the Moxley murder: In 1991 William Kennedy Smith, a
nephew of Sen. Edward Kennedy was tried for rape and acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The author Dominick Dunne, who was reporting on the trial, got a
tip that Smith had been at the house of the man now accused of the
killing, Michael Skakel, the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked it out, and it was a bum rap,'' Dunne said. ``But it
got me interested in the story again.'' The result was the 1993
best-selling roman a clef, ``A Season in Purgatory,'' which
chronicled the investigation into a young woman's murder and the
involvement of a troubled, wealthy Irish Catholic family.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne not only became close friends with Dorthy Moxley, Ms.
Moxley's mother, but he then became a guru of sorts to Mark
Fuhrman, an investigator in Los Angeles who was made famous during
the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Fuhrman's book ``Murder in
Greenwich: Who Killed Martha Moxley?'' _ which chronicled what
Fuhrman said was a seriously botched investigation by the Greenwich
police _ was published by Harper Collins in 1998, briefly fluttered
onto best-seller lists and again set off a round of press reports.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, a division of Little, Brown published
``Greentown: Murder and Mystery in Greenwich, America's Wealthiest
Community,'' a social study of the culture of wealth in Greenwich.
The author, Tim Dumas, who had attended Greenwich High School with
Ms. Moxley, also offered his theories about ineffective police
work.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne and Fuhrman said Wednesday that the case could not have
advanced without the attention of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I discussed writing the novel with Mrs. Moxley, I said,
`I can guarantee you that this book will get a lot of publicity,'
'' Dunne said. Fuhrman, speaking by cellular phone while on his way
to a television appearance to talk about the case, said, ``The
written word is the only reason this case is going to be in a
courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of the writers consulted Leonard Levitt, a Newsday
columnist, who had been following the case since the early 1980s.
Levitt has written at least a dozen articles about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley, interviewed at her home in suburban New Jersey on
Wednesday, said that she also credited the press with helping
substantially to move the investigation along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news media attention made me feel wonderful because for so
long there was nothing I could do about something that hurt so
badly,'' she said, recalling that the family had for years
maintained a $100,000 reward for information leading to a
conviction in the case. ``But suddenly I could do something. I
could talk to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Michael Skakel himself shopped around a book
proposal, a memoir of the case from his point of view that also
delved partly into the Kennedy family's Catholicism. The tentative
title was ``Dead Man Talking.'' His literary agent, the David
Vigliano Agency, found no buyers.

AMERICA ONLINE POSTS GAIN IN SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With subscriptions and advertising sales growing briskly,
America Online handily beat Wall Street's expectations in its most
recent quarter, reporting a profit of $271 million Wednesday, up
from $115 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 10 cents a share, beating the 8 cents
analysts had forecast and matching the ``whisper number.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite competitors' aggressive promotion of free and low-cost
Internet services, America Online added 2.1 million subscribers in
the quarter, meaning its various services totaled more than 24
million subscribers. At the same time, advertising sales grew 79
percent from a year earlier and telecommunication costs declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at subscriber growth, advertising sales and
margin improvement, you see a company that is doing everything
well,'' said Brian Oaks, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   AOL released its results after exchange-trading ended. Its stock
was up $3.5625, to $64.0625, during the session and rallied to $65
in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company's stock price remained well below its price last
week when it announced its plan to buy Time Warner for $165
billion. So, AOL executives spent much of their conference call
with investors Wednesday talking not about the last quarter but how
Wall Street should value its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to valuing the new company, it's clear that AOL
Time Warner will be an Internet-powered enterprise,'' Stephen M.
Case, the company's chairman and chief executive, told analysts. He
said the growth rate of the new company's pretax operating earnings
would exceed 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's similar to other Internet-powered companies like Cisco
and Microsoft,'' Case said, suggesting that America Online should
have the higher stock-price multiple that those companies do.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the conference call, Case, who will be the
chairman of AOL Time Warner, said he was surprised by the drop in
AOL's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did expect some initial pressure, but we had expected that
by now it would have corrected,'' Case said. ``I have no doubt that
a year from now AOL Time Warner will be seen as one of the must-own
companies, and stockholders who invest now will be greatly
rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Case said that even if the shares did not rebound,
the merger would go ahead. ``This deal is going to happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts suggested that the company's strong fourth-quarter
performance might help its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a knee-jerk reaction by investors who said this
isn't an Internet pure play any more,'' said Jamie Kiggen, with
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``But what people missed was that none
of the metrics we use to measure AOL now will go away. They will
still have tremendous subscriber growth after the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three months of 1999, America Online's second
fiscal quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.6 billion, up 41
percent from the year earlier. Of that total, $1.1 billion was from
subscriptions, up 36 percent from a year ago. Advertising, commerce
and other revenue was $437 million, up 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL service added 1.8 million members in the quarter,
reaching 20.5 million subscribers. Its CompuServe subsidiary added
300,000 subscribers, for a total of 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, America Online also included 740,000
subscribers from the Gateway.Net Internet service it agreed to
operate on behalf of Gateway computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings included a $111 million pretax gain
related to its investment in Sandpiper Networks and $35 million in
charges related to acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Case said that in the week since the merger was
announced, discussions had picked up between America Online and
owners of cable systems about allowing AOL to use their networks to
offer high-speed access to its service.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the big cable operators, led by AT&AMP;T, have blocked
America Online in favor of their own high-speed Internet services.
But with America Online's pending purchase of Time Warner, the No.
2 cable system, the balance of power in the market may have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more willing to see us as a potential ally rather
than a potential competitor,'' Case said. He said he expected to
complete an agreement for access to other cable systems well before
the merger with Time Warner is scheduled to be completed early next
year. &QL;

TEAMMATES WORKING THE PHONES, AND MORE, FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Iowa, Tenn., Calif.)  (jw) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Iowa _ Deep into the tiny crowd's second hour of
waiting for Al Gore, a young woman whose shiny blue pants say she
is probably not from the next town over jumps up behind the podium
at the VFW hall and tells the 27 government workers who have come
out to see the vice president that he desperately needs their help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been assigned to Marion County, and we're really
struggling,'' said the woman, 20-year-old Alison Friedman, who left
Stanford last fall to help Gore. ``And I don't have to tell you how
important it is to get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Her newly assigned partner, 47-year-old Warren Gooch, who
practices law back in Knoxville, Tenn., is standing at the back of
the hall with his arms crossed over his sweater vest and tie,
smiling. ``This is kind of a command performance,'' he drawled as
she joined him. ``I was supposed to be in the Virgin Islands right
now.'' Either in solidarity or not to be outdone, Ms. Friedman
added, ``And I was supposed to be in Europe with Pearl Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gooch, an old friend of the Gores whose daddy ran Al Gore's
daddy's first campaign, later asked, ``Who says there isn't any
passion in the Gore campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   And at this point, the outcome of the Iowa caucuses probably
depends at least as much as anything the candidates might do or say
on the long hours put in by people like Ms. Friedman and Gooch, who
will spend the next few days on the phone, pressing Iowans to come
out to caucus for their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gore is favored to win next Monday has not relaxed
her a bit. When asked why she's here, she said, ``I grew up in the
reproductive rights movement; I knew about abortion before I knew
about sex,'' and laughed. ``I remember Dianne Feinstein saying that
when she was at Stanford they used to have to pass a basket to
collect money for illegal abortions, and we don't have to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting choice of words for such an enthusiastic
supporter of abortion rights, Ms. Friedman said she was behind Gore
``mostly because he is the most viable'' presidential candidate who
would protect Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the perfect embodiment of Gore's one-time campaign theme
of practical idealism, she explained that ``given the superdelegate
situation, Al Gore is going to be nominee, so the better we do in
Iowa, the sooner we wrap this up, and the more money we'll have
left to beat Bush so he doesn't get to appoint three Supreme Court
justices.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooch's mission is a little more laid back, but also a lot more
personal. ``I'm here to tell people I've known Al Gore a long
time,'' he said, as if he had all the time in the world for the job
at hand. ``And there aren't many people who won't come around if
you tell them you've known this man for 30 years and see what their
concerns are.''
</P>
<P>
   After the event at the VFW, the two of them repair to Mr. C's
for some lunch and strategizing. Ms. Friedman feels there are a
couple of urgent items on the agenda: First, many of the folks who
are on the list in her thick blue notebook as precinct captains
have told her that this is news to them. ``Warren, we have another
big problem,'' she said, giving her meatloaf sandwich a poke. ``A
lot of people are uncomfortable with the whole term `precinct
captain.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gooch grinned. ``We've just got to make 'em feel good about it
and they're gonna love it.'' Still, Ms. Friedman said, ``We have to
make sure they're comfortable in their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, she is comfortable in hers. This, of course, will be
her first opportunity to vote in a presidential election, and she
has never seen an Iowa caucus. (``It sounds very junior high-esque,
very Red Rover,'' she observed, with everyone lined up to choose up
sides.) But before Gooch heads back to Des Moines to line up some
new precinct captains, she lets him know they've got 300 calls to
make that day.
</P>
<P>
   Then he drops her off over at the home of Pat Nichols, a local
woman who has been putting up Democratic organizers back as far as
Ted Kennedy's 1980 campaign. Mrs. Nichols and her friend, Carole
Chambers, a retired nurse, have been making calls, too, but are
pretty discouraged after a series of hang-ups by people complaining
they'd already been called repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Friedman, however, feels even this can be turned to Gore's
advantage. ``Yesterday,'' she said, grabbing a phone, ``I got a few
who promised to go to caucus if I didn't call again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate calling people who might be dead,'' she whispered, but
then plunged in anyway. ``Hi, Philip? It's Alison. With the Gore
campaign. Oh, please, you're breaking my heart. I just really care
because Gore is the only candidate who's pledged to protect
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Well, I can certainly
appreciate being slightly disenchanted, but the vice president has
donated his life to preserve those health care programs you care so
much about. I understand. Yes, the Democrats do have two good
candidates. Well, we'll probably call you back. OK, I promise it
won't be today.''
</P>
<P>
   In about 50 other calls, Ms. Friedman promises free rides and
posters and also offers guilt trips _ ``It's only an hour and how
is he going to become president if you won't go to caucus?'' _ and
tells a man whose wife won't come along to consider ``what a lovely
bonding experience that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she sends the police over to check on a man who says he
can't go because he's having chest pains, and is over the moon when
it seems she has brought a Bradley supporter to his senses with her
spiel on Pell grants. ``Maybe he's not totally convinced,'' she
allowed. ``But a couple more calls and I'll have him.''
</P>
<P>
   After three hours and about 50 calls, only three people have
promised they will be there for sure. But there's so much left to
be done. And before the evening ends, Ms. Friedman looks across the
table and sees one more opportunity: ``Have you decided who you're
going to be voting for?''

NEWS ANALYSIS: COMMUNISTS WITH PUTIN STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, SAY JILTED
DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By demonstrating a readiness to cut a deal with the
Communists in the legislature, Vladimir Putin, Russia's current and
perhaps future president, is evidently willing to forsake
ideological allies and embrace ideological enemies to achieve his
ends. The question remains: what ends?
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has clogged newspapers, airwaves and even the
Internet with paeans to democratic ideals since taking power from
Boris Yeltsin last month, stunned outsiders on Tuesday by making a
power-sharing arrangement in the newly elected lower house of
parliament with the Communist Party, which would seem,
ideologically, to be his sworn enemy. The Communists got a sheaf of
committees and the all-powerful speaker's chair. In return, direct
supporters of Putin, the acting president, got a lock on key
legislative committees.
</P>
<P>
   Left shirtless and out in Moscow's numbing cold was the
parliament's contingent of free-market democrats, at least those
not directly allied with Putin _ including a flock of
pro-democratic politicians led by former prime minister Yevgeny
Primakov. The maneuver compelled Primakov, perhaps Putin's most
prominent potential rival for the presidency, to drop out of the
race for speaker and thus lose a national platform and a potential
power base.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing turmoil there was no lack of explanations: that
Putin, the shrewd strategist, co-opted a weakened Communist Party
into assenting to his democratic reforms; that Putin, the realist,
decided the Communists were more reliable than the fractious
free-marketeers or a legislature run by Primakov, a crafty rival.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious answer _ and the one democrats do not want to believe
_ is that Putin is less bothered with ideology than with achieving
his ultimate end: consolidating power.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, his back-room accord with the Communists,
structured as an end run around parliamentary rules, is a first
step toward a new Russian autocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous symptom,'' said Elena Mizulina, a
legislator, ``because immediately the question is raised: What's
next? What other rules and legal norms would be violated? This is
very alarming.'' Ms. Mizulina belongs to the Yabloko faction,
Russia's oldest pro-democracy party.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday she and the other outsiders _ members of Yabloko,
the free-market Union of Right Forces and Primakov's Fatherland
faction _ boycotted the new legislature's opening session. At a
rump meeting they denounced the Kremlin as a political machine
intent on one-party rule and a rubber-stamp legislature.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative explanation was offered Wednesday by Alexander
Limanov, a political analyst writing for the Russian news Web site
-www.gazeta.ru, who said Putin had chosen an ``absolutely
predictable'' ally in the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The four or five pro-democracy factions supporting the Kremlin
might be molded into a coalition, he wrote, but not one that would
be ``monolithic or disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to enact his legislative package, Putin ``in the end
was convinced'' that he must have a controllable Parliament,
Limanov wrote, adding, ``The most convenient form for this was the
Communists.'' Being authoritarian themselves, he wrote, the
Communists will be hard put to resist most of Putin's proposals to
increase state power.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Tuesday's move may have helped the one credible
opponent to Putin in the presidential race, Primakov, back into a
race he seemed to have given up.
</P>
<P>
   After supporters filed a notice of candidacy Wednesday, he said
he had not made up his mind about running.
</P>
<P>
   The darker view contrasts Putin's stated support of a democratic
Russia with major events during his tenure, including the Chechnya
war and the legislative elections of December, widely condemned as
tilted in the Kremlin's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Putin has signed legislation granting state
security agencies an expanded right to monitor e-mail. And a
Kremlin committee is considering press restrictions on the Chechen
war.
</P>
<P>
   To experts like Nikolai Petrov, at the Moscow office of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the coalition between
Putin's forces and the Communists only continues an ominous trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called democratization of Russia in the last 10 years
was to a great extent the weakening of the state,'' he said. ``And
now, as the strengthening of state is going on and Mr. Putin is
representing this trend, it's almost understandable that a lot of
so-called democratic achievements will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Primakov called the deal with the Communists a legislative
desecration. Other critics were two more Yeltsin prime ministers,
Sergei Stepashin of Yabloko and Sergei Kiriyenko of the pro-market
Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint is shared by many who are left out politically:
that their parties were denied leadership posts in proportion to
their share of seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, with but a fifth of the 450 seats, grabbed a
third of the chairmanships. Putin's Unity, with 18 percent of
seats, got 26 percent of the committee posts. Primakov's Fatherland
controls 10 percent of seats and was offered one chairmanship,
which it spurned.
</P>
<P>
   The sin of unequally dividing the spoils, not unknown in
Washington, is not necessarily antidemocratic, as the Communist
speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, was quick to note Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Putin has not denied spoils to his
opponents, but to his kin. And his chosen partners, the Communists,
were seen as a declining force, having lost many seats in elections
last month.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for many outsiders to see what the Kremlin had in
common with its former Soviet masters, except, critics charged, a
desire to perpetuate and expand their control.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin has always said that he is a democrat first
and a nice guy second _ and that ensuring democracy means
assembling a government strong enough to arrest financial and
social decline.
</P>
<P>
   As for the notion that he is a not-so-closet authoritarian,
Putin said this week that Russian dictatorship has been relegated
to history's ash heap and that those who warn most of its
resurgence may be fixated on the concept themselves.

APPLE CHIEF REWARDED FOR COMPANY'S FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc. once again handily surpassed
analysts' estimates for its first quarter, and a grateful board
thanked its chief executive, Steve Jobs, for the company's
turnaround by giving him a Gulfstream V jet and 10 million options.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' options for Apple's common stock were awarded at last
week's closing price of $98.99, but he will continue to receive a
token salary of just $1 a year. After returning to a struggling
Apple two-and-a-half years ago, Jobs called himself the ``interim
chief executive'' until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry York, an Apple director, said that under Jobs and his
executive team, Apple's market valuation had increased from less
than $2 billion to more than $16 billion, and that the $90 million
cost to Apple for the jet and a tax offset was about 6.5 percent of
the gain. The airplane will be staffed and operated at Jobs'
expense, he said. Apple announced its results after the close of
the market. In Nasdaq trading, Apple shares closed at $106.5625, up
$2.625. In after-hours trading the shares traded as high as $114.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 1, Apple reported earnings of $183
million, or $1.03 a diluted share, up 20 percent from $152 million,
or 95 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues
rose 37 percent to $2.34 billion from $1.71 billion in the first
quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   First quarter 2000 included a net gain of $5 million from a
number of nonrecurring items, including an after-tax gain of $101
million from the sale of approximately 5 million shares of ARM
Holdings PLC, a net reorganization charge of $6 million, and a
one-time charge for Jobs' $90 million bonus _ $45 million for the
jet plus money to offset the impact on Jobs' taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Without these items, Apple's earnings would have been $178
million, up 45 percent from the year-ago-quarter, and earnings a
diluted share would have been $1.00. Analysts expected Apple to
earn 90 cents a share, according to First Call. The ``whisper
number'' was 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an absolutely sensational quarter, and very significant
for Apple,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon
Read.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said it sold 1.38 million computers during the quarter,
including more than 700,000 iMac consumer desktops and 235,000
iBook consumer laptops, for unit sales growth of 46 percent
year-over-year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple shipped a record number of units for any quarter in its
history,'' Jobs said in a telephone interview. ``Even at its peak
revenues in the mid-'90s of around $11 billion, Apple never shipped
as many units as we did last quarter. What it means is we are
firing on all cylinders.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gross profit margins declined to 25.9 percent in the quarter,
down from 28.9 percent a year ago. In a conference call with
securities analysts, Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial
officer, attributed the slip to higher component costs,
particularly for memory chips; higher air freight expenses
associated with getting products to stores in time for Christmas;
and lower-than-expected high-margin sales of Mac OS 9, the most
recent revision of the Macintosh operating system software.
</P>

   Average selling prices fell only slightly, which Anderson
attributed to a higher-than-expected percentage of iMac sales going
to the $1,499 DV Special Edition model. In October, Apple announced
three new versions of its popular iMac, including two with the
ability to edit digital movies, and one priced at $999.

   ``They drove volume and at the same time they maintained a
premium,'' said Michael Kwatinetz, an analyst with Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``The customer is willing to spend money if you give
them value. Steve Jobs has just done a tremendous job of
re-identifying Apple with positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his somewhat unusual compensation package, Jobs said
the airplane would help him coordinate his two jobs (he is also
chief executive of Pixar Inc.) and his family life. ``The board has
been very wonderful in offering me things over the last two years,
and I've been too busy to really worry about that,'' he said.
``They thought of this, and it's something I'll probably actually
use, and it's something I'd probably never have bought myself.''

MARTIN AVOIDS ROUGH SPOTS HIS FIRST DAY ON PGA TOUR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ The news media attention focused on
Casey Martin was expected. His gallery was smaller than expected.
And considering his two-month absence from competitive golf,
Martin's performance was better than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Making his much-anticipated debut as a member of the PGA Tour,
and overcoming his early-round nerves, Martin shot a 4-under-par 68
in Wednesday's opening round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
David Toms held a one-stroke lead in the tournament after shooting
a 63 at Indian Wells Country Club, one of the four golf courses on
which the event is played. Three players were tied for second place
_ Bob Tway and Paul Goydos, who played at Indian Wells, and Robert
Damron who played at PGA West Arnold Palmer. The defending
champion, David Duval, shot a 68 at the Palmer course, as did
Justin Leonard. Davis Love III shot a 66 at Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who successfully sued the PGA Tour for the right to
use a golf cart in competition, was satisfied to find himself just
five strokes off the lead. Playing on the easiest of the
tournament's four courses, Martin chipped in from 30 feet for an
eagle, added three birdies and made just one bogey during the
sunny, calm, 80-degree day, showing the poise that has become a
trademark since his fight to reach the PGA Tour became a national
story.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder called
Klippel-Trenauney-Weber Syndrome, won his court case against the
PGA Tour for the right to use a cart in 1998. But the PGA has
appealed the decision, and a ruling on the appeal is expected
sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin earned his way onto this year's PGA Tour by finishing
among the top 15 winners on last year's Nike Tour, which is now the
Buy.com Tour. Wednesday, Martin started with a steady round that
showed his strength off the tee, and his ability to handle the
spotlight. If he had not squandered a few birdie opportunities with
some missed putts, Martin's score would have been even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously could have made a few more putts, but I think that
was a result of nerves,'' said Martin, who is 27 years old. ``Once
I chipped in, I settled down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it probably helped Martin that his gallery never
surpassed 150 people, and at times, only about two dozen people
were following his round. Most of the tournament gallery was six
miles away at the Palmer course, following the celebrities in this
Pro-Am event such as the actor Bill Murray, the singer Michael
Bolton, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, San Francisco 49ers receiver
Jerry Rice and John Elway, the former Denver Broncos quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   At times, there were more reporters in Martin's gallery than
fans. And as his presence on tour becomes more routine, Martin and
some of his peers hope that he becomes less of a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wishes that all the media following him would go
somewhere else and let him play golf,'' said Glen Day, who shot a
65 Wednesday. ``That's what he needs. Let him play golf. Let him
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with three amateur partners, which all the professionals
will do through Saturday, Martin started on the 10th tee, with his
golf cart parked inconspicuously about 60 feet away. After being
greeted with applause after his name was announced, Martin blasted
a tee shot down the middle of the fairway, then walked with his
familiar limp to his cart, then drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had little trouble navigating his cart through
Wednesday's sparse gallery, and at times, it was easy to forget
that Martin was arriving to his ball a little differently than
everyone else. The highlight of his round was the eagle at the
par-5, 483-yard No. 14, when he hit his second shot just short of
the green. He then chipped in to make his first eagle as a member
of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Martin lives with constant pain in his withered right leg, and
he often has trouble sleeping through the night. He spent Tuesday
night having dinner with his parents and his brother, and he also
attended a Bible study class, which helped him prepare for
Wednesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will be another interesting day for Martin, when one of
his playing partners will be Richard Ferris, a member of the Tour
policy board who testified against Martin in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice guy, but he went out of his way to testify against
me,'' Martin said. ``It's a little bit ironic that I got paired
with him, but we'll be fine out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about playing with Martin, Ferris smiled. ``I think he's a
wonderful young man, but the Tour's position is that walking is an
integral part of the game,'' Ferris said. ``I'm looking forward to
playing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martin was looking forward to another day, happy that
his 2000 debut was finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' Martin said. ``I had been thinking about it.
Now I can move on.''

ADVERTISING: A WOMAN WHO TOOK IBM FROM STAID TO CUTTING EDGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The feminist revolution of the 1970s hasn't exactly
upended the top echelons of the corporate world. But it has
achieved a slow, significant evolution of women joining the ranks
of top corporate officers at large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, some 13 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500
companies are expected to be women, up from 10 percent in 1996,
according to projections by Catalyst, a nonprofit research
organization in New York that works to advance women in business.
Even so, just 5 percent of the top positions at the Fortune 500
companies _ with titles ranging from executive vice president to
chairman _ were women in 1998, Catalyst said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who has made it is Abby Kohnstamm, the first woman to
serve as senior vice president of marketing at International
Business Machines. She is also a member of the elite 13-member
corporate executive committee that governs the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohnstamm, who oversees more than $1 billion in advertising
and marketing spending, is credited with helping to transform Big
Blue's global image as a stodgy old mainframe business to a
cutting-edge corporation focused on electronic business. The focus
on electronic business can be seen in IBM's ongoing advertising
campaign about e-business using the slogan, ``Solutions for a small
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Ms. Kohnstamm is being named the Advertising Woman of
the Year by Advertising Women of New York for her role at IBM,
taking her place next to other stars among women in advertising,
marketing and the media. The award from the club clearly signals
that Ms. Kohnstamm has become one of the most powerful women in
advertising today.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Kohnstamm said she had learned over the years is to
forget the numbers not in her favor and to just persevere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, when they ask, that the first thing is to
decide what you're trying to accomplish and not get distracted with
this other stuff,'' said the soft-spoken Ms. Kohnstamm in a phone
interview from her Armonk, N.Y., office. ``Just keep your eye on
the ball, develop a bit of a tough skin. Take some chances; do some
things; make some things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohnstamm took IBM's marketing helm in 1993 after being
recruited by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chief executive _ whom she
had once served as executive assistant at American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gerstner, IBM's stock has moved from the low- to mid-$20s
to the $114 range, according to split-adjusted figures from Steve
Milunovich, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But while the financial and operational overhaul was extensive,
marketing also played a strategic role in IBM's success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially the job was a financial restructuring,'' Milunovich
said. ``But marketing played a very big role _ they had to
reposition the company. Our surveys find the perception of IBM has
definitely improved and that they are seen as a key beneficiary of
e-commerce spending, which is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohnstamm's challenge was to completely change the public's
perception of IBM as yesterday's news. To do that, Ms. Kohnstamm,
in 1994, dismissed IBM's 80 advertising agencies around the world
and consolidated all advertising at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, a
unit of the WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing O&AMP;M, she selected a shop she had a long relationship
with at American Express and an old friend and colleague, Shelly
Lazarus, Ogilvy's chairwoman and chief executive. Ms. Kohnstamm
said the consolidation was intended to give IBM one voice and one
focus around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has been made of our personal relationship,'' Ms.
Kohnstamm said. ``It was a factor, but it wasn't the only factor.
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather really had a passion, and it wasn't just Shelly.
They believed we could collectively relaunch this brand and they
wanted that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The edict to O&AMP;M was to tap into IBMs equities and reinvigorate
the brand, but do so in a manner that would surprise people. They
came up with ``Solutions for a small planet,'' a campaign that
shows the problems of the electronic revolution and how IBM has the
solutions. The campaign also came up with a language for the
electronic revolution _ e-business, which appears in all IBM
communications as a sort of symbolic shorthand for the consumer to
understand that IBM is integrally involved in Web marketing and
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to talk about the company in a manner that was
surprising, and that would take people a bit off guard, that maybe
I should reconsider IBM,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects, we pulled out the latent equities we always
had _ our enormous technical and business expertise and our image
as a company that you can count on.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two children, ages 10 and 15, Ms. Kohnstamm said
she had also been lucky to work in companies and for people who
allow flexibility for women. She said companies need to recognize
that women and men have a balancing act between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   Her own philosophy is that when her family needs her, she is
there for them. But, she said, she also doesn't abuse that
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Kohnstamm did not start out so focused. She pursued a
career as a professional dancer and even received a master's degree
in dance education before switching gears and gaining an MBA from
New York University.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting, perhaps, that she ended up at IBM. Her father,
Chuck Francis, retired from IBM in 1987 after 30 years, eventually
as head of advertising. The famous Little Tramp campaign using a
Charlie Chaplin character was developed under his leadership, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's in my blood,'' she said.

SEOUL HOPES TO CONCLUDE DAEWOO TALKS SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The government here said Wednesday that it
hoped to conclude debt negotiations with foreign creditors of the
insolvent Daewoo Group by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the foreign creditors have taken place intermittently
since the summer, as the conglomerate struggled under more than $70
billion in debt. The South Korean government wants to conclude an
agreement with the foreign creditors, who hold $6.7 billion in
debt, before it speeds up its dismantling of the conglomerate with
the sale of assets, in particular those of Daewoo Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a recent offer by foreign creditors to
settle for 45 cents on each dollar of their loans would be accepted
when both sides meet on Thursday in Hong Kong. Until now, the
Korean government has insisted on repaying no more than 36.5 cents
to the dollar, while foreign creditors insisted on a recovery of 59
cents.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks fail, officials here have warned that they are
willing to place Daewoo Corp., a core unit of Daewoo Group, under
court receivership. The flagship subsidiary holds more than 70
percent of the conglomerate's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said it would make 35 trillion won, or about
$31 billion, available to local financial institutions that are
saddled with Daewoo Group debt.
</P>
<P>
   The planned injection of capital _ which was larger than
expected _ is aimed at preventing cash shortages at investment
trust companies holding Daewoo debt when individual investors are
allowed to withdraw 95 percent of the face value of their
investments Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Yong-keun, the new chairman of the nation's Financial
Supervisory Commission, also noted that a similar support plan last
fall, when there was a partial lifting of limits on redeeming
Daewoo bonds, had helped prevent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time again, nothing will happen,'' Lee said.

CHASE MANHATTAN EARNINGS UP 48 PERCENT, EXCEEDING FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Riding huge gains from investing in start-up
technology companies, Chase Manhattan said Wednesday that its
fourth-quarter earnings rose 48 percent, easily exceeding
investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the nation's second-largest bank, said it earned $1.69
billion, or $1.98 a diluted share, up from $1.15 billion, or $1.31
a share, in the fourth quarter of 1998. As a group, analysts had
expected the bank to earn just $1.32 a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Two big securities firms, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. and
Bear Stearns Companies, reported better-than-expected quarterly
earnings, lifted by high levels of trading activity and investment
banking.
</P>
<P>
   At Chase, most of the surprises came from Chase Capital
Partners, a unit of the bank that invests in private companies and
often retains some of their shares after they go public. Chase had
$1.3 billion in gains, realized and on paper, on investments of
that type last quarter, more than five times the $244 million in
private equity gains it recorded in the quarter last year. Those
gains amounted to 21 percent of the bank's total revenue of $6.27
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Chase executives took pains Wednesday to convince investors that
the gains, unusually large as they were, did not represent a
one-time phenomenon. Instead, they made a plea for a higher
valuation of the company's stock based on potential gains from the
hundreds of young companies they have financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, we are in a hot market,'' said Dina Dublon, Chase's
chief financial officer. ``This is not a wagon we just jumped on
hurriedly in '99 to catch up. This is a major way we participate in
the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that Chase invested in early had their first
public offerings of stock last quarter. Shares of several others
that had already gone public rose in the quarter, pushing up their
value on Chase's books. All told, about 30 percent of Chase
Capital's $9 billion portfolio is in publicly traded stocks. Those
shares have a market value of about $4.3 billion, but the bank said
it was carrying them on its books at about $3 billion because of
various restrictions on its ability to sell them now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The frustrating thing for them is that the normal investor in
bank stocks is fairly conservative,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The question is: Could these big
positive markups in value turn negative next quarter if the tech
sector implodes?''
</P>
<P>
   During the last 20 days of the quarter, Chase's performance also
received a lift from the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist investment bank that
Chase acquired in December.
</P>
<P>
   At Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, investment banking fees, for
advising companies on mergers and acquisitions and underwriting
their stocks and junk bonds, soared 81 percent last quarter. That
rapid growth helped Donaldson report fourth-quarter earnings that
nearly tripled to $191.2 million, or $1.35 a diluted share, from
$68.7 million, or 47 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roby, the chief executive, said the firm would continue to
invest in building its business outside the United States. He said
revenue from overseas doubled last year, to about $780 million,
though he added that the international operations were not yet
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns said gains in investment banking and trading
contributed to an 80 percent increase in quarterly earnings, to
$245.1 million, or $1.64 a diluted share, from $135.9 million, or
80 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The reported results were for Bear Stearns' fiscal second
quarter, which ended Dec. 31, but the firm is now halfway through
its fiscal first quarter. The odd sequence was created by a
decision, approved by its board this week, to shift its fiscal
calendar to end in November instead of June. The firm hopes to cut
down on poaching of its employees by competitors, all of whose
fiscal years end either in November or December. Executives thought
too many Bear Stearns employees were receiving annual bonus checks
during the summer, then jumping to other firms with hopes of
getting another bonus check at the end of the calendar year.

BOEING PROFIT RISES BY 42 PERCENT ON IMPROVED JET OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benefiting from heavy cost-cutting, the Boeing Co. said
Wednesday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 42 percent, far
outpacing most Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest plane maker, reported fourth-quarter
profit of $662 million, or 74 cents a diluted share. In the quarter
a year earlier, the company earned $465 million, or 48 cents a
diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had realized that Boeing's operations were improving in
recent months, but few expected the company to post such a robust
performance in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected Boeing to earn 68 cents a
share, 6 cents below the actual total.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our commercial jet operation, the speed with which we have
gotten back on our feet has surprised a lot of people,'' said Phil
Condit, Boeing's chief executive. ``We may have even surprised some
executives here.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stock price increased $2.625, or 5.8 percent, to close
Wednesday at $47.625 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing delivered fewer jets in the fourth quarter of
1999 than in the year-earlier quarter, the company increased its
operating profit in that division to $698 million, from $54
million.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which is based in Seattle, said it had made cost
improvements on its next-generation 737s and 777s. The company also
said that the average labor overtime in the fourth quarter had
dropped to 10 percent from 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in jet deliveries caused Boeing's fourth-quarter sales
to drop 11 percent, to $15.2 billion, from $17 billion in the
quarter a year earlier. For the year, Boeing's sales increased 3
percent, to $57.9 billion, up from $56.1 billion. The company's
earnings for last year increased 106 percent, to $2.3 billion, up
from $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see improvements at Boeing over last year,''
said Sam Pearlstein, an aerospace analyst at ING Barings. ``What
was the surprise was Boeing's confidence for 2000 and 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing projected an operating margin of 7 percent this year, up
from about 5.5 percent in 1999. The company also predicted its
sales would decline this year to $50 billion but rise in 2001 to
$51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also raised their earnings estimates. Christopher
Mecray, an aerospace analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown, raised
his earnings estimates for Boeing this year from $2.20 a share to
$2.50 a share.

IBM PROFIT OFF, BUT IT BEATS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM said late Wednesday that its earnings during the last three
months of 1999 fell more than 11 percent from the previous year,
but Wall Street had expected even worse and the company's stock
moved up in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   IBM warned last year that the world's preoccupation with year
2000 computer problems would hurt the company's earnings. But when
IBM reported Wednesday after the close of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, the result was a comfortable 6 cents a share above
the average of the analysts' lowered estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it earned $2.09 billion, or $1.12 a share, in
the fourth quarter, down 11.1 percent from $2.35 billion, or $1.24
a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They passed muster with flying colors,'' said John B. Jones,
who follows IBM for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   But the minority of analysts who feel the company is currently
overrated were not about to retreat. They noted that revenue for
the quarter was off 3.8 percent, to $24.18 billion, from $25.18
billion a year ago, more than most analysts had expected. The
better-than-expected earnings resulted from cost-control efforts,
not good news about new products, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether the declines are all Y2K as IBM is
saying,'' said Steven M. Milunovich, who follows IBM for Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, the biggest declines were in IBM's
hardware businesses, but most of the analysts' questions for the
company focused on software and global services. The latter
businesses are the new engines of IBM's growth as it transforms
itself from the old Big Blue, which built its reputation on
mainframe computers, into a leading vendor of services and Internet
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our portfolio continued to shift toward higher-growth
businesses,'' said John Joyce, chief financial officer for IBM,
which is based in Armonk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   IBM bulls were particularly impressed that despite the focus of
most major customers on year 2000 preparations, the company was
able to get $10 billion in new services contracts in the last
quarter. The majority of the new deals were outsourcing agreements
in which IBM will manage computer systems for large customers. The
company's backlog has reached $60 billion, up 20 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also reported that electronic-commerce units grew 60
percent, to $3 billion in revenue, over the last year. Over all, it
said that although year 2000 concerns would continue to dampen some
businesses in the current quarter, it expected to meet Wall
Street's targets for the year of revenue growth in the high single
digits and double-digit earnings growth. ``We continue to believe
that once the Y2K transition is completed, this can be a very good
year for IBM,'' Louis V. Gerstner, IBM's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's shares finished trading Wednesday at $115.50, off 50 cents
from Tuesday's close, but they soared to more than $120 after the
earnings were released.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is no question IBM was among the major computer companies
hardest hit in recent months by preparations for the year 2000
computer problem. One-fourth of the company's revenue comes from
banks and other large financial institutions, most of which
finished repairing systems by the middle of last year and then
began to freeze their networks and software to prevent introducing
new problems. Sales to such customers were up 13 percent in the
first half of 1999 compared with the previous year and down by 4
percent in the second half from 1998, Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, hardware sales fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
to $10.2 billion. Mainframes, peripheral equipment and personal
computers all suffered, with the personal computer group's profits
also being hurt by the costs of shutting down IBM's money-losing
retail channels.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest unknowns revolve around how much of the slowing
growth in the all-important services side of the company has also
been related to year 2000. The company's global services revenue
increased 7 percent during the fourth quarter. That is about half
the rate IBM will need to keep Wall Street happy.

FAILING KOREAN AUTOMAKERS BECOME WORLDWIDE QUARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see KOREA-DAEWOO)  
 (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Two South Korean automakers spent the 1990s building
costly factories, running them inefficiently and wrecking their
balance sheets with enormous debts _ and have now emerged as
sought-after acquisition targets in the latest round of
consolidation in the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   At industry conferences here over the last two weeks, American
and European executives have repeatedly cited Daewoo Motor Co. and
Samsung Motor Inc., both of which are insolvent, as desirable
purchases at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean auto market _ once virtually closed to
outsiders by government regulations and local business practices _
has started to revive with the rebound from the Asian economic
crisis. And because the Korean currency is still weaker than it had
been before the crisis took hold late in 1997, South Korea has
become an attractive place to manufacture for export to other
countries, with Daewoo already moving into the United States market
despite its financial problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, finding the right price has been difficult.
Western automakers have pursued their forays as bottom-fishing,
looking for ways to buy factories and brands for pennies on the
dollar. Korean automakers and their creditors have held out for
prices that might at least allow them to cover a large chunk of
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a slow, awkward dance, in which both sides
are playing hard to get. General Motors, for instance, has been in
talks to buy Daewoo for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The tempo has picked up in the last several weeks as Ford Motor
Co. has also begun negotiations with Daewoo while Renault SA has
started trying to acquire Samsung Motor. But GM, Ford and Renault
executives have each said that a deal is possible only if they do
not have to take responsibility for all of the Korean companies'
debts _ a condition that has so far been rejected by the Korean
automaker's executives and creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman for international operations,
said in an interview Wednesday night that ``we clearly wouldn't
take on the debt load Daewoo has at the present time, and we're
just exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a resolution will be very quick,'' Booker
continued. ``It will not be until after the parliamentary
elections'' in South Korea, ``and they're in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's late entry into the bidding has prompted some muttering
in Detroit that the company might just be running up the price for
GM. But Booker denied this, saying, ``That may be the end result
but that's not why we're in it _ we're in it because we can't let a
company of that size go by without investigating it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the nervousness of Western automakers is that
Daewoo Motor and Samsung Motor are both part of huge conglomerates
with many different debt and equity relationships among the various
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman and chief executive,
remarked: ``Our idea is not to buy a company, but to buy assets and
a brand. We are not quite sure we can understand a Korean balance
sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer's comments were regarded as particularly significant
because Renault did have the confidence last March to buy 37
percent of Nissan Motor Co. at a time when other automakers,
notably DaimlerChrysler AG, were reluctant to invest because their
executives were unsure that they understood the extent of Nissan's
debts.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, said that
while growth in Asia was one of his top goals, he would not overpay
for Daewoo. ``This is a company that is severely troubled with
massive debts,'' he told reporters here this week. ``We have other
options; they don't necessarily include Korea.''

ELIAS EXTENDS SCORING STREAK TO 12 GAMES AS DEVILS TOP BLACKHAWKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Patrik Elias extended his point-scoring
streak to 12 games Wednesday night when he got what proved to be
the winning goal in the New Jersey Devils' 4-1 victory over the
Chicago Blackhawks at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The goal by Elias, with 10 minutes 22 seconds left in the third
period, was his 17th of the season and gave New Jersey a 2-1 lead.
By scoring in his 12th straight game, he equaled Devils scoring
streaks established by the captain, Scott Stevens, in 1994, Pat
Verbeek in 1987 and Aaron Broten in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Elias scored his winner from close range on the right with a
shot over Jocelyn Thibault's left shoulder after a pass by Jason
Arnott from the other side. The goal gave Elias his 17th point in
the stretch. Elias got two more points before the game was over,
assisting on Arnott's 12th goal and scoring an empty-net goal with
14 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo scored the first goal for the Devils, who posted
their eighth victory in the last nine and improved to 29-13-5, the
best mark in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Martha scored the lone goal for the Blackhawks, who took
28 shots against Martin Brodeur, who made a number of spectacular
saves when the game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   In their only visit to New Jersey this season, the Blackhawks
fared a little better than they did when the Devils made theIr lone
visit to Chicago, on Dec. 9, scoring a 4-0 victory that marked
Brodeur's second shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur and the Devils got ahead of the visitors Wednesday night
when Sergei Brylin gained possession of the puck in the neutral
zone and fed Pandolfo, who sped toward Chicago's goal and beat
Thibault just inside the right post from the slot before falling.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfo's goal was his fourth of the season and it came 3
minutes 7 seconds into the game, seconds after Krzysztof Oliwa of
the Devils engaged Brad Brown into a fight at center ice.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa is the chief pugilist for the Devils and he apparently
wanted to show his parents, visiting from his native Poland, that
he can fight as well as score. Oliwa had a rare goal two nights ago
against the Hurricanes to the delight of his mother, Krzystyna, who
cried when she watched her son score in the first NHL game she had
attended.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils power play, which had been fairly efficient in the
previous five games with five goals, not only failed on its first
two advantages Wednesday night, but it also allowed a goal, only
the third short-handed goal all season for the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   It was scored by Martha, who got his first goal in 29 games,
having been stymied since his score Nov. 12 against the Islanders.
The goal came with 6:24 left in the middle period, moments after
Petr Sykora had missed a grand opportunity after a Chicago giveaway
in its zone.
</P>
<P>
   Martha had a marvelous chance to get his second goal of the
night after a mistake by the Devils' defensemen with 6:34 left in
the third, but he was denied by Brodeur, who flipped himself
backward to stop Martrha's backhander from directly in front. &QL;

GEMSTAR BUYS 2 ELECTRONIC BOOK FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gemstar International Group, a Pasadena company that emerged
from obscurity in the fall to acquire TV Guide Inc., announced a
stock-for-stock deal Wednesday to buy two leading makers of
electronic book devices. The two companies _ NuvoMedia and SoftBook
Press _ have been competing to develop the infant electronic book
market with limited success because of the wariness of publishers
and authors about posting a high volume of titles in the format.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Gemstar acquisition, executives at the companies
said there will be more financial resources to create an
advertising campaign to promote the electronic books, which
currently range in price from $199 for a Rocket e-Book to $599 for
a SoftBook device. In addition, they said Gemstar has the resources
to license electronic book technology to other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar is the inventor of VCR Plus technology, which allows
consumers to record a television program by entering code numbers
that are printed in television listings in more than 1,800
publications around the world. The company has licensed these
interactive programming guides to companies like Microsoft and
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Henry C. Yuen, chairman and chief executive officer of Gemstar,
said that the company found the electronic book market appealing
because it will be able to combine elements of TV technology with
electronic book devices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said that next year the company will start
offering two-way paging devices in connection with its electronic
programming guides. That paging device could also be used with
electronic books so that a reader could use the pager to order a
book, Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paging device is totally suited for the books,'' Yuen
said. He said a user could get breaking news or a book with the
flip of a switch on the device.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that to develop the market the company faces what he
calls a ``double chicken and the egg'' dilemma. The company needs
to sell a higher volume of the devices to attract publishers and
authors. Currently, perhaps less than 10,000 have been sold. The
prices of electronic books also need to come down to build the
market, but that won't happen until demand increases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to aim below 100 bucks,'' Yuen said. ``The way I look
at it, you've got to get it cheap enough to make it an impulse
purchase. If I can make it cheaper, I can get a larger number of
people to read them. Then the publishers will not be able to ignore
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morrow, director of communications for SoftBook, said that
with the acquisition NuvoMedia and Softbook Press will be able to
combine their offerings to nearly double the titles available in
electronic form to almost 4,000 plus more than 30 magazines and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new market,'' he said, ``and SoftBook and NuvoMedia
have demonstrated that it's a viable one. We've passed that first
phase and now we're ready for the second phase of rapid deployment
and commercialization.''
</P>
<P>
   SoftBook Press was started in 1996, while NuvoMedia was started
in April 1997. Although both were competing to produce electronic
book devices, they followed different business strategies with
NuvoMedia going after individual consumers and SoftBook looking for
customers in corporations and school districts.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, the two companies said they will continue
to pursue those distinct strategies. ``Our goal remains to get
every child an electronic book in five years so that backpacks are
out of business,'' Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Yuen said that his company is already in discussions with large
manufacturers that might be willing to license the technology and
then take over the task of producing the books. In addition, with
Gemstar's acquisition of TV Guide, he said that readers should
expect to see advertising promoting the electronic reading devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let people know there is such a thing as an
electronic book and how to get it. Then we're going to go out and
get manufacturers to put them out in volumes,'' he vowed.

CHANGES AT DAILY NEWS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see ROSENTHAL-DAILYNEWS)  
 (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From one perspective, a series of executive and
ownership changes at The (New York) Daily News and elsewhere in the
publishing and printing empire of Mortimer Zuckerman and Fred
Drasner is nothing special _ just a normal realignment of
responsibilities by two executives around the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   From another view, the changes show that the quarter-century
partnership between the two prominent businessmen is loosening as
their interests diverge.
</P>
<P>
   As Zuckerman said Wednesday, ``We're partners. It's not that
we're yoked together by chains. I don't want to do some of the
things he wants to do, and he doesn't want to do some of the things
I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three events _ most recently, a reshuffling Monday that
left Drasner with less day-to-day responsibility at The News _ have
raised questions about the relationship between the two partners.
</P>
<P>
   The News announced Monday that Les Goodstein, its executive vice
president and associate publisher, had been promoted to president
and chief operating officer, also taking over some of Drasner's
executive responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Zuckerman announced that he planned to sell his 15
percent stake in the Washington Redskins football team _ his half
of a 30 percent stake he and Drasner acquired earlier last year in
partnership with Daniel Snyder, a Washington communications
entrepreneur. For his part, Drasner said, ``He's going in one
direction,'' adding: ``I'm intrigued by football. Look, we paid
$800 million for the Redskins. I'm entitled to watch my
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Applied Graphics Technologies, a pre-press printing
company co-owned by the two men, acquired a British pre-press
company, Wace PLC and installed Wace's chief executive, Derek
Ashley, as the chief operating officer, taking over some of the
portfolio of Drasner, who remains the chief executive. Meanwhile,
Zuckerman appears to have little direct role in the company's
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Both The News and Applied Graphics had come under close public
scrutiny in recent months because of real or threatened financial
reversals. In an industry made volatile by rapid technological
change, Applied Graphics has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Its operating profit of $23.7 million through the first three
quarters of 1999 declined by about $1 million, or 3.9 percent, from
the same period in 1998, according to its most recent Securities
and Exchange Commission filings. Meanwhile, thanks in part to the
Wace acquisition, its debt grew to $309 million. Its stock price at
closing Wednesday was $8.625, down 50 cents for the day _ and down
from a close of more than $60 in early January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although The News is privately held by Zuckerman and Drasner,
its financial difficulties have also got recent attention. Last
fall the newspaper won a judicial reprieve from a
multimillion-dollar back-pay award granted by a labor arbitrator _
but only after it provided evidence showing it had made money in
only one year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The executive changes at companies like The News and Applied
Graphics, not to mention their real financial reversals, have
attracted continuing attention. Zuckerman, as co-owner of The News
and U.S. News &AMP; World Report _ and until last year, the owner of
The Atlantic Monthly _ is one of the highest-profile figures in the
high-profile media industry.
</P>
<P>
   As Steven Florio, president and chief executive of Conde Nast,
said Wednesday evening, ``Very public businessmen, the Donald
Trumps and the Mort Zuckermans of the world _ they are kind of the
rock stars of the new millennium.'' He added that there was ``great
interest in watching people who succeed or fail or better yet
succeed, then fail, then roar ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Zuckerman and Drasner will be
roaring ahead together, or separately. Zuckerman said Wednesday:
``Fred Drasner and I have worked together for 25 years. We're very
good friends. That doesn't mean we don't have disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I want to get out of things I don't really love. I
love journalism and public policy and real estate.'' Conspicuously
absent from his list were the printing business and pro football.
When asked about his future role at Applied Graphics, Zuckerman
would give no specifics. He did say: ``I suspect we'll continue to
be in ventures together. I expect we'll be in new ventures
together.''

ETHEL KENNEDY'S NEPHEW CHARGED IN 25-YEAR-OLD SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., N.J., Fla., Mass.)  (Eds.: Rewrites throughout, adds background on the case beginning
21st graph, ``Martha Moxley, a popular girl...'')  
(jw) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Nearly 25 years after 15-year-old Martha
Moxley was bludgeoned to death on the lawn of her family home here,
police Wednesday charged Michael Skakel, her former friend and
neighbor and a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But in a legal twist that is sure to lead to further
complications in the highly publicized case, Skakel, 39, was
charged as a minor because he was 15 at the time of the October
1975 killing in Belle Haven, a gated section of this affluent town.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Skakel came after prosecutors disclosed
Wednesday that a grand jury had found that enough evidence existed
to arrest him. But they would not discuss that evidence, or their
plans. But legal experts said prosecutors would almost certainly
file a motion to have Skakel tried as an adult, a prospect that the
law at the time of the killing did not address. For now, Skakel's
legal fate is up to a Juvenile Court judge in Stamford who will
decide whether the case should be heard there or in Connecticut
Superior Court, which could sentence him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what penalty Skakel would face if he is
convicted as a juvenile. The old law required that juvenile
offenders be released at 21.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel surrendered Wednesday to Greenwich police, who charged
him with murder. He posted a $500,000 bond, was released and left
the station smiling. His lawyer, Michael Sherman, said Skakel was
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrest was a major break in a murder case that has
long confounded local and state authorities and produced several
books written by journalists and detectives lured here in hopes of
unearthing the clues that would crack the case. None did, although
a 1998 book written by Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police
detective, named Skakel as the likely killer.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of investigating, first by the Greenwich police
and later by the state's attorney in Bridgeport, Skakel and his
older brother Thomas emerged at the top of prosecutors' list of
suspects. Both have denied any role in the crime, in which Miss
Moxley was beaten and stabbed with a golf club wielded so
powerfully against her that it shattered during the attack. Police
later traced the club, a 6-iron, to a set owned by Ann Reynolds
Skakel, the boys' mother. Mrs. Skakel, the sister-in-law of Ethel
Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, had died two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel lives in a gated complex in Hobe Sound, Fla.,
with his wife, young son and father, Rushton Skakel. Michael Skakel
arrived in Greenwich by train Wednesday afternoon after learning
Tuesday night that prosecutors planned to issue a warrant for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not guilty,'' Sherman said Wednesday morning, adding that
his client's spirits were good, all things considered. ``Everyone's
been telling him this was going to happen for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Skakel will begin later this month or in
early February, when he may become the first 39-year-old defendant
to appear in Stamford Juvenile Court. There, Judge Maureen Dennis
will decide whether Skakel should be charged as an adult in
Superior Court, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   What may keep Skakel's case in Juvenile Court, though, is a 1975
Connecticut law that required judges to find probable cause before
moving any case involving a defendant age 14 to 16 to an adult
court. But legal experts say that under the judicial philosophy of
that time, juveniles were not typically tried for murder, but sent
for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the law has been revised to make the transfer of juvenile
murder defendants automatic, a battle is sure to erupt about which
version of the law will apply to Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   If the case is kept in Juvenile Court, the court will probably
have little power to punish him, said David Rosen, a lecturer at
Yale and a senior research associate at Yale Law School's Child
Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to punish him would be through a transfer to the
Superior Court, but a transfer may not be a maneuver available to
the prosecutor,'' depending on how the judge interprets the law,
Rosen said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Under the law as it
stood in 1975, he added, ``the only thing this guy can be
prosecuted for is being a juvenile delinquent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, Rosen added, ``may be walking into a thicket that
there is no way out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Keefe, a criminal defense lawyer in New Haven, said
prosecutors most likely would not have hunted down Skakel if they
did not expect his case to be heard in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's going to be on the judge to transfer him out of
Juvenile Court and have him tried as an adult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Skakel was turning himself in to the police in Greenwich,
Dorthy Moxley, the mother of the slain girl, sat beaming next to a
painting of Martha in the dining room of her New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding her confusion over the legal complexities involved in
trying Skakel, Mrs. Moxley said she was hoping for a trial, any
trial. ``Wild horses couldn't keep me away,'' she said. Since
Tuesday, she said, when she first heard there was a new development
in the case, she has been a bundle of nerves. ``When my husband
died 12 years ago,'' she said, ``we thought there was no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, John Moxley, Martha's older brother and now a
commercial real estate specialist with the firm of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, said, ``This will never be behind us, and it will always
be part of the fabric of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Martha Moxley, a popular girl who enjoyed swimming and tennis,
was killed shortly after 10 p.m. on Oct. 30, 1975, police said,
after spending the evening with friends, including Thomas and
Michael Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after Miss Moxley's death, her family became
convinced that one of the Skakel brothers was the killer, and
repeatedly criticized the work of Greenwich police detectives as
sluggish and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrest and charges against Skakel revived an
investigation that had lost steam after the Skakels and the
Moxleys, once close neighbors, had ended their friendship, amid
accusations and denials about the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley moved with her husband to New Jersey. Thomas
eventually moved to Massachusetts, where he lives with his wife and
three children, according to his lawyer, Emanuel Margolis.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, an avid speed skier, moved to Cohasset, Mass.,
and worked with his cousin, Michael Kennedy, at Citizens Energy
Corp., a company that provided low-cost energy to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The case lay mostly dormant until 1998, when Fuhrman's book was
published singling out Michael Skakel. The book asserted that he
killed Miss Moxley in a jealous rage, supposedly after seeing her
share a kiss with Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the state's attorney in Bridgeport, Jonathan
Benedict, asked that a grand jury to investigate whether there was
enough evidence to file charges against any of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's murder charge is a result of a grand jury
investigation into Miss Moxley's killing that began in June 1998.
The sole grand jurist, Judge George Thim of Bridgeport Superior
Court, found probable cause to issue the arrest warrant for Skakel,
Benedict said Wednesday. Thim interviewed more than 50 witnesses,
including former patients at the Elan school, a treatment center in
Maine that Michael Skakel attended for alcoholism from 1978 to
1980. Those witnesses said Skakel had admitted killing Miss Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   But in another strange aside to the charges, Benedict refused to
identify Skakel as the object of their arrest warrant, even though
Sherman, Skakel's lawyer, had already said his client was traveling
to Greenwich to be arrested. Because Skakel was a juvenile at the
time of the murder, prosecutors are still barred from officially
revealing his identity or commenting on any aspect of the case,
said Benedict, the state's attorney.

KNICKS GIVE MARBURY A LOSS TO PONDER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the frantic end unfolded and the New Jersey Nets'
skittering Stephon Marbury drove hard to the basket but could not
find a crack in the defense, Chris Childs raised his fist in
another triumphant moment for the New York Knicks point guards.
</P>
<P>
   They had defeated their favorite critic, Marbury, 90-89,
Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. Childs' quick feet _
along with some help from Allan Houston _ disrupted Marbury's
last-second drive for a potential game-winning shot on the
Brooklyn-born star's dream court. Marbury could not split Childs
and Houston and ended up losing the ball at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who had 23 points and 10 assists, just shook his head
as he left. Childs and Charlie Ward, who led the Knicks with 19
points, were left with the satisfaction of ruining the night of an
opponent who has been critical of their talents. It was almost the
other way around, though. Patrick Ewing had a chance to put the
Nets away with 13 seconds left but missed a jumper that gave the
Nets a final opportunity. With 6.1 seconds on the clock, the Nets'
Scott Burrell inbounded the ball to Marbury, who drove as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' control of the game began to slip away midway
through the fourth quarter. With 9 minutes 13 seconds left, the
Knicks held a 12-point lead and plenty of confidence. But after the
Knicks committed five turnovers in a five-minute stretch, the Nets
creeped to within three points. That gap vanished when Keith Van
Horn was left alone by Larry Johnson to hit a 3-pointer with 3:30
left to tie the score, 84-84.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Burrell gave the Nets an 87-86 lead with 2:08
left and put a little fear into the once-confident Knicks. The one
solid Knick through the chaos, Ward, had fouled out with 2:19
remaining and took his 19-point, seven-assist night to the bench
with him. After matching Marbury's moments with some of his own
smooth shooting, Ward was, once again, letting his opponent know
that his previous slights of Knicks point guards were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Without Ward, the Knicks turned to Ewing. He hit a baseline
jumper with 1:14 left to give the Knicks back the lead, 90-89. He
also fielded the rebound off Van Horn's missed shot that would have
put the Nets back in the lead with 35 seconds left. But on the next
possession, Ewing's miss gave the Nets life.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from coach Jeff Van Gundy's occasional anxiety attacks,
the Knicks (24-14) were a team humming along as they approached the
Nets. The only glitch in the Knicks' harmony was the comments made
by Houston on Tuesday after practice. Houston broke from character
and expressed his frustration about not being the main option
anymore on a team that is increasingly post-oriented with the
Ewing's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan is one of the greatest guys I've ever met,'' Van Gundy
said before Wednesday night's game. ``For him to say something,
that tells you where this league is at.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's disappointment with Houston was obvious. He
disagreed with Houston's choice to vent his frustration and met
with him briefly late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how you use one word and it changes everything,''
Houston said, referring to the word ``frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never would I be frustrated to where it would affect the team.
All I was really saying was that I can't rush shots sometimes.
That's all. There's nothing to it. As long as we're winning, it
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Houston settled into the first half quietly.
He had seven attempts, same as Ewing, but delivered only seven
points, which included a runner with 1.1 seconds left in the half
to give the Knicks a 43-38 lead.

LATEST SPEINDING BINGE MIGHT BE IT FOR BASEBALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Those ``drunken sailors'' are at it again. No wonder Tom
Schieffer enjoys waking up each morning void of a baseball
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Tom Hicks went Naval in describing the spending
habits of his fellow baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer can relate. He once sat in Hicks' chair. In fact,
Hicks bought that chair from Schieffer, who was managing general
partner of the ownership group that sold the Rangers to Hicks two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it was indeed sobering for Schieffer, and especially for
Hicks, when word leaked this week on the salary figure the Yankees
are prepared to offer shortstop Derek Jeter. Seven years, $118.5
million. Only one thing is certain _ the players, backed by the
muscle of their union, remain the designated driver in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   At $17 mil a season, Jeter would become the game's highest-paid
player. Last year, pitcher Kevin Brown was just that, at $15 mil.
The Dodgers followed that Brown contract by giving outfielder Shawn
Green a contract this winter worth $14 mil a year. One more round
for the house, because last call might never come.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason Jeter's reign as the game's money king won't
be for long. Wait until the free-agent tabs come due on Ken Griffey
Jr. and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, in dodging an anticipated $15 million-a-year
payout on Juan Gonzalez, the Rangers traded the two-time MVP in
November.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me again. What was The Great Shutdown of '94 supposed to
be all about? Didn't baseball do the unthinkable that year, and
blow out the World Series, with the intent of the owners to bring
salaries under control? Obviously, it was nothing but bar-stool
logic. First of all, the owners can't bring themselves under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole thing was a disaster for baseball, but even worse,
with all the heartache involved in the shutdown, nothing was
accomplished,'' Schieffer said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of commissioner Bud Selig's inner circle,
Schieffer was always considered a voice of baseball reason. He was
pro-owner but never a union-baiter. One thing also never questioned
about Schieffer, now or then, is a love for the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking that at some point a common ground will be
reached between the owners and the players,'' he said. ``But I
admit, I can't tell you that day is close, or even if it's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest argument going, and it's a valid argument, involves
why baseball owners allow salaries to become more outrageous each
season. Because they can, so says the argument. The market dictates
the salary load an owner can assume. And no check is ever too large
for a George Steinbrenner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't, however, take an economic genius to see the
shrinking number of clubs that can play the high-dollar game.
Competitive balance has been altered due to the economic
differences of big market//small market. Baseball has 30 teams, and
at least 18 of them are eliminated from World Series consideration
before a season even starts. Not enough payroll capacity equals not
enough talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way,'' said Schieffer, ``the shutdown in '94 resulted
in a positive thing for the small markets. Those clubs receive
revenue sharing which allows them to break even financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to make that work, the small-market clubs have had to
continue to slash payroll. This takes them out of the competitive
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer now serves as a consultant for Hicks in determining
the proper course for developing the land around The Ballpark in
Arlington. Real estate can be a high-risk business, but it's like a
sidewalk Kool-Aid stand compared with today's economics in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact the Rangers, being one of the big-market clubs,
still had to make the decision that was made on Juan, that tells
you the overall impact salaries are having,'' Schieffer said. ``The
Rangers can be and will still be competitive, but even so, it does
have to come down to what makes economic sense. The way the system
has been designed, the worst negotiator \Ramong owners\S raises the
financial floor for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about one more shutdown for baseball in 2002 (when the
current basic agreement expires), and this would be The Big One,
where the owners either break the union or totally destroy the
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' said Schieffer, ``but the system is still
groping since the last shutdown, we do know that. I don't think any
business should ever try to break a union. Unions have a place.
They are needed, but there also has to be that common ground with
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, how exactly do you explain all that to a bunch of
drunken sailors? \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's Sports at Six can be
heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

COMMENTARY: $45 MILLION _ THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What exciting news. The mayor's political ``friends''
just announced that they have already raised $12 million for his
unofficial Senate race. The first lady's camp says she has raised
$8 million. And by the time the campaign is over, we learned a few
weeks ago, the two expect to have spent $45 million _ $25 million
for her, $20 million for him _ for a job that pays $141,300 a year
(plus expenses).
</P>
<P>
   That's $45 million. If you are not Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Rudolph Giuliani or one of their hirelings, $45 million may not
mean much. What is $45 million, except a lot? A $45 million race
would set a new national record, beating $44 million spent in a
California race for the Senate six years ago. But that doesn't mean
much, either.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, then, the first installment of what could become a
continuing series of commentaries. Call it Let's Get Real. . . .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. In campaigns, $45 million is never $45 million. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The prediction that the two candidates will spend $45 million is
probably outdated already. But even if it turns out to be
technically accurate, it cannot be candidly accurate. Because it
does not include ``soft money'' _ huge sums that will be spent on
behalf of the candidates by boosters allegedly uninvolved in their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-named soft money is almost impossible to police. It's
made up of contributions from individuals, corporations and unions
that are much larger than any candidates can collect under federal
law. National and state parties then spend the money to promote
their favorite candidates, but pretend that they are merely sharing
their independent points of view with the public.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mrs. Clinton has raised about $360,000 for a soft money
account, and the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee has already
spent nearly $340,000 in upstate television ads starring Mrs.
Clinton. None of this money counts toward her projected $25 million
total.
</P>
<P>
   There just is no tracking this kind of campaign spending. What
if a commercial stressing Democratic candidates features Al Gore
and Mrs. Clinton? Whose account: his, hers or the ``party's''?
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has harshly criticized the Clinton soft-money spending,
but he won't rule out creating his own soft money account. And the
mayor is indulging in similar deceptions already. For example, he's
promoting the city in radio ads created by the city's tourism
bureau and paid for by the taxpayer; not political, he says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. The campaign as arms race. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With no limits on ways to advertise a candidacy, it is safe to
predict that both candidates will spend whatever they manage to
raise, even though they are among the best-known politicians in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Both are elaborately publicized and analyzed in books,
magazines, newspapers and television features, and can command all
the free television time they want. They are so well known that,
polls show, only about 10 percent of New York's potential voters
are in the ``undecided'' column.
</P>
<P>
   But no candidate is smart enough to know what incremental money
is needed to swing that last vote,'' said Mark Green, the city's
public advocate. ``It's not unlike an arms race.'' Green has
suggested an arms control agreement banning soft money, to no
avail. Instead, it's been bilateral escalation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. The candidates as New Coke. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton figure they have to spend and spend
and spend for another reason: New Yorkers know them, all right, but
they don't particularly like them. In a New York Times/CBS News
poll three months ago, Mrs. Clinton had a 38 percent
``unfavorable'' rating; Giuliani's was a close 34 percent. A Marist
poll taken last week showed him with a 28 percent unfavorable
rating, to her 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They either have to change people's opinion, make the other
candidates look worse, or spotlight new issues that cause people to
overlook their dislike, and that is the most difficult thing a
candidate has to do in politics,'' said Phil Friedman, a Democratic
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The two will have to change the minds of the already very much
decided voters, which is sort of like getting people who rejected
New Coke to reconsider. And that's expensive. In the New York City
market, television commercials can cost from $80,000 for 30 seconds
on a prime-time hit to $1,500 on one of the morning news show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. The remote control as political tool. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The targets of all this spending _ the voters _ are in for total
saturation. Therefore, a helpful reminder for those who do not have
relatives in Philadelphia: your television remote comes with two
useful options: a mute button, and an off switch.

GIVING LEVY A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 20: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's narrow, 4-to-3 vote by the Board of Education to
confirm Harold O. Levy as New York City's interim schools
chancellor was at least mercifully free of the acrimony that
dominated the meeting of 10 days ago, when the board endorsed
Levy's candidacy despite strident disapproval from city hall. The
atmosphere seemed to improve after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced
that he would not seek court action to prevent Levy's appointment,
thus averting a battle that would have jeopardized the search for a
permanent chancellor and thrown the system into chaos at a time
when crucial decisions have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Levy struck just the right tone Wednesday by saying: ``I know
the system can perform. So it's going to. Simple as that.'' With
the interim chancellor installed, the board needs to convene
promptly to begin the search for a permanent chancellor. Meanwhile,
the interim chancellor and his team need to prepare for the
summer-school session, which could attract as many as 320,000
students this year and will require 17,000 teachers who have yet to
be hired. For this session to be worthwhile, it is imperative that
as many teachers as possible be experienced and certified _ and
that the curriculum be decided upon quickly. The board needs to sit
down with the union to decide on incentives that will get
experienced teachers to commit themselves to the summer session
before they make other plans.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the state budget on which a portion of the
summer-school funding depends has yet to be worked out, raising the
possibility that the summer session will be cobbled together at the
last minute, leading to chaos in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   With such an enormous task at hand, the interim chancellor and
the school board will need help and cooperation from Giuliani. The
mayor made a step in the right direction when he promised not to
block Levy's appointment. But he took a gratuitous slap at Levy,
characterizing him as a union puppet and a purveyor of retrograde
thinking. For the sake of the city's schoolchildren, the mayor
needs to cut out the sniping and work hard to solve the problems
that lie ahead.

COWBOYS OWNER SAYS HE'S IN RESEARCH MODE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones continued his
head-coaching search yesterday by talking to such NFL luminaries as
Oakland's Al Davis, Kansas City's Carl Peterson, Cincinnati's Mike
Brown and former Cowboys offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, who
is on his way out in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do ask a lot of questions,'' said Jones, who has no
timetable for selecting a head coach and offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will spend today again at the site of the Senior Bowl,
then fly back to Valley Ranch. He was in New York on league
business earlier this week before returning Tuesday night to
Mobile, with Davis and Brown as guest passengers in his private
jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that I will have an interview with any coach
here in Mobile,'' Jones said. ``Keep in mind that I'm also looking
within our staff ... \Rand\S currently visiting with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading in-house candidates for the Cowboys' head-coaching
vacancy are special teams coach Joe Avezzano and defensive
coordinator Dave Campo. Both have met with Jones and have expressed
an interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones continues to give no hints as to: 1) whether the
hiring of Chan Gailey's successor will be one person or two and 2)
whether the search ultimately will lead him in-house for the head
coach or outside the organization for both positions. Gailey served
as both head coach and offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people currently on this staff who, in my mind, are
going to be head coaches in the NFL,'' Jones said. ``Whether or not
it's head coach of the Dallas Cowboys at this time is something
else ... but they've done a lot to contribute to the success of
this organization, and I do worry about losing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes are possible on every staff, and this includes the
Cowboys, whose assistants are under contract for 2000 with the
exception of Jim Bates (defensive line) and Dwain Painter (wide
receivers).
</P>
<P>
   Jones has used one of his two ``protected'' designations allowed
by the NFL _ one offensive and one defensive coach per team _ on
Campo.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Campo cannot interview with another NFL team
while under contract unless it is for a head-coaching position. The
exception to the rule is in the case of a requesting team that has
an unused ``protected'' designation of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NFL rule doesn't include coaches of special teams,
Avezzano doesn't have the ``protected'' tag. If the Cowboys have
used both ``protected'' designations, running backs coach Clarence
Shelmon is thought to have the other other.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Chicago offensive coordinator Gary Crowton, Denver
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Zampese, who will be gone if,
as expected,] the Patriots bring in Bill Belichick as their next
head coach, continue to be mentioned in speculation as the ``hot
candidates'' _ Crowton and Kubiak as possible head-coaching
candidates, Zampese as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is a good friend. I would give him all the information
he wants and never expect a nickel in return. That's just the
relationship we have,'' said Zampese, a favorite of Troy Aikman and
the offensive coordinator on the Cowboys' last successful Super
Bowl run in the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gone as possibilities are Mike Martz, offensive coordinator and
now heir apparent to Dick Vermeil as head coach of the St. Louis
Rams, and Dave Wannstedt, who succeeded the retired Jimmy Johnson
as the Miami Dolphins coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it ``would not be appropriate'' to comment on whether
he was interested in Wannstedt before the latter signed a
three-year contract as coach of the Dolphins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the information-gathering and networking stage of this
thing,'' Jones said yesterday, adding, ``I still haven't asked for
a formal interview of any coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about picking up the pace, Jones replied, ``The pace may
be picked up and \Rthe search\S over in a matter of an hour. This
is the time-consuming part ... doing your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he ``regrets'' needing to conduct a coaching search
just 24 months after hiring Gailey, Jones said that he is helped by
having gone through the same process so recently.
</P>
<P>
   The two top qualities that Jones said he is looking for in a new
head coach are ``commitment and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had both, Jones said. So, the quest is to find someone
with both qualities plus an offense that fits Aikman and the
Cowboys' personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, 52, has been with the Cowboys' organization for 11
seasons, Avezzano, 56, for 10. Both were on all three Super Bowl
teams of the '90s. Both would need an offensive coordinator and
play-caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, people think this is an awkward time for me,''
Avezzano said. ``I don't feel that way because I've been a part of
the organization for 10 years. I appreciate how Jerry has gone
about his business over the years. Like I've told people before:
`If Jerry ain't saying it, it ain't happening.' So you go about
your business and don't concern yourself about speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said, ``I really don't know what's going to happen, one
way or the other. I do know that Jerry is going to be thorough in
doing what he needs to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has discovered that the Cowboys' opening is still
considered to be a very attractive job in the NFL, adding, ``I
don't look at my \Rhands-on\S involvement as a deterrent,'' to
anybody wanting to be the Cowboys' next head coach and/or offensive
coordinator.

EDITORIAL: SENATOR TORRICELLI'S LATEST DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 20: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My integrity is worth more than profits,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli back in 1994, making a public pledge to avoid
participating in investments not available to the general public.
At the time, he was still a House member with hopes for higher
office, and he had suffered heavy criticism over a $144,000 profit
he had made from a private investment in a New Jersey bank.
</P>
<P>
   But now it turns out that Torricelli has reneged on his promise
to forgo special insider deals. The Asbury Park Press reported on
Sunday that Torricelli, a Democrat, has holdings currently valued
at $225,000 from a $5,000 investment he made last year in a
privately held Internet company that was subsequently bought by a
publicly traded Internet company based in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate transaction, Torricelli bought, for an undisclosed
price, 19,000 shares in a private company that sells diet plans on
the Internet. The value of these shares could well soar when the
company carries out its plan to offer stock for public sale later
this year, its first public offering. Torricelli has the option to
purchase 6,250 more shares at just $2.50 per share, even if the
public stock price rises well above that.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's spokesman, Richard McGrath, says his boss changed
his mind about avoiding insider deals because he was unhappy with
the financial performance of his now-dissolved blind trust and knew
that all his new investments would be disclosed to the public.
Furthermore, McGrath notes that the deals do not violate the law or
Senate ethics rules. But it is impossible for elected officials to
take advantage of such private investment offers without creating a
perception _ and often the reality _ that the special financial
opportunity given them will make them susceptible to demands from
the favor-givers.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli seemed to understand this when he talked about
putting integrity before profits. By breaking his pledge he has
betrayed the voters, and renewed doubts about his ethical judgment.
