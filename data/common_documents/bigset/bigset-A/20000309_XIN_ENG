<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Speaks Highly of 2000/2001 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday that the 2000/2001 budget is a very good one, which
meets the needs of the community but at the same time ensures
sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing, Tung noted Hong Kong scored a
substantial GDP growth rate of 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter
last year. "We can look forward to achieving a handsome growth of
about five per cent for this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm view that the government has the responsibility
to economy, to improve our efficiency, and to share the community'
s burden in promoting economic recovery," the Chief Executive said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, the financial secretary has presented
specific measures to enable civil service reforms to continue to
progress. I am sure that these measures will be welcomed by the
community," he added.
</P>
<P>
As the International Monetary Fund stated a few days ago, he
said, a modest deficit for the year 2000 will help the economy to
continue its recovery path.
</P>
<P>
"The financial secretary's budget for this year will help us to
achieve higher economic growth," he said. "And I know as a
community, by working together, Hong Kong will be able to scale
new heights."

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Keep Alert to Changing Trends: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs Jayakumar said here Wednesday that Singapore will support
engagement of key players in the region and keep alert to changing
trends in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question in the Parliament on his reading of
current situation and the role Singapore will play, Jayakumar said
that the situation in the region has somewhat stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"But there continue to be several potential flashpoints which
we need to watch and manage carefully," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar affirmed that Singapore has an interest in ensuring
the engagement of all the key players in as many forums as
possible and must be alert to new changes.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a benign favorable external environment in
the region is critical for Singapore, a small country, to be able
to develop and progress in the future as it has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Singapore's role should continue to be helpful in ASEAN +
3 Forum as well as in the ASEAN Regional Forum to try to engage
the critical players which are dialogue partners to sit together
at the table and to discuss common security issues, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar stressed that equally important is the ability of
Singapore to be alert to changing trends, shifting currents, new
alignments so that Singapore will not be caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely important," he said. "International events,
alliances and trends are never static....Singapore must be alert.
We must note changing trends, be able to adjust way ahead of time.
"
</P>
<P>
"If we can do that, then I think we will be more prepared for
new situations," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's deposed prime
minister Nawaz Sharif gave evidence in an anti-terrorism court in
Karachi for the first time Wednesday, denying charges of hijacking
and terrorism against him.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions from the court judge, Sharif insisted
that he didn't try to stop the landing of the plane that the now
Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf was on board on October
12 last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is incorrect that I have ordered that the plane should not
land in Pakistan," Sharif told the packed court.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister was accused of attempting to hijack
the plane after he announced to sack the army chief earlier on
that day.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif claimed that Musharraf himself was in control
of the plane as it headed into Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The plane finally landed in Karachi only after the army took
control of the airport with alleged fuel for only seven minutes'
flight.
</P>
<P>
According to Musharraf, he contacted the army leader of Karachi
under an emergency circumstances as the plane was going to run out
of fuel soon.

BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A place remains open for the

<HEADLINE> IMF Urged to Minimize Privatization Impact on Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Gambian delegate to the Oil and
Gas Africa 2000 Conference and Exhibition, which ended in Ghana's
capital Accra on Wednesday, has called on the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to minimize the impact of
privatization on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
 Lamin Kaba Jawara, Commissioner of Gambian Department of
State for Trade, Industry and Employment, condemned the trend
whereby most state assets are treated as scrap and given out
virtually for free to companies that have profit as their prime
motive, according to Ghana News Agency report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Jawara made these remarks in to a discussion on "Privatization
of National Companies: Impact Upstream and Down Stream", at the
fifth Oil and Gas Africa 2000 Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the story of privatization in Africa has not been a
pleasant one, where most investors from abroad pay very little
for the companies and later operate them along profitable lines,
sometimes to the detriment of the communities they live in.
</P>
<P>
Jawara said the IMF and World Bank need to help African
countries with enough expertise in the privatization process,
instead of making them look like "waste baskets" that are worth
nothing.
</P>
<P>
He said world financial institutions should not only shout for
 privatization but also encourage governments and countries to
move ahead efficiently well after privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said the experience in Gambia is not any different, adding:
"this situation is not new in Africa; no doubt African
governments have spoken at length about IMF policies in this
direction."
</P>
<P>
 Duncan Clarke, Chairman of Global Partners Pacific
International and Executive Coordinator, said privatization of
national oil companies is inevitable, but the process "must be by
design and not by default."
</P>
<P>
He said the format should be one that suits the country after
 experiences of marginalization over the years.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Says Egyptian Support Vital in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy Thursday praised Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for his
contribution to the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, saying Cairo's support is important in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the remarks at the Ben-Gurion Airport upon his return
from accompanying Israeli Prime Minister to attend a summit with
Mubarak, and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Levy described as "very good" the atmosphere of the three-way
summit, during which Barak and Arafat briefed the Egyptian leader
on the latest breakthrough on Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat Wednesday agreed to resume their stalled peace
talks in Washington later this month, breaking a month-long
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Egypt's support has played a vital role in help the
peace talks out of the impasse.
</P>
<P>
It was also widely reported that the breakthrough materialized
under the intensive mediation of the U.S. and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat reached a revised timetable concerning the
interim and final issues at their Wednesday summit.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise package, Israel will carry out the long-
delayed Israeli withdrawal from another 6.1 percent of the West
Bank within days and implement further land transfer in June, while
a framework agreement on final status of Jerusalem, borders,
refugees and Jewish settlement should be concluded by May and the
September 13 deadline for a final peace treaty remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks stalled in early February after
Barak and Arafat met and failed solve their differences on interim
and final issues, especially the land handover.
</P>
<P>
The originally planned February 13 deadline for a framework
peace deal passed without results.
</P>
<P>
As the first Arab nation to have signed a peace treaty with
Israel, Egypt plays a key mediating role in the Middle East peace
process. Barak and Arafat periodically meet with Mubarak for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader has recently denied reports in Israeli media
that a confidence crisis had developed between him and Barak after
the peace talks on both the Palestinian and Syrian tracks plunged
into impasse.
</P>
<P>
After the summit Thursday, Mubarak said the Middle East peace
prospects were brightening and the good relations between Barak and
Arafat is giving great hope for the resumption of a solution.
</P>
<P>
"We have great hopes that the Israel, Syria, Lebanon tracks
could resume soon, which would be the end of the problem of the
Middle East," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was injured
Thursday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks in northern and
southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:15 (0815 GMT), 10 formations of U.
S and British warplanes made 22 armed sorties over the northern
provinces of Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil, injuring one person and
having some civilian installations bombed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 13:30 (1030GMT), 14 U.S. and British
warplanes formations made six sorties from Kuwait and 34 sorties
from Saudi Arabia over the southern provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-
Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, the enemy planes were challenged by the Iraqi
air defense artillery and were forced to flee back to their air
bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
19,387 sorties, among them 3,474 from Turkey and 15,913 from Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, over the two no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the two restricted zones for lack of
explicit authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator McCain Suspends Presidential Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator John McCain
suspended his presidential campaign Thursday, conceding the
Republican presidential nomination to Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of Republican voters made clear their preference
for president is Governor Bush. I respect their decision," McCain
said at a press conference in his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
"I am no longer an active candidate for my party's nomination
for president. I congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his
family well," he said. " He may very well become the next
president of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Although McCain offered Bush his "best wishes", but he did not
announce his endorsement for Bush to leave his options open.
</P>
<P>
His decision came shortly after Democratic Bill Bradley
withdrew from his White House race to endorse Vice President Al
Gore for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
McCain was defeated in the Republican Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses, setting the stage for a fall showdown between
Republican Bush and Democratic Gore.
</P>
<P>
McCain has won seven states with 231 delegates while Bush has
617 of the 1,034 delegates needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
His Aides said the tactic to suspend the campaign gives him
leverage against Bush as he urges the Republican nominee to adopt
his political reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
Advisers have said McCain's options include barnstorming the
country to promote campaign finance reform and running for
president as a third-party candidate.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greek Economy Makes Historic Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Greek economy made a historic
step today with the formal filing of its application for accession
to the European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU) in a
special ceremony, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Greek candidature file, Simitis said that this
was a historic moment for Greece as its application for entry into
the EMU signaled a new historic cycle and opened a new era of
security, stability, development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Greece was joining the EMU by virtue of
its achievements and all the efforts and sacrifices of the Greek
people had borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
The Greek economy had a prospect of long-term stability
because foreign exchange risks were fading, interest rates were
falling and the business environment became more stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that approval of Greece's application at an
EU summit in Lisbon in June would help in pushing the country's
course to a more stable and effective level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou also said at the same event that EMU membership
signaled the start of a new era of creativity and progress for
Greece, which was joining EMU on its own merits with no political
conditions or commitments following the fulfillment of all EMU
convergence criteria.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece's economic progress was significant,
with its public debt being falling, inflation much lower but
productivity and wages having been increased.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece's application for EMU entry sparked mixed
reaction from opposition parties in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angola Accuses Ex-Portuguese President's Hostile Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentary leader of the Angolan
ruling party accused on former Portuguese President Mario Soares
for publishing hostile statement against Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Bornito de Sousa, whip of the ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola (MPLA), accused the former Portuguese president
of publishing a statement hostile to the Angolan government,
describing Angola as a corrupt dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Sousa described Soares as the "visceral enemy" of Angola,
accusing him of telling lies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the bilateral relations between the two
countries are not endangered, as long as the Portuguese incumbent
authorities had shown good sense.
</P>
<P>
Angolan officials have reacted angrily at Soares' statement,
with a cabinet minister alleging that Soares and his son Joao, the
mayor of Lisbon, were "principal beneficiaries" of illegal diamond
and ivory trading by the Angolan rebel movement National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Lisbon has protested Luanda's allegations against Soares,
Portugal's most prominent statesman. But since the diplomatic row
broke last week, Portuguese political parties have demanded the
government respond in a stronger, "less subservient" manner.
</P>
<P>
Soares has been calling on the Portuguese government to keep
channels open to the Angolan rebels in an effort to encourage
negotiations between the warring parties in the former Portuguese
colony.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Export of Fuel to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Thursday refuted reports
that Zambia is exporting fuel to Zimbabwe which is facing fuel
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister David Saviye told Zambia News Agency that at no
time did Zambia export fuel to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Saviye said Zambia has instead loaned Zimbabwe 34 wagons of
fuel, and that this was done at a time when that country had a
critical fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the fuel would be reimbursed in full though
he did not go into detail on when the fuel will be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
He said at the moment it is not possible for Zambia to export

fuel due to the fact that Indeni oil refinery is undergoing

exporting fuel to neighboring Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Curb Crocodile Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian village headman, whose
daughter was killed by a crocodile recently, Thursday appealed to
the government to curb the growth of crocodile population in the
Zambezi river.
</P>
<P>
The headman told Zambia News Agency in Mongu, the capital of
Western province, that the Zambezi river, which stretches for
1,520 kilometres in the country, has become infested with
crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
The headman urged the government to take actions or else more
people and cattle would be killed by the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
He said his daughter, 39, was killed by a crocodile last month
as she was washing clothes in the Zambezi river.
</P>
<P>
Another woman from the same village narrowly escaped last
January after a crocodile missed her by a flicker as she drew
water from the same river at almost the same spot.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Expound Stance on U.N. Resolution at Arab League Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said Al-Sahaf left here on Thursday for Beirut to attend the Arab
League (AL) foreign ministerial session, during which he will
expound Iraq's stance on the new U.N. resolution regarding Iraq,
the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership has repeatedly rejected the new resolution
recently, claiming that it aimed at prolonging the sanctions which
has been in place since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and keeping
Iraq under what it accused as "the colonial control" by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 called on
Iraq to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors in exchange for the
lifting of the crippling nine-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It created the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC) to replace the now defunct U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the resolution, saying it has carried out
all obligations concerning elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction and demanding an immediate end to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf will ask the pan-Arab session, which starts Saturday, to
discuss the sanctions and the nearly-daily U.S.-British aggressions
on Iraq, the INA said, referring to U.S. and British warplanes'
patrolling the two "no-fly zones" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two zones were imposed by the U.S.-led Western alliance
after the 1991 Gulf war allegedly to protect Shiite Muslims in the
south Iraq and the Kurds in the north from Baghdad's persecution.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the two restricted zones, citing they
were not authorized by the U.N. Security Council, and has
frequently confronted U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the two
zones.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming meeting, Sahaf will also meet AL Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid and a number of his counterparts
in a bid to boost Iraq's ties with the AL and other Arab countries
and coordinate stands on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
The AL decision to choose Beirut to host its 133th foreign
ministerial session is to show support for Lebanon, whose
infrastructure was attacked by Israel recently amid a flare-up of
conflicts between Israeli occupation troops and Lebanon's anti-
Israeli guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. Since then, Hezbollah has been
spearheading a war to oust the Israeli occupation forces and the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Premier Assures Pakistan of Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said Thursday that he will visit Pakistan shortly after a trip to
India, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the pledge when he was receiving Pakistani
Ambassador to Ankara Karamatullah Khan-Ghori at the Prime
Minister's Office. The Pakistani envoy conveyed an invitation to
Ecevit from Parvaz Musharraf, leader of the military administration
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told Khan-Ghori that his Pakistan visit will be at a time
apart from the trip to India.
</P>
<P>
Khan-Ghori also presented a "peace message" of Pakistan to
Ecevit to be submitted to India.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently aimed at balancing Turkey's relations
with the two rival states in the South Asian sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
Following Turkey's announcement on Ecevit's visit to India later
this month, Pakistan reportedly approached Turkey, asking Ecevit to
visit Pakistan, a traditional friend of Turkey, as well.
</P>
<P>
The military take-over, which took place in Islamabad last
October, aroused an international controversy. Musharraf paid a
visit to a number of friendly countries, including Turkey, to make
explanations about the change of power.
</P>
<P>
Sermet Atacanli, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated
Wednesday that Ecevit will travel to the Indian capital of New
Dehli in the coming weeks, and will also visit Pakistan at his
earliest convenience.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM to Attend Arab League Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Othman Ismail said he would attend the 113th session of the Arab
League (AL) to be held in the Lebanese capital Beirut on March 12-
13.
</P>
<P>
The decision to convene the meeting in Beirut is made to show
Arab solidarity with Lebanon in the face of Israel's repeated
aggression on south Lebanon, Ismail told the Sudanese News Agency
(SUNA). He noted that the Israeli attacks targeted the Lebanese
civilian infrastructure in violation of the international norms.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the Arab response to the Israeli attacks as well as
the return of Algeria and Libya to the Arab ranks were promising
signs of the improvement of the Arab position.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the easing of tension between Kuwait and some Arab
countries is also a positive development of the Arab position, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister pointed out that there was an Arab
consensus on the necessity of holding an emergency Arab summit
without excluding any AL member country, referring to the inclusion
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is also an Arab consensus on the importance of Iraq's
return to the Arab ranks and stopping the U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraqi targets, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The coming AL session is part of the efforts to revive
solidarity among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Hassan Abidine told
SUNA that the session will also discuss a Yemeni suggestion on
initiating a mechanism for convening the Arab summit on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
The event will also deal with other issues including the
situation in Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada Post is experimenting with
online postage stamps with the first issue to be expected within a
year, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The post office began testing digital stamps last month in
Calgary,where 35 small businesses have been equipped with software
link via Internet to E-Stamps Corp. in San Mateo, California.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at selling postage over the internet because
customers are constantly asking us to make our services more
convenient to them and this is one way of doing so," Canada Post
spokesman Rheal LeBlanc was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
E-stamps enable customers to place an envelope in a standard
office printer for correct postage, which will be issued through
the software program.
</P>
<P>
If the E-stamp service were launched nationally, consumers
would be able to buy stamps online using their credit card number,
according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Efforts to Make Humanitarian Action Conducive to Peace and Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday called for efforts to make humanitarian action "a
positive contribution" to restoring and maintaining peace and
security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Annan, delivering his speech at an open Security Council
debate, described the humanitarian action as "a critical aspect of
our mission to end suffering and alleviate extreme hardships
around the world."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also voiced his belief that such action is
crucial and imperative for the international community to deal
with what he called natural disaster and "man-made disaster which
are rooted clearly in war and tyranny."
</P>
<P>
"The experiences of the past decade, from Africa to the
Balkans to Asia, have taught us that our humanitarian mission
holds both greater promise and greater peril than almost any other
part of the U.N.'s work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen how humanitarian action can save lives, but we
have also seen how it can be exploited and abused by parties
unwilling to abide by international humanitarian principles, and
only too willing to subvert such action to further their own
inhumane policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Wars and natural disasters, often join in a terrible
combination, continue to cause massive loss of life, tremendous
suffering and great dislocations of peoples and groups," he said.
"The need for effective humanitarian assistance has ever been
greater."
</P>
<P>
Describing the flood-ravaged Mozambique as "only the most
urgent of a number of crises," Annan stressed three major issues
facing humanitarian action." They are: "First, how such action can
make a positive contribution to efforts to restore and maintain
peace and security. Second, how we can continue to make progress
in integrating humanitarian and political-military elements of U.N.
peace operations. Third, how we can ensure that the legal and
principled basis of humanitarian action is respected and
strengthened."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that in many instances, the causes of
humanitarian and security crises are the same, or that the one
arises from the other," he said. "It is equally clear that while
conflict and war are the main causes of humanitarian crisis,
involving violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law, and producing mass population displacement, such
crises often perpetuate instability."
</P>
<P>
"There are no more acute examples of this vicious and violent
cycle than the current crisis in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), as well as the crisis in Angola," he said. "The
crisis in the DRC has implicated a dozen states and over 50
million people, and had its roots in the humanitarian crisis in
the Great Lakes Region."
</P>
<P>
At least six African countries have been involved in the
conflict in the DRC, which broke out in August last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear, therefore, that humanitarian action not only
serves to protect the victims of conflict from further loss and
suffering, but can actually contribute to maintaining peace and
security," he said. "It is true in both negative and positive
terms."
</P>
<P>
"Recent examples where such humanitarian work has helped
consolidate in peace agreements can be found in Mozambique,
Cambodia, Central America, and more recently Guinea-Bissau and,
hopefully, Sierra Leone," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Withdraws From U.S. Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley announced his withdrawal from the U.S. Democratic
presidential campaign Thursday to endorse Vice President Al Gore
in the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president and I had a stiff competition and he won,"
Bradley said at a press conference in New Jersey. "I will support
him in his bid to win the White House."
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he had telephoned Gore to tell him the decision. "
Now is the time for unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that although he has decided to withdraw, he will
hold the 412 delegates he did win to give them a voice at the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in August. Gore has
the support of 1,424 delegates.
</P>
<P>
"We have been defeated, but the cause for which I ran has not
been defeated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley made the decision to quit the White House race after he
was defeated in all the 18 primaries and caucuses the Democrats
have held so far, and one day after he received a final blow in
the sweeping Super Tuesday contests.

<HEADLINE> Annan Outlines Ways for Security Council to Back Humanitarian Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday outlined three ways for the Security Council to
give strengthened support for humanitarian action, which he
described as "a critical aspect of our mission to end suffering
and alleviate extreme hardships around the world."
</P>
<P>
Annan, delivering his speech at an open Council debate, said,
"The Security Council can strengthen its support for humanitarian
action in at least three ways."
</P>
<P>
First, the 15-nation body can press Member States to commit
themselves fully to provide the financial support needed for
humanitarian programs, he said. "Recent Council efforts to do this
in the case of Angola have shown a direct positive result."
</P>
<P>
Second, the Council could consider including in peacekeeping
mandates provisions for financing the early stages of post-
conflict reconstruction and the restoration of the rule of law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Council should address the fact that post-conflict
peace-building activities are routinely hampered by the failure to
sustain the flow of resources, leading to gaps between the
provisions of direct humanitarian assistance and the restoration
of long-term reconstruction and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of the peace and security all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
"The lamentable truth is that far too many of the peace
agreements that are signed collapse before they are implemented,
or relapse into conflict after initial implementation -- in part,
because there are not enough resources to foster essential post-
conflict recovery and stability," he said. "The Council must find
ways to avoid this tragic and wasteful pattern of events."

<HEADLINE> More Sleep Might Help Improve Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have discovered a
new link between sleep and memory that seriously challenges the
wisdom of skimping on time spent sleeping, reported Herald
International Tribune on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that when people learn a new skill, their
performance does not improve until after they have had more than
six and preferably eight hours of sleep. Without adequate sleep,
researchers say, skills and even new factual information may not
get properly encoded into the brain's memory circuits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a person's intelligence may be less important than a
good night's sleep in forming many kinds of memories.
</P>
<P>
The new findings, published in the March issue of The Journal
of Cognitive Neuroscience, point to a new hypothesis for memory
formation involving the interaction between two stages of sleep:
One that occurs at the beginning of the night and one early in the
morning. During both periods the brain undergoes physical and
chemical changes whose interaction may be what strengthens memory
traces.
</P>
<P>
The research was carried out by Robert Stickgold, assistant
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and his
colleagues in the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the
Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
The research also has important implications for institutions
like universities, medical schools and the military, which often
train people amid long bouts of sleep deprivation. That is, more
sleep might improve students' performance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Optimistic About Increased Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson on Thursday said that he remains optimistic that the
oil producing countries will soon increase output to stabilize
world prices.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Richardson said that he expects additional production to lower U.S.
prices within a month of action by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to meet March 27 in Vienna,
where they are widely expected to increase oil production. The
countries cut back production 14 months ago by 4.3 million barrels
a day, which has caused oil prices to soar from less than 11 U.S.
dollars a barrel to a peak this week of about 34 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is there will be (price) stability shortly after (the
increased production) moves into the market," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
While optimistic about more oil being put into the market,
Richardson said that "the issue then becomes the size and
timeliness of it."
</P>
<P>
Separately, Richardson said the United States welcomed Iran's
apparent change in policy on additional oil supplies but insisted
that the Clinton administration was not promising Tehran anything
in return.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, OPEC price hawk Iran indicated it would go along
with a cartel decision to raise production and ease the current
world supply squeeze.
</P>
<P>
Richardson also said that the Clinton administration will not
seek to end economic sanctions against Iraq in order to get
additional oil supplies on the world market.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to lift the sanctions based on that,"
Richardson said. "If Iraq plays around with the markets (Saudi
Arabia) will take steps to mitigate that."

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Launches e-Learning Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
announced the launch of e-Learning for implementing an
supplementing the eEurope initiative in education and training.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive said the new initiative is
aimed to speed up the adjustment of education and training in
Europe to the digital age.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for Education and Culture Viviane Reding said
the global economy is gradually moving towards an innovation and
knowledge society which has enormous growth and employment
potential.
</P>
<P>
"But I find that Europe is not making full use of this
potential,in particular because it dose not have enough people
skilled in the information and communication technologies - a
recent study puts this skill deficit at 1.6 million people in 2002
- and because it is not moving fast enough into the digital age as
is shown by the slowness of the introduction of the Internet in
most of our member states," Reding said.
</P>
<P>
To response to the challenge of the "new economy", the EU
executive arm is taking action on two fronts: first, to promote
lifelong learning and the use of the new technologies in the new
generation (2000-2006) of the European education, training and
related programs; second, Europe must speed up the entry of its
schools and other places of learning into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive put forward its eEurope initiative last
December to make digital literacy one of the basic skills of every
young European. The e-Learning is intended to implement the
education and training part of the eEurope.
</P>
<P>
The e-Learning has four components: to equip schools with
multimedia computers, to train European teachers in digital
technologies, to develop European educational services and
software and to speed up the networking of schools and teachers.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's economic growth for
1999 as a whole was 1.7 percent compared to 2.1 percent the
previous year, according to latest government figures Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss economics ministry believes that Swiss
economic growth continues to pick up pace as Gross Domestic
Product in the fourth quarter of 1999 accelerated to 3.7 per cent,
mainly driven by foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services in the fourth quarter were up by
10.9 percent in real terms, with goods showing a higher level of
performance, while imports increased by 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recovery in the construction industry was showing a consistent
trend, with investments increasing by 2.2 per cent in the last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss National Bank has said it will take strong economic
growth into account when it formulates policy for the second
quarter later this month but has already taken this into
consideration in recent rate decisions.

UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China said Thursday that
the Security Council should also pay attention to humanitarian
issues caused by conflicts, no one should interfere in the
internal affairs of a sovereign country, nor should humanitarian
response be employed as a pretext to use force against a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council debate on the relationship between the
maintenance of peace and security and the humanitarian action.
</P>
<P>
"Like many other countries, we are of the view that the
Security Council should also pay attention to humanitarian issues
caused by conflicts and, especially, take into consideration
factors like humanitarian assistance when fulfilling its prime
responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and
reviewing situations of armed conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that the recipients of humanitarian
assistance are more often than not countries troubled by economic
difficulty, political instability and even armed conflicts, and
vulnerable both politically and economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As the purpose of humanitarian assistance by the
international community, including the United Nations, should be
to help eliminate or alleviate humanitarian assistance, the unique
realities or difficulties in the country concerned should be given
full consideration so as to prevent the conflict or a situation in
the country that has caused humanitarian problems from further
complication and avoid the aggravation of the already difficult or
even tragic humanitarian situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To do so, relevant humanitarian organizations, either
governmental, international or nongovernmental organizations, need
to fully respect the views of the recipient countries, adopt a
just, equitable and unbiased position toward all recipient
countries or parties so that the humanitarian work can not be
politicized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All parties concerned should be conscious that they are
carrying out humanitarian activities in a sovereign state and
therefore they should give full respect to the laws as well as
customs of the country concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to the internal affairs of the country, they
should not point fingers in spite of the humanitarian assistance
they have provided," he said. "Nor should they interfere in the
internal affair of a sovereign state in the name of humanitarian
assistance."
</P>
<P>
"More important, humanitarian responses should not be employed
as a pretext under which to use force against a sovereign state,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we cannot but notice with concern that, in
recent years, the lack of financial resources has placed a great
strain on humanitarian activities," he said. "We call on the
international community to make further efforts in this regard,
and attach equal importance to humanitarian difficulties and
crises wherever they emerge."

<TEXT>
<P>
The 30 humanitarian contracts, which were issued under the
current and last phase (VI and VII) of the oil-for-food program,
were worth 233.5 million U.S. dollars, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
During the week to March 3, Iraq exported a total of 12.1
million barrels of crude oil for an estimated revenue of 330
million dollars, the first since the new procedures began, the
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Since oil exports under phase VII began, there have been 145.1
million barrels exported for an estimated revenue of 3.6 million
dollars, and under phases IV, V, and VI, there were a total of 580
contracts for humanitarian supplies on hold, but none was

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Mounts Fierce Resistance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their assaults in the breakaway republic of Chechnya Thursday as
the remaining rebels mounted stubborn resistance.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting is still raging in the village of Komsomolskoye,
said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In another village, Selmentauzen, federal troops killed 37
rebels Wednesday and another 20 Thursday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that "two main rebel groupings have almost
been eliminated in Komsomolskoye and Selmentauzen."
</P>
<P>
These two pockets of resistance formed after the rebels
regrouped their forces in the Argun and Vedeno gorges. Many of the
rebels were wounded, and the survivors are experiencing a shortage
of ammunition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Russian Justice Ministry's special unit
were killed during an operation to liberate Komsomolskoye,
Yastrzhembsky said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Russian federal troops detained 11 foreign
mercenaries in Komsomolskoye, about four kilometers west of the
Argun gorge.
</P>
<P>
Two federal troops were killed and four wounded Thursday, said
Colonel Gennady Alyokhin, head of the North Caucasus army group
press center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a mopping up operation is in progress in and around
Ulus-Kert and Selmentauzen where 59 dead bodies of rebels and
large stores of arms and ammunition were found on Thursday,
Alyokhin said.
</P>
<P>
"The 1,600 strong rebel unit that fought in that area for a
week has been destroyed and dispersed" and that small groups
trying to flee in different directions are being sought and
destroyed, Interfax quoted Alyokhin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ulus-Kert was the scene of fierce fighting early last week.
From February 29 to March 3, 84 federal paratroopers were killed
in attempts to block the flight of the rebels; 400 militants were
killed during four days, Tass reported Thursday, citing a defense
official.

<HEADLINE> FSB: Terrorists May Be Behind Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Russian intelligence official
said Thursday that terrorists might be behind the crash earlier in
the day that killed nine people at a Moscow airport.
</P>
<P>
The Yak-40 bound for Kiev, Ukraine, went down shortly after
takeoff from the Sheremetyvo-1 airport Thursday morning. Both
Sheremetyvo-2, the international airport that shares runways with
Sheremetyvo-1, were closed briefly.
</P>
<P>
"Several versions may be considered, including possible
terrorist actions," said Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the
Federal Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
He said Ziya Bazhayev, a prominent businessman of Chechen
origin who was among the crash victims, had been under pressure
from militants. The rebels tried to force Bazhayev to give them
money to buy weapons, a request repeated denied.
</P>
<P>
"These facts were noted, and Bazhayev was often threatened in
this connection," Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is premature to firmly attribute the crash
to terrorism as authorities are still deciphering the flight
recorders' data.
</P>
<P>
Vologda Aviation Company, which owned the three-engine plane,
said the aircraft's service life had not expired and that its
commander, Sergei Yakushin, was one of the most experienced pilots
of the company.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Deploys Troops in Zambia-Angola Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has deployed troops in its
North Western Province bordering Angola to check the area which
has recently been attacked persistently by armed personnel
suspected to be Angolan anti- government forces.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa said here Thursday that
the situation is bad in the province and troops have already been
deployed to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
Sampa, who was recently in the area to assess the mayhem caused
by the suspected rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), appealed to people who have since
fled their homes due to the attacks not to rush back to their
villages until the area is thoroughly combed by the Zambian
troops.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are already there and people should not panic on
going back to their villages until our troops are satisfied that
the place is free of armed attacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that some soldiers entered his country in
uniforms and could not be identified as to whether they came from
the Angolan government or from UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said the Zambian government would take care of the
situation and that food would be dispatched to the area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is bad, people need food, blankets and shelter
and we are doing everything possible to address the situation", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia reported Thursday that over 2,000 villagers
have fled their homes in Chavuma and Zambezi districts adjacent to
Angola following a series of attacks by UNITA rebels, who grabbed
food and cattle from them.
</P>
<P>
The villagers who are now squatting on the outskirts of the two
 districts have lost more than 300 heads of cattle over the last
few weeks.

KAMPALA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Burundi President Pierre Buyoya

<HEADLINE> Angolan Coasts Threatened by Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil spill accidents successively
occurring in the sea are seriously threatening the environment and
the living space in Angola's northwest coast areas, especially in
the oil-abundant Cabinda Province, an official document said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the document issued by the concerned department,
tourism and fisheries are the main victims of the oil spill since
the provincial government has ordered to close down all the coasts
facing the threat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CAGBOC), filiale to the Chevron
Company, is considered as responsible for the accidents.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the company acknowledged that due to some
not-yet- identified causes, there are still existing oil spill in
the oil field where CAGBOC is operating.
</P>
<P>
The daily oil spillage is estimated at two barrels, equivalent
to some 310 liters of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
In early January, the Angolan fishers saw the oil spill for the
first time along the Cabinda coast and then reported to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Soon later, CAGBOC said that due to "technical error", an oil
well of the company mistook some 40 barrels of crude oil as waste
water and drained it to the sea.
</P>
<P>
But expert said that according to the area of the polluted
ocean surface, at least 100 barrels of oil has been spilled into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
A lot of U.S. technicians have been invited by the CAGBOC to
Angola, with an aim to resolve the problem as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda, Angola's northeast enclave, is the richest province of
the southern African country, mainly thanks to the abundant oil
reserve in the continental shelf off the coast, which has
attracted many western oil companies including Chevron, the French
ELF and the Italian Agip.

<HEADLINE> India Says U.S. To Revoke Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ten day before the scheduled
arrival of United States President Bill Clinton for a five-day
official visit, India said Thursday that Washington is likely to
issue a notification "very shortly" to revoke sanctions imposed
against 51 Indian companies following its nuclear tests in May
1998.
</P>
<P>
Indications to this effect has been conveyed by the U.S.
administration to New Delhi, a spokesman of the External Affairs
Ministry told the media here.
</P>
<P>
He said these Indian companies will be excluded from the
sanction list after the Federal Register notification is issued,
adding the issuance of the notification is a "technical matter."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, the matter had nothing to do with
the Clinton's impending visit.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a mistake to link the notification issue with the
President's visit," he said while describing the official U.S.
announcement to revoke the sanctions as a "step in the right
direction."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Celeste said here
Thursday that Washington has no intention to mediate on the
Kashmir issue but favored an early resumption of high-level
dialogue between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention to mediate but we feel both India and
Pakistan should have a high-level dialogue" to improve their
relations, he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said that Clinton's visit is mainly aimed at
taking Indo-U.S. relations to a new level and the two sides are
likely to come out with a "blueprint" for giving a substantial
fillip to bilateral relations during his stay in the South Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
Signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), missile
technology and nuclear disarmament are among the issues expected
to figure in talks between Clinton and Indian leaders, Celeste
said.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. sanctions against India, the ambassador said while
some of them have already been eased, talks are underway for
removing some other restrictions while some may continue.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Nourishes Great Hopes for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL SHEIKH (Egypt), March 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak Thursday expressed optimism about the prospects of
the Mideast peace process after a summit with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said at a after-meeting press conference, flanked by
smiling Arafat and Barak, that "we met here in a very friendly
atmosphere and solved so many obstacles."
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to over 200 reporters, Mubarak also said
a "good relationship" between Arafat and Barak "is giving great
hope
for the resumption of the solution between both sides."
</P>
<P>
"And we have great hopes that Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese track
could resume soon, and this will be the end of the problem of the
Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks remain frozen after only two
rounds of negotiations that took place in January and the Lebanese-
Israeli track that derailed in 1996 has not been restarted yet.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mubarak declined to elaborate the
achievements of the talks, just saying they will be reflected in
the future developments.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the aims of the talks are not only to solve
some problems in the peace process, but also to seek for a durable
solution which will secure the stability and economic development
in this region.
</P>
<P>
After Mubarak's statement, the three leaders left the conference
without answering a single question from journalists, with
explanation by Mubarak that they had no time. Mubarak invited
Arafat and Barak to a banquet before the leaders leave for home
later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak arrived in the Egyptian Red Sea resort earlier
in the day and the three leaders held a hour-long meeting in the
Golyville Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The three-way meeting was arranged one day after the Barak-
Arafat summit in the West Bank city of Ramallah, at which the two
leaders decided to resume the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks in Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross, who also attended the
Wednesday summit, told reporters that Israel has agreed to carry
out the long-delayed Israeli troops withdrawal from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank within days, to implement further land
transfer in June while the two sides agreed on concluding the
framework deal by May and honoring the September 13 deadline for a
permanent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks bogged down early February
following an unsuccessful summit meeting between Barak and Arafat.
The two leaders failed to iron out their differences over key
interim and final issues, especially the overdue Israeli further
withdrawal from the West Bank that should have taken place on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
According to Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed last September,
the two sides should have concluded a framework agreement by
February 13 on final status of Jerusalem, borders, Jewish
settlements, Palestinian refugees and eventually clinched a
permanent peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, has been a key mediator in peace negotiations between the
Jewish state and Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Religious Party Threatens to Vote Against Israeli Government Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-orthodox religious
Shas party threatened Thursday that its 17 Knesset (parliament)
members will vote against the government in the next week's non-
confidence motion, even though the party is in the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The threat was made by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef
after his meeting with legislator Silvan Shalom from the opposition
Likud party, senior sources in the party revealed.
</P>
<P>
The motion, to be debated on Monday, was submitted by Likud in
response to the announcement that Education Minister Yossi Sarid
will introduce to school curriculum the poems of Mahmoud Darwish, a
controversial Palestinian writer.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Darwish is known for his poems about the suffering of
displaced Palestinians and their longing for the Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud parliamentarians accused him of anti-Zionism and
calling for the destruction of Israel. Someone also said Darwish
opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although Sarid contended Israelis have to know more about Arabs
and ignorance is not the best means for creating a better
neighborhood, his remarks failed to convince Shas and Rabbi Yosef,
who has absolute authority in the party.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts argued the real impetus behind Shas' threat is its
anger with Sarid, who continues refusing to allow Meshulam Nahari,
his Shas deputy, to take charge of religious schools, including
Shas' educational network.
</P>
<P>
Sarid is steadfast in his opposition to such a plan, saying that
each time the government caved in to Shas' threats, their lists of
demands would extend to a further length.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that Shas, the third largest party in
the 120-member Knesset and the biggest ruling partner of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's coalition, voted or threatened to vote
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the party withdrew its letter for quitting the
coalition only after the government accepted nearly all of its
budget demands for its ailing educational system.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic withdrawal, at the last minute before the Knesset's
voting of government's state budget, saved the prime minister from
the largest government crisis since he came to power.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Shas voted in favor of Likud's referendum bill in
its preliminary reading in the Knesset, which was again
contradictory to the coalition's stand on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The bill, requiring an absolute majority in ratifying the
handover of the occupied Golan Heights to Syria in a referendum,
will make the future peace deal with Syria more difficult to get
approval in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed at the time that at least part of
the reason for Shas' rebellion in the vote was its disputes with
the Education Ministry over Nahari's appointment.
</P>
<P>
Though, Barak reportedly dare not to irritate Rabbi Yosef
further, as he regards Yosef's attitude toward peace process with
Syria critical for influencing Shas and the whole country, which
will decide the fate of any peace treaties reached between the
government and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak had promised to hold a referendum for approval of such an
agreement, as it will surely include the withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's law, any decision by the government to
relinquish territories must be approved by a vote in the Knesset
and a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak sent his aides and cabinet ministers to resolve the
disputes with Shas, including Communications Minister Binyamin Ben
Eliezer's meeting with Rabbi Yosef on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
United States Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk will also visit
Yosef's home Thursday night to lobby for the peace with Syria and
the solidarity in the coalition.

between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a joint session of the National Security Council
(NSC) and the federal cabinet, Musharraf said, Pakistan "welcomes
all steps at resolution of the dispute, including third party
mediation."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came one day after United States President Bill
Clinton announced his decision to include Pakistan in his South
Asian tour later this month.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said that with the exception of India, Kashmir has
been "universally" recognized as the core issue hampering good
relations between India and Pakistan, "thus impeding peace,
tranquillity and economic development in the region
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, during his meeting with the then Pakistani
prime minister Nawaz Sharif last year, expressed his willingness
to meditate between the two South Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been opposing any third-party involvement in
the thorny Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
During his South Asian tour from March 20-25, the American
president will visit the two rival nations plus Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Singapore "Reasonably Confident" of UNSC Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) - Singapore Foreign Minister S.
Jayakumar said Thursday that he is "reasonably confident" of his
country's election for non-permanent membership of the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the parliament, Jayakumar said that "the prospects
of us being elected are very good," because there is no viable
Asian candidate competitor and the Asian Group has agreed on
Singapore's candidate for the UNSC position.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rosy prospects, however, the foreign minister said
Singapore is not being complacent but will continue with all its
efforts to talk to other countries in other regions to ensure a
good voting result in the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against the danger of "getting too carried away,
as it(being elected) does not mean that we have suddenly arrived
or that for two years we will have some magical power status
bestowed on us."
</P>
<P>
"During the two years on the UNSC and thereafter, we will still
remain a small country. We cannot pretend to be otherwise," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council, the U.N. body concerned with
international peace and security, now consists of five permanent
members which each has a veto-- the United States, Russia, Britain,
China, and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-
year terms.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Makes Plastic from Oil Palm for Use in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palm Oil Research
Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) is in the final stage of producing a
plastic, namely polyurethene, from oil palm for use in cars, its
Deputy Director-general Jalani Sukaimi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Polyurethene from oil palm is suitable for external car
components like the bumper and also suitable for use in several
parts of the car interior like the door trim, boot trim and rear
shelf, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new technology is the result of six months' research and
development (R&AMP;D) by the PORIM researchers at a cost of 1 million
ringgit (263,000 U.S. dollars), he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He said the technology had been given to the national car
producer Proton and the plastic from oil palm had passed
specification tests set by Proton.
</P>
<P>
"Proton is expected to start using the plastic produced with
PORIM technology next month," he said, adding the polyurethene is
expected to meet Proton's specifications by year end and usage is
expected to start early next year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, two lecturers from Science University of Malaysia
have achieved a breakthrough in producing plastic composites from
oil palm bunches after about four years' research also suitable
for the automotive and furniture industries.

<HEADLINE> S'pore-Malaysia Negotiations at Standstill: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The package negotiations on
outstanding bilateral issues between Singapore and Malaysia have
been at standstill since last May and new efforts are needed to
regain momentum for the negotiations, Minister for Foreign Affairs
S. Jayakumar told the Parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliament in response to questions on overall
state of relations between Singapore and Malaysia, Jayakumar, who
doubles as Minister for Law, described his country's current
relations with Malaysia to be in a "holding pattern," saying that
following three rapid rounds of discussions on outstanding
bilateral issues in March, April and May last year the momentum of
negotiations, except on CLOB issue, have "grounded to a halt."
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope, of course, that efforts can be resumed to
renew and enhance the cooperation between our two countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore and Malaysia are bound by a multiplicity
of different ties and their relations are marked by both
competition and cooperation to advance respective national
interests, the minister sees the ups and downs in the relationship
between the two neighbors as"natural" and voiced Singapore's
commitment to forging a long-term mutually beneficial relationship
with Malaysia and continuing to take constructive approach towards
realizing the full potential in their bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Taking the subject on the package negotiations launched a year
ago following talks between prime ministers of the two countries,
Jayakumar complained that Malaysia has not given any indication on
its preparedness to accommodate Singapore's requests on the
various issues especially on the supply of raw water to Singapore
after the expiry of our water agreements, despite Singapore tried
to be helpful and has taken the approach of offering "maximum
benefits for both sides" by trying to accommodate new Malaysian
requests on issues such as the railway land and the CPF (Central
Provident Fund) withdrawal by West Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Singapore wants to resolve these issues as soon as possible and
maintains its expectation and approach for a "win-win" deal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ball is in Malaysia's court as it is their turn to
host the next round of talks, he said, noting that Malaysia has
not yet responded with specific dates.
</P>
<P>
Singapore parliament is sitting for 10 days from Tuesday on to
debate the national budget.

<HEADLINE> General: Russia-NATO Consultations to Focus on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Consultations between Russia and
NATO, which resumed Thursday in Brussels, will focus on Kosovo, a
top Russian defense official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides will also start discussions on ways to
improve their ties frozen last March when NATO launched a 78-day
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, said Colonel General Leonid
Ivashov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's Military
Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss the non-proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and missile technologies, the military doctrine
and strategic concept of NATO, the military infrastructure in
Europe and measures against international terrorism, the Interfax
news agency quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The consultations are designed to "prepare drafts of particular
decisions on these issues for the defense and foreign ministers,"
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that Moscow has eased its objections to
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of other ways to provide for the security,
including militarily, of any country," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He described Russia's accession into NATO as only hypothetical,
saying Moscow can be a member only if NATO is transformed from a
military bloc into a European security institution and that Russia
has an equal voice and veto right.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov criticized NATO for its plans to set up a base in
Kosovo and warned that "some NATO countries, and primarily the
United States, are settling in seriously and for long time in the
Balkans."
</P>
<P>
Some are trying to stir up "a permanent tension" in the
Yugoslav province so as to "provide the foundation for a (long-
term) military and political presence in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said that he thinks NATO military contingents are
intensively preparing for an intervention into some of Yugoslavia'
s other provinces.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Chief of the U.N. mission in Kosovo Bernard
Koucher of making "artificial attempts... to remove Kosovo from
Yugoslavia, de-facto," in violation of U.N. resolution 1244 on
Belgrade's sovereignty over Kosovo.

The suspended boys and girls in Grade 6 and 7 recently set up a
Web site for Vancouver's Renfrew school to invite students to vote
online for "coolest girls or boys".
</P>

Eric Thomas, a Vancouver School Board superintendent, was
quoted as saying the issue "is a first at the elementary school
level."
</P>
<P>
"We're familiar with its use in high school but to have very
young children posting this offensive material is upsetting and we
felt we had to nip it in the bud," said the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
Kari Arnott, the school's principal, noted that "a parent
alerted me to how offensive and dangerous it was becoming: racism,
homophobia, sexism and silliness, combined with derogatory
statements about children in this school."
</P>
<P>
"It is not only victimizing but it is also potentially very
dangerous, because actual names of children at this school
connected to our address were posted to the whole, wide world,"
the principal said.
</P>
<P>
Police in Bruce Mines, Ontario, Tuesday also shut down a Web
site used by two girls in Grade 7 and 8 to insult two other girls.
</P>
<P>
The Internet page consisted mainly of juvenile rants comparable
to graffiti found on bathroom walls, according to a police officer
who investigated the site.

Police said they fear that such behavior could escalate into
violent acts.

GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's largest banking group,
UBS, achieved a net profit of 6.3 billion Swiss francs (about 3.7

The pre-tax profit was 8.179 billion Swiss francs (about 4.9

BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday it has adopted a progress report on the eEurope
initiative plan which aims to push Europe to benefit fully from

</P>
<P>
The eEurope initiative was put forward last December by the
European Commission -- the European Union's (EU) executive body.

<P>
It also noted that Europe has the potential and is determined

<P>
EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said in spite of European
strengths, for example in mobile communications, Europe is not yet
realizing the full potential of the Internet.

"This is why Europe needs urgent action in bringing down the
access prices," he said.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins First Match Since February 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United
States had no problems during his first match in over a month,
crushing South African qualifier Marcos Ondruska 6-2, 6-1 in the
first round of the 375,000 U.S. dollars Franklin Templeton Tennis
Classic in Arizona, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the top seed and three-time champion from the United
States, had not seen the court since February 6, when he helped
his country to a Davis Cup victory over Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"It's always nice to come back," said Agassi, the winner here
in 1993, 1994 and 1998 who is 10-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
All four seeds in action today were victorious, with No. 4
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, fifth seed Tim Henman of Britain and
No. 6 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had played in just one event this season, winning the
Australian Open for his thrid Grand Slam title in 12 months. He
then traveled to Zimbabwe, where he won two singles matches in a
stirring first-round Davis Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Agassi returned to the United States to play in
the Sybase Open in San Jose, California on February 6 but had to
withdraw with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
"It was hard just reading the results in the paper," Agassi
said. "I actually had a strong desire to get back out. That's a
good sign. It means I'm not only healthy but fresh and ready to go.
"

Gan Yuping, a vice mayor of Chongqing, where the Three Gorges
Project locates, told a news briefing at an on-going annual
session of the National People's Congress that Huang Faxiang and
Wan Sumei were sentenced to death and life imprisonment,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence was handed down by a Fengdu County court,
while the life imprisonment was announced by a Wanzhou District
court, both in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office audited funds for resettling those
people affected by the Three Gorges Project to dam China's longest
Rivers Yangtze last year, and discovered that as much as 500
million yuan had been squeezed into, misappropriated or embezzled
by individuals. Fourteen people were involved in 10 cases.
</P>
<P>
So far, 80 percent of the money has been recovered and will be
used for the original purpose, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The funds for relocating the affected people account for 85
percent of the total investment for the giant hydropower project,
Gan said, adding that Chongqing has set up a supervisory network
to monitor the use of the funds.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the central government has allocated
over 17.6 billion yuan for resettlement purpose in the Three
Gorges Project by 1999.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Three Gorges Area "Sheer Fabrication": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A vice major of Chongqing
Municipality today denounced as "sheer fabrication" some overseas
reports that there are refugees in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Gan Yuping did this when attending the 3rd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress. Reporters from some overseas media
asked the Chongqing delegation of NPC deputies about this in the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
Gan, who has been in charge of resettling people dislocated by
the Three Gorges Project for quite some time, said that relocation
has been going on smoothly according to the will of those to be
relocated and that people in the reservoir area remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Some 70,000 people will be resettled in 11 cities and provinces
including Shanghai in east China and the neighboring Sichuan
province. Officials of the recipient places and representatives of
farmers to be relocated have had contacts. By year end,
resettlement of people away from the reservoir area on a trial
basis will cover 6,000 farmers, Gan said.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,400 enterprises in the reservoir area that need to
be moved elsewhere, and some loss-making enterprises have gone
through the procedure of bankruptcy, with laid-off workers well
relocated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing had moved 190,000 people by the end of 1999, and by
2003, 500,000 more people will be resettled when the first units
of generators of the Three Gorges Project become operational, Gan
said, adding that the gigantic project will necessitate the
relocation of more than one million, of whom 85 percent live in
Chongqing Municipality.

SHARM EL SHEIKH (Egypt), March 9 (Xinhua) -- The hour-long

</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to more than 200 reporters, Mubarak said

</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate the achievements of the talks, but said

He said the three leaders also touched on the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks during their talks, saying they all hope
that the difficulties will be overcome in a short time that would
lead to the resumption of talks between Syria and Israel soon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that the aim of the talks is not only to solve some
problems in the peace process, but also to seek for a durable
solution which will secure the stability and economic development
in this region.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Transfer Towns Near Jerusalem to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel will transfer three Arab
towns near Jerusalem to the Palestinians during the upcoming
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank, said a senior Israeli
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Chief of Staff of Prime Minister's Office, told the
Israel Radio that three Arab towns situated east and north of
Jerusalem, including Abu Dis, will be transferred to the full
Palestinian control in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The handover would be in addition to the transfer of 6.1 percent
of the West Bank to full Palestinian self-rule expected to take
place in April, or later this year when the two sides reach a peace
agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
All the three towns are now in Area B of the West Bank, where
the Palestinians exercise civil administration while Israel
maintains security control. Yatom said that the transfer will not
cause any security problem to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted a Palestinian source as saying Thursday
that Israel will hand over at least one of the three towns to the
Palestinians during the next land transfer.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis has been suggested by Israelis as a possible capital of
a future Palestinian state, if the status of Jerusalem has not been
decided in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled in
February, were renewed Wednesday as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed to move the talks
to Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is also hosting a summit
meeting among him and Barak and Arafat Thursday in Sharm el Sheikh,
aimed at giving more momentum to the peace talks on the Israeli-
Palestinian track.

and Barak, "the talks, which was held in a friendly atmosphere,
have brought about fresh hopes to the Middle East peace process".
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to more than 200 reporters, Mubarak said
that the talks also help solve the problems facing the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to elaborate the achievements of the talks,
saying they will be reflected in the future developments.
</P>
<P>
He said the three leaders also touched on the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks during their talks, saying they all hope
that the difficulties will be overcome in a short time, which would
lead to the resumption of talks between Syria and Israel soon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that the aims of the talks are not only to solve
some problems in the peace process, but also to seek for a durable
solution which will secure the stability and economic development
in this region.
</P>
<P>
After Mubarak's statement, the three leaders left the conference
without answering a single question from journalists, with
explanation by Mubarak that they had no time.
</P>
<P>
Then Mubarak invited Arafat and Barak to a banquet after which
the visiting leaders will leave for home.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak arrived here at noon in a flash visit to Egypt
for a three-way meeting with Mubarak. The meeting came one day
after the Barak-Arafat meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
at which the two leaders decided to resume the stalled Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks in Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, who also attended the
Wednesday summit, told reporters that Israel has agreed to carry
out the long-delayed Israeli troops withdrawal from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank within days, to implement further land
transfer in June while the two sides agreed on concluding the
framework deal by May and honoring the September 13 deadline for a
permanent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks bogged down early February
following an unsuccessful summit meeting between Barak and Arafat.
The two leaders failed to iron out their differences over key
interim and final issues, especially the overdue Israeli further
withdrawal from the West Bank that should have taken place on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
According to Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed last September,
the two sides should have concluded a framework agreement by
February 13 on final status of Jerusalem, borders, Jewish
settlements, Palestinian refugees and eventually clinched a
permanent peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, has been a key mediator in peace negotiations between the
Jewish state and Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns Against Sheltering SLA Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese resistance guerrilla group
Hezbollah has warned some countries of granting refuge asylum to
the militiamen of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, Hassan Nasrallah has reportedly warned that those countries to
shelter SLA members, will be treated as enemies, the French Le
Figaro newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
France, Turkey, Cyprus and Canada were reportedly taking in
members of the Israel-allied militia.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah repeatedly stressed that it will not pardon SLA
militiamen after the Israeli cabinet on Sunday passed Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's plans to withdraw Israeli troops from south
Lebanon by July with or without an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol an Israeli-controlled security zone in southern Lebanon
which Israel set up in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern borders from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a war of attrition in southern
Lebanon to oust Israeli troops and the SLA from the country, the
last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 14 SLA militiamen have been
killed in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Alert Level Lowered on Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) lowered Thursday Mount Mayon
's warning status to Alert Level Four, after the volcano had a
sudden drop in all parameters of abnormal condition.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs said in a radio interview that there was a remarkable
decrease in volcanic earthquakes, sulfur dioxide emissions, ground
deformations and the most significant, lava outpouring stopped
indicating that no renewed active magma intrusion inside the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
There had been no significant volcanic quakes, so there was no
magma intrusion, the volcanologists said, adding that their
seismometers monitored only slight tremors which is normal to an
active volcano.
</P>
<P>
Despite these, however, the volcanologists reiterated their
call to maintain the 6-kilometer permanent danger zone.
</P>
<P>
With the lowering of alert status, the extended danger zone at
8-kilometer radius along the southeast quadrant was also reduced
to seven kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the Provincial Disaster Coodinating Council
reported that as of Thursday there are still over 60,000 evacuees
housed in 52 evacuation shelters in towns affected by the eruption.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 people fled foothill villages after the volcano
began its latest series of eruptions on February 24. There have
been no reported casualties.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Forecasts 4.5-5.5 Pct Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Buoyed by positive indicators such
as low inflation and interest rates, the economy in the
Philippines is expected to expand 4.5 to 5.5 percent in 2000 with
the growth concentrated in the services, industry and agriculture
sectors.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing here Thursday, Director General Felipe
Medalla of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)
said the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which grew 3.6 percent last
year, is projected to reach 4 to 5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Gross National Product (GNP) is expected to grow by 4.5 to
5.5 percent this year, up from 3.6 percent in 1999, Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth this year will come primarily from the services
sector, which expanded 3.9 percent in 1999 and is projected to
grow 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, and manufacturing sector, from
1.4 percent in 1999 to 4 to 5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector, which propelled economic growth last
year,will continue to expand by 3 to 3.5 percent in 2000. The
lower rate for the farm sector this year merely indicates an
adjustment from its remarkable 6.6 percent growth in 1999, which
was based on negative rates for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Due to the positive performance of revenue collection agencies
in January, the government kept well within its deficit target for
the same period, reporting deficit spending of only 110 million
pesos(2.75 million U.S. dollars), as compared to its target of 920
million pesos (23 million dollars) for that month.
</P>
<P>
Inflation continued to remain at low single-digit levels in
January(2.6 percent) and February (3 percent), while the benchmark
91-day Treasury Bill rates registered at 8.9 percent during the
first two months of the year. This is way below the 9.5-10.5
percent projected levels for 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi-based United Nations
 Environment Program (UNEP) Thursday expressed its support for the
 Indonesian government's rapid response to the forest fire
emergency in Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government's intention to summon logging and
plantation company owners and to review their licenses is the kind
of tough measures needed to pre-empt another crisis," said UNEP's
Asia-Pacific Regional Director Nirmal Andrews in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
However, Andrews said he was concerned at the prospect of a
repeat of the fires that caused months of choking haze throughout
the South East Asia region in 1997 and 1998, according to a new
release available here.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 1200 fires have been detected on the islands of
Sumatra and Kalimantan with pollution index readings over the 300
level, which is considered hazardous to health.
</P>
<P>
UNEP is also assisting with the development of a legal
framework for the prevention of trans-boundary haze pollution with
the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

<HEADLINE> Greece Applies For Entry into European Economic Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece officially applied to join
the European economic and monetary union on Thursday, the Greek
news media reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Economy and Finance Minister
Yannos Papantoniou sent letters to European Union leaders stating
that Greece was ready to become the 12th member of the Euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that Greece has met all the requirements to enter
the European Union's single currency group.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Brussels, EU Commission President
Romano Prodi and Economic Commissioner Pedro Solbes said Greece's
admittance to the Euro zone would be a positive step for the 11-
member economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
The EU heads of state are expected to approve Greece's
application at their meeting in Portugal in July. The admittance
will take effect on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Our application for entry into the European Monetary Union
marks a new historic cycle for our country. It opens a new era of
security, stability and development," Simitis said at a special
ceremony to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
"With its transition to a single currency, Greece will close a
25-year cycle of economic, social and political developments and
transformations," Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
From 1993, Greece managed to lower inflation from 14.2 percent
to 2.5 percent in 1999, and lowered the public deficit from 16.1
percent of Gross Domestic Product to 1.6 percent, said Papantoniou.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Parties to Talk Again After Wednesday's Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists
will proceed with peace talks on Thursday after Wednesday's round-
table talks failed to resolve the differences which led to the
current deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
All the Protestant and Roman Catholic parties met on Wednesday
for the first time since the peace process plunged into crisis
when Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson
suspended the short-lived power sharing institutions four weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said Wednesday's talks were useful and provided
evidence of a determination by all parties to take things forward
in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
"If the difficulties that led to suspension in the first place
could have been solved in a day, they would have already been
solved, but they are more complicated than that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen also admitted that the talks
had not produced any final solution.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to work on such a proposal, a set of
political circumstances that can recreate the confidence in both
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA)
political body Sinn Fein, said that his party is "none the wiser"
when he emerged from the talks.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Ulster Unionists of being unable to "absorb the
type of changes required to give some modicum of democratic rights
and entitlements."
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader said his party remained "wedded" to its
objective at the outset of the peace process which was to remove
guns from Irish politics.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue that within the terms of the Good Friday
Agreement. If David Trimble has some other agenda, he can pursue
that himself," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams and David Trimble, Northern Ireland's Protestant
First Minister and Ulster Unionist Party leader, have been foes
for many years.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble called for clarity over the arms issue, the lack
of which he said was dogging the process.
</P>
<P>
"We of course would dearly love to see what are the last
remaining issues in this process settled once and for all," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The majority Protestants want to maintain links with Britain
while the Catholics seek Irish unity, which led to more than 30
years of violence in the territory. A "Good Friday accord" was
signed in 1998 when all parties agreed to set up powersharing
institutions on the condition that IRA give up all their arms.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being held after a three-week "cooling off period
" during which the British and Irish governments hoped
recriminations over the British decision to suspend the Northern
Ireland assembly would abate.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has demanded that political institutions should be
reinstated, however, the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said
he could not re-form a powersharing administration with
republicans before the IRA arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Before the parties entered into Wednesday's talks, the British
and Irish governments were said not to have provided any fresh
ideas about how to save the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president's special security adviser, Jim Steinberg,
returned to Washington after meeting all the pro-Agreement parties
during his two-day fact-finding visit in Belfast to prepare for
next weeks meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, who advises Bill Clinton on Northern Ireland matters,
said that he believes there is a determination to find a way out
of the impasse.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Welcomes Greece's Euro-Zone Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
welcomed Greece's application for adopting the European Union's (
EU) single currency, the euro, and becoming the 12th member of the
euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Greece submitted its official request for participation in the
single currency on the same day.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi and Commissioner for
Economic and Monetary Affairs Pedro Solbes said that EU welcomes
Athens' application to join the third stage of the Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body said an enlarged EMU area will be
positive both for the euro-zone area and for its member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government's application will be examined by the
European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) which are
expected to make a decision in May.
</P>
<P>
A final decision is expected for the June 19-29 EU summit in
Oporto, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Recent data shows that 75 percent of Greeks support entry into
the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation remains the principle criterion to be
fulfilled since in January, Greek prices remained 0.07 percent
above the qualification threshold.
</P>
<P>
On January 15, the European Commission's Economic and Financial
Committee revalued the Greek drachma's central rate within the
European Monetary System by 3.5 percent, notably to permit a more
rapid decline in interest rates and more rigorous control of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Greece's updated convergence program was endorsed by EU finance
ministers during their meeting in Brussels on January 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
province today held a series of activities to woo investment from
east China's economic center Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A large delegation made up of leaders of various sectors in the
province explained the development strategy of their province to
financial experts and entrepreneurs in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Li Dachang, vice-governor of Sichuan, noted that his province
has worked out an ambitious plan to catch up with the economically-
advanced provinces and regions in the eastern part of the country
within a ten-year period.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by 2010, the gross domestic product (GDP)
of the province will be three times the current figure.
</P>
<P>
In response to the central government's decision to accelerate
economic development of the underdeveloped west, the province has
worked out detailed measures for improving local infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Sichuan will spend 170 billion yuan on
such improvements, said Li, adding that for 2000, the province has
allocated 28 billion yuan for the construction of 108 projects.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the total expressway length in Sichuan will stretch to
1,700 km, with eight high-grade roads being built linking
neighboring provinces and regions, including Chongqing
municipality, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces.
</P>
<P>
More railways and airports will be built to solve the transport
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Also on the list are the construction of electricity grids,
networks of natural gas and water, and the development of
information technology.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the scarcity of funds, Li said that his province
welcomes investment from domestic and overseas sources.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had used 13.3 billion US
dollars of contractual overseas investment and 9.8 billion yuan
from domestic firms.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Welcomes PNTR Legislation for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) in Hong Kong Thursday welcomed U.S. President Bill
Clinton's decision to introduce legislation in the Congress that
would grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to
China.
</P>
<P>
Approval of this legislation is a pre-requisite of the historic
U.S.-China trade agreement signed last November which paves the
way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
said an announcement of the AmCham.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see President Clinton's leadership and
commitment to normalizing trade between the U.S. and China,"
AmCham President Frank Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"The PNTR vote will be one of the most important votes for
members of Congress this year. Its positive outcome will shape
American foreign policy in Asia in the 21st century, promote
stability in the region, and spur trade and investment between the
U.S. and China, including Hong Kong," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Martin stressed that positive U.S.-China trade relations are in
the best interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Department of State figures, U.S. total
direct investment in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong exceeds 21
billion U.S. dollars and 20 billion U.S. dollars, respectively,
while exports of American goods and services to China have grown
to 18 billion U.S. dollars annually, supporting over 200,000
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
AmCham hopes that the PNTR legislation will move expeditiously
through the House of Representative and Senate, and has launched
an aggressive campaign to facilitate that process.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that AmCham's Chairman Richard Kahler spent the
early part of this week in discussions with key players on Capitol
Hill in advance of the Chamber's leadership delegation to
Washington D.C. in the week of May 15.
</P>
<P>
"AmCham is delivering the message that Hong Kong is an
important U.S. trading partner. With over 1,100 U.S. companies
represented in Hong Kong -- over 400 of which are regional
headquarters of offices -- this partnership can only become
stronger with the increase in U.S.-China trade expected following
China's successful accession to the WTO, which is why PNTR for
China is also important for Hong Kong," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"With the economy now recovering, Hong Kong stands to benefit
from increased direct as well as indirect investment given that
Hong Kong is the principal entrepot for trade with the mainland,"
Martin concluded.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Secretary for Trade
and Industry Chau Tak Hay Thursday welcomed U.S. President Bill
Clinton's move to submit to the Congress the legislation seeking
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for China.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland of China and the U.S. are Hong Kong's two largest
trading partners. A stable trading relationship between them is
extremely important to Hong Kong. The granting of PNTR status to
the mainland will remove the uncertainty which accompanies the
annual exercise to renew China's PNTR status in the U.S.," Chau
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a recent analysis done by the Hong Kong Government
Economist has indicated that Hong Kong's economy will benefit from
the business opportunities that China's WTO (World Trade
Organization) membership will create.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. Congress will support President Clinton'
s request and pass the PNTR legislation at an early date." Chau
said.

Jiang talked about strengthening national defense and
furthering military modernization in his speech, attaching special
importance to improving the army's defense capabilities through
high technology. "There is a lot of work we need to do to
accelerate our army's modernization, and the key lies in having a
good grasp of important matters that have a bearing on the overall
situation, and we should always base the modernization drive on
issues of strategic importance," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the importance of continued reform for the
modernization of the armed forces, saying reform is a driving
force for modernization as well as a way out. "It's impossible for
us to achieve a breakthrough or even any result without a
pioneering and reforming spirit," he said, calling for reforms in
all aspects including military affairs, political work and
logistics.
</P>
<P>
Saying a full and earnest implementation of all measures
constitutes a key to achieving the goal of military modernization,
Jiang said, "We should strengthen education for the armed forces
to instill in them a strong conviction and a belief in their
historic mission. We should pool the vigor, willpower and wisdom
of all officers and soldiers for the purpose of achieving
modernization for the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged senior military officers to improve their
leadership and fulfill their respective responsibilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yunnan has a poor population of 7.2 million in 1993, which was
reduced to 2.45 million at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ma Qizhi, chairman of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China, said Ningxia will continue its poverty-relief
efforts after it attains the goal of ensuring basic living
necessities for the needy. "For those poor people relocated from
the southern mountainous areas, Ningxia will strive to lift them
out of poverty in five years and get rich in another five years,"
Ma pledged.
</P>
<P>
Yang Caishou, an official in charge of poverty alleviation in
Guangxi, an autonomous region in south China, said Guangxi
attained its initial goal for eliminating abject poverty last year
and will focus its future efforts on reducing poverty through
ecological development and education so as to ensure sustainable
economic growth in such areas.
</P>
<P>
China started to implement an ambitious poverty-relief program
in 1994, pledging to help its 80 million needy population in rural
areas out of poverty in eight years. The needy rural population
had since dropped to 34 million by the end of last year,
accounting for about 4.3 percent of the total rural population.

<HEADLINE> No Severe Pollution in Three Gorges Area: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality, where the Three Gorges Project is
located, today dismissed as "groundless" allegations of severe
environmental pollution in the reservoir area of the multi-billion-
yuan hydropower project to dam the Yangtze River, China's Longest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here, Vice-Mayor Gan Yuping said
there is no severe pollution in the Three Gorges reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the problem was once serious,
especially when summer floods brought about huge amount of mud and
waste from the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
But the problem has been resolved thanks to concerted efforts
of local governments and people as well as installation of
advanced sewage treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir area cover a 500-km-long section of the river,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
issue, he said, noting that in recent year, departments concerned
have probed into the problem of pollution in major cities along
the Yangtze River. The cities have stepped up efforts to deal with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
China has set ecological protection in the Three Gorges
reservoir a priority in its economic and social development plan
this year.

The grand military parade celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the founding of New China exhibited to the world the army's new
outlook and great achievements in modernization, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue promoting the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century, and
by the mid-century, build China into a powerful, democratic and
civilized socialist modern country and realize the great revival
of the Chinese nation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In this process, the army shoulders a great historic
responsibility, namely, to protect state sovereignty, unity,
security, and people's peaceful labor, and to provide a strong
guarantee for reform, open policy implementation and socialist
modernization, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Political polarization and economic globalization are
continuing. However, the old, irrational international economic
order has not changed fundamentally, with hegemonism and power
politics having had new development, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a strong sense of crisis, because we cannot
concentrate on economic development without a consolidated
national defense and a powerful army," Jiang said, calling on all
officers and soldiers of the PLA to incessantly raise the army's
deterring and actual combat ability.
</P>
<P>
The army should fulfill its fundamental obligation to safeguard
state sovereignty and security, and meanwhile take an active part
in the country's economic development, Jiang said, urging the army
to work out an overall program to help and support the
implementation of the government-initiated develop-the-west
strategy.

<HEADLINE> S'pore FM Rules Out Leasing Indonesian Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar has ruled out the possibility of leasing some
Indonesian land and develop it into an economic area under
Singapore full control.
</P>
<P>
The minister made this clear to the parliament when speaking in
response to a MP's proposal that the Singapore government should
consider leasing from the Indonesian government one of the Riau
islands to develop it into an economic area with Singapore
government maintaining full control of the island.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar, who doubles as minister for law, described it as "
not a practical proposal." The parliament is sitting for ten days
from Tuesday to debate the government budget for FY2000.
</P>
<P>
The minister drew attention to the sensitivity of the issue,
noting this would be open to all kinds of interpretations and
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, what is proposed may be seen as impinging on
Indonesia's rights of sovereignty, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the current situation in Indonesia, Jayakumar said
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has begun a process of
political consolidation, national reconciliation and restoring
international confidence, which is important for the return of
economic stability and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid also sought to deal with the regional pressures
for greater autonomy and even some calls for independence, he said,
adding Wahid has received the endorsement of the international
community on his country's unity.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar described the relations between Singapore and
Indonesia as "warm and friendly ."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent trouble in Bintan, an Indonesian
island close to Singapore, Jayakumar said demonstrations at the
Bintan Industrial Estate in January 2000 over the issue of land
compensation caused losses for companies operating there as work
had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He said "such disturbances, if unchecked, would affect
investors in the Bintan Industrial Estate and in turn dampen
foreign investor's confidence in Indonesia and affect Singapore's
ability to act as catalyst to enhance investor confidence in
Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar emphasized that compensation for the land had been
fully settled when development works by the Indonesia-Singapore
joint venture company on the Bintan Industrial Estate began more
than five years ago and President Wahid himself has said that the
outbreaks of unrest in Indonesia were product of a conspiracy
against his government.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar noted that the Indonesian government have taken swift
action to end the disturbances and since then the situation in
Bintan has been stabilised.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bhutan will hold
secretary-level talks on the issue of Bhutanese refugees on March
12,according to a foreign ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Murari Raj Sharma told a press conference
Thursday that the new round of bilateral talks to be held on March
12 in Kathmandu will focus on issues related to the verification
of the refugees,including modalities and pro-forma of the
verification process, as well as the composition of the
verification team.
</P>
<P>
"Once the verification process begins, there will be no
stumbling stone over the resolution of the refugees issues," said
Sharma.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in eastern
Nepal since they were evicted in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The last round of secretary-level talks on refugees issues,
held on February 14 in Thimpu, capital of Bhutan, had discussed
technical aspects of the verification process, which will divide
the refugees into four categories -- bonafide Bhutanese citizens,
Bhutanese who have emigrated, Bhutanese who have committed crimes
and non-Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-level talks were intended to make way for a new
round of ministerial talks. Eight rounds of ministerial talks
between the two Himalayan kingdoms have so far failed to produce
any agreement on the repatriation of the refugees.

January ordered that Gonzalez be returned to his father in Cuba,
which was backed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S.
Attorney-General Janet Reno.

Gonzalez's Miami relatives to keep him in the U.S. His
great-uncle wanted to seek political asylum for the child.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche, Dresdner Merge to Form World's Largest Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Deutsche Bank and Dresdner
Bank officially confirmed a merger that will form the world's
largest financial institution with total assets of 2.5 trillion
marks (1.2 trillion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The merger was confirmed Thursday by the supervisory boards of
both banks, Deutsche Press Argentur reported.
</P>
<P>
The new combined bank will retain the name Deutsche Bank AG
while adopting Dresdner Bank's green corporate color over
Deutsche's blue.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank will hold between 60 percent and 64 percent of
the new conglomerate, and Dresdner will hold between 36 and 30
percent, said a statement released Thursday. The two banks also
plan to spin off their retail unit in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to be completed by July 1 and save the
company 2.9 billion euros (2.8 billion dollars) by wiping out
overlapping operations.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank's chief executive Rolf Breuer and Dresdner's
Bernhard Walter will be co-CEOs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the new bank will focus on investment banking,
a sector traditionally dominated by U.S. investment houses and
more profitable than retail banking.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche is Germany's largest private bank with assets of some
58 billion euros. It is the world's largest bank after acquiring
the New York-based Bankers Trust last year and enjoys the highest
stock value of any European bank.
</P>
<P>
Dresdner Bank is the third-largest private bank in Germany.
Some analysts called its tie-up with Deutsche a "merger of equals,
" while others say it amounted to a takeover of Dresdner Bank by
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that Dresdner has been seen as an unprofitable
giant under a lot of pressure for not being able to face up to the
challenges of the new global environment.
</P>
<P>
The merger will lead to a total of 14,000 job cuts, the German
daily Handelsblatt quoted Deutsche Bank supervisory board member
Gerhard Renner as saying.
</P>
<P>
The governing Social Democratic party seemed to welcome the
merger despite the job losses. Its spokesman, Ditmar Staffelt said
that the merger would strengthen Germany's standing as a center of
international finance, according to reports from the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Output Keeps Rapid Growth in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest figures
from the National Bureau of Statistics, China's industrial output

percent increase over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Late Argentine Writer Visits Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- The wife of renowned Argentine
writer Jorge Luis Borges, Maria Kodama, visited the Great Wall
today and donated a set of books titled "Complete Works of Borges"
to the China Great Wall Museum.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, works by Borges (1899-1986) had a far-reaching
influence on European and American literature. His writings were
introduced to China in the early 1980s, winning acclaim from
Chinese youth. Borges, familiar with Chinese classic literature,
had long desired to visit China and to see the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Stroking the weather-beaten bricks of the ancient wall, Kodama
said, "The Great Wall is far more grandiose than I imagined. As
climbing the Great Wall was one of my husband's dreams, I think he
would be comforted (with my visit)."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Borges arrived in Beijing yesterday to attend a ceremony
marking the publication of his husband's completed collection of
writings.
</P>
<P>
The set of books consists of five volumes of poems, short
stories and prose.

WUHAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 56 Hong Kong-
based corporations gathered at an exposition opening here today to
seek cooperation with trade partners in Wuhan, the provincial
capital of central China's Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Hong Kong Trade and
Development Council(HKTDC) and the Wuhan municipal government, is
the largest of its kind ever held in Wuhan as well as all of
central China.
</P>
<P>
Garments, decorative items, electronic products, jewelry and
food are the major commodities on display in the 110-plus
pavilions at the exhibition hall. These pavilions are organized in
three groups, representing the Hong Kong enterprises, Hong Kong
government, and Hong Kong Tourism Associations.
</P>
<P>
Conveniently located in central China, Wuhan enjoys special
advantages for trade development and has huge potential, said
Michael Sze Cho-cheung, director of HKTDC.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongxiang, vice governor of Hubei Province, said that the
economic and trade relationship between Hong Kong and Wuhan has
improved significantly in recent years. Currently more than 2,000

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Consumers'
Association today invited 22 renowned lawyers to provide pro bono
legal assistance for local citizens whose consumer rights have
been violated.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers will help to resolve problems stemming from
consumer complaints and inform their clients of the applicable law.
</P>
<P>
The national Consumers' Day, which falls on March 15 each year,
is a special day created to raise public awareness of consumers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Jialin, a volunteer lawyer, the basic principle
of the Law on Protecting Consumers' Rights and Interests is to
protect the weak side in a consumer conflict -- the customer --
who often is unable to guard his own interests because of limited
finances or lack of understanding of the law, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He believed that with the help of lawyers, the customers can
better safeguard their rights and interest "with legal weapons" in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong New Budget Widely Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The 2000-2001 Budget unveiled
Wednesday by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen received
wide praise in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po, one of the major dailies of Hong Kong, said in a
comment Thursday that the budget is far-sighted by setting its
target at cutting cost, enhancing efficiency, further boosting
Hong Kong's economic recovery and preparing Hong Kong with more
strength for long-term economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The ideas of "harnessing the forces of globalization" and "
making the most of our China advantage" presented by the budget
reflect new thinking and style of "Hong Kong people running Hong
Kong," said the comment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said the budget, abiding by the
principle of fiscal prudence and cutting cost to benefit the
people, reflects an active and sound working style of the HKSAR
government.
</P>
<P>
The budget also won support of the major parties.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said a
thorough review of Hong Kong's tax system in the budget is needed
to combat increasingly serious tax avoidance on revenue arising
from the increasingly common e-commerce type of trading.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party and the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance
praised the government for extensively devising plans to cut back
the civil service staff size by 10,000 posts within the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the
budget took into consideration the difficulties of the business
community and the vast ordinary people while ensuring the long-
term economic benefit of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The budget shows the determination of the HKSAR government to
overcome hardship along with the people to actively blaze new
ground in economic development, said the chamber's chairman Robin
Y.H. Chan.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" in HK Good Example in Resolving Taiwan Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle in Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has been playing an exemplary role in
settling Taiwan issue, as Hong Kong has maintained prosperity and
stability over the past three years under the guidance of this
principle.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, made the remarks here
today. He is now here attending the 3rd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, which has been in session since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The central government has unswervingly kept to the principle
of "one country, two systems", and "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" with a high-degree of autonomy, backed the Hong Kong
SAR government in its administrative work, without interfering to
the least in the affairs that fall within the scope of a high-
degree autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR, according to the Basic Law
of the SAR, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong maintains its capitalist system and life style with a
legal system basically unchanged, while enjoying a high-degree of
autonomy as defined by the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law and keeping
independent finance and tariffs. The SAR government headed by Tung
Chee Hwa has exercised effective administration, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong SAR is heading for economic recovery despite
difficulties arising from the turmoil of Asian financial crisis,
thanks to support from the central government. And its economic
growth climbed to 1.8 percent last year from the negative 5.1
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong goes on keeping wide-ranging international
contacts and, over the past three years, Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa made trips to many countries and visited a host of
international organizations. Wherever he went, he was accorded
hospitality and warm receptions. Meanwhile, quite a few heads of
state and government also visited Hong Kong.

<P>
In addition, Hong Kong has sponsored a number of international
conferences, and expanded its economic and cultural exchanges with
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle
in Hong Kong with great success has fully proved the concept
correct, scientific, and feasible. Now, Hong Kong compatriots have
enjoyed the great benefits which are resultant from the principle,
and they fully confide in their future, Jiang said, adding that
last year, the number of HK residents migrating overseas recorded
was the smallest in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
All this has an increasing impact on Taiwan, and many Taiwan
compatriots either made special trips to Hong Kong or stopped over
to see for themselves, and they were convinced that the practice
of the "one country, two systems" principle was successful. And
this, too, will contribute significantly to the settlement of the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Liaison Office will conscientiously implement the
responsibilities and obligations as entrusted by the central
government and handle Taiwan-related affairs according to the
central government's Taiwan policies and the Basic Law, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
His office will go on supporting and encouraging Hong Kong to
keep and develop civilian exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan,
and welcome Taiwan residents and capital to invest, and do trade
and other businesses with Hong Kong, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his office will work harder still to increase
contacts between Hong Kong and Taiwan compatriots, advancing the
ties between Hong and Taiwan and cross-Straits relations, so as to
contribute to the eventual, full reunification of the motherland,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Session Focuses on Strategy to Develop China's West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Third Session of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, held
its fourth plenary meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and Vice-
Premier Wen Jiabao attended the meeting, at which 11 members of
the CPPCC National Committee aired their opinions on the
government's strategy to develop China's west in a big way.
</P>
<P>
Professor and Economist Xiao Zhuoji, of Beijing University,
called the strategy a long-term one that requires formulating
comprehensive plans and taking all factors into consideration and
has to be carried out in accordance with market economic
principles.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to adopt more favorable policies,
compared with its eastern counterpart, for the implementation of
the strategy so as to develop the western region in a speedy way.
Great efforts should be made to develop the private sector,
protect the environment and resources, and accelerate the
development of infrastructure including communications,
telecommunications, and water-supply and power-supply facilities,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuping, vice chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee
of the China Democratic National Construction Association,
proposed setting up a Western Region Development Bank and issuing
long-term bonds for development of the west.
</P>
<P>
Further emancipating the mind is one of the most important part
of implementing the strategy of developing the west, said Zhu
Peide, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. He emphasized the need for
people to change their thinking on how to develop the west. In his
view, development should follow market economic principles; and
people should espouse self-reliance and be prepared for long-term
hard work.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Lo Hong-sui, from Hong Kong, suggested that China's
west improve its investment environment and adopt more favorable
policies so as to attract companies from Hong Kong. Wu Suk-qing,
another Hong Kong deputy, spoke on the role Hong Kong and Macao
can play in developing the country's west.

"Thorough investigations will be launched into major corruption
cases, regardless of whichever department and person they may
involve," he said, stressing, "No lenience will be shown in
dealing with those involved."
</P>
<P>
The minister is attending the on-going Third Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress as an observer. Fighting
corruption has been a heated topic among NPC deputies and members
of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which is also in its annual
session.
</P>
<P>
He said the punishment of corrupt officials like Hu Changqing,
a former governor of east China's Jiangxi Province, is a
remarkable achievement of the nationwide anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
Hu Changqing, convicted on charges of bribery and possession of
huge amounts of property from unidentified sources, was sentenced
to death by the provincial Higher People's Court on February 15,
this year and was executed in the Jiangxi provincial capital
Nanchang Wednesday after his death sentence was upheld by the
Supreme People's Court of China.
</P>
<P>
The punishment of Hu has enhanced the graft-busters' confidence
in rooting out corruption, minister He said, vowing to deal
severely with those involved in corruption cases.

Laws should be formulated by summing up the experience of the
masses, he said, noting that the more developed the economy is,
the bigger efforts should be made to strengthen the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmaker emphasized the need for people's congresses at
different levels and their deputies to perform their functions
more actively, saying this is what is required in the process of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthening
democracy and the rule of law. Lawmakers come from all circles and
are broadly representative of the will and interests of the people,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li called the struggle against corruption as representing the
will of the people and the Party, adding it is a top issue to
which people pay a lot of attention and is a life-or-death matter
for the nation. He urged strengthening legislative work and
combining it with the current anti-graft campaign.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Summit on Mideast Peace Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL SHEIKH (Egypt), March 9 (Xinhua) -- A three-way summit
among Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak began here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite summit took place one day after Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to resumed their stalled peace talks in
Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
The just-started talks are expected to address the new timetable
for the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks agreed Wednesday at the
Arafat-Barak meeting, with the presence of U.S. Mideast peace envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the three-way meeting, Mubarak held brief talks with
Arafat, who and Barak arrived in the Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm
el Sheikh earlier in the day. The three leaders will hold a joint
press conference on their talks after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following a 75-minute summit between Barak and Arafat on
Wednesday, Ross announced that Israeli and Palestinian chief
negotiators will renew their talks in Washington Eid al-Adha, the
Muslim Feast of Sacrifice, which ends on March 19.
</P>
<P>
He also said Israel has agreed to carry out the long-delayed
Israeli troops withdrawal from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank
within days, to implement further land transfer in June while the
two sides agreed on concluding the framework deal by May and
honoring the September 13 deadline for a permanent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks stalled early February
following an unsuccessful summit meeting between Barak and Arafat.
The two leaders failed to iron out their differences over key
interim and final issues, especially the overdue Israeli further
withdrawal from the West Bank that should have taken place on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
According to Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum last September, the two
sides should have concluded a framework agreement by February 13 on
final status of Jerusalem, borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian
refugees and eventually clinched a permanent peace deal by
September 13.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, has been a key mediator in peace negotiations between the
Jewish state and Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Rules out Intervention on Telstra Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday ruled out any government intervention to stop the
country's leading telecommunications company Telstra slashing
further jobs in regional Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It would be absurd for the government to tell it how to manage
its staff," he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Telstra, of which the government is a major shareholder, on
Wednesday announced a 2.1-billion-Australian dollar (1.39 billion
U.S. dollar) half-year profit and its plans to shed up to 16,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made it clear his promise to protect jobs
and services in the bush did not relate to the half-privatized
phone company.
</P>
<P>
"Telstra is of course a company that has certain commercial
obligations and the proposition that the government should seek to
micro-manage the employment levels of Telstra is not a proposition
that I assert," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he spoke to Telstra Chairman Bob Mansfield and
Chief Executive Ziggy Switkowski about the job cuts and Telstra's
half-year results before the announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
"I made it very clear to the chairman and the managing director
yesterday that the government was absolutely committed, and that
there was an absolute obligation on Telstra to ensure, there was
no deterioration of services in regional Australia," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed that those services had to increase, the value of those
services had to increase," he added.
</P>
<P>
Switkowski fronted a meeting of about 150 MPs and senators in
Parliament House Thursday to explain Telstra's plans and push for
a further privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said Telstra had to cut costs to survive and planned to
consolidate the country's 290 call centers, many of which are
based in regional areas.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Not to Accept Annan's Demand on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
president of the Cambodian National Assembly, said Thursday that U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's demand to let the U.N. to
appoint prosecutors and judges on the Khmer Rouge trial would be
accepted neither by the Cambodian government nor by his Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh made the remarks during his meeting with the visiting
senior U.S. envoy Ralph Boyce, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asia and Pacific, who arrived here Thursday morning for
one-day talks on the plans to try former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Prince urged the U.N. to send a legal team to Cambodia as
soon as possible for further discussions, noting that "the
National Assembly will review a draft law on Khmer Rouge trial on
April 20." The government approved the draft law on January 14.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ralph Boyce explained the United States'
position on the issue, saying his government wants only to
coordinate in order to narrow the gap between the U.N. and
Cambodia. "The issue on how to try the former Khmer Rouge leaders
should be decided by the U.N. and Cambodia," Boyce stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two also talked about some issues of common concern, such
as the performance of the coalition government and the scheduled
communal election.
</P>
<P>
Boyce praised the great changes which have taken place in
Cambodia since the new coalition government was formed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Boyce, before leaving here Thursday afternoon, also met with
Prime Minister Hun Sen and Cabinet Minister Sok An, the top
official in charge of tribunal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure, Boyce expressed his hope that the U.N.
legal team will arrive here soon and reach an agreement with
Cambodia on the Khmer Rouge trial.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on how to try Khmer Rouge leaders have been
deadlocked for months over who should control the trial.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen Monday accused the U.N. of dragging its feet on an
agreement to send a legal team reached at a meeting with Annan in
Bangkok last month. On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said that a top lawyer would be sent to Phnom Penh next week in a
bid to resolve the differences and to make a deal on the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government insists that it should have a
substantial power over a Phnom Penh-based "international-style"
court, including the sharing of key courtroom posts and the
prescreening of international participants by Hun Sen's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Company Opens Factory in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. multinational Coca-Cola
Company Wednesday opened its first factory in Angola, the first
foreign industrial project going on stream in the country since
its independence following petroliferous and diamond projects.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Coca-Cola Bom Jesus in the
central coast Benguela province, the production capacity is
expected to reach 1,000 cartons of coca-cola per hour, the
official News Agency Angop reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At present, a 350-millilitre bottle of coca-cola costs some 40
U.S cents in Angola, much higher than the price of 20 cents in
South Africa, Mozambique and Namibia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Coca-Cola Company has invested some 32 million U.S. dollars
in the project, including one factory, 10 retail stores and 22,000
selling points around the country, which will create 400 jobs for
the Angolans.
</P>
<P>
According to Don Short, head of the Coca-Cola's African and
Middle East Group, his company will set up two more factories in
Angola, because Angola is an "excellent" country for international
investment, with a return comparable with most other markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is scheduled to travel to Russia on Friday on a mission to get to
know Acting President Vladimir Putin, who is widely expected to
win Russia's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister's key objective is to build a personal
relationship with Putin and assess for himself where Putin is
coming from and what he wants to achieve," a spokesman for Blair
said in London.
</P>
<P>
Blair is due to arrive in St. Petersburg, Putin's home city,
late on Friday and hold talks with him on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister will be the first Western head of government
to go to Russia to meet Putin since the former premier took over
in the Kremlin at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is too important a country to ignore or isolate. We
need to engage. This opportunity should not be turned down," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's trip follows a visit to Moscow last month by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who praised Putin as a "refreshingly
open" man who would push economic reforms and build better
relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
Several other Western foreign ministers have been to Moscow to
size up Putin, but no Western heads of state or heads of
government have made the trip so far this year.

<P>
WUHAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Studying abroad is becoming easier
for Chinese, say representatives from universities
enthusiastically promoting their schools at a nationwide
exhibition tour of China's major cities.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 International Higher Education Exhibition, which
gathers staff from 160 universities from 18 countries, was on its
fourth leg of the tour in this capital of central China's Hubei
Province yesterday, where it welcomed more than 50,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Kong Dechang sat on steps outside the exhibition hall after
spending a whole day elbowing his way through the crowd to collect
information brochures from the various schools.
</P>
<P>
"To find a good foreign school for my child would be as
exciting as winning a business contract," said the 50-year-old
private businessman, thumbing through his thick pile of papers.
</P>
<P>
He said that like many Chinese parents, he could afford tuition
for overseas study for his child.
</P>
<P>
Giles Williams, who represents Brooke House College from the U.
K., said in the exhibition that students of all nationalities
benefit from the experience of learning overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Entry-Exit Administration with
the Ministry of Public Security, the number of students who go
abroad at their own expense amounted to 80,000, up 60 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign students in Chinese universities
increased at an annual rate of 20 percent to reach 50,000 last
year. They are studying at some 300 Chinese higher learning
institutes.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was held earlier in Beijing, Xi'an and Chengdu,
where it attracted more than 200,000 people. It will move to China
's largest economic and commercial center of Shanghai this weekend.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Forecasts 3.4 Percent Global Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The world economy is expected to
grow by 3.4 percent in 2000, up from 2.9 percent in 1999, on the
backdrop of improving economic conditions in the U.S., Europe and
Asia, a HSBC investment expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at HSBC Asset Management's annual investment seminar,
Global Chief Investment Officer Bryce McDonnell said that "
Globally, strong economic growth is forecast for all regions
except Japan this year, with the strongest growth expected in Asia.
"
</P>
<P>
The Asian economy is forecast to grow in excess of six percent
in 2000, and Hong Kong is expected to see a sharp recovery from 2.
9 percent growth in 1999 to approximately five percent in 2000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell believed headline inflation is not likely to be a
concern in the near term as underlying inflation levels remain
within most central bank target ranges. However, should the
persistent strength in the commodities sector remain, headline
inflation levels may see a rise, which would eventually have an
impact on the underlying inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell warned of a possible rise in interest rates, saying
that as growth is expected to rise there will be pressure on short-
term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He expected U.S. short-term interest rates to rise by 50 basis
points over the next three months, a rate increase likely to be
matched by other major banks in Europe, the United Kingdom and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Over the coming 12 years, McDonnell expected the U.S. rates to
rise by 70 to 100 basis points, which will have ramifications for
the global equities markets.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell expected technology innovation and technology stocks
to continue to dominate and attract investor interest in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Within the Asian region, markets such as Hong Kong, China's
Taiwan, and Korea are particularly attractive to investors over
the medium term, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Set Out U.S. Dollar Clearing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced here today that the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) has been appointed as settlement
institution for the U.S. dollar clearing system to facilitate the
efficient settlement of U.S. dollar transactions in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. dollar clearing system is important in developing
Hong Kong's infrastructure as an international financial center,"
said Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"By facilitating delivery versus payment (DvP) for U.S. dollar
denominated securities traded in Hong Kong and payment versus
payment (PvP) for foreign exchange transactions between the U.S.
dollar and Hong Kong dollar, settlement efficiency will be
enhanced and settlement risk greatly reduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
In line with international practice and with the
recommendations by the Bank for International Settlements, a
private sector solution has been devised for the U.S. dollar
clearing system.
</P>
<P>
As a commercial bank, HSBC will act as the settlement
institution. It will in turn appoint Hong Kong Interbank Clearing
Limited, the current operator of the Hong Kong dollar payment
system, as its clearing agent.
</P>
<P>
The franchise of appointing HSBC to be the settlement
institution will last five years. The system will be implemented
in phase and is expected to commence in the third quarter of this
year.

process.

<P>
The agreement to restart the peace talks that has been in

summit between Barak and Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who attended the
Barak-Arafat summit in Ramallah, announced the breakthrough shortly
after the face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said "the parties made good progress in addressing and

</P>
<P>
"Toward this end, they agreed that the negotiations will resume
after the Eid in Washington," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "The objective (of the resumption of the talks) is to
reach a framework agreement as soon as possible so that all
permanent status issues can be resolved by September 13," the
deadline mandated in an interim peace deal signed here last
September for a permanent peace deal between Israel and the

</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks stalled early February
following an unsuccessful summit meeting between Barak and Arafat.
The two leaders failed to iron out their differences over key
interim and final issues, especially the overdue Israeli further
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday meeting, Israel agreed to carry out the long-
delayed transfer of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank within
days, hand over more West Bank land by June, the two sides agreed
to reset May as the new deadline for a framework agreement on a
permanent peace and honor the September 13 deadline for a final
peace.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for a framework agreement on final status of
Jerusalem, borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees was
originally set in the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal on February 13.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Bring about More Products With  "Made in Singapore" Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Ministry of
Information and Arts Thursday released a "Renaissance City Report"
with a view to bringing about more arts and cultural products with
the "Made in Singapore" label.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Information and Arts and Minister for
Environment Lee Yock Suan told the parliament on the day that the
report is aimed at articulating for Singapore to be a renaissance
city and proposing the strategic direction to guide the promotion
of culture and arts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the report has a vision to establish Singapore as a
global city of the arts and to provide cultural ballast in nation-
building efforts.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen sense of national identity and
belongings, he said, Singapore needs to inculcate an appreciation
of the artistic and cultural heritage and strengthen the Singapore
Heartbeat through the creation and sharing of Singapore stories in
forms of theater, dance, music, literature, film or the visual
arts.
</P>
<P>
The two approaches adopted in the report to develop the arts
and cultural scene are to nurture audiences with a deep
appreciation for the arts and keen sense of aesthetics and to
attract, develop and support both local and overseas creative
talents, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said the six strategies set forth in the report are to
turn Singapore into a strong arts and cultural base, develop major
arts, recognize and groom talent, provide good infrastructure and
facilities, go international and develop what is called an arts
and cultural "renaissance" economy.
</P>
<P>
The term "renaissance" is used to embody the wide and diverse
range of attributes at the individual level, the social level and
the international arena and to emphasize the spirit of creativity,
innovation and multi-disciplinary learning and of socio-economic,
intellectual and cultural vibrancy, the minister elaborated.
</P>
<P>
On expenditure projection, Lee said the government operating
expenditure on the arts in Singapore currently stands at seven
Singapore dollars (about 4.1 U.S. dollars) per capita and the
government has generally agreed to appropriate additional 50
million Singapore dollars (about 30 million U.S. dollars) in total
over the next five years on arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
The additional sum will raise Singapore's per capita operating
expenditure to ten Singapore dollars (about 6 U.S. dollars) and on
a per capita basis the figure is only about half that of the state
of Victoria in Australia and less than a third that of Hong Kong,
he noted.

The agreement was reached at a meeting between the two leaders
at the presidential palace here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a press conference after the meeting that the
center will probably be based in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides also discussed the setting up
of shipping services between main ports of the two countries, such
as between Indonesia's Tanjung Priok and Malaysia's Port Kelang.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he is planning to involve Brunei to discuss the
possibility of opening overland transportation to connect Malaysia,
Brunei and Indonesia to enhance tourism.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir with a 150-member delegation including some key
ministers,arrived here Thursday morning for a two days visit, the
first time after Wahid took office in October last year.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mahathir reiterated his commitment to help
Indonesia in handling its economic crisis as well as strengthening
its economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the 11th largest foreign investors in Indonesia and
the second biggest from the Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with Indonesia's Aceh issues, the
premier expected that the unitary state of Indonesia will remain
intact, and hoped that Aceh province will be remain to be a part
of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow anybody to use Malaysia as a base to launch
bad activities to fight against the neighboring country like
Indonesia,"the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Aceh is the Western-most province of Indonesia which is now
have been demanding for an independence.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Gov't, Opposition to hold Talks on New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting between them is the first of its kind after
Kumaratunga beat the opposition leader at the presidential
elections last December.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe had said that they will have to agree on a
structure, agenda and timetable at the beginning of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The results of the meeting are not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
But the main aim of the meeting is to reach consensus on the
draft constitution which is to replace the presidential system by
Westminster democracy, and to turn the island country into a de
facto federal state by devolving more powers to regional councils
including one administered by minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
One of the main sticking points in discussing the new draft
constitution is likely to be the abolition of the executive
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The UNP wants the abolition as soon as the new constitution is
passed while the government proposes a six-year transition period
during which the presidency still retains.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on Thursday had been earlier fixed for February 22.
However, Wickremesinghe scrapped the talks claiming that he did
not have sufficient time to study the government's proposals.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Decide on WTO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is scrutinizing the
various conventions and treaties of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) before deciding to join the organization or not, a senior
official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Thursday quoted Trade and
Industry Minister Kassahun Ayele as saying that a high-level
committee comprising members from various government departments
has been set up to assess the pros and cons of joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by the Trade and Industry Ministry, has
also formed 10 other sub-committees to study the WTO documents
which specify a member's rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committees are currently studying the items on
agriculture, trade and investment, financial services and
industrial-related services, Kassahun said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Zambian people participating seminars held here
in the past several months advocated that the country should be
careful with the WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
Many Ethiopian businessmen, however, with the support of senior
 government officials, believe that it might be helpful to
alleviate state poverty and to promote national economy when
Ethiopia become a WTO member.

Nigeria's northern states Wednesday resolved to repudiate last
month's decision by the National Council of State to suspend the
implementation of Islamic Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the country's northern city Kaduna, the
traditional leaders said in a communique that "Sharia issue is a
constitutional matter and the only lasting solution to it is to
resolve it constitutionally," reported The Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting set up a committee with members from the northern
states to find a lasting solution to the Sharia issue in order to
help heal the wounds inflicted "on the country in general and the
north in particular," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "the meeting called upon the federal government to
 investigate the root causes of the recent crisis in Kaduna and
its spill- over in parts of south-eastern states."
</P>
<P>
"To the rulers, there are reasons to believe the crisis was
premeditated, and might have been planned outside the state," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
According to Alhaji Adamu, head of the committee set up by the
northern rulers, "the crisis couldn't have been the result of the
Sharia, because states that had already implemented it have
remained peaceful."
</P>
<P>
He condemned "the one-sided nature and the unprofessional
manner" of the handling of the issue by the media.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been killed during clashes in Kaduna
and other cities in the south last month between Christians and
Moslems living there.
</P>
<P>
The country's 36 governors agreed at an emergency meeting of
the National Council of State following the riot to suspend the
controversial code. But some state governors acted back on the
decision immediately and vowed to go ahead with the Islamic law.

WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis of Switzerland
and American Lindsay Davenpor have been confirmed to play the WTA
Tour Evert Cup which begins in Indian Wells, California, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the top seed, will be seeking another chance to avenge
her Australian Open defeat by Davenport, seeded second.
</P>
<P>
But the top two players in the world will likely face stiff
opposition from third seed and defending champion Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
Nathalie Tauziat, who defeated an ailing Williams for the title
in Paris in February, is the fourth seed, one of five French
players among the 16 seeded players who have first-round byes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Goods Welcomed by Foreign Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI,March 9 (Xinhua) -- New York businessman Ezra Cattan
said he hopes China will enter the World Trade Organization (WTO)
as this would mean inexpensive but quality textiles made in China
will enter the U.S. market without any international trade quota
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Cattan was perusing the various textiles displayed at the
ongoing East China Imports and Exports Fair in Shanghai, saying
that Chinese-made textiles are popular among U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
His feeling was shared by businessmen from other countries, who
ordered "Shanshan" and "Youngor" brands western-style suits from a
company based in Ningbo, east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from Indonesia and the Republic of Korea expressed
interest in microscopes made by a company in Nanjing, Jiangsu
province, at the week-long fair which opened Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that Chinese-made goods will be able to find
markets when China enters WTO," said Sun Hui, president of Zibo
Colored Glaze Co. Ltd. in east China's Shandong Province. The
company displayed more than 600 varieties of art reflecting
colorful national styles.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors said labor-intensive goods will still allow Chinese
goods to have a market slice in the international market after
China becomes a member of WTO. In addition, Chinese companies are
stepping up efforts to upgrade their technology, to be ready to
compete with their rivals abroad.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese businessmen have set their sights on the
international markets. Last year, private businessmen in Yiwu,
east China's Zhejiang Province, opened a market in Johannesburg,
South Africa, while others from the city of Wenzhou in the
province are selling shoes in St. Paul, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair is hosted by Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and commercial center, and eastern provinces of Anhui,
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest regional fair in east China, one of the
country's most developed areas known for its export-oriented
economy.

BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo met
here today with Rene Dahan, director and senior vice-president of
the US Exxon Mobil Corporation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tibetology in "Golden Era"-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Tibetologists have made
unprecedented academic achievements since the country began its
opening-up drive 20 years ago, according to Li Guoqing, deputy
director of China's Center of Tibetology.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetology has entered a Golden Era," Li claims.
</P>
<P>
To date, China boasts over 50 Tibetology research institutes,
with China's Center of Tibetology and the China Tibet Academy of
Social Sciences as the biggest.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 1,000-plus Tibetologists, about half belong to
the Tibetan ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, China has trained more than 100 post-
graduates and dozens of Ph.D. students in Tibetology. Most are
young or middle-aged scholars who have mastered not only the
Chinese and Tibetan languages, but also English or other foreign
languages. They are gradually becoming the backbones in every
sector of Chinese Tibetology.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that "under the guidance and support of people's
governments at all levels, Tibetology has become more popular
among Chinese scholars. And in other parts of the world, research
of Tibetology among academic circles has also become more active
in recent years."

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will forward a draft resolution on the Israeli nuclear
file at the Arab League Ministerial Council meetings to be held in
Beirut on Saturday and Sunday. The document will call on Arab
countries to coordinate their stances in the face of Israel's
refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the
consequent hazards to regional security and stability and to the
Mideast peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and India concluded a deal under which India will buy
three Egyptian state-owned factories producing fero-manganese,
cement and lime with 480 million U.S. dollars. The Indian side also
proposed to buy another factory producing cast iron 400,000 tons a
year.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Another Egyptian plane, carrying 40 tons of urgent relief
aid, left for Mozambique on Wednesday to help the African flood-
ravaged country. The aid includes foodstuff, blankets, tents and
medicine. Egypt's first aid plane left late Monday with 35 tons of
relief goods on board.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- A mild tremor measuring 5.4 degrees on Richter scale rocked
Egypt Wednesday at 4:22 p.m. local time (02:22 GMT), the National
Center for Meteorological and Geophysical studies said. The
epicenter of the tremor was the Gulf of Aqaba near the Sinai resort
of Dahab. It was followed by an aftershock measuring 3.5 degrees on
the Richter scale.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moviegoers May Collect Tickets at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. theaters will let people
buy tickets over the Internet and print them out at home, it is
reported from Las Vegas, where the annual ShoWest convention is
under way.
</P>
<P>
Moviefone.com, operated by AOL Moviefone Inc., began testing
such a system this week in Seattle, industry officials said,
adding that the tickets can be bought online with a credit card
and then printed with bar codes readable by scanners at the
theater door.
</P>
<P>
The company already has an Internet-based ticket ordering
system for the movies in several major cities. But while the
tickets can be reserved online, they still must be picked up at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six U.S. leading movie chains used this week's
ShoWest convention of theater owners to announce similar ventures
for Internet ordering, though they won't include home printing at
first. The six chains operate about 12,000 screens in North
America, nearly a third of the industry total.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe that the venture is another example of
theaters' plan to establish a relationship with moviegoers
separate from the actual viewing of films. Over time such ventures
will be able to offer promotions, sell movie-related wares and
target advertising shaped around customers' preferences and habits.
</P>
<P>
Ordering the movie tickets online will, in most cases, carry a
service fee of a dollar or two, on top of the admission price,
though executives say such fees eventually could be reduced or
eliminated as the sites gain advertising revenue.

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils 1 Giga Processor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, on Wednesday unveiled its fastest computer
chip, the Intel Pentium III 1 gigahertz (GHz) processor.
</P>
<P>
"Intel's Pentium III processor operating at 1 GHz is the
highest performance microprocessor for PCs (personal computers),
enabling Intel's customers to ship the fastest personal computers
in the world," said Paul Otellini, executive vice president and
general manager of Intel's architecture group.
</P>
<P>
The processor will be used in new computer models by Hewlett-
Packard, Dell and IBM, and is expected to boost performance by 15
percent over the current fastest processors, Intel said.
</P>
<P>
The Intel Pentium III 1 gigahertz processor comes on the heels
of rival Applied Micro Devices' (AMD's) release of its version of
the 1 GHz chip Monday, the Athlon processor. AMD began shipping
the new chip to Compaq and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
Intel said its 1 GHz Pentium III processor will help speed the
performance of advanced applications including digital photography,
video editing, music, voice recognition and 3-D gaming.
</P>
<P>
Intel priced its 1 gigahertz processor at 990 U.S. dollars, in
quantities of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Most consumers now have computers that run at less than 500
megahertz, according to research firm Dataquest - adequate for
most programs on the market.
</P>
<P>
But analysts believe the additional speed provided by a
gigahertz chip, or 1,000 megahertz, will become more necessary as
the home computer shifts from being primarily used for word
processing and surfing the Internet to a central hub connecting
various devices in the home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Toy Sales Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Online toy sales in the United
States catapulted from 45 million U.S. dollars in 1998 to 425
million dollars in 1999, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from U.S. marketing information provider, the NPD
Group, predicts that online toy sales will reach 1.6 billion
dollars by 2002 if last year's momentum continues.
</P>
<P>
Online toy sales accounted for two percent of all 1999 toy
sales in the United Sates, which totaled 23 billion dollars, said
the NPD.
</P>
<P>
According to an NPD survey conducted in September last year, 55
percent of respondents said a reason for deciding not to purchase
online was unwillingness to pay shipping costs. By January 2000,
that number had dropped to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers' desire to see in person the intended purchase
item was a reason not to purchase toys online for 46 percent of
respondents in September and for only 29 percent in January. The
NPD said that this shift may be attributed to marketers' increased
attention to providing comprehensive online product information.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 13,000 toy-only sites on the Web.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows Protection of WWII Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Clearly in reference to Latvia's
arrest of a World War II (WWII) veteran, Russia's Acting President
Vladimir Putin Thursday vowed to protect all WWII veterans, no
matter where they live.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a cabinet meeting on preparations for celebrating
the 55th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, Putin said
he had contacted the Latvian leadership on the arrest of WWII
veteran Yevgeny Savenko.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect all soldiers of the Great Patriotic War, no
matter where they live," Putin said. "This is our sacred duty."
</P>
<P>
Moscow has expressed displeasure over the arrest and the
pending trial of the 86-year-old veteran who once served as a
Soviet KGB officer.
</P>
<P>
Savenko, who is of Russian nationality, was arrested last
October and charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Latvia was a republic of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
There are around 1.8 million WWII veterans living in Russia and
at least 650 veterans, including 350 from other republics of the
former Soviet Union, will march in the May 9 parade in Moscow,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"They are all soldiers of the Great Patriotic War. Therefore,
we should not make any difference between them in organizing their
reception in Moscow," Putin said. "If our neighboring republics
cannot do this, we should shoulder all expenses."
</P>
<P>
Russia held a grand ceremony in May 1995 to mark the 50th
anniversary of the end of World War II. The former Soviet Union
lost 27 million lives in its vigorous fight against Nazi Germany.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- French insurance companies are
pinning high hopes on the Chinese market, which will be the world'
s largest insurance market by the mid-21st century, said Denis
Kessler, chairman of the French Federation of Insurance Companies
(FFSA).
</P>
<P>
Kessler, who is leading a FFSA delegation in China, said China'
s expanding economy and huge population will create the need for
new insurance services and greater markets for life, health and
pension insurance, which in turn would spur economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here today that French insurance companies
are expecting China's early accession to the World Trade
Organization, arguing that the entry of foreign firms into China
may reduce the market share of Chinese firms, but it would also
mean new technologies, new services and a bigger market.
</P>
<P>
The FFSA delegation arrived in Beijing on Wednesday. On the
same day, the FFSA signed an agreement with the Beijing Insurers'
Association for cooperation in insurance training and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoping, vice-chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission, met with Kessler today.

<HEADLINE> French Insurer Reaffirms Commitment to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Groupama, the second largest
composite insurance group in France, today reaffirmed its
commitment to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day technical seminar on liability insurance
here, Bernard Delas, chief executive officer (CEO) of Groupama
Insurance Group, said his company is now well-poised for the
Chinese insurance market.
</P>
<P>
"With China's forthcoming membership in the World Trade
Organization, we believe the opening-up of the insurance market in
China will set a favorable backdrop for Groupama's continuous
effort for cooperation with Chinese insurance market and local
insurers, which is an important part of Groupama's international
development," said Delas.
</P>
<P>
"As a leader in the industry, we are very pleased to provide
insurance practitioners in China with industry knowledge and know-
how through an ongoing educational and exchange program tailor-
designed for the industry," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The CEO is joining a delegation of the French Federation of
Insurance Companies on an official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Senior experts from Groupama will speak on liability insurance
for Chinese insurance practitioners and academics in Beijing
during the seminar, which would move to Shanghai for another
session on March 13-14.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1840, Groupama is one of the largest insurance
companies in Europe, with a premium income exceeding 12 billion U.
S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Groupama was the first French insurance conglomerate to enter
China's market. Its presence in China dates back to 1994, when its
representative office was opened in Beijing through its fully-
owned subsidiary GAN.

<HEADLINE> China Expects to Increase Onshore Oil Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to widely adopt the
polymer-driven technology in its onshore oilfields nationwide this
year, aiming to sharply increase crude oil recovery, a senior oil
expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Dakuang, a senior expert at the China National
Petroleum Corporation, which oversees the country's oil production,
China expects to pump out an additional 10 million tons of crude
this year by spreading the use of the new technology in its
onshore oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that injection of one ton of polymer into the
oil wells will turn out an additional 167 tons of crude. To
provide more polymer for the oilfields, the country has set up the
world's largest polymer-making plant in Daqing with an annual
production capacity of more than 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Han said that most of the country's oilfields belong to the
complex continental deposits as far as reserve layers are
concerned, where the crude is thick and oil wells have big water
content.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the polymer-driven technology is the best way
to solve these problems. And it has become a pressing task to
develop oil recovery technology, for two thirds of such crude
reserves haven't yet been tapped.
</P>
<P>
The expert noted that as early as the 1980s, Chinese oil
scientists had conducted six polymer-driven experiments in the
oilfields of Daqing and Dagang, resulting in the drop of the water
content and higher crude output in these oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1990s, the country expanded the experiments
into industrial production, with even better results.
</P>
<P>
Han said that the polymer-driven technology is very promising
and more advanced in terms of application, which resulted in
higher economic returns after being used in the country's major
oilfields.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) and Sichuan provincial government signed an agreement on
scientific and technological cooperation for the year 2000 in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
CAS will help the province promote economic development and
improve its ecological environment, according to the agreement,
which was signed by Zhang Zhongwei, governor of the province and
Lu Yongxiang, president of CAS.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will also be launched in electronics and
information industries, development of computer software,
industrialization of traditional Chinese medicine, and other high-
tech fields.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, the most populous province in west China, covers a
total area of 487,600 square kilometers and has a population of 84
million. However, the province only ranked 23rd on the list of
comprehensive capacity for sustainable development among 31
provinces, regions and municipalities in China, according to the
latest report on the strategy of sustainable development in China.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that through cooperation, CAS will help promote the
sustainable economic and social development in Sichuan, and in
turn help the province to fulfill the general goals of development
for the first decade of the 21st century.

ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- King of Jordan Abdullah Bin Hussein said during his official
visit to Turkey that Ankara should either grant or sell water from
it's Manavgat River at a symbolic price.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cost of a water pipeline from Israel to Jordan
was estimated at 300-350 million U.S. dollars and his country can
not afford this cost.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police launched operations against drug traffickers
on Wednesday in Istanbul, Icel and Aksaray, during which 11
suspects were arrested, 22 tons of hashish and 630 kilograms of
pure morphine were seized.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The eastern Turkey and Black Sea regions have been paralyzed
by two days of continued snowfall, which led to the closure of
road, air and rail communications.
</P>
<P>
In many provinces of the regions, snow reached a depth of one
meter. Since the end of last year, Turkey has been blanketed with
snow successively.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are heading back to the
table in an effort to reach a final-status deal by September 13, U.
S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross said Wednesday, after a three-way
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are expected to announce the new round of
negotiations in the presence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. The negotiators will travel to
Washington to relaunch the talks after the four-day Muslim Eid al-
Adha holiday ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The outcome of Wednesday's meeting between Barak and Arafat
indicates that both leaders are still waiting for Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad to decide whether to return to the talks with Israel
and cut a deal with Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians seem to have no sense of urgency,
as the talks are due to be resumed in only 10 days' time - during
which anything can happen, from a breakthrough on the Syrian front
to a terrorist attack that will implode the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the Washington
talks could last anywhere from a week to several weeks, and its
resumption would not necessarily be successful.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The High Court of Justice Wednesday ruled that the State of
Israel should not allocate state-owned land to the Jewish Agency to
build a community settlement that barred Arabs from building homes
there.
</P>
<P>
In the precedent-setting decision, which was made by a 4-1
majority, the court accepted the petition of an Israeli Arab couple
to recognize their right to settle in a Jewish community
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The decision was inked by Supreme Court President Aharon Barak,
who noted that it was future-oriented and did not apply to land
already allocated under the old system.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The State Attorney's Office is examining information
regarding other alleged sexual-harassment incidents involving
Minister of Transport Yitzhak Mordechai, sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One alleged incident occurred in 1996 and the victim was another
staff worker in Mordechai's Tel Aviv office. A former Israel
Defense Forces soldier also told Israeli Army Radio Wednesday
morning that Mordechai made unwanted sexual advances toward her in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The minister took leave Tuesday, after one of his staff workers,
a 23-year-old young woman, complained to the police that he had
sexually harassed and attempted to rape her.

<HEADLINE> Family Courts To Be Set Up In India's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
approved a plan to create 15 family courts in New Delhi to
preserve the institution of marriage and to promote the welfare of
children.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made due to a steady increase in cases
relating to matrimonial disputes, custody of children and
maintenance of alimony which have become unmanageable for the
traditional civil courts, a government press release issued here
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi government, which has been trying to procure
accommodation for setting up these courts, was reportedly urged
to expedite the establishment of these courts.
</P>
<P>
The institution of family dispute courts with an aim to promote
reconciliation among parties in cases of marital disputes and
family affairs would have local jurisdiction and preferences given
to women for appointment of presiding offices for the courts, the
release added.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the procedure generally followed in such
courts would be different from normal courts as applications are
filed on plain paper and none of the parties involved in the
disputes are represented by lawyers or legal practitioners as a
matter of right.
</P>
<P>
However, in exercise of its discretion, a family court may seek
assistance of a legal expert as amicus curiae in the interest of
justice.
</P>
<P>
The release said that such courts would deliver judgment on
declaring a marriage as null and void, restitution of conjugal
rights, judicial separation, dissolution of marriage, declaration
of matrimonial status of any person as well as to the ownership of
the property of the party concerned.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures, provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (
NCRB) just in time for the International Women's Day, showed that
the experience of Indian women continue to be a predictable
smorgasbord of rape, dowry deaths, torture, molestation and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In a country with a population of one billion, everybody seemed
to have got tired of the tales of brides and stove bursts and
beaten housewives which were staple fare for the media in the
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
NCRB said in its reports that laws to protect women's rights
enacted in the 1990s did not mean that old familiar crimes
including those in families had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report said, they have steadily increased as the
years went by: from 115,723 in 1996 to 131,338 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, NCRB said, the figures, which were culled from police
records, only indicate crimes that were reported to the police and
numerous more incidents might remain unreported because of fear,
ignorance or plain incapacities.

MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Muslim rebels kidnapped Thursday
three public school teachers in Zamboanga City in the southern
Philippines, but one managed to escape, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ferdinand Bajarin of the public information office of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), identified the victims as
Leticia Calo and Maybelyn Apolinario.
</P>
<P>
The third would-be victim, Editha Perez, however, escaped from
her captors and reported the matter to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Calo, Apolinario and Perez had just stepped out of the Cabaluan
Elementary School during a recess when four gunmen suddenly
dragged them to a waiting pumpboat. The school is near the
seashore fronting Basilan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The two kidnapped teachers were brought to Sacul Island, a
known stronghold of the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) and the extremist Abu Sayyaf Group.
</P>
<P>
The AFP Southern Command Task Force has mounted a hot pursuit
operation on the kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Hold Talks on Fishery  Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar will hold
talks on fishery cooperation and reopening of Myanmar waters to
Thai fishermen this month, a senior Thai agriculture and
cooperatives ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thammarong Prakobboon, director-general of the department of
fisheries, was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that the
talks will be held when Thai agriculture and cooperatives minister
Pongpol Adireksarn visits Rangoon between March 20 and 21.
</P>
<P>
Pongpel is scheduled to meet his Myanmar counterpart Maung
Maung Thein to discuss the reopening of the Myanmar waters to Thai
fishing vessels and fishery cooperation between the two countries,
Thammarong said.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of fishery cooperation between the two nations is
bright because Thailand has expertise and modern equipment in
fishery while Myanmar abounds with marine resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar closed its waters to Thai fishermen more than five
months ago following a hostage-taking incident at its embassy in
Bangkok, in which five Myanmar hostage takers were flown by the
Thai side to the Thai-Myanmar border and allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also willing to conduct a new survey on marine
resources as proposed by the Myanmar side and will also help train
Myanmar people on new fishery technology, Thammarong said, adding
that cooperation on forestry, irrigation, livestock development
and border trade will also be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Inflation Rate Hits Lowest in 30 Years: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's annual headline
inflation rate has dropped to its lowest level in nearly 30 years
despite the soaring oil prices in the world market, the Bank of
Tanzania announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the trebling of world oil prices from 10 U.S. dollars
to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel over the last 14 months, the annual
rate of inflation continued with the downward trend, declining to
6.6 percent in January 2000, the lowest in nearly 30 years, the
bank said in its monthly economic review report.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the sharp decline of inflation to the
prevailing adequate food supply which continued to improve in
January.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank warned that the hike of world oil prices was
likely to "exert strong pressures on the overall price levels and
the decline in the overall rate of inflation could slow down
considerably."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank report said that Tanzania's trade
deficit worsened by a staggering 175.6 percent to 24.3 million
U.S. dollars in January from 8.8 million U.S. dollars last
December, as exports fell to 64.7 million U.S. dollars from 100.5
million U.S. dollars, a decline of 36. 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in traditional exports follows a decline in
export volumes for most export commodities such as coffee, cotton,
sisal, tea and tobacco," the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Pyrethrum in High Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's pyrethrum is currently in
high demand on the world market owing to its high quality, the
Pyrethrum Board of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
According to orders placed by foreign buyers, Kenya faces a
pyrethrum deficit of 7,000 tons to satisfy international demand,
local media Thursday quoted chairman of the board John Mariaria as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are targeting at least 5,000 tons this season, the
figure is far below the demand on the world market, given the fact
that we supply 80 percent of the commodity worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kenya produced some 4,000 tons of pyrethrum with an
earning of 407 million shillings (about 56 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the effects of the El-nino rains and the La-nina
weather later on had negatively affected the country's pyrethrum
farming.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that his board is committed to ensuring
increased production of the crop by offering incentives such as
free seedlings, better prices, prompt monthly payments and free
education on crop production and management.
</P>
<P>
"We increased the prices by 19 percent last year and we are to
do it again this year so as to boost farmers to increase acreage
and help meet the current deficit," he said.

<HEADLINE> Torture Victim Wins 7,000 U.S. Dollars Compensation in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A former Zambian army officer was
awarded 20 million kwacha (over 7,000 U.S. dollars) by the Lusaka
High Court on Wednesday as compensation for the physical torture
by police officers while in detention at a police station here.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the judgement, Justice Elliot Chala said that no law
allows police to inflict any assault on a suspect, the Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Dave Kataba, said in his application that the
beating and torture on September 23, 1997 was unlawful and a
violation of his human rights.
</P>
<P>
He told the court that his arrest and continuous detention from
 September 21 to October 3, 1997 without being taken to court was
also unlawful.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, 1997, several officers searched Kataba's house
for fake passports and vehicle registration books but found
nothing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businesses Call for PNTR Status for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- After U.S. President Bill
Clinton sent legislation on Wednesday to Congress for granting
China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status, business
leaders pledged to conduct an "all-out effort" to assure passage
of the measure.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation will create a world of new opportunities for
America's workers, farmers and businesses," said Philip Condit in
a statement on behalf of the Business Roundtable (BRT). He is
chairman of the BRT Task Force on International Trade and
Investment and chairman and CEO of the Boeing Company.
</P>
<P>
The BRT corporation members have a combined workforce of more
than 10 million in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The truly remarkable thing about the trade agreement that will
come to life with the passage of this legislation is that the
United States gives up nothing -- China already has access to our
markets," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a win-win proposition for America and it deserves
strong, bipartisan support in Congress."
</P>
<P>
Condit said the passage of the legislation may provide a "once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity for the United Sates".
</P>
<P>
By passing the PNTR legislation, he said, Congress will be
knocking down hundreds of barriers that are slowing U.S. exports
to China's 1.3 billion-person marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. High Technology Industry Coalition on China Wednesday
also welcomed Clinton's move and called for early vote on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
"The High-Tech Coalition on China hopes that this legislation
will be acted on expeditiously," said Jim Whittaker, chairman of
the organization, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that it will be approved with bipartisan
support because of the positive benefits for the high-tech sector.
"
</P>
<P>
It is the high-tech industry's number one policy priority to
seek passage of the legislation so as to ensure that the benefits
of China's accession to the World Trade Organization apply to the
United States, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. High-Tech Industry Coalition on China, chaired by the
Hewlett-Packard Company, is made up of leading American technology
associations. Together, the associations represent thousands of
technology companies across the United States.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-funded Banks In Shanghai Proved To Be Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics from the
Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China show that all the 53
foreign-funded banks registered in this leading industrial and
commercial city scored a profit in 1999.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the combined capital of these banks
totaled 15.47 billion U.S. dollars, the total loan balance stood
at 10.756 billion U.S. dollars and deposits reached 2.431 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen banks which are approved to deal in Renminbi business
recorded deposits of 4.376 billion yuan (516 million U.S. dollars)
and total loans of 5.1 billion yuan (610 million U.S. dollars),
several times the figure for the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of
China said that the bank worked out a series of preferential
policies last year to encourage foreign-funded banks to expand
their businesses. These policies include increasing the areas in
which foreign-funded banks are allowed to deal in Renminbi
transactions, relaxing the restrictions on Renminbi business for
foreign-funded banks and increasing inter-bank lending of Renminbi.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Stop All Arms Sales to Taiwan Immediately, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China today demanded that the
United States fully understand the damage that will result from U.
S. arms sales to Taiwan, in particular at this critical juncture
of both Sino-U.S. relations and the relations across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao issued the
warning at a regular press conference here this afternoon when
asked to respond to a recently-issued U.S. report on arms sales to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the U.S. Department of Defense has
officially notified Congress that the U.S. is ready to sell Taiwan
162 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and equipment needed to upgrade
Taiwan's existing TPS-43F radar systems to TPS-75V. The deal is
valued at about 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China is deeply concerned by the report and has lodged serious
representation with the U.S., Zhu noted, calling on the U.S. to "
immediately stop all arms sales to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have always opposed the
selling of advanced weapons from the United States to Taiwan, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. government has already made
sincere commitments to the Chinese government and people on the
Taiwan issue. According to the commitments, the U.S. will observe
the principle of "one China," abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and adhere to the "three Nos."
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. "has time and again broken its own commitment by
selling large quantities of advanced weapons to Taiwan," Zhu
pointed out, describing the U.S. acts as "a serious encroachment
of Chinese sovereignty and a gross interference of China's
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that such actions "will encourage the
arrogant forces in Taiwan to split China and become an important
source for the tension across the Taiwan Straits."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China is firmly opposed to any
separatist activities that might emerge in the wake of the Karmapa
Buddha's leaving Tibet for India, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today at a regular press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark when asked to comment on the report that
India has allowed the 17th Karmapa Buddha to stay in India.
</P>
<P>
"I did not get the information from the Indian sources," Zhu
said. But he said he hoped that India will properly handle the
issue on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama and some foreign forces have historically tried
to manipulate the 17th Karmapa Buddha to reach their own
objectives, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The 17th Karmapa left Tibet late last year for India. He left a
letter claiming that the trip was aimed at retrieving black hats
and musical instruments which belong to the Karmapa ancestors.

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.S. for "Clear-cut" PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- China today urged the United States
to consider its own interests and swiftly approve permanent normal
trade relation (PNTR) status for China without any pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates the efforts by the U.S.
government and businesses to urge the Congress to grant PNTR to
China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a regular
press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it's absolutely normal for countries to grant
each other PNTR, but the United States has for a long time
attached pre-conditions to granting normal trade relations to
China by making annual appraisals, which has seriously affected
bilateral trade relations," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government insists that what the U.S. is about to
offer must be a "clear-cut and neat" PNTR -- with no conditional
measures thrown in, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
U.S. businesses in China will be seriously hurt if the U.S.
fails to find a solution to this problem, Zhu warned, adding that
the WTO accord the two countries signed in November 1999 would be
meaningless without the U.S. granting PNTR to China.
</P>
<P>
China has made active moves to implement the agricultural
cooperation agreement signed by the two last December, by sending
groups of experts to the U.S. for research tours, Zhu said. Deputy
Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu just finished his U.S. tour, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China welcomes the upcoming visits of U.S.
Secretary of Commerce William Daley and Secretary of Agriculture
Dan Glickman, and that the two sides will exchange views on
strengthening bilateral trade and getting PNTR for China.

incident will have serious repercussions for Sino-Japanese

</P>
<P>
He demanded that the Japanese government handle the problem
with discretion when asked to comment on the report that some
Japanese high-ranking political figures are preparing for Lee's
Japan visit after his term as "president" is over.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Lee Tung-hui has long been involved in activities
to create two Chinas, and has continuously eroded the friendly

<P>
He reiterated that Lee's political activities in foreign
countries are an attempt to make two Chinas, and that his actions

<HEADLINE> HK, Macao Investors Eye West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's ambitious strategy to
develop its underdeveloped west has aroused great interests among
investors from Hong Kong and Macao, the two special administrative
regions that have been major beneficiaries from the country's
reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
There has been a special enthusiasm to "go west" among Hong
Kong and Macao business people who are here attending the annual
sessions of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the top
legislature, and the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top
advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Of these lawmakers or advisors, many have visited the western
region. West China is known for its abundant natural resources,
cheap labor and sound industrial base, as well as steadily
improving infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have invested in the western region, such as Ng
Fok, a CPPCC National Committee member and president of the Macao-
based Ng Fok Group Co., Ltd., and Peter Wang Man-kong, a NPC
deputy and vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber
of Commerce, both of whom have investment in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chan Wing-kee, a NPC deputy and chairman of the Chinese
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, said the government
strategy has provided a good business opportunity for firms in
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
To invest in the west could lower the cost for Hong Kong
investors to compete in the world market, said Vincent Lo Hong-sui,
a CPPCC National Committee member. He suggested that the western
areas should improve the investment environment as early as
possible so as to lure medium and small companies from Hong Kong,
Macao and foreign countries. "Hong Kong is, without doubt, the
best partner for the western region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Intensified Efforts Needed to Protect Environment along China's Largest River: Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers, who are
currently in Beijing for an annual session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), the top legislature, have called for
intensified efforts to protect the environment along the Yangtze,
China's largest river, urged a coordinate development of
environment and economy in the area.
</P>
<P>
They are of the opinion that efforts should be made to protect
soil and water along the river's upper reaches while carrying out
an overall development plan in the middle and downstream areas.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, a link between the developed eastern
provinces and underdeveloped western areas, has often been flooded
in summer, but it has low water flow in winter, said Li Zongqi,
president of the Changjiang Shipping Co. Group, warning that it
sounds an "alarming bell" to the regional economy in the Yangtze
River valley, where there are top industrial cities like Shanghai
and Wuhan in the country.
</P>
<P>
Severe pollution has greatly endangered the existence of rare
aquatic species, and resulted in deluges and deteriorating
environment for human life and production, according to Sun
Zhigang, secretary of the City Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) of Yichang, Hubei Province, who also said that the
mammoth Three Gorges Dam Project area is also facing a pollution
threat.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are very appreciative of what Premier Zhu Rongji
has said in his government work report that "greater efforts will
be made in implementing the government-backed programs to protect
primitive forests in the upper and middle reaches of both Yangtze
and Yellow rivers by returning farmland to forests or grassland."
They are also unanimous in the view that it is the best plan to
improve the environment of the Yangtze River area.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment and outmoded means of production
have been the major factors that cause the worsening of
environment in the Yangtze river area, said Professor Tian Dalun,
of the Zhongnan (Central-south) Forestry Institute. The government
programs to curb land erosion in the Yangtze River valley
epitomizes the government's resolve to tackle the problem
completely.
</P>
<P>
Those farmers, whose farmland will return to forests, pastures
or lakes, should be helped and assisted to eke out a new means of
production in compliance with requirements of the environment, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Hunnan Province, a main
beneficiary of the programs, has returned over 350 sq. km. of
reclaimed land back to the lakes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The deputies also urged to enact specific laws on environmental
protection in the Yangtze River area and set up and improve the
managerial system pertaining to the protection of water resources
of the Yangtze in a bid to resolve foreseeable water shortage in
the new century.

from Hong Kong, suggested in a 12-page proposal that internet-
based economy be bolstered as an important infrastructure and
pillar industry in the nation.
</P>
<P>
In that regard, China needs to establish its own system for
developing internet-related technologies, map out a blueprint for
developing the industry, popularize the use of internet, and form
a venture capital investment system, suggested Cai, who is
chairman of the board of directors of the Hong Kong Shanghai
Industrial (Group) Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
With a promising future ahead, internet has registered fast
growth in China in recent years. By January 2000, the nation's
internet users had reached 8.9 million, which is projected to
reach 30 million in three years.
</P>
<P>
Derivative industries of the internet mainly involve internet
technology, E-commerce, information technology, telecommunications,
software and hardware of computers, and web-based media, said Cai,
adding that the booming E-commerce is already incorporating the
internet industries with traditional industries and rising to
become a new form of industry.
</P>
<P>
Ni Guangnan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, echoed Cai's view by citing the internet as a new
growth area for the global economy and development of cyber-
economy as an irreversible trend.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Chinese economist Xiao Zhuoji also called for greater
government support in funds and the capital market to facilitate
the growth of cyber-economy in the nation.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Pushes Forward Regional Economic Integration  : Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Severino made the remarks before an international conference on
'Indonesia's Future Challenges and Implications for the Region'
sponsored by the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia
Pacific(CSCAP) Indonesia and Japan Committees held in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to these instant predictions, ASEAN has pushed
forward the integration of Southeast Asia's economies. It
accelerated the completion of AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area),"
Severino told the conference, referring to predictions made by
commentators outside and even in Southeast Asia which said that
ASEAN would fall into disarray if not break up, as a result of the
(economic) crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN has achieved a substantial level of economic integration
despite the scepticism of many through the years," he said, adding
the AFTA will be completed in less than two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
He also said that ASEAN will change in the way they conduct
certain of their affairs if they are to cope with the reality of
globalization. "ASEAN will not be the same anymore."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN is, of course, all too aware of the need to make changes
in the way the international community conducts its financial
affairs,and ASEAN has made known its position on this subject. But
ASEAN countries also know that they themselves must now enter into
a new stage in the development of their economies and their
societies. The old ways of doing things, no matter how well they
seem to have served ASEAN in the past, will no longer do,"
Severino said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that such changes could unsettle nations and
societies, at least temporarily. "The crisis has taught, if the
transition is not made, the economy could stall. The gap between
ASEAN nations could, as a result, widen further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with the transformation process now is
taking place in Indonesia, Severino said that ASEAN needs the
country's stability.
</P>
<P>
"How Indonesia manages its own transition and its own affairs
could have a profound impact on ASEAN future," he said, adding
only a stable Indonesia can continue to play a leading role in
international affairs, which has been one of Indonesia's principal
contributions to ASEAN's international influence and prestige.
</P>
<P>
How Indonesia gets back on the road of growth, and to what
extent, will obviously influence the rest of Southeast ASia, he
said.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 Zambian villagers have
fled the bordering North-Western Province following persistent
attacks by armed men suspected to be the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels, the Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, who are now squatting on the outskirts of
Chavuma and Zambezi districts, have lost more than 300 heads of
cattle in different raids over the last few weeks, the report
said.

<P>
The attackers, clad in military fatigue, beat the villagers,
robbing them of food and cattle which were driven back to
UNITA-held camps in neighboring Angola.

Zambezi Member of Parliament David Saviye confirmed the
development in an interview in Lusaka on Wednesday, saying
Minister of Defense Chitalu Sampa and some senior government
officials had rushed to the area to ascertain the gravity of the
matter.

<P>
The government has taken full control of the security

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Establish National Payment Councils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is to initiate the establishment of
national payment councils aimed at improving the efficiency of
payment in trade and commercial transactions in member states.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for setting up the councils will be tabled during
a meeting of experts in Mauritius in two weeks time, according to
a report by the Times of Zambia newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The payment councils will be expected to monitor and seek ways
of improving various aspects of payments and money transfers in
individual member states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are still delays in the execution of payment transactions
in most member states, including delays in cheque clearances and
money transfers.
</P>
<P>
COMESA wish to facilitate the establishment of the councils,
which will be autonomously run by individual member states through
appointed committees.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Mauritius meeting will also be
attended by central bank governors and finance ministers of the
member states.
</P>
<P>
Cross border trade is targeted to be one of the areas of COMESA
activity which would benefit from an efficient payments system
within the regional trading bloc, especially with the advent of
the Free Trade Area scheduled for October 31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Urges to Disengage Fighting Forces in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Disengaging forces involved in
continued cease-fire violations and creating buffer zones should
be the first fundamental step to restore peace in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), a senior Uganda official has said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi,
who is also Chairman of the Joint Political Commission set up
under the Lusaka cease-fire agreement, told Xinhua Thursday
morning that he hoped the U.N. peacekeeping mission to come in and
stop the violations.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting forces should be pulled out of range of each
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
The continued cease-fire violations in the DRC had put the
Lusaka agreement, which was okayed by all belligerents in the
19-month-long armed conflict in July and August of 1999, on the
brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided last month to send a
5,500-strong peacekeeping force to the DRC to facilitate the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the warring sides in the DRC continued to fight even
after the signing of the agreement, adding more difficulty to the
cease-fire implementation.

<HEADLINE> European Union to Aid Rwanda After Six-Year Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union ( EU) will
resume aid to Rwanda after a six-year suspension, newspapers based
in the Kenyan capital Nairobi reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Rwanda where I will sign a new indicative
program with Rwanda, resuming our full-scale aid to Rwanda," the
reports quoted European Commissioner for Development and
Humanitarian Affairs Poul Nielson as saying in Dar es Salaam on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended aid to Rwanda soon after the 1994 genocide in
which at least 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed by Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
The central African country has been relatively stable since
the Rwandan Patriotic Front ended the genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nielson, who left Tanzania for Rwanda Wednesday evening, was
expected to sign the financing agreement on Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Help Ease Fuel Shortage in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is exporting fuel to
neighboring Zimbabwe, which has been facing fuel shortages after
its transport infrastructure was damaged recently by cyclone, the
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zimbabwean high commissioner to Zambia John
Kangai as confirming here on Wednesday that apart from Zambia,
South Africa and Botswana are also helping his country ease the
fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
He said lack of foreign exchanges and corruption in the
country's National Oil Company are also causes for the shortages.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also quoted Deputy Minister of Zambian
energy ministry Celestino Chibamba that his country has not enough
stocks and will find it difficult to meet the demands of the
Zimbabwean market.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of African countries to help their
neighbors when situations like the ones prevailing in Zimbabwe and
Mozambique occur, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Tightens Foreign Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has further tightened
its control over foreign exchange as the country's economy is
worsening as a result of the 22-month war with Eritrea and
recurrent humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest currency regulations that came into effect on
February 11, businessmen in Ethiopia are required to deposit 100
percent of the value of the goods to be imported in local currency
with a commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the regulations, businessmen had only to deposit
between 25 and 40 percent of the value of goods to be imported.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper Thursday quoted Alemseged Assefa, Vice
Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia, as saying that
importers are required to present a copy of deposit slips and
other relevant documents to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
According to Alemseged, imports of fuel, pharmaceuticals,
vehicles, aircraft and boats are exempt from the new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the National Bank has set
restrictions on the amount of foreign currency which businessmen
could obtain to import goods.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the regulations over foreign exchange management, it
is reported that Ethiopia's weekly wholesale foreign exchange
auctions still continued.

<HEADLINE> West China Expected to Be New "Gold Rush" Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The opening last week of a
representative office in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's
Sichuan province, by the New York Life Insurance Co., is regarded
as the latest effort from the world's top 500 transnational
corporations to join in China's nationwide develop-the-west
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan will serve as the company's starting point to expand
its business in west China, according to a company vice president.
</P>
<P>
The American firm is only one of the numerous investors from
overseas that have shown keen interest in China's western area
upon learning the Chinese government-initiated strategy, said
Zhang Zhongwei, governor of Sichuan who is here attending the 3rd
Session of the ongoing Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Contracted overseas investment in Sichuan topped 400 million U.
S. dollars during the first two months of this year, a four-fold
rise over the same period of 1999, Zhang said. Other NPC deputies
from the western areas also brought in encouraging news in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
"Another round of 'gold rush' has arrived in western China as
was the case in east and south China when the reform and opening-
up policy was launched two decades ago, which drew large numbers
of overseas businesspeople to invest in China. Then, many Chinese
entrepreneurs have come to the fore, and the country's economic
reform was boosted," said renowned economist Fan Gang.
</P>
<P>
Western China covers an area of 5.4 million sq km and a
combined population of 285 million, constituting 56 percent and 23
percent of the national total, respectively. And it boasts half
the country's proven mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, economic growth and people's living standard are still
low there due to long-term excessive logging that leads to
deteriorating soil erosion and intensified desertification in some
areas. And the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) in the west
was only 60 percent of the national average.
</P>
<P>
This partly explains why the develop-the-west strategy is being
worked out at the onset of the new century. The newly proposed
east-west gas pipeline project, namely to pipe natural gas in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to Shanghai in east China, which
involves 120 billion yuan (14.4 billion US dollars) of investment
for the first-phase project.
</P>
<P>
The central government is pooling fund for the ambitious
program. "The potential business opportunities in the west will be
far more than in the east when the first round of 'gold rush' took
place there," an expert predicted.
</P>
<P>
Insiders listed some advantageous external conditions for
implementing the strategy, such as a wider range of areas
subjected to overseas investment and a still more open market due
to China's possible eminent entry into the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Eliminating Lifeless Firms Gives Boost to SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official statistics show that a total of 6,400 SOEs have gone
bankrupt or been merged during the past three years. In 1999 alone,
over 860 SOEs went bankrupt. On the other hand, the profits of the
state sector surged 77.7 percent last year, the highest growth
rate in five years.
</P>
<P>
As economic efficiency improves in SOEs, the booming private
economy is also becoming a chief absorber of workers laid off from
the state sector. In Guangzhou, for instance, more than one fourth
of the laid-off workers joined the private sector upon their
departure from their former state-owned employers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1999, about 4,000 laid-off workers were
employed daily by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to NPC deputy Li Xinjia, an economist from the
Academy of Social Sciences in Guangdong Province, introducing non-
state capital into some industries may also lead to a stronger
state economy. Through holding a predominant stake in the
Guangzhou Honda Motor Co. Ltd, a Sino-Japanese venture, the
Guangzhou city government is controlling not only the motor
venture itself but also its numerous subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
While closing some lifeless SOEs, the government is also
providing a series of policy incentives to those viable firms for
listing shares, getting bank loans, and increasing exports, said
Chen Weirong, president of the Shenzhen Konka Electronic Group Co.
Ltd, a state-holding company. With intensified government support,
Chen said, the Konka Group will grow to become the nation's
biggest exporter of household electric appliances in two years.

<P>
All the work mentioned above is to supervise the financial work
of the central government, to combat graft and corruption, and to
enable the banking sector at the central level so as to facilitate
reform, development and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng went on to say that the NPC Standing Committee's
supervision over trial and procuratorating processes should be
kept to the principles of Party leadership instead of actually
doing trial and procuratorating work, and implementing the
principle on collective exercise of supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of supervision is to promote the functions of the
internal jurisdictional mechanism, and to ensure that courts and
procuratorates deal with cases in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li Peng also called for doing a still better job for
the filing and examination of regulations concerning autonomy and
separate regulations.

BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- "We are set to reduce the deficit-
ridden large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to
20 percent of the total this year, through freeing 100 such firms
and closing 100 more," said Lin Shusen, mayor of China's southern
boom city Guangzhou who is here attending an annual session of the
nation's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"Only when those hopeless firms go bankrupt, can we concentrate
the state-owned resources on improving the hopeful ones," Lin
stressed, citing measures in both regards as a key to the SOE
reform.
</P>
<P>
As a result of implementing a restructuring program in the
state sector, the city's state sector registered an annual growth
of 13 percent in industrial output value, turning Guangzhou into
the nation's second largest industrial city after Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Lu Baifu, deputy director of the Development Research Center
under the State Council and also a deputy to the Third Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), summed up Guangzhou's
experience by saying that the flourishing of the private sector in
areas that have claimed success in the SOE reform proved that the
state capital could be made best use of so long as it could be
withdrawn from some sectors and efficiently utilized in other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Actually, restructuring the state sector and reducing its
presence in the national economy were already endorsed by the
central authorities last year as an effective means to deepen the
SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, an economic powerhouse in eastern China, shut down a
good many SOEs in traditional processing industries in recent
years. In the first half of last year alone, Shanghai transferred
and sold 1.2 billion yuan-worth of SOEs. By the year-end, Shanghai
has reduced the money losers in the state sector to the lowest
level in ten years.

<P>
It is a serious crime to combine inedible objects with any
edible thing, said Dr. Tika Karki, Director of the Laboratory. "We
have already directed regional food laboratories in the country to
collect the samples of such lollipops so that we can initiate
action against the manufacturers of such products," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a ten-year-old Nepalese boy swallowed a whistle
while licking a lollipop and was suffocated to death on the way to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has witnessed a series of accidents related to lollipops
with whistles swallowed by children in the past one year. Four
boys earlier had to undergo bronchoscope after they swallowed
whistles in lollipops.
</P>
<P>
However, no serious measures were taken to outlaw confectioners
producing such lollipops in the past and basic mandatory
requirements have not been set for the manufacturing of lollipops.
</P>
<P>
The consumers protection act of Nepal have provisioned a legal
action and fine against the manufacturers of fatal edibles.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Industrial
Production Index (IPI) in January rose 26 percent to 167.7 points,
a favorable beginning for the year compared with 133.1 points
registered in the same month of 1999, Malaysian Statistics
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The achievement gave an early indication of a promising
economic growth for the year, the department said in a preliminary
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia's January industrial production surged due to
strong rises in both the manufacturing and electricity output.
</P>
<P>
The department also said the year-on-year rise was attributable
to soaring manufacturing production growth of 37.4 percent to 180.
4 points on a year-on-year basis and the strong electricity output
growth of 9.2 percent to 176.4.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IPI in January was 4.2 percent lower when
compared with that of December, 1999. The drop was due to a 7.3
percent decrease in manufacturing output and a 4.8 percent drop in
the electricity index.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice President George
Saitoti has appealed to the Canadian government for assistance in
dealing with the refugee situation in the country, according to a
report by the Kenya Times newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The influx of refugees to Kenya from war-torn countries in the

also has become a cause of insecurity in Kenya, said Saitoti while
meeting with visiting Canadian Minister Elinor Chaplain of
Citizenship and Immigration.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said Kenya has continued to host thousands
of refugees from war-torn nations likes Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia
and countries in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
He called for a lasting solution to the conflicts in these
countries in order to enable displaced people to return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Chaplain, who is responsible for Canadian refugee policy and
resettlement of refugees to Canada, will visit the Dadaab refugee

<HEADLINE> Last Interfet Warship Returns to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The last Australian warship of
the International Force in East Timor (Interfet) returned home to
Sydney Thursday after two months keeping the seas safe around East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
A small but ecstatic crowd of family and well-wishers gathered
on the Woolloomooloo dock, on the Sydney Harbor, to welcome home
the HMAS Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The warship's main job in East Timor was to patrol the
coastline while her helicopter transferred personnel and equipment
to the island.
</P>
<P>
The ship's top officer, Commander Andy Gough, said the main
function of the HMAS Melbourne was to keep the sea lanes open.
</P>
<P>
"As the terrain is so difficult to get around and air support
hard to get, keeping the sea lanes open to keep our troops
provided with equipment and supplies was crucially important,"
Gough said.
</P>
<P>
Gough described the climate in East Timor as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to define where humidity ends and precipitation
begins ... it's that hot and sweaty that you cannot tell when it's
raining or just humid," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Launches Mother-Baby Health Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality has launched a health project to minimize the
mortality rate among mothers and newly-born babies in 21 of the
city's counties.
</P>
<P>
According to Chongqing Vice Mayor Wang Hongju, the two-year
project involves a total investment of over 20 million yuan (2.4
million U.S. dollars), 10 million yuan (1.2 million dollars) from
the central government and the rest from local governments.
</P>
<P>
The money is being used to train medical personnel, provide
health-care education for expectant mothers, buy health equipment
for county and township hospitals, and provide financial support
to poor pregnant mothers, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2001 when the project is completed, the city is
expected to see its mother and baby mortality rates drop by 50
percent and 33 percent, compared to 1990, he added.
</P>
<P>
With 80 percent of its 30 million people living in the rural
areas, Chongqing's mortality rates for mothers and babies were 157.
26 per 100,000 and 58.47 per 1,000, respectively in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This situation had greatly improved by the end of 1998 thanks
to efforts by the local government which allocated more than 30
million yuan (3.6 million dollars) a year to hospitals and clinics
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China is also expected to launch similar projects in 11 other
provinces in central and western areas with a total investment of
100 million yuan (12 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> East China County Welcomes Back Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The reappearance of South China
tigers in Yuanqing County in east China's Zhejiang Province is now
a hot topic among the local people.
</P>
<P>
Folks there are talking about the tigers in the office, at the
dining table, and everywhere they go these days. They all say the
appearance of tigers is due to efforts made by the county
government to improve the environment and expand forest areas.
</P>
<P>
The area of the Baishanzu Nature Reserve, where traces of South
China tigers were found, has been expanded from some 6,000
hectares in 1991 to the current 10,000-plus hectares.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Bureau and Zhejiang University
jointly announced on February 12 the discovery of tiger traces in
the Fengyang Mountain-Baishanzu Nature Reserve region, the first
since they disappeared from the province decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger was listed as one of the ten most
endangered wildlife species in the world in 1996 by the
International Union For Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
These tigers mainly lived in a large area covering Zhejiang and
Fujian provinces in the east and Qinghai and Sichuan provinces in
the west, and the Qinling Ranges and the Yellow River in the north
and Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the
south.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 4,000 South China tigers in the country
in 1949, but their number decreased to the current 30 to 50
because of excessive killing and a deteriorating natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
There had been no reports of the tiger in Zhejiang Province
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Four workers in the Baishanzu Nature Reserve first found the
traces of two adult South China tigers and one young tiger on
October 24, 1998. One week later, tiger excrement was found in the
reserve, and by early February this year, traces of the tigers had
been found many times in the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Professor Fang Shengguo and other experts from Zhejiang
University, along with the provincial forestry bureau, used the
gene-marking identification method to prove that the discovered
excrement belonged to South China tigers.
</P>
<P>
On March 6, Yuanqing County convened a meeting and called on
all departments concerned to extend great efforts to protect, save,
and publicize the tiger, and said they will further expand the
area of the Baishanzu Nature Reserve to provide greater living
space for South China tigers.

<HEADLINE> China Should Economize Resources in West Development: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China should not take the old road
of wasting resources and polluting the environment while
developing the western region, but rather economize resources,
said Tian Fengshan, the newly appointed minister of Land Resources.
</P>
<P>
Tian, former governor of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, was appointed to his new post at the beginning of this
month. He said that his ministry is now drawing up a plan to
develop land resources in western China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will investigate mineral, land, and underground
water resources in the western region, and based on the
investigation, will map out a comprehensive development plan for
the utilization of the resources, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
Tian stressed the introduction of high technology in resource
development, such as remote sensing devices and information
technology for monitoring the ecological environment of western
China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also gather experts to study the exploitation
of large mineral deposits in the west, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the development of land and mineral
resources in western China should be more market oriented, and
that efficiency in the utilization of these resources should be
improved. At the same time, China will return some cultivated land
to forests and grassland to improve the ecological environment of
the region.
</P>
<P>
China has instituted a series of preferential policies to
encourage financial and labor investment in the west, and
restrictions on foreign companies wishing to explore mineral
resources there have been relaxed. China is currently attracting
foreign investment in mineral exploration in the southwestern
province of Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't Won't to Intervene In Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has insisted
it will not cut oil tax or subsidize oil products to bring down
local retail prices despite rocketing charges, which increased by
another 0.40 baht (0.01 U.S. dollar) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Bangkok Post, the government's
policy has been widely supported by several leading economists who
say that a reduction of oil tax will not only worsen the
government's fiscal position, but also distort the local market.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted as saying that he was
confident that oil prices would not stay high too long.
</P>
<P>
Domestic oil companies Thursday raised the prices of all petrol
and diesel oil products by another 0.40 baht a liter, setting an
all-time record high for the second time in just one week.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister Wednesday told all ministries concerned to
convince private operators not to increase the prices of their
services or products.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts, however, noted that it is important for the
government to curb the hiking prices of goods, otherwise the
government's stability could be affected.
</P>
<P>
As oil prices soar rapidly, Thai commerce ministry has already
approved price increases for 12 goods, including lubricants, soy
sauce, instant coffee, soya cooking oil, semi-finished foods,
medicine seasoning powder, pesticides, concrete roof tiles, nails,
electric wire and portland cement.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that there is no measures to prevent oil
prices from rising as it is an external factor.
</P>
<P>
The price of Dubai crude soared to 28.41 dollars a barrel
Wednesday from 26.45 dollars last Monday while the posted price of
premium petrol in Singapore soared to 37.45 dollars a barrel from
35.95 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The jump in world oil prices came amid growing uncertainty over
whether Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase production.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
Wednesday cautioned the country's bankers not to make loans on the
expectation that the record-breaking economic expansion will
continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Independent Community Bankers of America at
its meeting in San Antonio, Texas, Greenspan said there was a "
troubling trend" of many banks taking the strong economy for
granted and considering it "ordinary and expected."
</P>
<P>
"Lending granted on that basis could have grave consequences
for the (banking) industry's ability to weather weaker economic
conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came two days after he publicly expressed concern
that the nation's record-breaking economic expansion could be
ended by a resurgence of inflation unless growth slowed to a more

<HEADLINE> Blazers Again Place Brian Grant on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- After playing a pivotal role in
the Portland Trail Blazers' drive to the Western Conference finals
last season, forward Brian Grant is having trouble staying healthy
and was placed on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis.
</P>
<P>
Grant, who missed all of preseason and the first seven games of
the season with a knee injury, was limited to eight ineffective
minutes in Monday's home loss to Toronto due to a strained arch.
He missed the Blazers' matchup with the league-leading Los Angeles
Lakers on February 29 with the same injury.
</P>
<P>
Grant, 27, was averaging 6.7 points, 5.3 rebounds in 49 games,
playing more of a supporting role off the deep Blazers' bench.
Portland (46-13) is second to the first-place Lakers in the
Pacific Division and for the top overall record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Grant averaged 11.5 points and a team-high 9.8 rebounds during
the 1998-99 season, his second with Portland after signing as a
free agent. He also hung tough against Utah Jazz power forward
Karl Malone in the Western Conference semifinals, helping the
Blazers end Utah's run for a third straight NBA Finals appearance.
</P>
<P>
Grant began his career with the Sacramento Kings, who selected
him eighth overall in the 1994 draft.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi had an easy win in
his first match of the month as he defeated Marcos Ondruska in 65
minutes at the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic in Arizona on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world number one dismissed the South African qualifier 6-2,
6-1 in a rematch of the 1993 Scottsdale final in which the
American claimed the first of his three titles here.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who won his sixth career Grand Slam title this year at
the Australian Open, had not played since suffering back spasms
after helping the United States edge Zimbabwe 3-2 in the first
round of the Davis Cup with a pair of singles wins in early
February.
</P>
<P>
"It's always nice to come back," said Agassi who improved his
match record this year to a perfect 10-0.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has been playing the best tennis of his life since the
middle of last year, reaching four successive Grand Slam finals

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Visits Cambodia on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. envoy arrived
here Thursday for one day talk with the Cambodian government about
plans to try former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Ralph Boyce, U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state for East Asia and Pacific, said that his visit aimed at
discussing bilateral relations and some issues of common concern.
He said he did not bring with him any special suggestions on the
trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, according to local newspapers, Ralph Boyce, who came
ahead of the arrival next week of the U.N. top lawyer, would focus
on the issue of U.N. involvement in the trial including
reiterating Washington's position that the United Nations should
be involved in any Cambodian trial and that they should be held to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Boyce would meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen and National
Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh during his one-day
stay.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on how to try Khmer Rouge leaders have been
deadlocked for months on who should control the trial.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Tuesday to send a
top lawyer next week to Phnom Penh in a bid to resolve differences
over a trial and to make a deal on it.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen on Monday accused the United Nations of dragging its
feet on an agreement to send a legal team made at a meeting with
Annan in Bangkok last month.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian government insists on maintaining significant power
over a Phnom Penh-based "international-style" court, including the
sharing of key courtroom posts and the prescreening of
international participants by Hun Sen's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> World-Class Oceanarium to Be Set Up in Manila Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans to
set up a world-class oceanarium in Manila Bay in a bid to help
promote the protection of marine life and boost tourism in the
nation, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said the program will be carried out through the joint
effort of the Agriculture Department, the Science and Technology
Department and the Tourism Department.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara was quoted as saying that
the oceanarium, which is one of the millennium projects of the
Estrada Administration, will highlight the country's rich and
diversified marine life and aquatic resources.
</P>
<P>
A world-class oceanarium will attract foreign and local
tourists and investors, Angara said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, however, the objective is to educate our countrymen,
especially the youth on how to preserve marine life and conserve
corals and all marine resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Manila oceanarium will include a marine museum and
a maritime research laboratory, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from being a huge aquarium, it will also house a
dolphinarium and touch pools so that the visitors can have a
closer interaction with aquatic life, the PNA added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Continues Trade Negotiations With WTO, Other Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is accelerating its
integration into the regional and world economies by continuing
trade negotiations with World Trade Organization and some other
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Committee for International Economic
Cooperation held a meeting here recently, discussing the WTO
negotiations and Vietnam's preparations for adhering to provisions
of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, according to a report of local daily
Vietnam News Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, chaired by the committee's president
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, Vietnam will focus on
policy transparency in talks to be held next June in Geneva on its
bid to join WTO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from the Trade Ministry said that Vietnam
would continue trade negotiations with the United States, Mexico,
Brazil, Columbia, South Africa and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
It said that active preparation was underway for the signing of
trade agreements with South Africa, Senegal and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
These are countries with whom preliminary talks on bilateral
trade pacts were held last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will also negotiate with European Union on increasing
textile and garment quotas.
</P>
<P>
The country will establish inter-governmental committees with
Chile and Peru. The two countries have just signed trade
agreements with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Vietnam has granted the most favorable nation status
to 69 countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's trade has been oriented in recent years towards
markets in Europe, America and the Middle-East, with trading ties
with Russia and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
also being strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Commercial ties with Laos and Cambodia have been expanded while
projects to promote exports to Latin America have been completed,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover of Vietnam's export in 1999 reached 11.5
billion U.S. dollars, the highest export turnover in the history
of the country, while the import turnover of the country was about
11.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Affected by Global Warming: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The temperature of the Kathmandu
Valley is increasing at an alarming rate of 0.12 degree Celsius
per year as global warming continues to show its effects in Nepal,
according to a meteorological analysis.
</P>
<P>
A recent analysis of the temperature data from 1977 to 1996
revealed that by the year 2030, the temperature change over the
country could range from 1.7 to 4.2 degrees Celsius, said Dr.
Adarsa Pokharel, who presented the analysis at an eight-day
international meteorology conference that began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, "the anticipated change in precipitation could be
anything from 36 to 67 percent from the baseline while the peak
discharges in run-off could shift to the month of July instead of
August by 2030," said Dr. Pokharel, director general of the
Department of Hydrology and Meteorology in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis the total carbon dioxide emission is
estimated to increase from 770 to 7,590 giga gram by 2030.
</P>
<P>
Even though the global warming effects have been observed
globally, regional peculiarities have been very conspicuous like
the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers, said Dr. Pokharel, giving
instances of the Rikha Samba and other glaciers in the mid-
Himalayan region, whose width have shrunk substantially over the
past few decades.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pokharel said the Rikha glacier appears to have retreated
to a distance of 100 meters over a period of just 20 years due to
global warming.
</P>
<P>
He said Tsho Rolpa glacier lake, which was a tiny dot during
1950's, had extended to such an extent that the Nepali government
had to take immediate mitigation measures to save the lives of
people in the downstream region from the potential outburst flood.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 meteorological experts from more than 100 countries
are participating in the fifth session of Inter-Governmental Panel
on Climate Change. The conference is to focus mainly on
methodological and technical issues arising from technology
transfer, factories and emission scenarios.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Tighten Rules on Gene Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said that
it will enhance the inspections and regulation of gene therapy
experiments to ensure the therapy's safety and boost public
confidence in the research field.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National
Institute of Health (NIH) said Tuesday that gene-therapy
researchers will be required to submit more detailed information
about their experiments to regulators, and detail the steps they
take in the experiment process.
</P>
<P>
The monitors are responsible for making sure that patients'
rights are being protected and the trial is running in accordance
with an agreed-upon plan.
</P>
<P>
Because of a recent medical incident, the FDA said it needs to
take more active approach and not simply review the plans after a
problem comes to light.
</P>
<P>
Last September, an Arizona patient, Jesse Gelsinger, 18, died
in a gene therapy experiment at University of Pennsylvania. The
teenager became the first patient whose death is considered
directly linked to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
The death of Jesse Gelsinger brought about fierce controversy
on the safety of gene therapy, and prompted a wide-ranging review
of the science and regulation behind more than 350 experiments
conducted to date in the United States.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the experiment process at the University, the
FDA ordered a halt in the eight gene therapy trials there.
</P>
<P>
The FDA also acknowledged that its monitoring of some
experiments had been "less than adequate".
</P>
<P>
The NIH will hold quarterly forums on gene therapy, and the
first such session will take place this week during a meeting of
the Recombination DNA Advisory Committee, a special NIH panel
involved in overseeing gene therapy.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Labor Compensation Talks Fail to Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The negotiators failed
Wednesday after two-day talks here to reach a final agreement on
the allocation of the fund Germany compensated for victims of Nazi
slave labor during the Second World War and more talks are needed,
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat announced.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-day talks, Eizenstat told a press
conference at the State Department that the talks will be resumed
on March 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
"It's a devilishly difficult and complex process where the
interests involved are very intense," Eizenstat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The talks, convened at the State Department, were chaired by
Deputy Treasury Secretary Eizenstat and chief German negotiator
Otto Lambsdorff.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German
industry, told reporters outside the U.S. State Department
building that the tough obstacle for the talks is the insurance
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are in really tough negotiations. We are very close, that's
obvious, but there is still one link missing and that's the
insurance issue," Gibowski said.
</P>
<P>
About 1.24 million slaves, mainly Jews, and forced laborers,
mainly from eastern and central Europe, will be the beneficiaries
from the German compensation.
</P>
<P>
The difference now among the negotiators was whether the German
fund should cover any of the insurance claims and the exact
proportion of the fund that should go to about one million former
forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the insurance issue is resolved, it's difficult to see
how we can move forward with the remaining initiative," Eizenstat
added.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat told reporters he believes that all the insurance
claims would be covered outside the 10 billion marks (about 5.21
billion U.S. dollars) pledged by Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, Lambsdorff, speaking to reporters after the talks,
said, "the outset that (insurance) claims would be fully included
in the 10 billion marks (ditto)."
</P>
<P>
The issue will be a focal point in Berlin when the negotiators
meet.
</P>
<P>
The German government and industry agreed to pay 10 billion
marks at the end of last year to compensate the slaves and forced
laborers taken by the Nazis during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Israel,
along with the German and U.S. representatives, have been involved
in the negotiation process.

"Tibet is far from perfect, with a high level of poverty, but
progress is being made."
</P>
<P>
A major factor is the poor education system, but it is obvious
that steps are being taken to improve education facilities
throughout the areas of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"If you visit Tibet determined to ignore progress, to seek out
problems and look at everything with preconceived negative ideas,
I am sure that you could succeed in producing a bad report."
People with such an attitude visiting the United States or
Australia could also come up with a negative report if they worked
at it.

He recalled that during his first visit to Potala, Norbulinka,
Jpkhang, Tashilhunpo, Paklhor Choide, Drepeng and Ganden
monasteries, the number of monks seen at each place varied
considerably from 50 or 60 at Ganden to just a handful.

<P>
This time I saw more monks in the Potala Palace alone than in
all of the other temples in 1992. And as well, as mentioned above,
the Potala was full of tourists and there were queues for every
ladder or stairs going from one site to another.
</P>
<P>
Everywhere on the streets, people were walking with prayer
wheels and prostrating themselves in prayer. Most of the people
wore Tibetan dress which is the "clear evidence" that Tibetan
people have freedom of choice in clothing.

Nehl said the claims that Tibetans were forced to limit the
number of children they have as nonsense, saying that many Tibetan

In 1993, the then National Party Leader, Tim Fisher, (later
deputy prime minister of Australia) who resigned last year due to

he stated that Tibet had made great progress in its economic and
social life. It was true, but this attracted criticism at that

On June 7 1999, Nugent told the Parliament, "When I was in
Tibet one did not see the open oppression that you hear all the
stories about. You did not see the large numbers of military that
you hear a lot of stories about. Nonetheless, I have to say also
that, clearly, when people spoke to you, they spoke with a degree
of caution and reserve," Nehl quoted Nugent as saying.

On the history of Tibet, he said that outside China there are
widespread misconceptions and ignorance about the history of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that "China troops invaded and occupied Tibet" in
1950 and that was the start of Sino-Tibet relations. In fact, most
historians agree that Tibet has been a part of, or a dependency of,
China for most of the time since the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the revolution of 1911, Tibet declared autonomy,
as did the other provinces of China. For nearly the next 40 years,
the then central government was preoccupied with a civil war and
war with Japan. In 1950 Tibet was 'reunified' with the lowland
areas of China. As a historical fact, this involved the presence
of and action by the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Equally, it should not be forgotten that in 1904 a British
expeditionary force from India, led by Colonel Younghusband,
invaded Tibet. Strong resistance at Gyantse delayed them, but the
British finally entered Lhasa. It is interesting that the peace
treaty was signed in Beijing, not Lhasa.

The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader but obviously,
also a political figure with his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Under Chinese suzerainty, the rule of the Lama
hierarchy was one of feudal servitude, similar to the various
dynastic empires of China itself. Effectively, it was a theocratic
dictatorship by the privileged few and the bulk of the population
experienced similar serfdom to that of the Middle Ages in Europe
with virtually no possibility of social and economic development.

He was fortunate to have become involved with Professor
Creswell Eastman, of Westmead Hospital in Sydney, in the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Church Denies Intention to Topple Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Catholic Church has
claimed that it is not out to destabilize the Estrada
administration, the nation's leading newspaper Manila Bulletin
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This statement was issued Wednesday by the Catholic Bishops'
Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) after President Joseph
Estrada lamented that Church leaders are only good at finding
fault with his administration.
</P>
<P>
"The CBCP is not part of any design to topple the government.
It is not our business," said Hernando Coronel, spokesman of the
CBCP.
</P>
<P>
However, Coronel said, it is part of the CBCP's prophetic duty
to point out the immoral ills, especially the corruption in
government.
</P>
<P>
"That's what we are doing and this is part of our prophetic
function," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CBCP, an influential religious body in the nation, had
earlier pledged to be in "critical solidarity" with the government,
and not to act as an "adversary" in spiritual, social, political,
and cultural issues confronting Filipinos. Since then, the bishops
have actively presented the cry of the people to the government.
</P>
<P>
Recently they appealed President Estrada to eradicate
corruption within the government in order to solve the old
recurring problem of poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin has openly criticized the
government in lacking direction.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, however, has advised church leaders to leave political
issues to the government and instead concentrate on helping the
government's family planning program.
</P>
<P>
He said the church has neglected its role in teaching "
responsible parenthood" to the Catholic flock, who compose 80
percent of the country's 75 million population.

<HEADLINE> 11 Dolphins Washed Ashore in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Eleven dolphins, seven of them dead,
were washed ashore early Thursday morning in Lingayan Gulf in the
northern Philippines, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The local village official Ricardo Mejia was quoted as saying
that this was the third time in three years that dolphins were
washed ashore near Dagupan, Pangasinan province in western Luzon.
</P>
<P>
Mejia called on officials of the Bureau of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources to come to his village and treat the four
dolphins which are still alive but appeared to be now weakening.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven dead dolphins, one was a baby dolphin. The adult
dolphins had wounds in their bodies probably due to gunshot, Mejia
said.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that these dolphins may have been shot in mid sea by
crewmen of passing ocean-going vessels in target practice.
</P>
<P>
Westly Rosario, officer-in-charge of the National Integrated
Fisheries Research and Development Center said the four dolphins
still alive will be towed by boats to mid sea after treatment.
</P>
<P>
He surmised that the dolphins came nearer to Dagupan where
there is more fertile food for them, citing the fact that
milkfishes grow bigger and fatter there than in other areas of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Disputed Bosnian Town Declared Neutral Multi-Ethnic District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's disputed town of Brcko was
formally declared a neutral multi-ethnic district on Wednesday in
a bid to promote confidence, understanding and cooperation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, to be run jointly by Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs,
will heed the laws governing Bosnia as a whole but be independent
of both the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic that
make up Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern Bosnian town, the only territorial link
between the western and eastern halves of the Serb Republic, was
hotly contested during Bosnia's 1991-1995 civil war. Its fate had
remained unresolved until an international tribunal made the
decision last March.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived
Wednesday for a two-day visit to Bosnia, attended the ceremony to
inaugurate the neutral district.
</P>
<P>
"Today's event clearly shows the direction this country is
headed: It is away from division and towards more joint action,
away from bitterness and towards cooperation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were also other Western and Bosnian
officials, who held out hope that Brcko would become a model to
help boost cooperation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"That model is a multi-ethnic state of equal people. We cannot
change the past but we can make our future better," said Alija
Izetbegovic, current chairman of the three-member collegiate
Bosnian presidency.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Rodman Waived by Mavericks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman was waived today,
ending his publicity -- driven stint with the Dallas Mavericks --
and perhaps his star-crossed NBA career.
</P>
<P>
The flaky forward with the ever-changing hair colors, multiple
tattoos and body piercing was sent packing after only 12 games and
a handful of tirades.
</P>
<P>
The last one was directed at pending Mavericks owner Mark Cuban,
who was the only one willing to take a chance on Rodman and his
bizarre behavior. While admitting to signing Rodman as a way to
generate increased attendance and interest in the Mavericks, Cuban
also allowed Rodman to lease his guest house and relaxed team
rules for the seven-time rebounding champion.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Rodman was ungrateful. After Tuesday's loss in
Seattle, Rodman blasted Cuban's hands-on management style.
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't need to be hanging around the players like he's a
coach or something," Rodman told the Dallas Morning News. "That's
like Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and it's dumb. That's why
the Cowboys went down. He needs to be the owner, step back and put
people in who can get this team in right direction."
</P>
<P>
It was hard to tell what direction Rodman was headed. His brief
stay with the Mavericks included six technical fouls, a pair of
ejection, a one-game league suspension, $13,000 in fines and only
three wins. He maintained a running feud with the NBA's hierarchy,
criticizing referees and challenging Commissioner David Stern to a
fight.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 38, averaged 14.3 rebounds for the Mavericks. But the
five-time NBA champion often seemed disinterested and provided no
veteran leadership for a young team trying to make the playoffs
for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Upon Rodman's arrival, the Mavs had won seven of eight games to
improve their record to 20-27. They are 4-9 since, including a
current five-game losing streak, and coach and general manager Don
Nelson decided on a new direction.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed getting to know Dennis as a person and enjoyed
coaching him," Nelson said in a statement. "He was brought here to
help us make a playoff run, which obviously hasn't happened.
Therefore, it is in the best interest of the organization to play
our young players throughout the remainder of the season."
</P>
<P>
It marked the second time in as many years Rodman was signed by
a team in midseason, only to be waived several weeks later. Last
year, he was signed by the Los Angeles Lakers, who waived him
after just 23 games.
</P>
<P>
Always a free-spirited, high-maintenance player, Rodman may
find his basketball career to be over. He has worked in movies and
wrestling but faces a series of lawsuits brought on by his often
boorish behavior in public.
</P>
<P>
Since leaving the Lakers, Rodman was arrested in an incident
involving his former wife, Carmen Electra. He also has been
arrested for public intoxication.
</P>
<P>
A native of Dallas, the Mavericks were Rodman's fifth team. He
won a record seven straight rebounding titles from 1992-1998 with
Detroit, San Antonrio and Chicago. He was a member of NBA
championship teams in Detroit in 1989 and 1990 and in Chicago from
1996-1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Rodman has called greater attention to himself with
his antics on and off the court. Last season, he was waived by the
Lakers following repeated team violations, including lateness to
practice and a four-gam leave of absence during the season.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-1996 season, Rodman was suspended six games by
the NBA for head-butting referee Ted Bernhardt. In January 1997,
he was suspended 11 games by the league for kicking a cameraman in
the groin. During the 1997 NBA Finals, he made obscene and
insensitive comments regarding Mormons as the Bulls battled the
Utah Jazz.

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Students Launch High-tech Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Liu Qingfeng, a doctoral candidate
at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC),
registered his own high-tech enterprise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Liu's company, Xunfei Information Technology Co. Ltd., mainly
develops computer software, and so far has produced a series of
software that enables computers to speak standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
This helped Liu expand his company's capital to 60 million yuan
(about 7.2 million U.S. dollars) after only several months of
operation.
</P>
<P>
"I'll make my company a 'Bell Laboratories' in China," said the
ambitious Liu. "I'm a professional developer of technologies, and
I'm also the manager of an enterprise. We can bring together a
group of outstanding talent to do our best and realize our dream."
</P>
<P>
For these encouraging achievements, Liu's company has won
support from the local government and funds from several large
companies. Anhui Province and the provincial capital of Hefei,
where USTC is located, listed Liu's company as a key high-tech
firm and has provided it with preferential support.
</P>
<P>
The company also received funding from the national innovation
fund for medium-sized and small high-tech enterprises in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Along with Liu Qingfeng, many other Chinese university students
have established their own firms.
</P>
<P>
Several students from Qinghua (Tsinghua) University are
developing a new device projecting high-resolution images onto
large television screen, which is said to be less expansive and
have the potential of replacing current large-screen television.
These students have founded their own firm and got capital
investment from a big marketing enterprise in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, many outstanding Chinese college
students went abroad and took their ideas with them. Others tried
to sell their research findings to domestic manufacturers, but
quite often they failed to realize the deals and turn their ideas
into reality.
</P>
<P>
This also applies to many Chinese research institutes.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the State Council in April last year
issued regulations on promoting the transformation of research
achievements into productivity.
</P>
<P>
These regulations also encourage research institutes and
universities to start their high-tech enterprises, and challenge
individuals to register their own firms. (more

HAIKOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 260 women entrepreneurs
from around the world yesterday called for joint efforts to
improve women's social position worldwide at an international
forum in this capital of southernmost China's island province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yanqiu, president of the Hainan Women Entrepreneurs
Association, told the forum that discrimination against women is
still an international problem. She said even in the ten countries
that claim to have the highest employment rate for women, female
employees occupy less than half of the total jobs.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Third World countries pointed out that
women are the ones who suffer most from war and a deteriorating
environment, and they face problems ranging from poor education
and housing to insufficient food for themselves.
</P>
<P>
They called on the world community to attach more importance to
the accord on improving the position of women by the year 2000,
which was passed at the Third World Women's Conference in Nairobi
in 1985.

<P>
Wang Dazhong, president of Qinghua, said that "to turn Qinghua
into one of the world's best universities, it is necessary to

</P>
<P>
The Tsinghua Tongfang Co. set up by the university has made a
name brand computer in China, generating sales in the hundreds of
millions of yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Following the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China
also agreed to provide loans of 500 million yuan (about 60 million
U.S. dollars) to People's University over five years, and several
other banks including the Bank of Communications also signed
agreements with several renowned Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that Chinese research institutes and
universities have abundant talent and fine research facilities,
which enables them to develop a large market if they choose to
directly engage in research-achievement-to-productivity projects.

<HEADLINE> Knowledge, Not Beauty, Important for Beijing Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Reading and learning seem to be
more important than makeup and housework for the women of Beijing,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Meilande Consulting, showed that jobs
demanding more education, such as doctor, accountant and college
teacher, top the list of work that Beijing women find attractive.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, jobs such as modeling which rely on beauty are not
so popular among those women surveyed.
</P>
<P>
"Reading and learning have come to be important ways for women
to improve their status," said Ge Chenhong, a sociologist at
People's University.
</P>
<P>
Women now account for 46 percent of Beijing's civil servants
and 53 percent of the city's technicians, while in 1949, when the
People's Republic of China was founded, as many as 90 percent of
the Chinese women were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, of the 28,000 employees in
Beijing's overseas-funded firms, half are women now.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 60 percent of the Beijing's women who were
laid-off from state enterprises found new jobs after completing a
variety of training courses.

Even at Gangbala mountain pass, 5,000 meters above sea level,
there were tourists from many different countries with a constant
flow of traffic. Seven years ago, He was the only foreigner going
through the pass and there was not even any other vehicle on the
road.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, driving from Lhasa to Xigaze, Nehl did not see any
other motor vehicles apart from a convoy of army trucks. But in
1999, he saw an endless flow of vehicles, including big buses,
commercial trucks and four wheel drive vehicles that are now
common on Tibetan country roads.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic development of Tibet has been supported by
the whole of China. The Chinese central government has not
collected any taxation from Tibet in recent years, and has, in
fact, allocated 3 billion Yuan (US$ 361 million) to Tibet every
year in the form of fiscal subsidies and investment projects.
Other provinces and municipalities have helped Tibet set up 62
projects with a total investment of 4 billion Yuan (US$ 482
million).
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the rest of China is helping develop the
Tibetan economy to the same level as other inland areas.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Today's China Daily carried an
article of comments by Garry Nehl, deputy speaker of the
Australian House of Representatives, about his visits to Tibet in
1992 and 1999 during an interview with the China Association for
International Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Following are excepts of his comments:
</P>
<P>
Tibet has had "remarkable progress" everywhere he went compared
with 1992. "The changes have been so significant that some places
were almost unrecognizable," he said. "Commercial activities have
increased considerably in every town I visited and it was obvious
that facilities in the towns had improved remarkably compared with
seven years ago."
</P>
<P>
The Gonggar Airport is much more modern in 1999 than it was in
1992. During the drive to Xigaze, he saw a very large
hydroelectric power station under construction, which, when
complete, will provide electricity for villages and farms in
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
In some areas still without electricity, the infrastructure
cables were already in place. However, in 1992, he saw no outlying
farms with electricity and even in Xigaze, there were power breaks
for several hours and hot water was not available in the hotel.
But this was not the case in his visit last September.
</P>
<P>
Also, large numbers of people are working on the shores of Lake
Yamzhog digging trenches for laying optical fiber cable to extend
modern communications technology to remote areas of Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator said that
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), the country's legislature, will draft and revise a series
of laws this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, NPC Standing Committee chairman, announced a
legislation package in his report on the work of the NPC Standing
Committee delivered here today at the ongoing 3rd Session of the
Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee will draft laws on anti-monopoly, anti-
dumping, supervision, social security, proprietorship, and state
assets, Li said, adding that legislation will be speeded up on
science and technology, and laws concerning banking services and
international trade will be enacted or amended.
</P>
<P>
Those to be amended include laws on trade marks, patents,
regional autonomy and marriage.
</P>
<P>
"We should further link legislative work to major state

we will do further studies on, and amend, the Corporate Law to
meet the needs of state enterprise reform and development," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment to Law on Regional Autonomy aims to
promote economic and social development, strengthen national unity,

<HEADLINE> China to Enact Law on Law-making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A draft legislation law, or a law
on law-making, has been submitted today to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
When enacted, the law is expected to standardize law-making in
China.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, director of the Legislative Affairs Commission under
the NPC Standing Committee, made explanations to NPC deputies on
the draft law.
</P>
<P>
In spite of progresses China has made in establishing a
legislative system, numerous problems exist such as contradictions
between different laws and regulations, and irresponsible law-
making out of considerations for local interests, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
"These problems not only undermine the integrity and dignity of
laws and regulations enacted but also give rise to disputes in law
enforcement," Gu said, adding that a law on law-making is of great
significance to improving China's socialist legal system and
promoting the rule of law in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The legislation law is expected to provide basic principles in
law-making, detailed stipulations on the limits of authority of
laws and regulations, the process of legislation and applicable
rules.
</P>
<P>
The draft law further defines the exclusive law-making right of
the NPC and its Standing Committee in ten areas, including the
basic political system of the state, economic system of the state,
civil and criminal laws, punishments such as deprivation of
citizens' political rights and restriction of personal freedom,
and systems relating to litigation and arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to authorize
the State Council with the right to enact laws and regulations,
but its scope of legislation will gradually be narrowed along with
the formation of a fairly well-functioning legal system in the
nation, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
The new law defines law-making procedures and advocates
democratic law-making. It also contains articles concerning the
formulation of administrative regulations, and regulations made by
local governments and law-making bodies.
</P>
<P>
To solve conflicts and confusion arising from conflicting laws
and regulations, the law also establishes special procedures for
examining laws and regulations to be drafted, and the NPC
Standing Committee is authorized to repeal any regulations that
contradict the Constitution and related laws.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee had reviewed and examined the draft
legislation law for a second time prior to today's submission to
the session of the nation's legislature for deliberation.

<TEXT>
<P>
The draft legislation law has been submitted to the current
session for deliberation and, when it is passed, it will play an
important role in standardization of legislation work, Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the NPC's supervision work, Li Peng said that in the past
year, the NPC Standing Committee placed its supervisory function
on an important position. It has thus made supervision more
effective. The Standing Committee has arranged the drafting and
examination of three stipulations and decisions on supervision
work, and conducted four law-enacting checks. All the work has
been basically completed.
</P>
<P>
In selecting the law-enacting examination programs, the
Standing Committee focused its attention on the central tasks of
the state and the issues of great concern to the people. It
examined successively the implementation of the Law on Air
Pollution Control, Forest Law, Product Quality Law and Compulsory
Education Law.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the outstanding problems that should be resolved
at present, the NPC Standing Committee listened to and examined
the State Council's report on basic living guarantees for laid-off
workers of the state-owned enterprises, on increasing farmers'
income and easing their burden, on construction of public security
contingents and on management of cultural market.
</P>
<P>
News media did the coverage of deliberation sessions to combine
the NPC's supervisory rule with media's supervision so that the
people's supervision over the work of the NPC Standing Committee
and other state organs is facilitated.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the NPC Standing Committee formulated decisions on
beefing up its supervision over examining the budget of the
central government and over economic work. Moreover, it also
examined the legal documents on supervision over trial and
procuratorating procedures, thus creating conditions and obtaining
experience for formulating comprehensive law supervision.
</P>
<P>
This year, NPC Standing Committee will make a breakthrough in
coping with knotty problems in legislation, improving the quality
of the work of legislation and go on increasing supervisory work
in accordance with the central tasks for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Down to Lowest in Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Shaken by the sudden twist of
events at the local stock market, the Philippine peso crashed
Wednesday through the 41-peso level against the U.S. dollar,
plunging to a five-month low of 41.15 pesos at one point, Business
World said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic
currencies exchange showed that the peso averaged 41.042 against
the dollar, down 11.9 cents from 40.923 average the previous day,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The peso initially opened weak due to market anxiety," a
trader from a local bank said. The peso hit 41.15, its lowest for
the day, within a few minutes after it opened at 41.12 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Later, it recovered to reach an intraday high of 40.975 pesos,
and eventually close at 40.985 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Market anxiety was caused by the mass resignation on Tuesday of
the entire Compliance and Surveillance Group of the Philippine
Stock Exchange (PSE) group that investigated the alleged price
manipulation in BW Resources Corp., which prompted Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay to order the
suspension of stock market trading for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
News of the trading suspension caused banks to buy dollars to
service the needs of offshore clients pulling out investments in
the stock market, currency traders said.
</P>
<P>
Although an order issued Wednesday morning by other
commissioners of the SEC allowed the exchange to open for business,
traders said the negative impact "has already set in" despite the
opening.
</P>
<P>
A trader from a local bank said the market is now on a "wait-
and-see" attitude on what will happen at the local bourse.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Declares Forest Fires National  Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government declared
forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands a national disaster
and warned errant logging and plantation firms they could lose
their licenses.
</P>
<P>
"The president asked us to summon the companies. We will take
punitive action against them, revoking their licenses if necessary,
if there is enough evidence," State Minister of Environment Sonny
Keraf was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the fires raging in a number of forests in the two
islands have reached the emergency level. The government would
provide state funds to put out the fires and rehabilitate the
areas affected.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the government would cooperate with
Malaysia and Singapore in dousing the flames, but had not yet
considered foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Forestry Ministry Suripto said in
Pekanbaru, capital of Riau province, that Malaysia and Singapore
had complained about the smog that had reappeared in the oil-rich
province over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The Riau administration has started distributing masks to
residents to protect them from the smog arising from the fires.
</P>
<P>
Deputy head of the Environmental Management Agency in charge of
controlling environmental damage Aca Sugandhi said at least 515
hot spots had been detected across Riau's regencies of Kampar and
Benegkalis over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Visibility was estimated at around 500 meters, while the
pollution index was reportedly at the hazardous level of 313. A
normal level is below 50.
</P>
<P>
"The level of ash particles in the smog has exceed the safe
limit and has caused respiratory problems, but the density of the
haze has not disrupted air transportation there," Aca was quoted
by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan are causing fears of a
repeat of the 1997 disaster when neighboring Singapore and parts
of Malaysia were engulfed in thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 fires, the most widespread ever, destroyed about 5
million hectares of forest in the country with an economic loss of
about 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil received 69 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign investments during the period of 1990-1998,
the Economic and Social Development National Bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The national bank, the main Brazilian official bank, said that
the figure increased the Brazilian share in the world's total
investments from 0.54 percent in 1990 to 4.46 percent in 1998, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was the second largest investment destination among
developing nations after China which received 247 billion dollars
of direct foreign investment in the same nine years, it said.
</P>
<P>
The rising foreign investment in Brazil from 1.2 billion
dollars in 1992 to 30 billion dollars in 1999 played an important
role in helping finance the South American country's current
accounts deficit, and reducing its dependence on short term
capitals.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increase to the economic stability,
free trade, the strengthening of the Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) and the intensification of the privatization program.
</P>
<P>
It also said that 13 percent of foreign money was invested in
the industrial sector last year and 85 percent in services.

<HEADLINE> More Care for Siberian Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 9 (Xinhua) --We will give more care to our
remaining 12 Siberian tigers and prevent anything from happening
to them, said Li Yunshan, head of the Shenyang Siberian Tiger Park
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Two Siberian tigers there, Duoduo and Meimei, developed
diarrhea and vomiting on February 10 after eating rotten meat, and
soon after, Duoduo died.
</P>
<P>
Meimei, having gone through the darkest days of her life, is
now lying outside her lair, enjoying the sunshine. She now eats
five kilos of beef a day, and howls at the visitors when she is
good mood, showing her vitality.
</P>
<P>
"How wonderful it would have been if Duoduo were still alive,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
"We are sorry to hear the news, and Duoduo's keeper even cried.
We treat them with great care and love, as if they were our
children, " said the director of the Harbin Siberian Tiger Park.
</P>
<P>
Keepers say Siberian tigers often save food they are given for
later meals, and they sometimes eat rotten meat. Also, the two who
fell ill were old and vulnerable to disease, said Qiu Yingjie,
head of the Liaoning Provincial Wildlife Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Tiger Park will be more careful in the choice of
food for their tigers and watch them closely to detect problems as
soon as possible. They will also invite an experienced keeper from
the breeding center in Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Duoduo and Meimei came to Shenyang at the end of 1998 with
eight other tigers from the Harbin Siberian Tiger Park in the
nearby province of Heilongjiang, and two keepers accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of all, the two, both in their twenties, old
age for Siberian tigers, gave birth to three tiger cubs after they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Siberian Tiger Park with 70 Siberian tigers now, is
the largest such in the world.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are among the top-ten most endangered species
in the world, with only around 300 remaining in the wild.

<HEADLINE> China to Green Its West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The new government-initiated
strategy of prioritizing China's vast west for economic
development not only gives local people new hopes of early
modernization but also promises to improve the natural environment
there.
</P>
<P>
Protecting and improving ecological environment consitututes an
important part of the ambitious strategy which aims to turn
China's west not only into a modern, prosperous region but also a
land of greenness where humans and nature co-exist harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for more than one half of the total area of China,
the west is known for its backward economy and vulnerable
ecological environment, which makes it natural for people to
associate the west with the barren Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
To implement the developing-the-west strategy, according to
Wang Xianjin, a member of the Environment and Resources Protection
Committee of the National People's Congress, China plans to build
more than 200 nature reserves on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the
mountainous southwest China to improve the ecological environment
there and protect the habitats of endangered species such as the
Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, and spotted deer.
</P>
<P>
These reserves, whose construction is expected to take five
years to complete, will bring the total number of nature reserves
in the country's west to about 1,000. By then, the combined area
of nature reserves in the west will account for about 8.5 percent
of the total, close to the national average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the next ten years, the State Forestry
Administration plans to invest 100 billion yuan in an
afforestation project along the upper reaches of the Yangtze and
the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also drafting their own plans to
reconvert cropfield into forest and grass land, according to NPC
deputies from Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, about four times as large as France in land area,
plans to plant trees on 200,000 ha of cropfield and double the
local oasis area to about 140,000 ha in the coming three years.
Shaanxi province is to inject 20 billion yuan in restoring local
ecological balance in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to benefiting local people, environment experts
hold restoration of the ecological environment in the west, home
to the headstream of a good many long rivers, is conducive to
maintaining an ecological balance for the whole country.

CARACAS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan Air Force (VAF) has
ordered 12 modern primary training planes from Italy and will
receive two of them by the end of this month, official reports
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
VAF General Commander, Division General Arturo Garcia, was
quoted as saying that the 12 AS-270 planes with state-of-the-art
technology will substitute for the "Mentor C-34" aircraft that
have been in service for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The training planes are expected to arrive in pairs every two
months.
</P>
<P>
The old Mentor C-34 aircraft that are still good will be either

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela authorized a meeting on
its land for peace negotiators between the Colombian government
and one of the rebel forces, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the ministry said that the government approved
the meeting, to be attended in a few days by Rebel force commander
Raul Reyes, one of the seven members of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) directorate and Colombian Commissioner
for Peace Victor G. Ricardo, following consultations with the
Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
The venue and exact time of the gathering have been kept in the
dark out of security reasons.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the authorization was made under a plan
promoted by President Hugo Chavez in support of the peace process
in Colombia, which has been plagued by decade-long internal wars.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela lent its territory last year in more than five
occasions for meetings between the Colombian guerrilla National
Liberation Army (ELN) delegates, the commissioner for peace in
Colombia, and representatives of several government sectors.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Costa Rica to Resume Talks on Navigation Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Costa
Rica and Nicaragua agreed Wednesday in Washington to resume talks
on the navigation rights in the San Juan River, after the
Organization of American States (OAS) rejected to arbitrate their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Nicaragua, all the OAS members rejected the
mediation request made by Costa Rica and called on the two nations
resuming their dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the United States recommended that OAS general
secretary Cesar Gaviria should act as facilitator for the
resumption of conversations, said Radio Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has the dominion and full imperium over the San Juan
River waters under the "Canas-Jerez Treaty" signed in 1858, and
Costa Ria has the rights of free navigation with commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two countries started 18 months ago
when Managua forbade the circulation of Costa Rican armed guards
in the border river waters.

HEFEI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 100 million yuan (
about 12 million U.S. dollars) to develop a cultural street for
tourists in Xixian County, a historic town in east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
The county, known as Huizhou for much of its history, is
appealing to visitors as it was the cradle of famous scholars and
is located at the foot of picturesque Yellow Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Investors plan to build a 310-meter-long and 51.8-meter-wide
street with ten memorial archways in traditional style, and
artificial hills and pavilions.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be made by the county and the Jiangong

HARBIN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Suifenhe, Dongning and Huichun,
three highway border ports in northeast China's Heilongjiang and
Jilin provinces neighboring Russia, have extended their daily
hours of operation from eight to twelve hours.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between China and Russia, the ports
began extending their hours on March 1 to meet the demands of the
booming border trade.
</P>
<P>
As trade channels linking China and Russia, these ports have
been very busy during the first two months of the year, handling
59.9, 67.8, and 68 percent more passengers, cargo, and vehicles
than during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts say the trade along this border is expected to
continue growing now that the ports have extended their hours.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Province Helps Needy Out Of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province plans to
help 500,000 local people escape poverty by the end of this year,
according to a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
The province had 3.15 million needy people in 1994, said the
official, and after years of poverty-relief effort, the province
had reduced this number to 700,000 by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of Anhui's poor live in the Dabie mountainous
areas, where conditions are harsh and infrastructure backward.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last year, more than 100 million yuan has been
invested in an aid-the-poor program in the thirteen poor
mountainous counties across the province.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has invested nearly 100 million
yuan to develop agricultural technology projects in six poverty-
stricken counties. With the help of these projects, thousands of
farmers there have rid themselves of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Bayern Munich Defeats Real Madrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Lothar Matthaeus celebrated his
farewell game from Bayern Munich with a 4-1 victory over Real
Madrid on Wednesday that sent last season's losing finalist into
quarterfinals of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Mehmet Scholl and Brazilian striker Giovane Elber
scored in the first half-time and substitute Alexander Zickler
added two more in the second. Ivan Helguera notched Real's goal in
the 69th.
</P>
<P>
With 10 points from four matches, Bayern is now assured of
finishing as one of the top two teams in Group C. Real, a record
seven-time champion in Europe's most prestigious club competition,
has six points.
</P>
<P>
Just four minutes into action, Scholl, deep in offside, picked
up a ball that had been challenged by both Elber and Real captain
Fernando Ruiz Hierro. While the linesman lifted his flag to
indicate an offside, Scholl chipped the ball past Real's 18-year-
old goalkeeper Iker Casillas.
</P>
<P>
Dutch referee Dick Jol overruled his linesman and allowed the
goal to stand despite Real protests. Television replays showed
that Hierro may have been the last to touch the ball, which would
make the goal legal, but the replays were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, which won 4-2 in Madrid one week ago, put the Spanish
defense under a lot of pressure early in the game and went up 2-0
at the half-hour.
</P>
<P>
Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn intercepted a Spanish cross and
then launched a long kick-in into the Real half. Hierro misjudged
the ball and it bounced over the Spanish defender. Elber charged
through and bounced the ball twice on his knee before lifting it
over Casillas.
</P>
<P>
Real's best chance came in the 40th, when Fernando Redondo put
Roberto Carlos through on the left. The Brazilian wingback raced
into the Bayern area and unleashed a blistering shot that shook
Kahn's crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Bayern shifted down a gear after the interval and was punished
in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
Helguera, unable to find an open man, decided to take a shot
from some 20 meters. Matthaeus was late in challenging and
Helguera's tremendous right-foot drive drilled into the roof of
Kahn's net.
</P>
<P>
And just as Real threatened to equalize, Matthaeus began the
move the led to Bayern's third goal. He carried the ball in a long
run into the Real half, fed Stefan Effenberg, who found Zickler at
the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Zickler blasted a shot into the upper left corner of Casillas'
net in the 79th and wrapped up the tally in the injury time.

<P>
BERLIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer legend Diego
Maradona has received the invitation to take part in the Matthaeus
's farewell match on May 26 in Munich as a guest of honor, said
Matthaeus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Because Maradona is undergoing rehabilitation in Cuba for
cocaine addiction, he only can attend as a honor guest and not as
a player in the match.
</P>
<P>
Maradona and Matthaeus had each taken part in three World Cups.
In 1986 and 1990 they met twice in the final. In 1986, Argentina
with Maradona as captain defeated Germany 3-2 and got the Cup for
the second time, and four years later, Germany with Matthaeus as
captain took a revenge with 1-0 and won the Cup for the third time.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus has won 144 national caps and taken part in European
Champions League for over 100 times.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus said that soccer stars, including the World
Footballer of the Year 1999 Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Roberto Baggio and
Davis Beckham, will show up in his farewell game.

GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice President of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) Kevan Gosper has decided to resign from
the IOC Ethics Commission, said the IOC today in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Commission said that it had "regretfully" taken
formal note of the decision by Gosper to resign from the

</P>
<P>
De Cuellar, also a member of the Ethics Commission, has
accepted this mission.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Rolls, Agassi Sits at Franklin Templeton Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The second-seeded Peter Sampras
cruised past Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-3, 6-4 Tuesday at the $375,
000 Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic, which was hampered by
inclement weather for the second straight day in Arizona, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Due to scheduling conflicts caused by Monday's rainout of first-
round action, top-seeded Andre Agassi had to wait another day to
play his first match of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Americans Agassi and Sampras, the current and former long-time
world No.1s, are done nursing injuries and seeded 1-2 at this
hardcourt event.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had not played since suffering a hip flexor in his
thrilling five-set loss to Agassi in the semifinals in Melbourne
in January. He was to have played with Agassi in the Davis Cup but
needed time to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
Although he received a wild card entry, the 28-year-old was
given no favors with his first-round opponent. However, he handled
Rusedski with no problem.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had lost for the first time in seven meetings with the
hard-serving Brit in Paris in 1998, but fought off the adverse
weather conditions in defeating him today.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had played in just one event this season, winning the
Australian Open for his third Grand Slam title in 12 months. He
then traveled to Zimbabwe, where he won two singles matches in the
United States' stirring first-round Davis Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
When the 29-year-old returned to the U.S. to play in the Sybase
Open, he had to withdraw with back spasms. He will play South
African qualifier Marcos Ondruska on Wednesday night as he begins
his quest for a fourth title in Scottsdale. He also won here in
1993, 1994 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Advance in All England Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- World number one Peter Gade
Christensen of Denmark led other seeded shuttlers to advance into
the second round of the All England Badminton Championships which
raised its curtain here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion, seeded first at the tournament, met no
challenge in his first outing, beating Tjitte weistra of the
Netherlands 15-7, 15-2 in just 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Dane was scheduled to meet England's national and U.S. Open
champion Colin Haughton, who was forced to pull out of the
tournament due to knee injury sustained in his Cuban Open final
loss, 15-3, 15-3, to Welshman and Olympic qualifying rival Richard
Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's Ji Xinpeng, joint 5/8 seed at the tournament,
struggled to beat underdog Martin Hagberg of Sweden in three sets
15-8, 6-15, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttler was at an edge to lose the match when he
was left behind at 10-14 in the third set. Only at the crucial
moment, Ji Xinpeng found back his pace and traced the score at 14-
all.
</P>
<P>
Ji asked three points, maintained his attacking speed and took
three points in a row to seal the match and place in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team head coach Li Yongbo was by no means satisfied by
Ji's performance. He told Ji: "you should have sped up early in
the match. If you don't speed up and attack, you will have little
chance in the second round."
</P>
<P>
Ji's victory might put his compatriot world champion Sun Jun in
danger for a place in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun, who did not take part in any competitions this year,
has his place in world rankings dropped from second to the eighth.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Luo Yigang and Chen Hong has already surpassed
Sun in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun has been forced to pull out of the championships due to
nagging injury.
</P>
<P>
If Ji Xinpeng beats another obstacle here, he would overtake
Sun in the world rankings this week.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, who got around the question on whether Sun is at
risk to make Olympic appearance, just said: "I think Sun could
have a chance to recover."
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese player Dong Jiong, who is ranked 26th in the
world, struggled to beat Tomas Johansson of Sweden 15-9, 17-15.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's singles, all seeded players have a bye in
the first round. The only major casualty of the day is Welsh
Kelly Morgan, who had a surprise victory over former world
champion Ye Zhaoying of China at the last world championships in
Copenhagen last May.
</P>
<P>
Morgan lost to Mette Pedersen of Denmark 11-8, 11-4, 11-6.
</P>
<P>
"After I saw the draw, I knew it could be tough for me," said
Morgan. "But now I have to forget it and prepare for the Olympics.
"
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles, world champion and Olympic gold
medalists Ge Fei and Gu Jun of China brushed aside Etty Tantri and
Cynthia Tuwankotta of Indonesia 15-11, 15-5.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government and people
will continue to support the Palestinian people over their
legitimate rights for self determination, Russian ambassador to
Israel said in East Jerusalem Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mihai Bikdanov made the remark in his meeting with Faisal

</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy said that since the Jerusalem issue will be

actions in the city must be stopped and only this can guarantee the
success of the peace talks and ensure the two sides to achieve a
just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to help push the Middle East peace process
forward, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Russian envoy also exchanged views with
Husseini on the Mideast multilateral talks, which held their second

The multilateral talks deal with issues such as water, economic
development, refugees, environment and regional security.

multilateral talks, adding that such talks must be conducted under
the United Nation's resolutions 242 and 194.

Jordan believed the Palestinian issue is core of the Middle East
peace process, and Amman has been persistent in its support for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state on their own soil
with Jerusalem as its capital.

<P>
Barak and Arafat agreed Wednesday at a summit in the West Bank
city of Ramallah to renew their peace talks in Washington after the
Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, which ends on March, to pave
the way for the conclusion of a framework agreement and a final
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders also agreed on a revised
timetable over interim and final issues.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise package, Israel will carry out the 6.1
percent withdrawal from the West Bank within days, the framework
agreement on the final status of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlements will be sealed by May and the
September 13 deadline for a permanent peace deal should be honored.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Arafat, Barak and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak held a three-way summit in Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm el
Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said after the meeting that the prospects of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process were brightening and "the good
relationship between Barak and Arafat is giving great hope for the
resumption of a solution between both sides."
</P>
<P>
He also declared "we have great hopes that the Israel, Syria and
Lebanon tracks will resume soon, which would be the end of the
problem of the region."
</P>
<P>
Talks between Syria and Israel that hit a snag in January only
after two rounds of negotiations since resumed last December remain
frozen while the Lebanon track that derailed in 1996 has yet to
restart.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh met European Union Envoy Miguel Moratinos here this
afternoon over the peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track that has
been frozen since last January.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Moratinos told reporters that he held
intensive talks with Shareh as part of the E.U. efforts to help
resume the Syrian-Israeli peace talks. He also reviewed with Shareh
the E.U. suggestions on the resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We assert in Damascus the need to secure a comprehensive deal
involving Syria, Lebanon and Israel and the priority in this regard
should be given to Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon and the
Syrian Golan Heights through political negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the position of the E.U., " he added.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos also visited Israel, Lebanon and the United States
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-E.U. talks dealt with the bilateral ties and the ways
of developing cooperation in various areas, Shareh told the Arab
Syrian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The third round of the Syrian-Israeli talks, originally slated
for last January 19, has been postponed indefinitely due to
Israel's failure to promise to withdraw fully from the Golan
Heights and return to the June 4, 1967, border lines.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak admitted recently that the
late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had promised to return to
the June 4, 1967 boder lines.

<P>
ALGIERS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In a joint statement issued at the
end of Sudanese President Omar El-Bashir's visit to Algeria,
Khartoum said it backs Algiers' crackdown on militant Islamic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese people and government support Algeria's campaign
against terrorism through the people and the government's concerted
efforts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Bashir hailed the
recent improvement of the ties between the two countries, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian-Sudanese ties have undergone a period of strain
since 1993 when Algiers accused Khartoum of backing Algeria's anti-
government militant Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika and Bashir called for a session by the Algerian-
Sudanese Joint Commission as soon as possible to enhance
cooperation and work out plans in line with the continuous
development of bilateral ties, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Department Buys Back 1 Billion Dollars of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in 70 years,
the U.S. Treasury Department bought back on Thursday 1 billion U.S.
dollars of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
The department, flush with cash from a booming economy, paid 1.
345 billion dollars to repurchase the 1 billion dollars, a tiny
fraction of the 5.7-trillion-dollar national debt. Of that total,
3.6 trillion dollars are held by the public.
</P>
<P>
The last time the U.S. government repurchased debt was during
the Hoover administration in 1930.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department limited its repurchase to 30-year bonds
sold between 1985 and 1990. Another 1 billion dollars in older,
higher-yielding securities are expected to be bought back by the
Treasury later this month.
</P>
<P>
By buying back some of the debt, the government is hoping to
save in financing costs.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers announced in January that
the government hoped to buy back up to 30 billion dollars of the 5.
7-trillion-dollar national debt this year.
</P>
<P>
The administration's budget projected that the entire 3.6
trillion dollars publicly held debt could be wiped out by 2013
under current projections for budget surpluses. The rest of the
national debt is held by the government's large trust funds,
primarily Social Security.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the debt buybacks, the Treasury has already
reduced the debt held by the public by 140 billion dollars over
the past two years just by offering fewer new issues of the
government securities during its quarterly auctions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Pakistan Trip Serves U.S. Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Thursday that he decided to go to Pakistan because it serves
America's interests, not for an endorsement of the military coup
that took place last October.
</P>
<P>
"It is a recognition in my judgment that America's interests
and values will be advanced if we maintain some contact with and
communications with the Pakistani government," Clinton said during
a brief question-and-answer session with reporters on the South
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly not an endorsement of the military coup," and
"it would be a grave mistake" to view his upcoming visit to
Pakistan as an endorsement of a military coup that took place last
October.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf, who ousted Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in the military coup, said Wednesday,
however, that Clinton's trip "vindicates the legitimacy of my
government's stand and gives credence to our aim to put things
right in our country."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to stop in Pakistan after a five-day visit to its
arch-rival, India, later this month. White House officials said
the Pakistan visit will be limited to just a few hours but will
include a meeting with Gen. Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had debated for weeks whether
Clinton should go to Pakistan, and if so what message that would
send.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it would be "a mistake not to go" to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"After all, Pakistan was our ally throughout the Cold War.
Since I've been president, Pakistan on more than one occasion has
helped us to arrest terrorists, often at some risk to the regime,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated his visit to the subcontinent would give the
United States greater influence on the future direction of
Pakistan and on avoiding dangerous conflicts in South Asia by
keeping channels open.

<HEADLINE> Multilateral Lenders Prepared to Support Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The management of four
international financial institutions announced Thursday their plan
to provide a total of 2 billion U.S. dollars in loans to Ecuador
over the next three years to support the government's ambitious
program of economic and structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The four multilateral lenders are the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (
IDB), and the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF).
</P>
<P>
The proposed package comprises a stand-by arrangement of 300
million dollars from the IMF that is expected to be presented to
the IMF's executive board within a month, and that would be
disbursed during the next 12 months. In addition, the proposed
package consists of new loans totaling 425 million dollars from
the World Bank, 620 million dollars from the IDB, and 700 million
dollars from the CAF.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the executive boards of the institutions, 900
million dollars will be available to the South American country in
the next 12 months, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The loans are a combination of balance of payments support and
investment lending with a strong social content. They are intended
to assist the implementation of dollarization, the resolution of
the banking crisis, and to strengthen the public finances,
including Ecuador's social safety net to minimize the impact on
the poor of the nation's difficult economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Disbursements this year are likely to begin within a month, by
which time the Ecuadorian Congress is expected to have approved
complementary measures necessary to implement Ecuador's reform
program.

<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and top seed
Ye Zhaoying of China became the biggest casualty so far at the All
England Badminton Championships when she lost to Mia Audina
Tjiptawan of the Netherlands here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese player, who had won here in the past three
consecutive years, was beaten in straight sets at 9-11 and 9-11.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team head coach Li Yongbo branded Ye's defeat as normal,
but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
At the last world championships in Copenhagen, Ye was ousted by
Kelly Morgan of Wales in the first round.
</P>
<P>
After being left behind in the first set at 0-7, Ye once tried
to gear up to catch up, tracking the score at 5-7 and 9-10 before
losing the set at 11-9.
</P>
<P>
The start of the second set was almost a duplicate of the first
one. Only when Ye was at the score of 1-6, could she pick up her
mind to regain some strength.
</P>
<P>
After leveling the score at 9-all, two positive errors from her
gave the match to the Dutch rival.
</P>
<P>
"I have been trying to be stable, but she had the total control
of the court," said Ye.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, men's top seed and defending champion Peter Gade
Christensen of Denmark advanced into the quater-finals by
defeating Budi Santoso of Indonesia 15-3, 15-9.

HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain recalled its High
Commissioner (ambassador) to Zimbabwe Peter Longworth on Thursday
after Zimbabwean customs officials forcibly opened British
diplomatic shipment, plunging their ties to an all- time low.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister of State for African affairs Peter
Hain described Zimbabwe's action as "a grave breach of the Vienna
Convention" and "not the act of a civilized country" in a
statement released by the British High Commission (embassy) in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Hain said, "Zimbabwe should be in no doubt that this is totally
 unacceptable behaviour. Accordingly, we have decided to recall
our High Commissioner from Harare for consultations."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's customs officials at Harare International Airport
impounded six tons of goods belonging to a British diplomat last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who was on board a British Airways plane, was
prevented from entering the country with the luggage unchecked
after Customs officials told him that the consignment was
unusually large and therefore could not pass under diplomatic
privileges.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's state radio said customs officials had discovered "
sensitive communications gadgets" in the consignment.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy of Portugal, whose country is holding European
Union rotating presidency, said in a statement on Thursday, "The
EU is most seriously concerned at this unprecedented and grave
breach of the Vienna Convention by the Zimbabwean government."
</P>
<P>
"The EU demands the immediate release of the bags in question
and demands an assurance from the Zimbabwean government that all
future consignments of diplomatic bags for all countries will be
handled in accordance with the Vienna Convention," the statement
said. EndItem

Britain to recall its high commissioner (ambassador) from Harare

<HEADLINE> Security Council Affirms Importance of Humanitarian Action in World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday voiced its recognition of the importance of the
humanitarian action in the maintenance of world peace and security,
saying that the humanitarian crises can be both causes and
consequences of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in the presidential statement adopted by
the 15-nation body at the end of an open debate on the
humanitarian aspect before the Security Council in the maintenance
of peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The Council recognizes that humanitarian crises can be both
causes and consequences of conflicts and that they can affect the
Council's efforts to prevent and end conflicts, and deal with
other threats to international peace and security," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council affirms that timely consideration of the
following humanitarian issues contributes to the prevention of
escalation of conflicts and to the maintenance of international
peace and security," the statement said, adding that the issues
include access for the U.N. and associated personnel, other
humanitarian personnel and humanitarian supplies to the war
affected civilians, humanitarian components in peace agreements
and peace-keeping operations, and resources constraints.
</P>
<P>
"Full and timely support for humanitarian components can be
critical in ensuring and enhancing the sustainability of any peace
agreement and post-conflict peace-building," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement underlined the importance of "
effective coordination" among relevant U.N. organs and agencies,
regional bodies, other inter-governmental and international
organizations and other humanitarian actors in the field in
situations of ongoing conflict and peace-building through the
development of strategic framework.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recognizes the role played by
international humanitarian organizations and non-governmental
organizations in providing humanitarian assistance and alleviating
the impact of humanitarian crises," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The open debate was chaired by Abdus Samad Azad, foreign
minister of Bangladesh, who holds the Security Council presidency
for the month of March. Representatives from some 30 countries,

LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of
semiconductors jumped 33 percent in January compared with the same
month a year ago, with the Asia-Pacific region and Japan showing
the strongest gains, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales in January reached 14.8 billion U.S. dollars,

Traditionally, SIA said, January sales tend to be weak. But the
increase in the month illustrates the continuation of the industry
's growth patten that commenced in mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sharply Criticizes Sierra Leonean Ex-rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday sharply criticized former Sierra Leonean rebel
leader Foday Sankoh for blocking the peace process in the West
African country, saying Sankoh and his fighters are hostile to U.N.
peace-keepers and adopt "the often negative and confusing approach
" to the U.N. role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said, "I continue
to be very concerned about the often negative and confusing
approach taken by Mr. Sankoh to key elements of the peace process
and the role entrusted to the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Quite understandably, the present situation gives rise to
serious doubts about the commitment of Mr. Sankoh and RUF (the
Revolutionary United Front) to the faithful implementation of the
peace agreement," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This dangerous trend is detrimental to the peace process and
should be stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important, the continuing cease-fire violations
perpetrated against civilians and peace-keepers cannot be
tolerated by the international community," he said. "Furthermore,
the persistent obstruction of UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra
Leone) patrols and deployment is unacceptable and must cease
immediately."
</P>
<P>
RUF officials joined a united government after Sankoh and
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Kabbah signed a peace accord in
Lome, capital of Togo, in July last year, putting an end to the
nine-year bloody war in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored demobilization and disarmament process,
which should be carried out under the Lome accord, was hampered
with RUF fighters still controlling the country's most mining

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Closes Above 5,000 For First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks drove the
Nasdaq composite index above 5,000 for the first time Thursday
while lifting the Dow industrials back to the 10,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq index closed up 149.60 at 5,046.86.
The index closed above 5,000 just 46 trading sessions after
finishing above 4,000 on December 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 154.20 at 10,010.73 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 34.99 at 1,401.69.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index rallied after investors poured money into
computer, telecommunications and dot.com stocks. Among the
companies leading the index higher were Cisco System, Qwest
Communications and America Online.
</P>
<P>
Computer maker Hewlett-Packard, the Dow's component, also rose,
lifting the blue chip index above 10,000. The Dow index lost 374
points on March 7, falling below the 10,000 milestone.
</P>
<P>
But the industrials were still weak today as investors remained
worried about higher interest rates. Alcoa and United Technologies
both fell.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, investors moved away from the blue chip stocks
in fears of higher rates while rushing in the technology stocks.
The divergence pushed the Nasdaq index up 20 percent so far this
year while the Dow index was kept down more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 11.77 at 603.00 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 17.36 at 1,018.76. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 11.39 at 606.12.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,689 up, 1,295 down and 499
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.12 billion shares from 1.19 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Warns of Violence Risk in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary of State
Peter Mandelson Thursday warned violence could flare in Northern
Ireland if current efforts fail to restore momentum to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as a face-to-face meeting between Sinn Fein
and Ulster Unionists failed to break the impasse over arms and
devolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an Institute of Management event in Dublin on
Thursday, Mandelson stressed: "We will not have long-term
stability in Northern Ireland while stockpiles of weapons and
armed paramilitaries remain in existence."
</P>
<P>
But he also warned: "I have little doubt that if politics are
not allowed to work in Northern Ireland, further instability and
the risk of violence will result."
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of arms would have to be resolved within the
terms of the Good Friday Agreement, apparently scotching
suggestions at the weekend by an Irish government minister that
the May 22 deadline could be extended. He also ruled out any
renegotiation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
After the bilateral meeting between Ulster Unionists and Sinn
Fein, former First Minister David Trimble said they had used the
meeting as an opportunity to restate their positions, but that the
difficulties remained.
</P>
<P>
The face-to-face talks between Sinn Fein and Ulster Unionists
followed round table discussions involving all the main pro-
Agreement parties at the same venue on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
That meeting broke up without any apparent solution although
Mandelson described them as "useful".
</P>
<P>
He said the talks were evidence of a determination by all the
parties to "take things forward in a constructive way".
</P>
<P>
"If the difficulties that led to suspension in the first place
could have been solved in a day, they would have already been
solved - they are more complicated than that."
</P>
<P>
All the main pro-Agreement parties were meeting for the first
time since the short-lived power sharing institutions were
suspended by Mandelson almost four weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Again Asks Congress to Quickly Pass Gun-Safety Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm not at all sure that even a callous, irresponsible drug
dealer with a 6-year-old in the house wouldn't leave a child
trigger lock on a gun," Clinton said in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
Kayla Rolland was killed by her first-grade classmate, a 6-year-
old boy, at a school in Mount Morris Township of Michigan State on
February 29.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeated his call for licensing gun owners and said
that in the future, trigger locks could be retrofitted for old
handguns.
</P>
<P>
"If I could pass this, then I'd start looking at what to do
with the guns that are out there now, whether we could get trigger
locks for them and how we'd do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton met with key House and Senate judiciary
committee leaders in the White House, but the meeting failed to
yield an agreement to resume negotiations over a gun bill.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House and Senate conferees have not met since last August,
unable to bridge differences over the gun show provision.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Officials Enter Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have, from time to time, sent delegations ... to work with
the Kurdish officials in northern Iraq," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Thursday complained the U.S. intrusion and called on the
United Nations to prevent any recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahaf made the request in
identical letters to Seceretary-General Kofi Annan and to the
president of the Security Council. The letters were circulated in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf's letter said the intrusion was "part and parcel of the
frenzied acts of aggression committed by the United States" that
were an open and deliberate interference in Iraq's internal
affairs and a threat to its security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he was aware that the Iraqi government did not
support such visits. "But we have made clear, while we recognize
the territorial integrity of Iraq, that we think it's important
and appropriate for us to meet with ... Kurdish officials in
northern Iraq, and we will continue to do so as we see fit," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq was one of the no-fly zones imposed by the United
States and Britain after the Gulf War in 1991. And the United
States has entered the area many times, trying to reconcile rival
Kurdish factions in hope of subverting of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf called on the Security Council to discharge its
responsibilities as stipulated by the U.N. Charter by "opposing
actions that violate the norms of international law" and by taking
the necessary measures to ensure respect for Iraq's sovereignty
and political independence.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says US Backs Drive For Independence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense undersecretary Paolo
Guerrini Thursday accused the U.S. of nourishing Kosovo Albanian
hopes of independence and urged Europe to be firmer in its
opposition to such a solution on the status of the war- devastated
province.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Italian weekly La Rinascita, due to
hit newsstands next week, Guerrini complained that "the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) has never been disbanded and is more active
than ever."
</P>
<P>
He said that the KLA's "real aim" was achieving independence
for Kosovo, for which it was able to "count on the support of the
U.S.".
</P>
<P>
Guerrini stressed that the United Nations resolution on Kosovo
provides for "ample autonomy" for the region but "within the
framework of the Yugoslav federation."
</P>
<P>
"This is the problem. America has decided to back the KLA, as
we have seen in Mitrovica (the ethnically divided city in north
Kosovo),but Europe mustn't just stand by and risk finding itself
sooner or later simply faced with the fact (of independence)," the
undersecretary continued.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy's position was "clear and correct,"
explaining that "we are working for respect for Yugoslav
territorial integrity and an end to ethnic cleansing."
</P>
<P>
He said that one solution could be the division of Kosovo into
what he called "cantons," which would have their own autonomous
political structures while remaining firmly inside the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
Guerrini also sounded the alarm over the "deteriorating
situation" in Montenegro, which is still tied to Serbia inside the
federation but is strongly independence-minded.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of a new crisis front in Montenegro is not an
unrealistic prospect. There are clear signs. There are continual
violations of the law there, a system of organized crime which we
must do something about before it's too late," the undersecretary
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday voiced his deep concern over the effects of
flooding in Madagascar, saying he trusts that donors will
contribute generously to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here through his spokesman, said
he "is deeply concerned over the effects of flooding caused by
Cyclone Gloria" in the island country.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports said that 560,000 people are affected,
with 10,000 homeless and an additional 12,000 out of reach, the
statement said. "The cyclone has caused heavy damage to houses and
vital road links."
</P>
<P>
"This disaster occurs at a time when a cholera epidemic has
taken the lives of over 1,000 people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In response, U.N. agencies on the ground are undertaking
further assessments, propositioning food and non-food items and
providing support in coordinating the relief response," the
statement said. "An official appeal for international assistance
will shortly be launched."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General trusts that donors will contribute
generously in response to this disaster," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came one day after the announcement by the U.N.
World Food Program (WFP) to launch its first airlift operation to
deliver food to displaced people in Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
WFP said in a statement that it was launching its first
airlift operation Friday to deliver urgently needed emergency food
rations to tens of thousands of people left destitute by floods in
nearby Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
The Madagascar Government Tuesday appealed for food and
medicine to help those displaced by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Antibody Protecting Against HIV Virus Identified in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of researchers at San
Raffaele Hospital in Milan has discovered an antibody which can
offer protection from the HIV virus which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
After studying a test group for four years, made up of 90
people who had HIV-positive partners, the researchers were able to
identify an antibody which the subjects had but their infected
partners did not.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was announced to the press Thursday by Lucia
Lopalco, the biologist from San Raffaele's bio-technology
department who headed the research project.
</P>
<P>
"This antibody," she explained, "is linked to a protein, CCR5,
which is present on the surface of cells in the immune system and
represent an important entryway for the virus."
</P>
<P>
"The antibody's action mechanism is very particular," Lopalco
added, "and it can modify the CCR5 protein and make it
inaccessible to the virus. The impossibility of entering the cell
thus creates a natural protection against infection by the HIV
virus."
</P>
<P>
Lopalco said that the discovery could lead to important
developments in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
She said that with enough research funds, it could become the
basis for a treatment within just a few years' time, with the
antibody being used during the early stages of infection.
</P>
<P>
She said that it could also lead to the development of a
vaccine capable of stimulating the body's immune system to produce
the protective antibody although she stressed that this would be a
much longer research process.
</P>
<P>
She said that theoretically, the antibody could be reproduced
in a laboratory and developed into a drug which would stop the
virus from entering the cell.
</P>
<P>
But Lopalco warned that "if it works, then we have discovered
how to block one entrance (of the virus) but we don't know whether
this is the only entrance. The virus could have other ways of
entering cells and reproducing."
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Lopalco's research project has
received 130 million lire (almost 65,000 U.S. dollars) annually in
funding from Italy's Higher Health Institute.
</P>
<P>
The medical data relating to the project was published Thursday
in the Journal of Immunology.
